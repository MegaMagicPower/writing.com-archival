Why isn\u2019t there anything to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-A very bored Issei. Looking around the empty room, Issei was about to leave until an idea struck him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBucchou isn\u2019t here! That means I could see her office! And maybe more!\u201d Issei was practically drooling at the thought of seeing what Rias kept in her office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarreling down the passage, Issei quickly located the door. Sneaking towards it on the off chance Rias teleported in, he found it unlocked. He crept into the room, excitement burning in his veins-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-only to find an ordinary office space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... he nearly cried out in disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me?! Nothing?! Rias is practically an exhibitionist, and there\u2019s not even a scrap clothing!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweeping across the room, Issei spent the next few minutes looking for anything out of the ordinary. But nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess I\u2019ll just leave...\u201d Issei began to leave when something caught his vision from the corner. It was a lacy red bra. Almost tripping over himself, Issei rushed over. \u201cFinally! Bucchou\u2019s bra! I can almost imagine her glorious oppai!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei picked up the bra, but immediately felt a cold chill run up his spine. The bra glowed briefly, and then rushed underneath his shirt. It latched itself around his chest, settling in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d He felt a sense of panic set in, but then went numb as a strange feeling entered his chest. His nipples began to darken and grow, and the pectorals began to become fatter. A set of breasts pushed out from his chest spilling and filling the empty cups of the bra. Issei moaned as they entered D-cup territory, before finally stopping at a large E-cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down in panic , Issei saw the breasts he lusted after jutting out proudly while straining his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

How do I have Bucchou\u2019s chest?\u201d Finally managing to slip out the office, Issei moved as quickly as he could, despite the constant shifting weight on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did not notice a lacy black thong sitting in the hall. Just like the bra, it slipped up his pants leg and wrapped around his junk. By the time Issei noticed, a heat was building around his crotch. With a loud SLLURRRPP, a fresh pair of moist lips and clit was what remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei wanted to cry, as <i>she</i> couldn\u2019t even check without being reminded.

Pulling it to it\u2019s full length, she briefly admired it and yank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to yank it off, it was stuck in place. And with every tug, a new change took place. Yank. To bright blue-green eyes. Tug. A pair of plump lips puckered out. Pull. A shrunken and cute nose. After one final attempt to pluck the hair, Issei\u2019s face shifted to match Rias\u2019s facial structure as a long curtain of crimson hair growing down to her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning into the nearest restroom, Rias\u2019s shocked face stared back. She then stiffened up, as old uniforms began to shift. The plain red shirt began to brighten and change as the shirt turned into a white shirt. A line of buttons ran down the middle and split as it tightened. The male jacket ripped in two, forming a corset and shoulder cape that tied themselves quickly. As this went on, Issei\u2019s body quickly changed to match the uniform. Her stomach caved and shifted into an hourglass, her arms becoming slender and hairless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lower half of the uniform quickly began to match. Part of the pants simply faded, turning more into shorts revealing long plump legs. The top half began to merge and turn pink, reforming into a pink pleated skirt. And rising with it, Issei\u2019s ass began to inflate into a perfect heart shape. The tennis shoes quickly shifted into a pair of brown dress shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA carbon copy of Rias stared back in the mirror, horrorstricken at the transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

He leaned upward and saw that he was in what looked like a infirmary. He looked around the room and saw only empty beds, and realized that he was the only one in the room. He heard the door open and he turned toward it and his eyes widened when he saw Riser enter the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riser!\" Issei growled, glaring angrily at him. He tried to get out of the bed, but the moment that he did a surge of pain made him stop and hiss in pain. He wanted nothing more then to get out of the bed and beat that fried chicken into a bloody pulp!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now you shouldn't try to move in your current condition,\" Riser chastised, smirking down at him. A small magic circle appeared and hit Issei. His body froze and no matter how hard he tried to move he couldn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bastard!\" Issei growled at him, glaring at him. \"What are you doing here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After Rias's defeat our engagement is all but assured now, and since our marriage is soon she has other matters to attend to, and I have the final say on what happens to her and her Peerage now. As for why I'm here I need to teach you your place and make sure that you remember your place in our society,\" Riser said, smirking smugly at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled out a small golden vial with a red diamond shaped cap with some kind of faint red liquid inside it. He played with the vial in his hand, twirling it around in his hand as he watched the liquid move around inside of the bottle.  He pulled out the stopper and brought the vial closer to Issei and poured the contents down Issei's mouth. Issei choked on it for a moment, but then it managed to go down his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment it did Issei began to feel better, The pain that he had felt mere moments ago began to vanish, as if it was never there in the first place. He tried to move, but he still couldn't no matter how hard he tried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you heal me you fried chicken! What are you doing!\" Issei demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I healed you because I would rather you be at full health for what's about to happen. As I said earlier you need to learn your place in our society. And you will soon enough,\" Riser said, smirking at him. He pulled a red gem out of his pocket and then held it out toward Issei. He channeled a bit of his power into it and the gem began to glow in his hand. A red beam of energy flew from the gem and hit Issei.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as the beam hit him the first thing Issei noticed was all of the body hair below his eyebrows fell off. His face burned as it began to shift around and soften. His lips puffed out as nose shrank a little and his eyes grew bigger and his eye lashes grew longer. He felt the tip of his hair soften and grow longer and as it quickly grew past his shoulders and now felt like soft silk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs that happened Issei's legs thinned out, more so at his calves than his thighs, where there still was a subtle curve to them. Then, they began to lengthen out, raising his height just a smidge and giving him legs that any girl would kill for. They were long, attached to thick sexy thighs. His legs were all around sexy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis dick would have to agree on that, erecting itself as his feet shrink down, becoming more and more petite by the second. As that finishes up, a sudden pressure begins to build up at his hips, eventually resulting in a drastic push outwards, putting untold amounts of stress against hid hipbone. He gasped in pain as the bone quickly refurbished itself, leaving only the beauty of his lower curves left for men to fawn over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressure built up in Issei's butt, causing him to gasp in bliss as his butt began to grow out, becoming fatter and fatter and fatter. The damn thing quickly ran out of room in his already cramped underwear, but still refused to slow down, putting immense pressure on it as well as his erect penis in the front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before he could grope his new butt with all the intensity of a wild animal, Issei felt a sudden pull on his private parts. Before he could figure out what was happening, his balls and dick were already half inside of his body and still going. Any sense of pain that he could\u2019ve felt was washed out by the constant final senses going nuts on his once proud penis. In just a few minutes his penis and balls were gone and replaced with a brand new clitoris for the world to gaze in lust at as his penis finished changing into a vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei's stomach lost gargantuan amounts of fat with each and every breathe she took. It didn\u2019t take long before it lost half of its original size, and was still constantly shrinking down, down, down until finally it stopped around the flatness of a wall. Her new stomach was also incredibly toned, and would be the envy of women around the world. Pressure built up on the sides of his new core, and in one quick motion a violent yet elegant snap, creating gorgeous curves fitting of a goddess and an hourglass figure that was truly superb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer spine started to loosen up considerably, gaining an incredible curve in the process. Due to that he shrunk in height by about an inch or so, but that curve more than made up for it by pushing out large ass and flat chest quite nicely, making a lecherous smile appear on Riser's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei's male nipples begin to enlarge, widening and sprouting up to quite explicit levels. But the sensitivity gained with the larger size made him moan and gasp in pleasure. Before she knew it breasts began to develop behind her nipples, pushing them out in the process. What started out as two small orbs soon grew out to so much more, passing into B-cups without even slowing down and continued to trudge forward without any sign of slowing down, even when they passed DD. The constantly growing pressure of her shirt against her nipples made her cave in to her sexual desire, and she began fondling her expanding contained boobs without even realizing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiser let his lecherous smile grow in delight. Absolutely loving the free show that he was getting. She had turned out better then he had hoped. He watched as her breasts grew larger and larger, even when they passed Rias's and Akeno's bust size. Loud moans were escaping Issei's mouth between breaths, as sweat was covering her body. She now let out tired breaths as her breasts ceased their growth, and were now massive F-cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts flooded out of her shirt torn shirt, and looked like they were close to tearing it in half. If she wasn't sitting down then she would see her pants straining against her sexy thighs, and that they were close to ripping. Her brown hair had grown all the way to her butt and looked like a silky brown waterfall behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...bastard,\" She said tiredly. She breathed deeply and could see that Riser wasn't looking at her face, but rather at her jiggling bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/8f/4b/3c/8f4b3cd52cb5645e099c74ad5a79ae21.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736...</a>  - What Issei now looks like.</span></div></div>",

As she moved nearly toppled over from the weight of her massive chest, since she wasn't used to the added weight. She managed to stop herself, but accidentally gave Riser a look at her massive cleavage. Riser laughed as he walked closer to Issei and groped one of her breasts. Issei gasped as a sure of pleasure went through her body. A blush formed on her face as she began to glare at him angrily and in embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing you turned out far better then I had hoped,\" Riser admitted, studying her beauty. There was no question that she was beautiful with a heart-shaped face, a cute nose, and beautiful brown eyes. Not to mention a killer body that women in all the factions would kill to have. With breasts that were the largest that he had ever seen and a curvy figure that resembled a hourglass, and a massive butt that would get everyone's attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Change me back you fried chicken!\" Issei demanded angrily. Issei glared at Riser angrily, but too Riser it looked more like a sexy smolder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No can do. Once the gem turns someone into a woman it is impossible for them to change back,\" Riser informed her, causing Issei's eyes to widen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Issei said sadly in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiser stepped forward and grabbed her by her slim waist, but Issei was still in shock to his action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you are stuck like this, Izumi,\" Riser said, giving her a new name. He smirked as he lowered his arm down her waist just a little, but didn't make any move to grab anything just yet. \"You are no longer a man, but a woman, one that WILL learn her place and remember it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What happens next?)</span></div></div>",

She glared at him and tried to force herself off of him, but she wasn't as strong as she was before she changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiser smirked as he lowered his hand down from her waist and roughly grabbed her butt. She gasped in surprise and pleasure as a blush quickly overtook her face. Before she could do anything Riser quickly opened his mouth and slipped his tongue inside of 'Izumi's' mouth. Her blush grew as she felt Riser's tongue wrestled with his own. She tried to use her own tongue to force his own out, but she had far less experience using her tongue then Riser did, and unfortunately for her she lost the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued to kiss her, he continued too roughly grab and squeeze her butt to his pleasure. Unknown to him a heat began to form between her legs, as surges of pleasure continued too go through her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Wonder what that ass would feel like without any clothing in the way,'</i> Riser thought curiously. Despite how big her butt was, it also had a tightness too it that most butts didn't have at that size. He brought his free hand up across her stomach and grabbed her breast. She gasped though the kiss as Riser deepened the kiss. Her blush grew as the heat between her legs began to grow. She never felt like this before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiser broke the kiss and Issei quickly began to take deep breathes. She was happy that the kiss finally broke, because she was beginning to run out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to worry about what will happen next Izumi,\" Riser said charmingly wit a smile on his face, but that smile did little to ease Issei's nerves. In fact, the only thing that smile did was make the pit in her stomach bigger. \"After all, we still have one more person to visit before you can learn your place.\"</span></div></div>",

Issei gasped in surprise and banged her fist against his chest, but while she might not be hurt anymore, she lacked the energy to do any real harm, because of the transformation and Riser's fondling. Riser smirked as he decided to continue her punishment and continued to fondle her delicious butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Izumi's' moans were like music to Riser's ears. Riser looked down at the woman in his arms as she glared at him hatefully, but just like last time he found that glare on her face sexy, and couldn't take it seriously, especially with the blush on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Soon enough, she'll be begging for more,'</i> Riser thought,his happiness growing at the thought, but before he could do that he wanted to visit the other one now, before he forgot. Not only that, but it would save a little bit of time later. He walked out of the room and down the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Who the hell is the other person?'</i> Issei thought as she continued to feel surges of pleasure from Riser's hands, much to her displeasure. The worst part was that deep down she actually enjoyed it! She blamed it on this new body and how sensitive everything was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiser stopped by a door and took his hand off of her butt and opened the door he moved to the side so that he could enter the room with Issei in his arms.

Riser threw her down on one of the empty beds like a sack of potatoes. Yuto turned and was surprised by who he saw enter the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuto wondered who the busty brunette was, taking in all of her features. It took a moment, but he realized that the woman was Issei!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiba! Get out of here!\" Issei exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet for now,\" Riser ordered, and Issei's mouth shut. Issei tried to open her mouth, but to no avail. It wouldn't open no matter how hard she tried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like last time, Riser pulled out a bottle of Phoenix Tears and pulled out the stopper. He opened Kiba's mouth and forced the bottle's contents down his throat. He could hear Kiba swallow the liquid inside and glared at Riser. She knew what he was going to do. If she could move her body then she might be able to help him. She tried to move her body to help, but she couldn't move her limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiser performed the same spell on Kiba that he had used on Issei to keep him still. Yuto couldn't move. Riser pulled out the gem, and Issei knew what was about to happen next. A part of him wanted to turn away and close his eyes, but another part of him wanted to see just what kind of girl Kiba would become, and hoped that when the transformation was done she would have large succulent breasts. Riser pulled out the gem and channeled power into it. The gem began to glow in his hand. A red beam of energy flew from the gem and hit Kiba. Kiba gasped as his body began to shiver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiser canceled the spell that he had placed on Kiba earlier that prevented him from moving and watched him closely in anticipation, excitement in his eyes as he waited for what was going to happen next, just like with Issei. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He gasped in pain as the bone quickly refurbished itself, leaving only the beauty of his lower curves left for men to fawn over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat little fat there was in his body left his stomach and moved, and became a smooth sexy feminine core. Unlike Issei's change though, the majority of the fat seemed to go straight into her butt and thighs. The pressure built up in her pants until they could hardly take it anymore. The occupants heard a ripping sound, and knew that it was Kiba's pants. Her thick thighs led down to a pair of sexy legs. She turned and they could see the top of her butt and and a large rip down the center. While Issei's new butt was a large shaply bubble butt, Kiba's was more like a blimp then a bubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's nipples began to enlarge, widening and sprouting up to quite explicit levels. But the sensitivity gained with the larger size made her moan and gasp in pleasure. Before she knew it breasts began to develop behind her nipples, pushing them out in the process. The two small orbs of flesh on her chest soon grew out to so much more, They easily flew past the A-cup range straight into into B-cups without even slowing down and continued to continued to grow larger. They passed the D-cup range and began to slow down in their growth when they passed the DD-cup range. Her breasts finally stopped growing when they became large perky E-cups, the same size as Rias's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's new bust jiggled up and down from her deep breaths. If Issei could move her mouth she would no doubt be staring open mouthed with drool coming out of her mouth. The only sign of her thoughts was her large wide eyed expression with a dark blush on her face, and a large smile on her face as her eyes stayed on the jiggling succulent mounds on Kiba's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiser couldn't help, but smile lecherously. This had turned out better then he had thought. While both of them were sexy beautiful woman it was clear to him that 'Izumi' was the bustier of the two, while 'Yumi' had the better ass and hips between the two of them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The images that assaulted their minds were of them making out Riser, having sex with him, and doing what he commended them to do, and from what they could see, the images showed them loving every second of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon enough both of you will be begging me to take you,\" Riser said, smirking victoriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Does someone interfere and stop the mental changes?)</span></div></div>",

The scene had gathered quite a crowd among the students, while others had continued on their way, clearly used to what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to them, among the watchers one of them sighed. The person who sighed was a young man about 6 feet tall. He had fair skin that contrasted his black shaggy hair and hazel eyes. He wore the standard male academy uniform with the top few buttons of his jacket undone, and a silver chain across his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Idiots,\" Arashi muttered, shaking his head. He watched as the kendo club walked forward angrily. They had their shinai in hand and were glaring angrily at the Perverted Trio. He knew what was about to happen and continued on his way home. He didn't particularly hate them, but he didn't care for them either. It never amused him when they got hurt, but he did have to admit they were quite resilient and determined to continue to do that, even thought it always ended the same way. Though they did deserve what they had coming to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he left the school he decided to take take a shortcut to his house through the park, and as he walked he noticed a envelope on a bench. His curiosity got the better of him and he walked toward it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" Arashi muttered. He picked up the envelope and looked at it for a moment. He didn't see anything really prominent on the front of it, or anything that seemed strange about it. He turned it over and to his surprise he saw that it was addressed to him. He opened the envelope and pulled out the paper inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Find the love of your life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaven't you ever wondered what your true love would be like. To find that special someone that will make you whole! To find that special someone that will accept your past, your present and will standby you in the future. A relationship without equal where you feel nothing but joy. A relationship that brings out the best in you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you need to do is sign the bottom and soon you will find true love Arashi!<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nHe wasn't sure what to make about the paper. It seemed like one of those charms that you would find at one of the temples. He didn't think much of it, and thought it had to be some kind of prank or something, but considered signing it anyway. After all what did he have to lose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed his bag on the bench and pulled a pen out of his bag and took of the lid off of it. He placed the paper against the flat side of his bag and casually wrote his name down at the bottom and then put the pen back into his bag. The moment he did he saw a faint glow from the bottom. The moment the glow stopped he saw that there was now writing at the bottom. He knew for a fact that it wasn't there before and quickly read what had appeared at the bottom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thank you, and soon true love will come to you Arashi!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell,\" Arashi muttered in shocked awe. He lifted the paper closer to his face to get a better look, but before he could get a closer look at it, it suddenly caught on fire in his hand. His eyes widened and he quickly dropped the paper down and before it even touched the ground it was dust in the wind. He watched as the ashes flew off and looked back at his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did that even happen,\" Arashi muttered in awe. Paper did not just combust for no reason. He shook his head and continued on his journey back home.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For some reason he felt unusual, like he had just been by hit something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly blinked and shook his head. Right after Issei came to his senses a splitting headache suddenly came over him. He brought his hand up to his head and began to message it to try and make the pain stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe certainly had never had a headache like this before, nothing before had ever effected him in quite such a way as he was feeling right now. It wasn't like he felt sick or anything, he just felt...weird. The kind of strangeness that made you feel out of place in your own body. It was confusing and foreign, so Issei closed his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned off is computer and made his way to his bed. How could he enjoy eroge with this weird headache? He fell down onto his bed and pulled the covers over himself and groaned as he tried to fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a really bad headache,\" he muttered to himself. \"The pain will go away after a good night's rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he woke up he noticed something.</span></div></div>",

He was happy that the headache that he had last night was gone now. He stretched in his bed and cracked his neck, getting all of the morning kinks that he had out of his system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt something tickle his shoulders and brought his hands up and grabbed handfuls of brown hair. He made his way tot he bathroom and when he looked in the mirror he saw that his hair was indeed longer. Last night it touched the bottom of his neck, but now seemed to go a little past his shoulders. Not only that, but his hair seemed to have taken on a lighter shade of brown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell did my hair get this long?\" Issei questioned. \"Meh, guess I just need to get a haircut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put his thoughts aside as he took a shower and noticed that as he rubbed soap on his body that it seemed a lot smoother then usual, but blamed it on the soap for that. Right after the shower he brushed his teeth, and put on a red shirt and the school uniform.

Not only that but it was a lighter shade of brown as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell did his hair get that long?\" Arashi muttered. He knew for a fact that Issei's hair couldn't have grown that long in a single night, and there was no way that he was wearing a wig. If he was then the Student Council would've taken it from him. Anther thing that he noticed was that no one seemed to notice anything different about Issei. They acted as if he always had long hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Why is no one saying anything about it?'</i> He thought to himself. He watched as Issei walked across the room and sat down in his seat next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to see if he could find anything else about Issei that changed, but before he could get a good look at Issei their English teacher entered the room and begined class.

Normally, he would be out on one of his usual requests, but just for today, Yuuto was free, a rare moment of respite for him, given his increasing popularity after the last Rating Game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just looking at some strange pendant I found on the way here.\" He held it up for him to see, his friend looking at the item with curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks quite expansive. I wonder if a teacher lost it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably. I can't picture a regular girl wearing something like this... Say, does it look kind of familiar to you? I think I saw the design before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do? Hmm... Oh! I remember, isn't it from that one show you showed me once? I think it belongs to the nurse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, that's right! I almost forgot about it! Man, I can't believe I wouldn't remember the biggest pair of oppai I've ever seen. But wait, how come you remember it? I thought you said that show wasn't your cup of tea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me it's not.\", replied the Knight, as he didn't seem to understand the wonders of the female body the same way Issei did. \"It's just that the principle of the show reminded me a bit of Buchou. I made me wonder a bit how it would be for her to be principal of the school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I can't see her like that. I mean, she has red hair, but she is more tomboyish than Xenovia, and even some of the guys I know. And why a principal? Rias didn't say anything about being the headmaster of a school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but is a fun thought, being in the shoes of a principal, wouldn't it? It kind of suits Buchou quite well to be honest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure this isn't your thing? You are quite strict yourself with your training and like following the rules. Are you sure you don't want to be the principal instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, as much as I would like to experiment with that, I don't think- Ah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuuto stopped as a bright gleam escaped from the eye of the necklace and hit him with full force. It was lighting quick, as Issei barely registered it, but it was enough for the Knight was blinded for a second, while the Pawn didn't seem to be hit by the light. However this wasn't enough to make him lose his balance, quickly regaining his composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay Kiba?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am fine. Nothing seems to be off. But it seems like the necklace might be some sort of enchanted item. Sensei said he will have business at the school later, so we should show it to him when he arrives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a plan. But what should we do until then? I mean, we can practice of fighting moves, but with the kendo club around, I don't think that's a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say we try to see what enchantment was placed on that thing. I'll head for the ORC building to bring some books and files that might help us find out what it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't we just ask Rias about it? Sounds like it might take a while if it's just us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. Everything is already organized, so I should be able to return in a few minutes. Until then, please contact Sensei and let him know about the situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it.\", said Issei as he placed the pendant in his pocket, not noticing the continued glow from the eye before Kiba left. But as his friend took a corner, he muttered to himself: \"Huh... Did his beauty mark disappear? No, I must be imagining things...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It didn't really feel like a curse, but for a spell to be strong enough to affect him in some way, it meant that whoever enchanted the necklace had to be fairly potent caster. As for the sensation itself, it couldn't be really described as a sickness as the boy wasn't experiencing any sort of pain, but he could feel that something was off about his body, and he couldn't exactly name what was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder who made that spell. Certainly, it must've been made with the intention of protection, as I doubt that pendant could be used as a weapon. But for such an item to be dropped in our school like that is a little sloppy. And I am unaware of a student who possesses magic abilities like that, otherwise Buchou would've investigated it. I can't really think of someone that isn't affiliated to either the ORC or the student council to know about the existence of magic anyway...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile pondering, in addition to his mole beneath his eye, every other strand of hair beneath his eyebrows disappeared, leaving his skin smooth. His socks also seemed to have vanished, leaving his feet bare, which felt a little strange in his dress shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... And also, why would they pick that design for the necklace? It did look more expensive than just a piece of merchandise, so I would assume they tried to make it look as much as they could like the original. But that show has a very limited audience and not many people would watch it, given even Ise-kun said it wasn't really in his top 15 choices either. And that timing... I wonder if there was a trigger. I would've expected to activate way sooner, when Ise-kun talked about the nurse, given the item was made based on something she wears. I only talked about the principal and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Yuuto seemed to be taken over by a wave to dizziness that appeared out of nowhere. What was strange was that it also seemed to affect his mind, making the thoughts he previously had become foggy. He didn't notice how he slowly started to get a little bit taller or that his shoes suddenly transformed into a pair of black slippers. There was something that told him that the light from before was the cause of this, yet with each passing second, he was getting more focused on trying to have his head stop spinning rather than trying to understand what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... That sure came out way too suddenly\", mumbled the knight in a tone that exuded a little bit of annoyance, something he wouldn't really show for situations such as these. \"I may need to freshen up a bit... although I may hope this will go away on it own...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Stumbling a bit by how lightheaded he felt, he almost went into the women's restroom before correcting himself and going to the men's. Inside, he shakily made his way to the sink and started to rinse his face, the cold water slowly making his mind to wake up from its muddled state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, his feet became more petite as his toes formed a small arches. Interestingly though was that a small amount of energy was gradually collecting at said point, which made him feel a surge of power that was a little different than the usual Devil power that he normally had. Said feeling however was ignored when his face started to tingle a bit. He couldn't really notice due to the fact that he was still splashing it with water, but his masculine features were getting softer with his lips plumping up a bit. After feeling that the wave of vertigo was gone, Yuuto took a paper towel and dried off his face. When he was done and looked at himself in the mirror however, he could feel that something was out of place, but for some reason, he had trouble telling what was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Is my face looking different? Did I had a mole before under my left eye? No, that's silly, why would I have one? And besides, I would've noticed it if there ever was one.\", said Yuuto, again with a tone slightly different than his usual polite one. He still sounded as upbeat as ever, he seemed to be a little more casual in his vocabulary. \"Still, it really is weird how I got dizzy like that. Was it from that light? Or it was something else?... Eh, whatever. I am feeling good now, so there's no problem. Anyway, I need to go back to the ORC building to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely enough, Yuuto actually had a lapse in his memory, as he had trouble remembering his reason for going their clubhouse. He was too distracted to see how his pants began to grow a little shorter on him while his necktie vanished completely. And despite his prolonged lifespan, which made him age a lot slower, he physically grew older to 19 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hmm... Ah yes, I remember now, I wanted to go and see what that light was all about in one of the books we have there. Geez, talk about having a brain fart. Glad to know I was alone when this happened... I can't really imagine how embarrassing it would be if Ise-kun was here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking one last look in the mirror before leaving, Yuuto smiled to himself, glad to see there wasn't anything wrong with him and also thinking he looked charming for a second, the teen now left the bathroom. There was something that bothered him with his own name as he went back on the corridor, Yuuto Kiba sounding off for him. After a brief moment, and hoping this was the last lapse of the day, he now remembered, as Yiuto Rija became for him his new name.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The one with the girls with big breasts that could use magic weapons of sorts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it does. Down to the last detail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei was currently talking with Azazel on the phone regarding the necklace he found and how it struck Yuuto with a beam of light that made him stagger. He tried to explain the best he could what happened, which made the Fallen Angel a little confused by the circumstances of the event, as well as the overall appearance of the item.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you think it's dangerous? It didn't look like it had a major effect on Kiba, but it was quite powerful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so. It sounds to me like something used to protect the caster or disorientate the enemy, so it shouldn't have that much power. Although I think it's for the best to observe Yuuto in case there were any lingering effects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree. I had quite a few surprises before with how strong some of these things are...\", said Issei  flatly, as he picked up the necklace to look at it again. Azazel knew he was referring to some of the gadgets he made that had... a few undesirable secondary effects that usually had the boy as the victim, which made him give out a nervous chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt escaped his notice that the eye of the pendant was still faintly glowing even now. His hands began shrinking down as the digits grew a little longer. And while he couldn't feel it just yet, his hands did look a bit more frail, as their strength was slowly fading away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That aside... Sorry for asking again, but does it really look like how I know it? I watched that program before, and I am amazed that you found one that is just like the original.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I can tell it's not regular merchandise either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's the quality of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks genuine. The rock in the center didn't seem like glass, it is like a real jewel. And the edges seem to be silver too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's bizarre. This isn't the first time someone turns a piece of jewelery into a magic item, but for someone to go as far as to style the thing to the real one makes me think that whoever made this has a little too much time spent in front of the TV if he went the extra mile for the design...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most likely... Anyway, when do you think you can get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might take a bit. After the whole mess with Cao Cao, there are quite a few things that needs to be resolved around here. But I'll come as soon as possible and I'll also give Rossweisse a heads-up to come with me if she finishes her job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Also, can you please not tell Rias about this yet? We all just got a break after the battles up until now and she doesn't need to worry over something that's maybe isn't a real emergency. Just let her finish the job for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always thinking about others, aren't you? Fine, I'll be tight-lipped for now. I'll also keep it a secret from the others too. You and Yuuto just wait for a bit, I'll come in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Sensei.\", replied Issei with a smile as he finished the conversation before a small chill ran down his spine. \"Was that a cold breeze? I hope I won't catch a cold or anything.\" He missed how his skin was now silky smooth and now there wasn't any hair or imperfection on it. In fact, it looked almost like he took daily care of his body and it didn't look like it belonged to someone who was out training daily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow came the waiting game. He originally came to school to help Matsuda and Motohama with sneaking into the girls' locker rooms, but the two caught a cold and didn't tell him, and when the girls caught him hiding, they jumped to conclusions and began punishing him like usual. He could wait for Yuuto, or he could try and have a bit of fun spying on the girls in retaliation.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thus, he quickly made his way to the locker room and then hid himself in one of the lockers that he knew wasn't occupied. He was glad this time Xenovia wasn't around to blow his cover, and hoped that the girls didn't begin to get too suspicious and start checking around the room for him. Conveniently enough, within five minutes, the girls actually came after the kendo practice finished and began undressing as they wiped off their sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! They really went the extra mile for new designs! I didn't try to look at them for a while, and I am glad I didn't miss the opportunity! I just hope Rias won't find out about this. I know I should stop doing this, but this is one of men's needs after all. Not to mention I actually deserve it after those two goofballs left me on my own.\" For once, he was happy that his plan wouldn't be ruin by some external factor, the only possible way of him being caught was him somehow making noise, although he trained himself to remain silent whenever he hid himself in a locker after many attempts before. He was just glad no one actually saw him practice something like this, otherwise this would've raised a lot of eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Issei indulged himself in observing the girls' figures, especially the breasts, and sometimes the designs of the underwear the had, he felt a little bit of discomfort as his shoes and his pants both turned black and started to tighten on him. It also hurt his feet a bit as they started to grow smaller inside his footwear, with him gaining a pedicure in the process. He ignored this slight discomfort as he tried to continue watching the girls. He was a bit surprised Ddraig didn't try to say something to admonish him for what he was doing or at least complain about the situation, but figured he was most likely sleeping, thus he didn't ponder too much on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile looking around, he heard a certain conversation Murayama and Katase started between themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, have you seen the new nurse we're getting? I have never seen anyone look so amazing in my life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither. She really looks like a model and her figure is something unbelievable! How does she manage to support her chest like that? I wonder if that's how Rias-senpai and Himejima-senpai would look like in a few years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! I can totally see that!... Although her choice in clothing is a bit too... out-there...\", said Katase frowning a little as she gave as Murayama smiled a bit nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well, with that I have to agree. She needs to take care of herself much better. I am shocked she didn't said anything about how she looks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen some guys watching her like a pack of wolves... I want to try and tell her that she needs a new wardrobe, but she is so kind to us, I don't want to somehow hurt her feelings if I say something that would make her feel... inadequate or immodest...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow this was something Issei was not aware of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A new hot nurse? When did she come? And how come I didn't know anything about this? I haven't seen anyone new around the school, but then again, I didn't go to the nurse's office lately either. Did those two knew about this? There's no way the didn't, but to not even give hint about it is not something those two would do, as they like to brag whenever they find someone of interest...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei's thoughts distracted him to miss how a few strands of his hair started to frame his face as his spiky hairstyle was slowly flattening. His changes didn't stop there as some of the times where he peeped at the girls in the past vanished from his mind entirely. This wasn't something major at the moment, but it became the start of what was to come...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His hairless skin made him shiver a little against the slightly cold breeze, but didn't think much of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now I should be making my way to the ORC. Can't have Ise-kun waiting for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he made his way towards the gate, the sense of urgency he had before seemed to disappear. His nervousness regarding the incident was slowly evaporating, and was having trouble thinking that there was a reason for him to leave at all, which made his pace slower. He scratched his hair a bit as it started to lengthen, his already silky hair getting a little more shine to it as he walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure is a chore... I wanted to be able to train here, today and having Ise-kun around to keep me company would've been a bonus. Instead, that necklace had to throw a light beam at me and make me lose my cool...\", he mumbled to himself as he looked at the empty yard. \"I wonder if I could do a lap or something before I leave. It's not like someone would see me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, his calves tingled as their muscles contracted and changed. Their mass became a little smaller, but they became leaner and sleeker, with their force increasing by a fair margin. Also, his pants, which revealed a bit of his calves, started to roll themselves out as the material became more stretchy and their pockets vanished as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYiuto shook his head, as a bit of his original personality resurfaced. \"No, I can't waste time like this. I have no reason to train like this, not when there is an emergency.\" The small part that urged to act serious however was quickly buried by the new emotions and thoughts he had. \"But is it really urgent? I feel fine and there doesn't seem to be anything out of the ordinary. I don't know why I was even in a rush. What's the worst that could happen anyway?... Such a pain the butt... I was so energetic when I came here today, and now I feel very upset for some reason. It's not like I mind looking into it a bit more, but his feels so useless... And somehow this is getting on my nerves, and I don't even know why. Maybe I need a distraction or something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYiuto was never as expressive on a daily basis as he was right now, and his fuse wasn't as big as before. It was nagging him why he was so angry all of a sudden over something he considered trivial, but he had to deal with his emotions anyway. He started to try and find his happy place as he made his way slowly to the ORC building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to remember the times when he was spending with his friends and enjoying their company. But along the way, Yiuto's feelings began to expand to the rest of the students. It felt a little strange for him to imagine the entire student body to be his close friends. He knew he had to protect everyone in case something happened, but there was a no need to share his feelings with so many people. When he tried to just focus on the ORC members, he somehow didn't felt as connected to them as before, and was starting to think that he should be considering someone else his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sure, he was a person that would jump in the frontlines if it meant shielding his friends from harm, but if he thought someone like Akeno would be more fit for the role of a caretaker than he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, this is getting weird... I thought I would just chill out a bit and think of something nice, but now I have another dilemma? My mind sure likes to play tricks on me today for some reason. I hope this isn't because of a lack of sleep or something like that... Sure I had plenty of paperwork to do last night, but it's not like I had a choice in the matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYiuto felt that something was wrong about that line of thinking, as he never had any jobs that had him signing papers, and even in the time he worked with the club, he always patiently helped with the paperwork when he was needed. But as he slowly aged up once again, this time to 22 years old, said thought was dismissed quickly. He didn't get that much height this time, as his body grew proportionate to his new age. His hands grew more slim alongside his arms, as they both looked smaller compared to how they were before. However, despite their more dainty appearance, they both felt stronger. Also, his collared shirt lost the black lines it had, becoming pure white, while the material shifted a bit, the cotton being mixed with polyester, as it started to resemble his pants a bit in terms of texture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes didn't stop there, as some of Yiuto's memories with him fighting using swords being replaced with him using his fists instead. This style didn't align too well with his own knightly image. But he began to think of himself less of a swordsman and more of a brawler as within his mind, his name was replaced once more, this time to Yiuro Roijo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Damn, it sure sucks having to sit in my office alone like that all night long. I am so glad I had enough coffee to keep me awake. Although... Where am I right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYiuro realized that he was no longer on the path to the old school building and he was now in the middle of the woods. Normally there should be no issue in getting there, but his sense of direction seemed to have gotten worse. Instead of trying to get back on the path, he gave out a sigh, as he started to head back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why I even thought of going to the ORC. I can just browse on my laptop than go there and maybe not find anything. It's going to be much faster anyway. Sill, I need to get better at paying attention to my surroundings. Last thing I need is for someone to know how horrible I am at reading maps...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was getting increasingly more dismissive of the entire situation, the idea of the occult staying in his mind, but he was thinking of the light less than a danger and more of an annoyance at most. On top of that, he was slowly getting a bit more distant of his group of friends, as they were starting to become regular people, like the rest of the students. On the way back, his hair was beginning to get a reddish tint as it started to lengthen, currently covering his ears.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few minutes ago...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei continued to listen to the conversation between the two kendo girls. He brushed away a strand of hair as his mane was beginning to lengthen without his notice. His bangs started to frame his face as the rest of his hair in the back was slowly getting longer, now reaching his neck. He was too distracted by their talk to actually acknowledge what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this lady got here a about a week ago and is still trying to fit in? How come Rossweisse-san or Sensei didn't mention that? They work for the school, so we should've gotten a heads-up about her. Then again, as long as it doesn't directly involve us, I guess it's not really worth mentioning... But still, Sensei should've said something about her. There's no way he wouldn't tell me if she is really as hot as she sounds...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to hear more about the newcomer, and why some of the details about her, such as her pink eyes and blue hair, sounded a bit familiar to him. He hoped the pair would mention something more about her appearance, but he wasn't expecting another bomb to be dropped by Katase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently she is a friend of our substitute principle that we got last month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? They know each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what I heard they went to the same high school together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's interesting... Who would've thought that tomboy of a principal is friends with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tell me. Remember the time she acted like our PE teacher? She was more driven than he ever was. And did you see how strong she was? She could do weight-lifting is she wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not sure she could. But she definitely took a lot of care in her figure. She is as beautiful as her nurse friend, so maybe their figures were something that drew them to each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha! That's a funny thought! And speaking of her, she seemed to pissed off when someone said she was more like a guy. I mean, I know she doesn't have the most attractive personality for the guys here, but she was a little angry when no boys were looking at her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe because of her coaching most likely\", giggled Murayama.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Issei was even more confused than before, something which was clearly shown by his raised eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So there's a new female principal as well? There's no way this isn't something worth mentioning! Changing the head of the school is major! Why wasn't I told about this? Did Rias and the others know? Kiba didn't say anything though...But why did the old one leave? Was it health issues?... Hold on a second. The way the principal sounds like is really familiar. Is she-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei didn't had time to think as he grew a bit in height, making him almost hit his head to the metal ceiling, as he grew up, to 20 years old. On top of that, his shoes started to push him a little higher as they grew a small heel while they lost their laces and the material began to harden. To make himself more comfortable without making much noise, Issei had no option but to try and bend his back. Surprisingly though, he found it to be quite easy as his spine now had an arching shape to make himself more flexible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it Isei! Don't make noise now! Or else you're toast!\" Isei didn't notice that he called himself in a slightly different manner as tried to not draw the attention of the girls, which was kind of hard, since he couldn't move his legs due to the fact his hardening footwear would surely make a loud sound on the metal floor of the locker. He also felt his brain buzz a bit as his name changed a bit in his head to Isei Houdou.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

He was so busy listening to Murayama and Katase that he didn't see how the girls already finished changing, alongside the rest of the kendo club. After the last girl left, Isei sighed as he opened the door of the locker and came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah... That scared me. I was for sure certain someone heard me. It suddenly felt a lot more cramped there for some reason and I was afraid I would be making too much noise.... Although it sucks I didn't manage to see as much as I wanted. I listened too much about this whole new nurse and principal thing that I forgot about the girls, and I barely got any info about those two anyway... I wanted to see what else was new, as I won't be getting another chance like this in a while. Sure, Rias and Akeno-san don't mind showing me their lingerie when they buy a new one, but still...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could lament further, his pants became even tighter on him, which was a little uncomfortable for him. They also started to shrink as they now reached the middle of his calves. Speaking of them, they vibrated as they morphed. They became shapely and quite slim, but the muscles in them seemed to atrophy as they felt a little bit weaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with my pants? They feel so tight right now...\" Isei pondered a bit over the issue, and saw that his body was slightly different. Seeing that his pants were a little shorter on him due to his new height and that his feet seemed to fit more snugly within his sturdier shoes made him smile to himself a bit. \"Huh...  feel a bit older now. I wonder if Rias will like it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsei uttered those words without much concern over his changed appearance, as he looked a little prideful over the way he looked. He believed Rias would appreciate the changes, but when he thought of his lover, something felt off. While the care and affection towards her didn't go away, his passion did drop quite a bit. It felt almost like he didn't felt as close to her as before. The same seemed to apply to the rest of his harem as well, with the feelings of love he had starting to diminish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally this would be a sign that something was going horribly wrong with his head, yet his thoughts seemed to quickly change to a different subject all together, his attraction over the girls suddenly turning off all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, I wonder if Yiuto got what he needed. I should head back and wait for him in case he already got back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a quick glance at the hallway to make sure there was nowhere around, Isei quickly got out of the locker room and started to head back to the meeting spot. On the way, his dress shirt lost its black accents while it started to lengthen a bit, currently going over his hips and covering a around half of his thighs. More mental changing happened as well, as knowledge about medicine and human physiology were starting to pop in mind. But there was also the fact that he began to no longer consider himself a student, a few thoughts making him think that he already finished high school, and that he didn't graduate from Kuoh. He shook his head, and didn't think much of it, although the lingering feeling still remained in the back of his head.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Outside, Yiuro managed to get back to the main gate, still pondering why he left for the old school building. He knew the ORC had a few books regarding talismans and charms and so on, but he considered the Internet to be a more viable way to get information. On the way however, he saw the kendo group leaving. Upon noticing him, they gave a polite bow, causing a bit of confusion as to why they were being so polite to a student... or rather former student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon Roijo-san.\", said the group in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... good afternoon to you too. Are you girls done with the training for today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. We are very grateful for being allowed to use the gym today as we needed a place to practice for the tournament text week.\", said Katase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sure... Were there any incidents?\", asked Yiuro slightly taken aback by how they were apparently thanking him for lending the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not really. Things were normal for the most past, and thankfully there weren't any of the usual perverts around to ruin anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that was something he didn't expect to hear. He was sure they would complain about Isei's supposed peeping after he saw him chase him around earlier. Were they considerate enough that they didn't want him to feel ashamed of his friend? Or did they suddenly decided to show forgiveness to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Huh?\" Suddenly, something within Yiuro's mind clicked, as the idea of Isei spying upon the girls sounded less and less plausible, as the perverted behaviour he was usually displaying was being slowly erased from his head. The image of his friend changed slightly, with the perversion being gradually replaced with modesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder his clothes, his abdomen was flattening, the visible muscle the area once had seemingly disappearing, but in reality they were now buried under a small layer of fat that made his waist look less taught than it actually was. His sides also pushed inwards, making his hips seem a little wider, something which was more evident as the hipbones started to stretch out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYiuto felt a little bit of pain from this process, but he tried to compose himself to not make the girls worry about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... Then I expect you to do your usual stuff on your own, but if you ever need some extra physical exercise, I would happy to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will remember that...\", said Murayama  a  little nervously as she and the others vaguely remembered the Spartan training they got last time they were coached by Yiuto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if that's all, then go home and relax. You don't even know how fast the weekend ends whenever you are busy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will. Have a good day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying goodbye to the group, Yiuto continued to head back to the building. Once inside, he found himself a little bewildered by the conversation with the girls. In the meantime, the buttons of his shirt were quickly replaced by a zipper as the collar was now looser around his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why were they talking like I did something for them? It's not like I could even give them the keys of the gym anyway. I mean, I do have an office here, but... An office?... Yeah, I have one. I work here at the school and my laptop is there. But why do I feel like that's wrong?... Maybe I should go to Isei and ask him if he thinks something's wrong.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just because my mind played a few tricks on me and I didn't get what those girls were talking about, I don't need to give him a scare that something's wrong with me. Jeez, so much trouble for a damn light... Besides, I can't just return without bringing some new info, or else Isei will think I goofed off somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a clear objective now, Yiuro decided to go to his \"office\", despite not knowing in full detail what his job actually was. But despite the fact that this is something he should know, he remained relaxed to the entire situation. He also didn't realize that his entire speech pattern changed completely, as he now sounded a lot more casual and carefree, opposed to his more polite and modest tone he previously had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way, his hair changed further as it now fell to his shoulders while the reddened further. Normally this would make him want to cut it as soon as possible to not inconvenience him, but it felt right for him to have longer hair now. In addition, he seemed a little bit peeved at the notion of him acting or looking \"masculine\", as he didn't want people to see him as such, and instead seemed to desire people to look at him and appreciate his looks. As for his sword skills, they were now partially replaced with different martial arts moves, which suited his style better, given that he was becoming as energetic and as Xenovia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Yiuro reached a double wooden door and opened it. Inside there were quite a few pieces of furniture which exuded an air of high-class. On each side, there was a trophy case, one which had various cups and medals won by the school, and the other, which was a bit smaller in comparison had various trophies which were seemingly won by a single individual at different sport competitions. The rest of the room was elegant and looked clean, showing that the place was well kept. It reminded him a bit of the main meeting room of the old school building that he... no, the ORC had, except it looked little more modern in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he went to sit at the large wooden desk, his body matured further to 24 years old, this time without growing in height, which made him look a little shorter compared to males his age. His hips expanded more as a little bit of fat covered them, while his butt also began to put on more mass as well. Fortunately, his pants didn't discomfort him as they remained quite roomy. They rolled themselves up until they climbed past his knees and stopping at his mid-thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down on the chair, and liking the cushy feeling it had, not knowing it was partially because of his expanding rear and turned on the laptop which was neatly placed in the middle of the study. \"Okay, now let's start searching...\" He didn't see that on the name plate on the desk was written his name and profession, \"Miuro Roijou- Headmaster\". He was now sitting in the principal's office, and was step by step growing into his new role.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had a few issues to correctly recall the Knight's name a few times before, with \"Yuuto\" and \"Yiuto\" alternating a bit between themselves for a little bit in his head, before remembering that Yiuro was his pal's name. In the meantime however, he found himself getting increasingly bored, as with Ddraig silent, he really didn't had anything to do right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time sure gets by a lot slower when there's no one around, huh? I hope he won't be taking much longer, but I am sure he is busy looking for clues.\", mumbled the Pawn to himself. \"Well... Might as well try to think of something to entertain me while I wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsei closed his eyes as he tried to think of the girls of his harem, with a small grin on his face. He started to recall the last trip to the school's pool that he had with them, which happened not that long ago, thus the memory was fresh in his mind. As he remembered the girls' curves, he subconsciously rubbed his legs together, which caused the new wave of changes. His calves became slim and curvy, but lost most of the muscle mass they once had traveled upwards. His thighs expanded as fat gathered in the area, while they became weaker in the process, all the training done to boost his running speed vanishing completely from both his body and his memories. As they continued to grow, Isei started to get a little turned on as his manhood was getting a little squeezed between the expanding masses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was enjoying the view he had created in his head, but something seemed to change. It was subtle at first, but Isei noticed how he was getting less attracted to the girls as he looked at their bodies. Their gazes also went from slightly lustful to the type of look they would have around their classmates, making him think they looked at him as a friend rather than as a lover. When he found himself no longer looking at the breasts and ignoring how close Rias and Akeno got to him, he opened his eyes in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that all about? Everything was normal then all of a sudden I am not looking at their oopai- I mean breasts? Is this a repeat of that UFO incident? I sure hope not. The would be the last thing I need... Don't tell me that light affected me too. I was sure I wasn't hit...\", said Isei to himself as he wanted to pick up the necklace to take another look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, he suddenly felt pressure in his abdomen, which prompted him to put one hand on his belly, without noticing that his red T-shirt was losing its color, the red slowly becoming duller while the fabric started to soften as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird... I hope I am not getting sick now...\" Now getting a little concerned of the effects of the light, he headed towards the closest restroom. Inside his head, the belief that he was a student was becoming less and less realistic, while the memories of him with the ORC were also fading away slowly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had suddenly the urge to sit down for some reason, and although a little reluctant at the beginning, he found himself obeying the urge and sat down. He then waited to do his business as he continued to keep his hands on his waist. As he did that, his toned abs were slowly withering away, the hard earned muscle being replaced by a slightly plumper belly. Once the pressure was diminishing a little, he pulled his hands away, just in time as a small roll of fat appeared. While he wasn't exactly getting overweight, his physique was gradually becoming something that belonged to a person who really wasn't into sport or any serious physical exercises, and was just trying to maintain himself fit instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder why I needed to come here. I didn't drink any water before... Which must mean...\", Isei took out the necklace out of his pocket and looked at it. \"...that this caused this to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsei had a feeling that whatever was affecting him was coming from the pendant, or rather the stone that was in the center. He took a closer look at it, and once again saw how genuine it looked. The blue marble seemed to be a real gemstone and the natural shine it had made it impossible to be a cheap fabrication. The silver rims also looked like they weren't just pieces of polished metal that would be found at any store. All in all, it looked just like a piece of jewelery you would expect to find people pay good money for it, and not at all like some cheap merchandise. However, there wasn't any sign that the item was having any power. Isei could feel a faint energy signature from it, but nothing that could make him identify what spell was placed on the gem <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No matter how many times I look at this, I can't really discern anything significant. I thought it was just a light that is used to disorientate others, but this clearly isn't the case. I wonder if I should call Rias after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he pondered that, he grew up again, this time to 22 years old. He felt a small surge of energy as he became older, making him give out a small moan with a slightly higher-pitched voice. His butt started to expand at a fast pace, making the seating a lot more cushy. Meanwhile, his boxers were becoming a lot silkier as their color were starting to change towards purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the energy spike was over, Isei's mind tried to recover, only to find it a little muddled, just as before. Firstly, his relationship with the members of the ORC seemed to change, as he didn't feel as close to them as before. Sure, they were all still good-natured people, but even Rias didn't seem to resonate with him as much as before. There was also the fact that his name became Asei Houjou, his old family name sounding more and more foreign to him by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Anyway, as I was saying, I must talk with Miuro about this again. Although why was I compelled to say \"Rias\" before? Was I talking about Rias Gremory-san from the ORC club? I suppose she has some books that might help, but I am sure she has her own schedule today... Maybe later I will visit her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing up, Asei was ready to put the necklace back in the pocket, but something made him to put it on him without knowing why. He couldn't have put it back anyway, as the pant pockets vanished. He however was none the wiser, as he liked the feeling his softer underwear felt over his curves, and especially over his manhood. Afterward, he washed his hands and went back on the corridor to wait for his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was basically a browser for magicians that only the licensed mages being able to use to prevent potential terrorists from being able to use it for their own reasons. So for Miuro to be able to use such a site was something which he shouldn't be able to do, yet he seemed unperturbed by the fact that he was using something that he shouldn't have known before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he searched, his hips and butt continued to grow as they both were soon approaching a size that rivaled the ones Rias and Akeno had. His underwear grew to accommodate his bigger curves as their material became softer and was slowly becoming the same red shading as his hair. Speaking of which, it continued to grow more and more, and while he didn't need to brush his bangs from his face as they were now framing his face and only a few strands occasionally came into his view, he was starting to get distracted by the fact that it was also brushing against his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... Nothing too concluding yet... It has to be one of these enchantments that affect the enemy like it showed here. But physical discomfort aside, this is one of the first times where it keeps affecting the mind continuously like that... It is nothing serious, as it seems to just be memory lapses and nothing else, but for this to be something recurring is something rare. I wonder if it also affected Isei, I mean Asei. Ugh, this is what I mean!\", groaned Miuro in frustration. \"Fortunately it doesn't look like it goes past making a few slips in our memories, but there is something that's been bothering me... For whatever reason, I feel like I am somehow connected to the ORC. It is really weird that this random magician made me think that I am related to Rias Gremory and her group of all people... Well, I do owe her a lot for what she did to me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind wondered as he tried to recall the debt he had for the redhead, but his mind seemed to be drawing a blank. Miuro didn't feel how his body's strength seemed to skyrocket as muscles tensed for a bit before filling him with a tiny wave of energy that hit his entire body. It manifested with an increase in power which was felt in his slimmer arms, smaller frame and bloating thighs. The last place also seemed to make him little aroused as his manhood was sandwiched between the growing legs, as muscle as fat both seemed to concentrate more in that area. While he now had a fantasy or two he could think about that would gladly indulge into, he decided to postpone any impure thoughts for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiuro's mind now almost completely erased most of his previous memories regarding the ORC and Rias, and the thought of him becoming a Devil was also becoming something untrue as well. On the other hand, his friendship with Asei remained, with the only change being in the dynamics between them, with him becoming the more open one, and Asei being a lot more demure than before... despite the clothes he wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... I could've sworn there was something about me having a debt to Gremory, but I can't remember why. most likely another effect of the light that's for sure... Still, she and the other girls are good people at heart, so who knows, maybe I should pay them a visit and talk with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then went back to the laptop, as he continued the search. But suddenly, there as something which drew his attention, making him wonder why he didn't notice it sooner.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However a moment later he realized something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I forget to put it on? Man, first my mind locks up, and now I forget things? There may be no reason for alarm right now, but this is getting a little aggravating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a hair accessory and quickly tied his hair with it in a high ponytail just as its shade became light red. The mane grew a bit more, so that even in the new way it was styled, it still reached to the bottom of his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, much better\", said Miuro proudly to himself. \"It sure felt weird not to have my ribbon on. I wonder if the girls from the kendo club noticed it. Maybe they were too tired or distracted. Well, they are nice kids, so they shouldn't gossip about it... Still, it's better than how it would've been if it was during the week...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiuro started to remember a few times where some boys called him unattractive despite trying to look so. It was true he wasn't as flashy about his looks as other teachers, but whatever she tried, between different brands of lip gloss, nail polish or perfume, many boys and even girls still said he looked too \"boyish\". And having misplaced his ribbon, one of his key \"feminine\" accessories, would surely make a few say he looked even more like a man. He was already getting a little angry, as he recalled Matsuda and Motohama, two of the people who were usually responsible for starting this discussion with their classmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear those too idiots don't know when to be quiet... I know that I don't really put that much effort in my looks as others, but still... How to I look like a man?! Just because I wear tracksuits most of the time, that doesn't make me less gorgeous! I worked a lot for this body, and now that I don't look as nice as nice as Asei, that doesn't mean I am not feminine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis statement seemed to affect his body as he went up to 25 years old. This change an age came up with his womanly figure nearly finishing forming, with him now being the proud owner of wide childbearing hips, thick but strong thighs and a large bubble-shaped behind. His waist still had to diminish a bit to finish the hourglass figure, but when it came down to his lower body, he looked like a model, save for one element that rested between his thighs. His clothes also became fully red, except for the collar which remained white. On the name plate on the desk, his name was now displayed as Miuri Rokijou.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, calm yourself Miuri...\", said the changing man to himself as he calmed himself down. \" Don't let these stupid thoughts distract you. You can think of a way to take your revenge on those perverts later. For now, just focus on searching about the enchantment placed on Ase's necklace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot noticing any of the changes that happened to him, Miuri went back on browsing, although he now felt somewhat more satisfied and even a little proud with his appearance, no longer feeling as \"masculine\" as before. However there was a small part of him that was still upset about, mainly his chest, and how people compared him to his friend in that regard, despite the fact that there really wasn't anything to compare at the moment...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He knew it was a bit of a distance between the two school buildings, but he didn't see him come back. He continued to look at the school yard from a window, but other than seeing the kendo club members talk among themselves for a few minutes before parting, there was no sign of activity ever since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a little concerning... Almost 30 minutes and still no sign of him. I wonder if something happened...\", said Asei to himself with a concerned look on his face. \"Where could he have gone...? Maybe I should call him to see if everything's all right... Huh?\" He was about to take out his phone and give him a call, but he realized he didn't have it on him. It escaped from his notice  however that his pants no longer had pockets, which was where he put the gadget in the first place. \"Did I lose it somewhere?... I think I left it in the nurse's office. How careless of me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Asei left to retrieve his phone, not noticing the slight shimmer of his pendant, which helped expedite the changes. His shoes began making a bit of noise as they became a pair of high heels, but he didn't saw the clicking sound his new footwear made out of the ordinary. His black pants continued to tighten on him as they continued to get shorter, now passing his knees and starting to force his legs together, with him putting one foot in front of each other. His T-shirt lost its sleeves as its color changed completely to a greyish blue while his shirt continued to lengthen as it reached the top of his thighs. Despite the changes, which now seemed to happen at a quicker pace, Asei didn't seem to notice how his clothes morphed, or that they were starting to show off his body, such as his the jiggle of his butt or the contours of his slightly pudgy belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really looks like things aren't going my way today. First the light, then those weird thoughts and now Miuro is missing... Although he could just be in his office and once again forgot to tell me. But I guess I am not in the position to criticize him this time, as I too misplaced my phone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point his memories of his past with the ORC, and even with his parents, were mostly gone, replaced with new ones that showed his past, not as a Devil, but rather as a magician together with Miuro, and the adventures and missions they had as they finished high-school and college before finding a job. He still vaguely remembered Rias and the other girls as acquaintances after arriving in Kuoh, but he no longer held any romantic feelings towards any of them. And on the same subject, despite his age and Miuro's assurance that he was a beautiful person, he somehow ended up as a virgin, which was something he was clearly ashamed of. He could still remember times when he had to lie to the students about his past love interests. He was a hopeless romantic without a doubt, and at this point, despite the need to find a man that would make him happy, he was content if a woman filled the role as well, showing that there was still a part of him which didn't change completely, which was his sexuality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel that his mind seized up again, but at this point Asei wasn't all that concerned anymore, as he brushed off a longer strand of hair, which was now going past his shoulders as the roots started to become dark blue and it slowly affected more and more of his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is really strange. Why did I think before that I was in a relationship with Gremory-san? Well, I am glad I am able to discern what's truth and what's not. She has a great personality and her figure looks a lot like mine and Miuro's despite being so much younger than us. The same goes for Himejima-san too. I wonder if she was an early bloomer... Oh dear, it looks like my mind is still playing tricks on me if it made me start thinking like that about those girls... I hope I am not turning into a pervert. Although some girls said I am a bit more than I know... Hah... I have to blame my inexperience on that for sure. I just hope I'll find someone suited for me soon...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite being a good while since he last visited the nurse's office, Asei found his way there much easier as thoughts and memories of him working as a nurse at the school for a bit filled his head. Along with those, more medical knowledge was added, recalling the lessons he took at the university and the practice he gained after working in a hospital. Once he reached the office and went inside, he saw the place looking as neat as always, given he was a quite orderly person. Aside from the usual desk, bed and cabinets filled with medical equipment and medicine, there were a few photo frames and ornaments here and there. But what drew his attention was the black purse sitting in the middle of the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I forgot my purse. I never thought I was that distracted that I didn't notice sooner. Although, I had something else to do that didn't require me to have it on me... Still, leaving my phone behind was a big mistake on my part...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking towards the desk, his skin-tight pants stopped shrinking at his mid-thighs, as they continued to force his legs together. Eventually, the material, which was now a lot more silky than before, drew his legs nearer as the legs were now fusing together. The new way of walking also made his hips shake more as they started to expand the same way his butt did, as fat was slowly gathering there as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking inside the bag, he saw it contained cosmetics, a wallet with some credit cards and a driver's license under his name and also his phone, which now had a more elegant black case than the one it had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There it was. It's a relief that it was here. Now let's call Miuro and ask him where he is... Huh? Where did these numbers come from?\" As he was checking his contacts, he saw that there were a few which he didn't remember seeing before. Aside from the ones of his current families, the rest of the teachers and a few friends, he also had the numbers of the ORC members as well. \"This is strange... How did these got here? Gremory-san doesn't seem to be the type to pull a prank like this, and I don't remember ever asking them for their contacts either. I feel like I shouldn't erase them though... They seem important...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, after a certain declaration made by his friend, the changes seemed to happen a lot faster this time, as he went up to 26 years old. He needed to cough for a bit as his vocal chords tightened further, raising his voice to a soprano level. Meanwhile, his former shirt finished becoming a simple white lab coat, that went down below his pants, while his top's hemline started to plunge a bit. He also felt a little aroused as his boxers became fully purple as their own legs started to shrink away. By doing so, the material started to restrain his manhood even more, which in tandem with the pillowy thighs made it impossible for him not to feel a little turned on. However, somehow Asei managed to control himself and managed to calm down. Also, on the driving license, his name was now listed as Ase Hiujou.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I don't know what that feeling was, but it was clearly... unexpected. Now I am really curious to know what that light did... Still, I need to erase these numbers. If someone is to find me with so many students' contacts, they might start off another rumor.\" He then proceeded to delete all the numbers, but when it came down to Rias's, he changed his mind. \"Actually, I could keep hers. I can say I exchanged contacts with her as she is the leader of a club... Personally I don't mind it. It is a little odd, but somehow I feel tempted to know more about her... Maybe it's because she is such a nice person. I can see why so many people like Gremory-san.\", said Asei to himself, as he still felt an affinity towards Rias, despite not knowing why.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As more time was spent searching, Miuri was getting less concerned with everything that happened after he was hit by the light. The memory lapses and the weird feelings he went through were quickly becoming more annoyances than actual reasons for concern. He was getting increasingly confident there wasn't any danger as much as before, and was slowly losing interest in looking for more answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did I even think I had to find this stuff so quickly? Yeah, it is a little strange that I haven't found any real clues as to what the source of the light was, but it definitely has to be a protection spell at most. I don't know what it did, but given that I barely felt anything after I got hit, it must mean I am resistant to it.\", said the young principal to himself. Despite the great amount of changes he underwent, his magic abilities were maintained, albeit they were now repurposed for a completely new role, the sword being traded for his fists, as he now was a physical fighter though and through, while his experience with a weapon was almost entirely removed from his mind at this point. \"... Well, no use in dwelling over this stuff right now. I'll just talk with Ase later when he comes. Until then, maybe a bit of relaxation wouldn't be too bad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiuri stretched on his chair before putting his arms behind his head and as he tried to relax. His shirt's buttons disappeared as they were replaced by a zipper while a few cream stripes, the same color as his collar, appeared on the side of both his top and pants. The material finished changing for both, and with a few extra minor changes, his clothes were now a tracking suit that showed a good amount of his figure. The zipper also seemed to move on its own as it started to lower itself, stopping at just below his collarbone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then tried to let his mind free and try to think of something pleasant. Most of his original hobbies were now gone, with training being the only major thing left that was still the same as before, except this time he was training the strength of his body rather than his skills with a sword. He began to remember the high school and college years where he and Ase remained really good friends despite how many years have passed ever since they first met each other. He could recall the moments where he joked around with his friend and when he gave him the idea of his not so modest fashion sense, and to his amusement how much Ase remained blissfully unaware that he was wearing clothing which was revealing a lot more than he should. Also, not long after learning of magic and becoming certified magicians, Miuri developed a slight interest in Ase's body, and he wasn't why. He thought it might've come after a long time of teasing him about his figure and the not so innocent times when they had to share a room and things sometimes escalated after they both got a little drunk, but he undoubtedly felt a bit attracted to his friend. Still, that didn't stop him for trying to find a man that would satisfy him, and hoped that he would find someone to appreciate his looks, rather than just say he wasn't beautiful enough, like most of the younger generation had stated quite a bit lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis underwear became fully red as the legs vanished completely. The material was still getting softer, which was making him slightly more aroused. At one point he was a bit confused why he didn't put a bra on today, but then remembered that he didn't want anything to hamper his training, which was the main reason he came to the school today anyway. As he was trying to snooze off for a bit however, he was suddenly woken up, as someone called him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Didn't you say you would meet me in the hallway after you were done?\", asked Ase on the phone. Realizing that he forgot he had to return, he laughed a bit sheepishly before he replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry... I went and looked up on the Internet a bit in my office, but I got a bit tired and tried to sleep a bit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly... I know you said you were feeling a little unwell, but still, you could've told me. If you felt out of it, you should've come to the nurse's office to rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I am fine. It's just that... my mind was a little foggy all day after that your necklace shined, so I kind of forgot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too? I also have been dealing with a few issues, as I had trouble remembering some things ever since you left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay now? Was there anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. I felt a little strange at times, and I found myself a bit lost with some of the thoughts I had, but there wasn't anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we both have been going through the same thing, huh? Well, the silver lining must be that we are both fine, right? I say it was a dud at most.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kind of envy your optimism, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. Wait for me, I'll come and discuss this when I get there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the conversation, Miuri's face finished feminizing, with the new visage showing both maturity as well as youthfulness. It didn't look as alluring as Ase's but it still looked very beautiful nonetheless. His Adam's apple slowly shrunk away during the call until it vanished completely, leaving him with a feminine but slightly boyish sounding-voice, but he didn't seem to notice this at all as he ended the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great... I was so distracted that I forgot to go back to Ase. I would've noticed it sooner, but I was so distracted by the fact that I went to the old school building without knowing why that it completely slipped my mind to return to him. I don't get why I went there even now. I mean, the ORC does some of the books from the library that are also used for magicians in training, but I could've found that info on my own anyway... Did I want to meet the members? They do come here during weekends but that still doesn't explain the reason I went there. Is this tied to how I thought I owed Rias Gremory something before?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could think any further, the same weird sensation he felt whenever he grew up returned for one last time, as he went up to his final age, 27 years old. This time however, the sensation was a little stronger than before, as he also ceased being a Devil, and reverting back to being a human, albeit one with above average magic power than a regular magician. This was also emphasized as the color of his eyes changed from blue to brownish-orange. There was still the Knight piece that resided within him, which still tied him to Rias, but he was unaware of its existence as the energy the piece emanated was barely being felt, and thus he didn't pay any  mind on it, thinking it was another of the light's effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Again? And it felt a little more powerful too... But it seems it kind of stopped. I wonder if there's something to trigger these.\", whispered Miuri to himself. Upon realizing the fact that he was close to whimper a bit at the strange feeling however, he shook his head. \"What's wrong with me? Why I am acting suddenly like this is something that should bother me the way it does? I let Asi's concern get to me and now I look like I am scared of a mere spell that did almost nothing to me! Why should I even be worried about anyway? It's not like I don't appreciate Asi worrying for me, but I am more than able to protect myself from a magic lightbulb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe name on the plate now said \"Minuri Rokiujou\", as his pride and confidence seemed to grow. In contrast, Minuri's manhood seemed to the exact opposite as it began to become smaller, as it was caressed by the silkier underwear.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Still the bits that he learned about her, including a few personal details he shouldn't normally know about her still remained ingrained in his psyche. While this made her more endearing to be around, as he greatly respected her personality and ethic, Ase decided that for the moment, he should place his desire to know more about the ORC president aside, and instead call Miuri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the phone, he was a little disappointed his best friend seemed to try and take a nap instead of investigating whether a spell was placed on his necklace or not. But when he learned Miuri was going through a similar ordeal in regards to how muddy his mind was, he lost the desire to try and reprimand him, instead showing a little bit of concern. Miuri assured him he was feeling mostly alright, and thus he was relieved that it didn't seem like there were any other harmful effects. There still was a bit of apprehension when it came down to put everything behind, and thus he decided that a face-to-face discussion was in order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring their talk, Ase's pants finished becoming a black tight-fitting skirt which outlined his thighs beautifully while his top's sleeves disappeared almost entirely, becoming now just spaghetti straps that held up the rest. The neckline plunged further along with the sides of the top, stopping just above his pectorals. With the color became a dull blue and a small layer of frills forming at the bottom, other than his underwear, his clothes were done changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing the call, Ase put the phone back in the purse together with the rest of its contents, and then swung it on his shoulder as he left for the principal's office. On the way, he couldn't help but feel that his clothes seemed a to ponder a bit on today's events. He was glad he and Miuri managed to prevent a worse outcome due to their very high resistance to magic. While it wasn't enough to withstand stronger magic attacks from Demons or Angels, they both had a remarkable amount of endurance, especially Miuri. But while remembering what happened, there was one thing that bothered him a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did Miuri go to the ORC club? We have already means to look what what we needed ourselves... Did he also felt something in regards to Rias Gremory? Could it be that she is involved in this incident...?\", thought Ase to himself. He began to doubt the young redhead for a second before he shook his head, and with a resolve that seemed almost unnatural for someone who shouldn't know Rias on a personal level, he banished the thought. \"No, that is impossible. Gremory-san is an upstanding student of the Academy, and I don't believe she would partake in such petty schemes. She is too kind and gentle to do something like this... Not to mention that it is highly unlikely for her to plan this herself, as there is no evidence she is a magician or knows about the concept of magic...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAse couldn't help but blush a bit at how fierce he tried to defend the girl. It felt a tad unnatural at how involved he suddenly seemed to get when it came down to her reputation. He didn't notice that his hair now cascaded down to his butt as it suddenly grew out, or that its color was now completely overtaken by the blue that appeared in his roots and his entire mane was now dark-blue. \"J-Jeez, where did that come from? I barely know Gremory-san, as I just got here in Kuoh not that long ago, but that thought just seemed to form by itself... She is a great person from what I've seen and heard about her, and Miuri said she likes her as a person but...Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, he took a quick look at one of the windows, and upon seeing his reflection he noticed something was off.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I could've sworn I put it this morning before leaving...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAse stopped as he put the purse on the window sill and took a compact mirror as he started to apply some mascara. It wasn't really a necessity, but he couldn't help but feel that it was wrong not to have some make-up on his face. While Ase did look quite pretty already, he felt like he couldn't pull it as well as Miuri did when it came down to natural look. The mascara lengthened his eyelashes, while the color of his orbs was gradually changing from brown to purple. The blush he applied afterward made his cheekbones go higher, and the lipstick made his lips a little plumper as they gained a natural's cupid's bow. Beneath his notice, all the memories of him being a Devil also disappeared, with only a faint aura from his Pawn pieces being the only reminder of the power he once had. Speaking of power, the Boosted Gear also seemed to become dormant, as while it remained with him and Ddraig still residing inside of it, it became unusable at the moment given his new physiology and magic abilities and thus its power was now hidden within him. Instead, he was now in possession of a new Sacred Gear, Valhelm, which allowed him to medically examine people and see exactly what's wrong with them, given his new occupation as nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing, Ase looked in the mirror. Satisfied with the way he looked, he blew a small kiss in the compact before starting to put everything back in the purse. \"It felt a little strange without my make-up on. Although it is a bit more curious why I didn't even notice anything until now. I know my head wasn't in the right place all day, but I would've expected at the very least to see something was missing when I went to the bathroom... Still, I must assume it was just another effect of the light, but it seems that my mind is getting clearer now, so it must mean that the effects are slowly wearing off. My body still feels a bit different than usual however, but I can't seem to notice anything out of the ordinary yet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, his body finally grew up to 27 years old, his final age. His curves became even more enticing as they grew one last time to proportions which would make a professional model jealous. With his wide alluring hips, gorgeous heart-shaped butt, beautiful thick thighs and plump but small waist, he was now the owner of a figure which undoubtedly made him look like a goddess, combined with his face and hair. The pendant emitted a faint light as it masked the changes that happened to his body. In his mind, his name also became Asi Hijou, as he became now a licensed nurse and magician.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Actually, now it feels better for some reason. Are the effects getting undone quicker now? That is certainly a relief... I just hope nothing else happens until everything goes back to normal...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he was done, he put the purse back on his shoulder and continued his way to Minuri's office. As Asi walked, he could feel how his large rear was bouncing quite a bit, which made him blush a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure hope these clothes are not too revealing. Minuri said that this outfit is supposed to make me look more appealing to men, but I only seem to draw the attention of those only interested in my body... Honestly, I still haven't found anyone who is fit for me, and despite what Minuri says, it is shameful that I am still a virgin to this day... At this point, I don't know what to do... I may even consider trying to get in a relationship with a woman if this continues. Some students do it, and I guess I have nothing to lose at this point...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon thinking of the idea to like a woman, Rias suddenly appeared into his head for some reason. He tried to distract himself from any perverse thoughts about the younger girl, but it was getting a little hard to do that, as his squished manhood resting between the thighs and the small, responsive bumps that were growing on his chest were making Asi the tiniest bit aroused.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don't know where those girls got that idea, but if they have a problem they should just tell me in the face, not gossip right outside my office!\" For the past few minutes, Minuri was ranting about various things that upset or irked him recently, from the way the students saw him, to some of the other teachers' opinion regarding his relaxed attitude at times. Normally, his fuze wasn't that short, but it was considerably smaller than how it was at the very beginning. \"... And lastly... what did those two perverts mean when they said I was not womanly enough? What do I need to do to be that, huh? Wear revealing dresses and make-up and start acting like a goody two-shoes? Well, sucks to be them, because I am not going to change, and if they can think they will get way with telling everyone that, they are about to see themselves why they should never insult a woman- man's looks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly corrected himself from that slip-up, although he was having a little trouble saying what gender he was at the moment. He wanted to say he was male, but a growing part of him disagreed with that. His underwear finished becoming a pair of red panties that hugged his privates tightly, but the uncomfortable sensation was slowly going away as they continued growing smaller. His nipples also got slightly larger as their color became a soft pink. Realizing that he got a little too worked up and that he was apparently complaining to no one for a good while, he cleared his throat and tried to regain his composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... Guess I got a bit ahead of myself there. How on Earth did I go from trying to give myself a pep talk to saying everything that pissed me off for the last month or so? Boy, I am happy I was alone when I said those things, otherwise I would've gotten in trouble for sure... But I guess I needed to get out of my system anyway, so it wasn't really a waste...\" He sighed as he slowly started to calm down. \"... I never thought it was this difficult to adapt. Most of the people here are good and nice to me, but of course there are some out there that like to say I am not up to their standards. I kind of expected this from the kids, but some teachers need to know when to shut up. Why can't everyone be like Azazel? He seems like an okay guy, is pretty cool and collected, can make some good jokes and is a little handsome. Too bad he isn't my type, but I will sure envy the girl who manages to get with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinuri laid himself back on the chair as he managed to relax a bit. \"I guess I can only really depend on Asi when it comes down to this stuff. Azazel and Rossweisse are nice to me, but I am not 100 percent ready to tell them all that's on my mind. And I think they will surely get fed up with me if I go and throw a tantrum like this. I am really lucky I have someone I know for so long that is going to accept having me for who I am when I try not to be all bossy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind started to think about Asi again, and like before, there was something that made him look attractive to him. He was having doubts thinking that there was anything romantic between them, but he couldn't deny that he felt a lot better thinking about him. He could recall the times where he fooled around in highschool and taunted Asi about how mature his figure was at his age back then and that he should try and show it more to the others to maybe get a boyfriend. But despite that, he couldn't help but feel a little bad for the nurse in regards to the fact that he was still a virgin. And the irony was that he did manage to get laid despite the crude remarks about his lacking femininity, while the more attractive Asi was still alone after this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Still, he needs to find a boyfriend or something. I could hook him up with someone, but a hopeless romantic like him would rather find someone suitable himself... I still don't get how he doesn't have a lover yet. Any woman would die to have a body like that and despite all the heads turning for him, still nothing? Small waist, large curves, great hair, cute face, modest personality... What is there not to like?\", he asked himself aloud before looking down at himself, and frowning a little upon noticing his flat chest. \"He even has probably the biggest breasts any of these guys have ever seen... Is that why I don't have anyone looking at me? Because they always compare me to her? But what is so different anyway? I have bigger hips, and my chest is just one cup size smaller... I swear, some men are really too superficial...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once the memories of his highschool days came in, his manhood shrunk further, barely a third of its original size, while his testes became notably smaller as they were slowly pulled inside him. His Sacred Gear also became Dragon Ace, which was perfectly suited for his new combat style, the ability to create thermal heat sources and ignite them matching his fiery personality. He can remember the times he spent as part of the student council with Tomiko, Gen, Akaya and of course, Asi. The former three went for different career choices after they graduated, and thus he kind of missed them and wanted to meet them more frequently... aside from maybe Akaya, as his shenanigans always managed to get him mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinuri was very glad he and Asi managed to stay in touch after graduation, and after pulling a few strings once he became principle at Kuoh, he managed to have him work at the school's medical office. Despite all of his teasing, the two were still best friends, and Asi was happy that their relationship didn't change too much since their younger days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Sometimes, I even wonder if either of us is going to find someone, since every guy around here is so judgmental over the smallest things. I don't think there was anyone I met recently who doesn't have one thing to criticize about me... and except for Azazel, I haven't met anyone handsome either... Well, at this rate I might just start dating Asi if this keeps up. He's hot, we know each other very well, and there's nothing to hide between us... Wait... Why does that doesn't sound too bad all of a sudden?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite starting the statement as a joke, when he started to think why Asi was still single despite all of his attempts to find a suitable lover, Asi once again felt a bit attracted to his friend, which made him pause. Minuri realized that somehow along the way, he was interested in his friends's body, which made him blush a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Am I... actually considering this?! I mean, other than Gen, there really wasn't a guy that could keep up with me, and we aren't as close as before. But for me to like Asi? Well... there are plenty of good points, as we get along so well and we do spend quite a bit of time together. But actual romance?... I am not too certain about that and I don't know when I started to think he looks attractive... Although I never considered dating a girl before. I saw a couple of girls kiss one time on campus, and thus, maybe it isn't so uncommon...? No, no. I am thinking way outside the box right now. Just because I haven't found a man I like, it doesn't mean I like women instead! I just need to wait and find someone that I could be with... But, to be honest... I waited eight years and there was no one good for me. Maybe a change wouldn't sound so bad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinuri was starting to get conflicted over what he was thinking about his relationship with Asi. This was because some of his original feelings about his friend, didn't go away, as he still held a considerable amount of trust, respect and dependence, even if his emotions were slightly warped and became a tad romantic along the way. He felt a little uncomfortable as his testes got pulled inside him and changed function, while his manhood continued to diminish, now not even visible through the panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...This is really strange... Is this because of that spell from before? No, I didn't feel odd for a while so I guess the effects are over... But seriously, this is getting weird. I still think guys are hot, but now so does Asi... I wonder if- Oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tiny manhood was pulled inside him completely an was promptly replaced with a mature womanhood. The feeling was exhilarating, but it was over almost instantly. The nameplate was now saying Minori Rokijou and the \"i\" in the family name was stretching out. Minori, who now considered herself a woman, felt a little lightheaded by what just happened and tried to get a hold of herself, but her head still felt cloudy for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn... That... was unexpected... Wait, was my chest always so small? I know everyone said it was smaller than Asi's, but it wasn't this small. Is that damn spell playing tricks on me again...?\" Minori grumbled as she unzipped a part of her top and began to rub her chest. She couldn't understand why was she doing this, but in her dazed state of mind, she didn't question it. Almost immediately, small lumps of fat were forming underneath his larger nipples as two perky mounds began to develop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Asi didn't notice that his pacing was slower, as he was deep in thought for several minutes, while blushing at the same time. The image of Rias was persisting into his head ever since he came up with the idea to date a girl. He knew it was wrong for him to like someone younger than him, and a girl no less, due to his new preference in men, but something about her seemed to be a lot more alluring than he thought. In the meantime, the small mountains that were growing on his chest reached A-cups, rubbing a bit against his top before a purple strapless bra formed over them to support them. His arousal was also stimulated further by the fact that his manhood was now resting inside a pair of purple lace panties, and as much as he tried not no focus on the sensation his groin felt against the silky material, he couldn't deny that it felt a little good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Why am I thinking about Gremory-san so much all of a sudden? Normally, I wouldn't feel like this towards another girl... I only jested about me dating a woman, but is this some sort of signal that I may be into both genders...? Or is it because of the light again? Somehow, I doubt that is the only factor, given that it feels to random to be tied her in any way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before a set of stairs, Asi stopped completely as he continued thinking about Rias. \"...But in any case, why is Gremory-san the one I seem to be attracted to? She has a great personality from what I've seen, is diligent with her studies, and seems to be acting like a role model to the other girls. But is that really all there is? She is a wonderful person, but I believe there is something about her appearance too... Is it maybe her crimson hair? True, it's not a shade you can see on anyone, and it makes her looks foreign and mysterious as well. I can't deny it looks really pretty... but Minuri has red hair too, and while it doesn't look as neat as Gremory-san's, it still looks beautiful...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Asi, his nipples suddenly became larger along with the areolae as their color changed into a light-pink hue. The breasts grew into B-cups as their growth rate seemed to accelerate. It wasn't until when the growing mounds reached C-cups and the nipples suddenly hardened as they grew in length quite a bit that they started to poke through the bra and top, when his focus was broken. He couldn't help but give out a small moan as the sensation as some of his feelings of Rias were copied into Minuri, now finding the young principal as attractive as the younger girl. While trying not to moan again, he ignored how his eyes hurt for a second as their color changed from brown to purple. Fortunately for him, the wave of arousal diminished a bit as he managed to partially regain his composure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Why did I feel like that all of a sudden? I was only thinking about Minuri's hair, so why? It's true that he isn't as well-mannered as Gremory-san, but his figure is indeed... something. I am surprised so many people seem to complain about how she is unappealing, but I can't really understand them. When it comes down to his temperament and his penchant to sometimes get a little overbearing, I don't see anything wrong with him. He should be able to find a lower quick enough with how well-endowed he is but... Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped as he realized he complimented his best friend's body. While he still agreed on the fact that Rias looked to be a more suitable love interest when it came down to personality, the fact that he knew so much and got along so good with Minuri, made him reconsider his thoughts about his \"pal\", which made him blush a little harder. He knew he shouldn't be feeling this way, but a tiny voice inside his head yelled \"oopai are amazing\", which made him reconsider a bit the idea of him dating a woman, and this time, it seemed to stick. There were still reservations that made him unsure, including the desire to date a man, but he wasn't no much against the idea of a female to replace him if she met the right criteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Asi's head started to hurt a bit, as his preferences changed a little bit... or rather some of his previous ones returned. His desire of dating Rias remained, except given his new age, he was reluctant in pursuing a relationship with a student that was ten years younger than him. She still remained the pinnacle of an ideal girlfriend, as some of the more personal details regarding her resurfaced back into his mind, as his thoughts warped a bit to accommodate, making him remember that he knew Rias for a little while before being hired at Kuoh. The aspect of her being a Devil however was lost, as he remained now blissfully unaware of the girl's true identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with him more open to dating a female, he began considering dating Minuri, as his mind now acknowledge him as someone of the fairer sex. As the memories of their school life together came into his thoughts, and seeing how well they got together, he didn't seem so against it. He still knew that Minuri might not even be interested in dating him, and that \"she\" wasn't the ideal lover he wanted, but ever since comparing the hair of the two potential love interests he now had, he started to think it wouldn't be so bad \"her\" as a lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, his breasts grew larger with each passing minute, going through C-cups and now entering D-cups with their growth rate not going down at all. They started to really push the top outwards as the gem of the necklace shined a little brighter, signifying that the changes were close to the climax. And yet, despite the increasing pleasant feelings coming from his chest and his groin, Asi simply tried to understand his own emotions instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Where is all of this coming from? First Gremory-san, and now Minuri? This is getting out of hand... I don't even understand how things even got to this point. First I made an off-handed comment about me dating a woman that I wasn't serious about, then I started to think of Gremory-san as attractive and now the same thing applies to Minuri after I just made a remark about how both of them have red hair?... I know my mind is still a little muddled after that incident with the light that happened before, but it's impossible for me to think like this just from that. Gremory-san aside, why am I suddenly interested in Minuri?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsi couldn't deny the familiarity he had with his best friend and the many memories they had together with \"her\". While it was true \"she\" sometimes still acted a little too childish or demanding, it was impossible to say \"she\" was a bad person in any way. He could remember when Minuri worked as a principal's assistant at another school, while also serving as a PE teacher, and \"she\" declared that every student will be protected from whatever harm may come. While the speech was a little cheesy, it sure caught the hearts of many parents and teachers, which made \"her\" receive a recommendation to work at Kouh as a temporary principal after many months of stellar work. Including an incident where a few rogue magicians that attacked the school for some reason, and managed to keep everything covered, without any civilians knowing of what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsi realized that maybe this was why he liked \"her\". He wasn't the strong at all, and was quite delicate in comparison to his friend. He was still brave and wanted to be a source of help to others, even if he didn't have the necessary strength to do so. Minuri was an example of someone who had said power, and was better able to help people. He wanted to support \"her\", someone who already decided to protect other, so that maybe one day he may gain the strength as well. It also kind of helped that \"her\" behaviour was quite \"masculine\", as much as \"she\" hated to be called manly, and thus perhaps it kind of made sense for them to become a couple in a way, as their goals weren't all that different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well... I may be jumping the gun here. I still desire a man, and someone like Gremory-san may be more appropriate for me, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, his body seemed to heat up a bit, as he started to pant. His breasts continued grow continuously, as they passed E-cups and were now into the F-cup range. Perhaps they were even bigger, but Asi didn't seem recall what size he was right now, as he tried to keep his balance by leaning on the nearby wall, his chest jiggling a bit as he did so. He couldn't tell if he had a fever or it was another effect of the spell, but he tried to calm down and endure, hoping that the heat might go away. He didn't notice that he started to rub his thighs together, sending more pleasurable feelings to his groin, especially after it started to shrink.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She didn't seem really aware of what was going on or that she was massaging her growing breasts, as her mind seemed to be quite foggy at the moment. Her body also felt warmer, and started to sweat a little bit when her breasts entered D-cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ngh... Is that light now starting to show its true effects? My chest seems to be heating up the most, but it doesn't really hurt. Actually, if it wasn't for the mess my head was, this wouldn't really feel so bad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued to rub his breasts, the final mental changes took place. The memories of his new family were complete as any lingering attachment towards Rias Gremory was removed, his current feelings for her being respect, but nothing more. In addition, the times when he was called manly became more frustrating to him now, as he now identified himself as a real woman, one that wanted to be appreciated more by others, and especially by men when it came down to her looks. Her personality went through a few more adjustments, as besides his ability to lead a school, he also became more proficient when it came down to teaching others, becoming quite proficient as a PE teacher and as a magic instructor. Her knowledge regarding different spell and magic items also seemed to have increased quite a bit, as she was now a fully-fledged magician as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment his breasts went into E-cups, he moaned a little as he accidentally brushed one of his nipples. His thoughts went back to Asi as he was now between best friend and potential love interest. He had to acknowledge that starting a relationship with him was actually quite enticing, and he wouldn't be too upset if he ended up with Asi instead of a man, even if deep down he would still hope a guy would rise to his standards. He wanted to moan a bit and try to say Asi's name, but he didn't manage to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden however, his hands moved faster, and after a quick surge, during which he pinched his nipples and whimpered a bit, his breasts finished growing into a pair of hefty F-cups that hung proudly on his chest. After ten seconds, the heat that enveloped his body started to disappear, and Minori welcomed the feel of the cooler air on her partially exposed torso. Upon realizing that she had her hands on her bossom, she pulled them off and zipped up her top to just above her breasts. After another minute of regaining her composure and feeling that her body temperature had gone back to normal, she had was gone she gave a long sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah... I guess it's finally over... I think that energy that made me feel off before is gone completely. I am not going to lie, I thought I had a stroke there for a second, but I guess it was just a fever of some sort. Although... I felt a little bit aroused during that time for some reason...\", said Minori to herself as she scratched her cheek, while blushing at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the changes finally over, Minori Rokujou, the current Principal of Kuoh Academy, and a bona fide high-class magician, was now happy everything was now seemingly over. She arrived in the town not that long ago after the former principal decided to take a break for personal reasons, and she was recommended to substitute for him until he came back. He was very happy with the prospect of him running a school, and despite some students seemed to have a few issues with her behaviour at times, she was largely respected by the student body and by most of the teachers. She was surprised to see that there was so much activity from Fallen Angels and Devils in the small city, so she and Aki needed to know when to act whenever a potential threat loomed over the school. Fortunately, there seemed to be another group that solved many issues that came up, such as when the Khaos Brigade appeared. Although they didn't know the identities of the members of the group, she was happy there was someone out there with a strong sense of justice, and would be happy if she could meet these individuals to know them better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was snapped from her own embarrassment as she realized something. \"Where is Aki? She's been gone for a while... Did that spell do something else to her?\" Minori was about to stand up and look for her friend, but a knock on the door made her sigh in relief.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As his breasts surged one last time to G-cups, making his bust comparable to Akeno's and his nipples clearly outlined in the top he was wearing, his testes were pulled inside him as they became ovaries and connected to the new cavity that formed in his abdomen, while his diminishing manhood was going to have the same fate as it slowly receded in an opening that formed beneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha... Ha... This is... I know I should try to resist this, but... it feels actually quite good and it feels like... it's close to the ending as well...\", said Asi as the pendant's gleam intensified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis memories about his old family, and soon life, were completely replaced with new ones of him growing up quite differently than before. He got introduced to magic quite early in his childhood and ever since then, he discovered he got an affinity to healing magic. This made him want to try and become someone that could help others, and thus decided to be a nurse, finding the occupation to be quite rewarding for him. He also became a proficient magician before entering college, around the same time he got Valhelm, and ever since then he sometimes acted as a tutor to young mages that had the same potential as him in terms of healing spells, as he himself admitted, he was a very poor combatant, neither his body nor his magic being fit for a battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing that he was so disappointed that despite his figure, which according to Minori and a few others, being something any woman would die for to have, still didn't help him find a suitor he could really like. He himself got aware that his body was a lot more well-endowed than regular people, reminders being the big breasts he had when he was just 12, the time when everyone had their mouths wide open they saw him in a bikini or the time when Minori groped him during the highschool days. During the last memory, he began to once again rub his thighs together, enjoying the feelings it produced on his shrinking manhood, until it became a tiny nub, and then the panties themselves seemed to push against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight at that moment, his mind suddenly flashed, as Rias's image suddenly became the focus. Asi was confused as to why did she appear in his psyche right then, and in addition, it seemed like she was whispering his name, although her lip movements looked like they were saying something else. \"Wha... Ria- Ah!\" However the image became the last thing to think about as a virgin flower bloomed between his legs, sending a way of pleasure throughout his body. The shining of the necklace and the the raise of his body temperature also stopped soon afterward, signifying the end of the changes. After a minute of taking deep breaths, the newly minted woman, with her cheeks still a little red, regained her bearings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... It looks like it's finished, whatever that was... Goodness, if anyone would've seen that, I would never have the courage to go out ever again. For someone as old as I am to be acting so indecent at school, and having such naughty thoughts about a student, and my best friend... So shameless...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAki Nijou, the newly appointed nurse of Kuoh Academy was a kind soul that wanted to support other when they needed it and was currently in Kuoh after Minori helped offer her a post at the academy. Reunited with the redhead not long after she gained the position of Principal, she decided to use her medical knowledge to aid the students and to pursue her dream, after an initial struggle to find a post after finishing college. She hoped the students will like her, and allow her to do her job, and after a week of work, she was very thrilled to see how many enjoyed her company. While she couldn't help but feel awkward when both boys and girls, and even some teachers would admire her figure, up until now she had a wonderful time at the school. She was very surprised when she found the city was a place where many Devils resided, but any fear she had towards them disappeared when she found out that some of them offered various services to human customers and tried to combat the ones that were trying to disrupt the peace in the small town. She didn't manage to find the Devils that were helping people but wanted to talk with them, as they seemed to be good souls. She also met Rias Gremory not long after moving in the town. She was a nice person that helped her showed around the neighborhood when Minori was busy, and left quite an impression on her after just one encounter. She met her several times afterward, together with her group, which all looked like polite and kind girls. But there was something regarding Rias that was increasingly enthralling for her with each meeting, soon realizing that she somehow managed to have a small crush on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter brushing away the embarrassment, she shook her head and quickened her pace to Minori's office. She quickly got to the door and knocked at it. \"I just hope she'll not ask to many questions about me being late...\", said the woman to herself as she opened the door.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What happened? Did something came up on the way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... It did. But I am not willing to talk about it, if that's okay with you.\", upon seeing the nurse's attempt to hide her blush, she quickly understood she went through the same thing as her just minutes before, and the redhead nodded in affirmation, still a little red in the cheeks herself. \"... But anyway, did you find out what that spell was all about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. I've looked around, but nothing I found really indicated to be anything else than a defensive spell made to confuse the enemies. Other than those weird feelings we got ever since that light hit us, there really wasn't anything harmful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. It was a little strange how it affected us, given our high endurance to enchantment type magic, but I suppose the caster was quite powerful. Maybe it could've been worse, but I suppose our resistance nullified part of the effects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it. Speaking of strange though, why did someone try and steal the necklace from you? I was thinking maybe it was for selling on the black market. Is it really that valuable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not. While the gem is quite valuable, it's not very expansive, nor is it a magic item. It is a little strange to consider a jewelery thief would go as far as to put a spell like that on it just to ensure no one takes it if they lose it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of makes sense. Also, if they tried to steal it, they did a pretty bad job doing it. It was right in the middle of the hallway, so it was impossible not to see it. To lose it like that must mean they have zero talent at robbing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed. Also, nothing else seemed to be missing from my office either, so maybe it wasn't a thief...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't think it really matters then.\", said Minori as she put her hands behind her head. \"Whether a mage did everything as a prank, or put a spell on it by accident and left, since we're both okay, then everything's fine. We'll just need to look around for anyone that could've did it to ensure it doesn't happen anymore. Who knows, maybe one of magicians that got their pummeled by us wanted to seek revenge and did a horrible way to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure are as relaxed as ever. But I suppose you are correct. It's not like dwelling on it would help, if we are physically and mentally fine... Although maybe we should use Valhelm to ensure there are no other lingering effects...\", said Aki as she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way... Did you get any funny thoughts about that Gremory girl during the whole thing?\", inquired the principal as the nurse raised her eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rias Gremory-san? Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At one point I felt like I was owing her something. I didn't understood what that was all about, but strangely enough, I only felt that way at the beginning, not at the end, when the headaches got stronger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I did at some point have a few strange thoughts regarding her too at one point. But nothing too important...\" Aki knew she was lying, given that the entire situation bolstered her feelings towards the student quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt she is involved in this mess, but we should keep our eyes on her just in case she somehow was the target of the magician.\", said Minori, to which Aki agreed. After that, her face got a little red again as she asked: \"Other than that... Were there any other strange thoughts that came out of nowhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh... No, there weren't... Did something different happen to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no... Just a few random things, nothing too major.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were too embarrassed to realize the other was blushing just as hard as they were. Their feelings for one another began to blossom during the transformation, and as they were unable to wash away the new feelings they had. Aki still had a thing for Rias, but it was quite obvious that she and Minori now had a crush on each other right now. They were about to say anything about their emotions, but just then, they shook their heads. It was too early to start thinking about romance based on a few new thoughts. They both saw each other as attractive, but only just now their feelings took a turn towards potential love. And since they both are still looking for a potential male suitor that would satisfy them, they decided to put these emotions aside, at the very least until they both sure that they were genuine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... In any case, we came today to train our magic, correct? I say we do just that to take our minds from this incident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? I never thought you would be so eager to train Aki. But I agree. Let's just put this whole thing behind us and have some fun now, when there's no students around to us practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Just try to keep your hands to yourself this time. You know you like to tease me quite a bit when we're alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, sure. I am just showing how much I like spending time with my best friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly... Still, I appreciate your company too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women smiled at each other as they both headed outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It took Azazel one phone call to realize something was obviously wrong with Issei and Yuuto. When he called Ise to ask about the meeting spot to talk about the enchanted necklace, he instead got to talk with a woman named Aki Nijou, who happened to the school's new nurse. She told him she called him for anything, and given she didn't mention anything about the spell, he figured she might not know anything about it. Things got a little weirder when Minori Rokujou, the substitute principal got in the conversation and she asked him what he doing. The fact that the empty post was occupied so fast after the headmaster told only the staff members about his temporary retirement was shocking, and judging by the voice, she seemed quite young at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe awkwardness of the conversation aside, as he triple checked and saw that the number he called was indeed Ise's and when Minori told him her number during their talk and saw it matched Yuuto's the alarm bells started ringing. He checked a few profiles on his custom-made phone and when he saw Minori and Aki's pictures and history, he immediately remembered the two as characters in a show the future Harem King showed him once. As strange as it was to have two fictional people to be real was, the usual grin he would have when thinking about meeting such beauties was nowhere no be seen, as he also found out that both of the boys were no longer part of Kuoh's academy students, and their records seemingly vanished, he could only sigh in exasperation at the situation: Issei and Yuuto must've become Aki and Minori respectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the side, Rossweisse, who listened to the conversation and helped in the search, was visibly mortified of the realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What is to be done about this? A-Are Ise-kun and Yuuto-kun going to be okay...?\", she asked in slight panic, to which the Fallen Angel realized her great worry regarding Ise's condition especially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not sure, but I am starting to get the picture. Remember that group of magicians that we repelled not that long ago? One of them had these items which resembled some of the things you see in TV shows like swords, potions, guns and so on... I think I recall the necklace that Ise talked about to be in his possession at some point. I am not sure how he found it, but it's possibly it affected both of them as it was probably activated by their magical signatures. Wouldn't have expected to turn them into women though. I guess our little culprit may be as perverted as the kid is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? So it's a type of body-alteration spell that also affects even reality?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't go so far, but it is a possibility. Fortunately, I doubt it is something that's outside your area of expertise. It was made by a regular magus, so maybe the effects aren't as strong. Given that they're both Devils maybe mitigated the effects, which means they should still have the Evil Pieces at the very least inside them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... Then I would probably be able to make a counter-spell. Yes, an analysis if the necklace should give me all the information I need.\", said the Valkyrie as her confidence slowly returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The problem is to cooperate. Since the show had magic elements in it, they might be magicians, and if they follow the plot of the story, then whoever Kiba became might pose an issue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Then we need to enlist Rias-sama's help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most likely. In case things go south, we should have the whole party. Anyway, once find out what happened to Ise... I guess we both know how they would react...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right... I too am very worried about this, but I will manage to keep my composure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just hope the rest will as well. I can already see Akeno crawling at the walls and Irina, Asia and Ravel freaking out completely while Rias tries to think of an idea to murder the magician... I sure didn't expect this weekend to go like this. Man, just rewriting so many people's memories after this will be such a nightmare. Maybe we can have Aki and Minori somehow stay in the world to prevent that from happening...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he called Rias and told her and the rest of the girls what happened, they immediately gave out such a loud \"WHAT?!\", that made Azazel and Rossweisse flinch. The Valkyrie seemed to be able to control herself at least for now, but judging from the reactions of the group, the Cadre knew that it would be quite an eventful weekend without a doubt. And he also hoped the boys not to remember anything, for their own sanity's sake, especially the Oopai Dragon's... And if that happened, this whole situation to be a secret took to the grave.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His pants had been torn to ribbons as a large ass and smooth thighs were now visible to all.

His \"Little Issei\" slowly shortened as it was consumed by the headband's power. His balls had formed a new pair of ovaries as his member was only two inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei, in a haze of arousal, quickly brought his hand down to push the remainder of his manhood into his new womanhood, she let out a sensual moan as she released for the first time as a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MI-MISS LUCIFUGE?!?!\" Sons screamed in complete surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Sona could say anymore, her thoughts froze as a spell was placed on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I did that...How disgraceful\" Issei(?) said in shame while maintaining her hold over Sona's thoughts.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a normal day in school, Issei began to head toward the club room knowing full well that he would be seeing his precious president. As he was opening the door ready to be greeted by the rest of the club member, he quickly noticed that what lied before him was only Rias setting at her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias was able to notice Issei entering the door knowing that she wasn't expecting any other visitor, which could only assume it was Issei. \"Oh Issei, good afternoon,\" she greeted him as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei was still confused as to why Rias was the only one present. He asked the only obvious question, \"Uhh... Bucchou, where are the other?\", starting to get a little worried. \"Did something happen while I wasn't here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias gave a small little laugh not surprised by the question, \"Oh Issei, there is nothing to worry about. The other just left to their houses since this week has been fairly quite. It just you appeared a little late for the announcement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei was relived that nothing bad happened, but also a bit embarrassed of the little comment made by Rias for his lateness. \"Does that mean that I also get to go home?\" He was both a bit sad that he wouldn't be able to spend some time with Rias, but also a little glad since now he had some time for himself and be able to catch u with some lewd magazines and what not. After the whole deal of dying and being reborn as demon really took a huge toll on what free time he had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it would appear so. Unless you wanna spend some alone time with me?\", she said smiling while perking up her breast ever so invitingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sexual pose Rias gave quickly made Issei blush deep red, \"I...um...I mean...if you wouldn't-\", trying his best to convey his feeling bit with no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, whatever fantasy Issei had in mind about this alone time with Rias was tarnished as to Rias had something else in mind. \"Actually, I would like you to take a look at this,\" pointing at what to appear to be a necklace laying in Rias' desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity overtook Issei wondering was it could be. At first glance it looked to appear to be a simple jewelry, but Issei knew full well that the world he know lived in, that necklace was no ordinary necklace. \"A necklace?\", unsure on how else to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, apparently this was sent to me from my mother saying how it could be more in use for me instead of her,\" Rias responded to Issei's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhh yes, Issei knew full well who Rias' mother was. Issei remember last time he saw her. Her luscious body, her big bouncy boobs, that perfect body figure. Issei just could resist imagining lewd things about especially since she look just like her daughter. And thus, Issei would know Rias' mother as the mother of all mothers. \"And..uh..what does it exactly do?\" trying to push his thoughts away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias took notice of the face Issei was making, but decided to ignore it and continue on her explanation, \"As what she has told me about the necklace, who ever wears it  would be transformed into the last person who was wearing it\", she continued, \"I think this power could be very useful in mission which revolves around stealth and such. However I haven't test it yet which is why I want you to put it on and test it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why would I wear... wait... better yet if I do wear it, who am I going to become\", Issei said unsure where this was leading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing like that, as far as my mother has told me, no one has worn it yet, so you would be the first. I want you to wear it so the necklace gets your copy stored in it so that for tomorrow we can test it out too see if it actually works,\" Rias explain to Issei hoping it would make sense to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I mean if Bucchou says it's all fine, then I got nothing to worry,\" Issei knew that he had nothing to fear as he would do anything for Rias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go then\", Rias hands him the necklace, \"this shouldn't take more and a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei grabs the necklace nothing the red shiny jewel in the middle. He then moved the necklace towards his neck, as moments later it was done. At first nothing happened, which made Issei think that whatever the necklace did has already done it. However, moments later the necklace began to glow, which then started to expand and envelope Issei. At first both Issei and Rias were not worried about the light show since they thought that it was all part of the process for the necklace and that it would stop just after a few seconds, but that was not the case.</span></div></div>",

Currently it was just him at home, as the girls were currently busy at the moment. Apparently, after the Rating Game with Sairaorg and the battle with Cao Cao, Rias and the rest of her Peerage were quite busy with various requests. Issei somehow managed to finish most of his word, thanks to Ravel's help, but he was getting quite tired recently, as he also had to study for school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man... I'm beat.\", sighed the Pawn as he slouched on the sofa, not even bothering changing from his school uniform, only taking off his blazer. \"I didn't think I would get to be so busy... I wonder if Rias dealt with this before. Well, she had to at least one time, but she seems to be doing quite well, energy wise... Wait a second... Asia, Xenovia and Irina had the same schedule as me, and also had devil and angel work to do as well, but for some reason they didn't look tired at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remembered that the Church Trio weren't nearly as beat up as he was, which was a little strange, especially for Asia, who doesn't have as much stamina as the rest of the group. Rias, Akeno and Koneko also seemed to be quite energetic as well, despite everything had needed to be done for the ORC, for school and the devil missions they got. Kiba and Gasper also seemed pretty okay, but he knew it was more because the former knew to more efficiently and the latter took things at his own pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder where they got all this energy? Did they learn a new spell from Rossweisse-san to help them? She also looked okay, but I don't think they wouldn't tell me if it was that... Hold on, what was that thing Akeno-san said about the milk they bought?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei got up and went towards the kitchen as he recalled a conversation between Rias and Akeno, with them talking about how they drank some milk and felt reinvigorated. He initially thought it was an exaggeration, but he then realized they might've bought it from the Lilith, which would've made a lot more sense. While he didn't ponder much of it at the start, he now opened the fridge to see if there were more bottles left to have one for himself. Fortunately, there was one left in the corner. He picked it up and started to read the labels on it about its effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Really? Gives you energy and vigor after you drink this, and the effects are amplified if you take a nap? That's awesome! It does have a few ingredients I haven't heard about, but I guess they are specific to the devil world. But...\" He then read a red piece of text on it which confuse him. \"\"It is to be consummated by women only\". Why? I mean, it's not poisonous if they can drink it. Why can't guys take this? Whatever, I doubt anything bad will happen. It can't be worse than Sensei's projects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took the lid off, and after a quick sniff he started to drink down the bottle. The taste was a little sweeter than he expected, but he enjoyed it anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that was good... The girls should've told me about this, I don't know why they didn't. And nothing happened yet. So much for that warning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe threw the empty bottle in the bin as he went back to the sofa, as he laid down, trying to sleep a little to see the effects of the milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how will I feel after I wake up? Most likely amazing, if I am to believe the label. But still, this kind of reminds of that show... What was it called again? I know it had this really weird way to power yourself up if you drink breast milk... It's such a stupid idea, but then again, I am the Oopai Dragon. I hope this wasn't breast milk or anything like that... She show was kind of strange, but that Tomo girl really was a looker, with those oopai... I wonder if they are as big as Rias's. Well, I guess I have plenty of time to imagine how big they were while the girls come back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he tried to fall asleep, he started to remember the girl named Tomo. Not only did she had an amazing figure, and the purple hair gave her an unique look. While she was physically as weak as someone could get, she had a really sweet personality, which combined with her childishness and innocence made her look like a more absent-minded Asia. As his lids started to feel heavy, Issei started to think how it would be if she was real...</span></div></div>",

Issei tried for another ten minutes to fall asleep, but all of a sudden, he didn't feel as tired as he did before. Confused, he woke up, pondering on why was this happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's strange... Is this because of the milk? I didn't know it had such a quick effect... Then again, if it from another world, I guess it does make sense more or less. But... I don't feel brimming with energy like it said on the label.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the tiredness from before was now mostly gone, he didn't feel as refreshed as he thought he would. It was more like the sensation of him already being well-rested, but forgot to drink his coffee. He was still a bit groggy, but the slight sleepiness from before was now gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it work the same for Rias and Akeno-san? They and the others felt a lot more energetic, but I guess this means the effect comes later, right? But if this wakes you up like that, why would it say to sleep? It's more like an energy drink more than milk if you think about it. Well, it's a bit of shame I couldn't dream about... Huh? Why can't I recall what I wanted to dream about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly enough, Issei couldn't remember why was he getting so excited to dream, as he couldn't say anymore what was he imagining before laying down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this a side effect? I think Akeno-san said the bottles were in a box before, so I guess they threw it away, as it was just the bottle there. Is that why it wasn't recommended for men? But, if it's just short-term amnesia, I guess it's okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up, doing a few stretches, but when he did, he felt like something was amiss with his body, but he brushed it off quickly, not paying much attention to the sensation too much. He then sat back down on the couch, as he turned on the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might as well watch something until Rias and the others come back. Too bad the shows I usually watch are not at this hour, but there should be something interesting on one of the one hundred channels we have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then start to channel surf, until he would find something that would catch his attention. But as he did, his body lost all the hair it once had, except for the one on his head. Speaking of which, his mane became a lot smoother and silkier as it gradually started to lose its spikiness. The weird sensation from before reemerged for a brief second, but it wasn't directed at his hair, but rather his figure, especially his chest. But just like before, he didn't ponder too much, focusing on pressing the buttons of the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the thoughts he had prior to his attempt to rest, everything that had to do with not just Tomo, but the show she was in was erased from his mind. But since he now forgot about it, he didn't consider trying to remember anymore, thinking it was just a mere side effect of the milk.</span></div></div>",

I know that this isn't the usual time to watch TV, but there has to be something I like...\", sighed Issei as he skimmed through the channels. He passed some news reports, a few baseball or football games and some of the soap operas his parents would usually watch, but none of the above drew his attention. But as he went through more channels, his preferences slowly started to shift, as he skipped a game review and a rock concert, something he would usually watch, without thinking much of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, his clothes started to tighten around him, especially his pants, which caused him a little bit of discomfort, but he didn't seem to mind it too much. Also, his white socks, started to grow as their material became a little softer as they crept to the middle of his calves, becoming crew-length socks, similar to the ones Rias wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another minute of searching, he stopped at a documentary about seals. Issei had nothing against watching documentaries, but he would rather do it if he had to for school or for another reason, rather than watch regularly. But he stopped just when the show started to show how baby seals are being nursed by their mothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww....\", gushed Issei when he saw the baby being breastfed. He was a boy, but he had to admit that the scene was quite endearing. \"I wasn't always a sucker for stuff like this, but this is pretty adorable, I am not going to lie. That baby is so cute! And the way it drinks milk is so cute!... Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped when he realized his mannerisms were somewhat similar to how Asia would react if she would be shown something like what he was watching. This was so against his normal behavior, that he got a little concerned about why he acted the way he did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did I sound like a girl? That sounded so weird coming out of my mouth... I think I should hide this from the girls. Xenovia and Akeno-san will tease me no end if they would hear me right now. I should see if there's something else...\" He was about to change the channel, when he saw the small seal being nuzzled by its mother, which made him unconsciously gush without him noticing. \"... But I don't want to spend more time on trying to find something interesting and I this is quite nice already... so I guess I might as well see it to the end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile continuing watching the show, Issei tried to ignore the small tingling sensation that he felt on his feet as they shrank down, becoming quite petite, which made his socks fit them better They also got a pedicure, making his nails trimmed and a little shiny. But the callousness they once had was now gone, looking almost like Issei never actually did much effort with them before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of that, as he continued to watch the seal family interact with each other, he continued to act in a manner which would be unnatural for him, gushing and giggling at times, as he got a bit more emotional in the process as well. There was also something in the way the mother acted that stuck with him, but he couldn't figure out at the moment what exactly it was, so he decided to figure it out later and continue enjoying himself with the show.</span></div></div>",

I think I might have found a soft spot for small animals. I wonder if the girls would like stuff like this. Asia and Koneko-chan might want to see it if I show it to them. Maybe Rias and the others will watch it if I ask them nicely. But who wouldn't like small baby animals anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he giggled, his hands shrunk down, the same way as his feet as they become delicate, and losing their strength in the process. His hair also continued becoming silkier as aside from losing its usual spikiness, their ends also started to turn a bit wavier as well. And yet Issei was completely unaware of any of this, instead still feeling like his body was supposed to look different than the way it was at the moment, yet he couldn't place his finger on what was wrong, so he didn't think too much of it right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... The girls are quite late though... I wonder if something happened. Then again, they went shopping at the mall, so it might take a while. Maybe I should've asked them to go with them and pick some cute clothes... I mean cool! Jeez, where did that come from?\", pondered the teen, correcting himself. \" Hearing myself saying things like \"cute\" doesn't really suit me, does it? What do you say Ddraig?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe expected the dragon to answer him, but was bothered by the fact that he didn't hear any replay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ddraig? Are you okay...\" His voice cracked a little at the end, raising in pitch a bit, making his voice slightly higher, but just like before, he didn't notice this. \"That was weird. I hope I am not getting sick or something.\", said Issei to himself with a higher pitched voice. \"I wonder why Ddraig isn't answering though... Well, he may be just sleeping, so I shouldn't bother him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was getting a little dismissive of the entire situation with Ddraig, instead focusing on his earlier thoughts. He was slowly getting a little more air-headed, as despite him not getting any dumber, he was starting to have a slightly less mature thinking process. Currently, it wasn't anything too noticeable, but eventually, this will become a more prominent trait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Should I call Rias and ask her when she will come?... But she could arrive any moment though... Hmm, what should I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Issei was pondering with his cell phone, in his hand, his pants started to crawl up his legs, as they became smaller, while not losing their tightness. As they retreated from his calves, showing now his longer socks, the material also started to soften, as they lost their pockets. Just like his pants, his T-shirt also got tighter on him as well, as its sleeves started to vanish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My clothes are a bit tight. Should I ask Rias to buy me something bigger? I hope I am not getting fat or anything... Maybe I should check the closet and look for something else to change into...\" Just as he was about to get up, a sound snapped him from his thoughts.</span></div></div>",

When looking to see who came, Issei's face brightened as he greeted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Iseimo. Thank you. I hope we didn't left you waiting for too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all tried to find something to buy, but Irina took a bit too long when we went to look for shoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xenovia, that's mean! You also spent a lot of time looking for a pair of sneakers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't that much. I found something interesting on TV, so time didn't pass too slow. It was something Asia and Koneko-chan would love to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? What was it about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asia, senpai can tell us after we put the clothes in the closet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh. I'm sorry, I forgot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it Asia. I also tend to forget things from time to time.\", said Iseimo playfully, as he stuck out his tongue a bit. While he did that, his face became a lot softer, as it took a rounder shape. Also, every single stand of hair he had on his body other than the one on his head fell down, leaving his skin smooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think that's really something to be proud of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe... Wait. Are Ravel and Rossweisse-san not here?\", asked the boy, seeing that two of the girls that usually resided with him to be missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rosseweisse-san went to school to talk with Azazel about a private matter, and Ravel was called by Riser and had to head home for a bit, but she said she will come home before dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... It's kind of a bummer that not everyone is here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Iseimo, we will surely fill up your time, now won't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akeno... Don't rile him up. And you know we and Koneko must study to not fall behind. Iseimo and the other already had their tests and we were busy until recently with our missions, so we need to recover lost time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But still... It's not like it's going to take too much, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah... What will I do with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone sans Rias giggled at her sigh, with none of the girls finding odd that Iseimo was laughing the same way they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Iseimo. We will hold you company, won't we Asia, Irina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. We just need to put the bags away, so just wait for us a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls smiled at their love interest's cheerfulness, as they all went do their rooms, while he went back to wait for them on the couch. He was a bit dismayed that Rias, Akeno and Koneko would be busy for a little while, but was nonetheless happy that they were home. But there was something that still nagged at him a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did Rias say my name wrong? I feel like she did, and the others did say it the same way she did... Nah, I might be wrong, and I just didn't hear it right. And asking them about it would be silly... Well, I am sure it's just me, so now worries there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he waited for the Church Trio to come back, his calves buzzed a little as all the muscle mass they had vanished, leaving them leaner and more shapely, but a lot weaker. If Iseimo would have to run right now, he would find himself winded a lot faster.</span></div></div>",

Until the president and Akeno-san finish studying for tonight, I was thinking maybe we should play for a bit. It's been a while since we last had a gaming session.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kind of knew she would pick something like this, but I am not going to lie, she somehow roped me in, and now I am a bit of a gamer myself.\", said Irina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What game are we playing?\", asked Iseimo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one of our favorite fighting games. One of our classics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Can I skip then? I am not really good at them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry Asia, I kind of forgot that you don't usually play something like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a problem. I'll spectate if you don't have anything against it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about about it Asia. I also wanted to play a bit, so I am all up for a few matches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIseimo's reply made Xenovia smile as she readied the console. But as she did that, he noticed something curious. His game equipment was usually black with red highlights, but this time it was a plain dark-blue color. He found this to be a little odd, but he thought she may have received another model from Azazel, so he didn't ask about it for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, his pants passed his knees and were now resting around his thighs. But the changes didn't stop there, as the color transitioned to burgundy as a white line appeared near the end of his pant legs. In addition, his now tighter shirt became completely sleeveless while its neckline plunged a little bit as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina and Asia stood on the sidelines, while Iseimo and Xenovia each took their controllers to pick their characters. It was a game the two were familiar with, though it was a little bit more difficult than normal games. Still, the two enjoyed to play it regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So best out of three for starters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two started their match, and from the start, Iseimo was getting an advantage. While Xenovia did get better, there was still quite a big gap between the two. But as the match continued, Iseimo was starting to get distracted by his fingernails growing out and gaining a manicure, his slimmer hands becoming even daintier than before. Despite winning the first round, his arms were now getting thinner and thinner, losing all the muscle mass it once had, making them look a lot more frail. In addition, Iseimo was starting to make more mistakes, making Xenovia slowly catch up to him. In the end, he still won, but his gaming skills were slowly starting to dull without a doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a close one, huh Iseimo? But I won't lose this time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe... Let's see if you're up to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they could start playing again, he started to slowly lose his more perverted demeanor. The times he was ogling the girls' breasts were becoming a little stale and confusing for him, as he didn't see that much relevance in the act itself. But that didn't make him see them in a less positive light, in fact he started to get a few playful, and slightly naughty thoughts regarding the girls' chests...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The second match started similarly to the first, with Iseimo managing to get in a good couple of hits, and Xenovia already on the defensive. But after ten seconds, Iseimo was slowly starting to lose his focus, making errors, which not only made him drop the combos, but also allowed Xenovia to launch a counterattack whenever she could. This was in part because he was slowly getting less interested in the game. While he didn't outright think that it was boring, he found himself not as interested in it as before, given by the fact that he was bit by bit forgetting the combos and special moves his character was supposed to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other reason was because he was having a hard time concentrating because his thighs were starting to thicken, crushing his groin the more they grew. This also felt somewhat arousing, making him stifle a moan as he tried not to make any noise. On top of that, his pants lost all of their pockets as their legs began to fuse together, as a small patch of white frills formed at their bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Iseimo managed to somehow win by spamming a few attacks. When the second round started however, all the momentum he had at the beginning was now gone, as Xenovia continued her relentless assault from the previous fight while Iseimo kept making mistakes that always put him at a disadvantage. Along the way, he also began to feel frustrated over his mistakes, more so than usual. This, combined with the arousal he was feeling down below made him lose the second round, pushing the match for one more battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Iseimo? Already losing?\", asked Xenovia teasingly, to which he answered back with a pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even close!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final round started, and like before, the Pawn's mistakes kept piling on, while the Knight went on the offensive and it was now his turn to be at the receiving end of some extended combos. He managed to launch some pretty good counters, but the small wave of arousal kept distracting him, as his thighs lost all of their muscles, as a layer of fat, made his legs look a lot more eye-catching, but also a lot weaker compared to before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't notice how his height decreased a little, making him now slightly smaller than Xenovia and Irina. In addition, his shoulders rounded themselves out, disrupting his focus even more for a couple of seconds. After another eight to ten seconds, the battle was over, and the blue haired girl emerged victorious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Now we're even!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You play way too aggressive Xenovia!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that's supposed how you're supposed the game, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be fair... You are a bit too engrossed in playing at times though. It's kind of like when you draw your sword, you know?\", said Irina, as Asia also added:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are kind of similar to Koneko-san sometimes. You were really focused back there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't say... I was never an avid gamer, but I guess I may get a bit enthusiastic...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I can win if you'll play like this. It's not a tournament.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Iseimo. I promise to take it easier this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\"</span></div></div>",

We'll wait for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then stood up and left for the toilet, not realizing he was now walking by placing a foot in front of the other. This made his hips shake a little bit, even if they weren't all that big. He also didn't notice that his pant legs continued to merge, making his legs be closer to one another. Once inside, after taking off his pants and underwear, instead of standing up, he sat down on the seat, thinking it was normal for him to do such. As he did his business, he could feel that the pressure wasn't exactly disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's strange... Did I eat something bad? I did drink that milk, so maybe that was the cause? But did it say it gives stomach aches? I don't remember...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he sat down, Iseimo's waist was slimming down considerably. His toned body gradually vanished, as everything that resulted after his training with Tannin was now replaced with a still slim, but weak physique. Every muscle that was put on either disappeared or was replaced with fat, which began to accumulate around his hips and rear, as they started to grow out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite all this, Iseimo only felt pleasurable sensations that made him feel batter, closing his eyes as he enjoyed how his former toned core was reduced to an abdomen, who despite remaining more or less flat, had a small layer of pudge, that was still being compressed. He could feel himself losing strength, but it was starting to feel natural for him to be weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't recall the times he trained to improve his body anymore and instead he remembered practicing magic with Rias and Rossweisse instead. He also remembered having troubles doing so due to his scatter-brained tendencies that sometimes appeared without a good reason. There were times where his attention span was extremely low or his focus was somewhere else, if there wasn't a necessity for him to concentrate. Even if his grades didn't change, it was being solidified for Iseimo to be acting like an innocent kid, and that while it exasperated the girls sometimes, it was nonetheless something adorable at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the pressure started to fade away, but despite this happening a good amount of time after he finished, Iseimo didn't question it, as he liked the entire process anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That felt good in the end. I wonder what caused it... Well, I for sure don't mind if it comes back. It was a little unpleasant at first, but then it was great.\", giggled the boy in a more childish manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he pulled up underwear, he noticed he had much more difficulty in doing so, due to his bigger proportions. As for his pants, as soon as he pulled them up, he found that instead, they had become a skirt identical to the ones the girls were wearing,the signature clothing item of the Kuoh Academy female students. He however enjoyed the feeling of wearing it instead of getting scared or concerned. He liked how his legs now felt a lot more free and thought that the design was cute, yet mature at the same time.</span></div></div>",

And yet, neither the hairless skin, the rounder face or the scrawnier arms were the things that he found different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My hair... It doesn't look right, does it? It looks a bit weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then took a hairbrush that was on the sink, that looked quite a bit more girly than the usual ones the the other occupants would have. It was also a purple color, which wasn't a particular color associated with any of the girls. But Iseimo didn't bother to think about it, as he believed that the brush belonged to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he fixed his hair, his mane immediately smoothed and grew out, as it became quite wavy and with some of his ends curling up as well. On top of that, the color of his roots seemed to darken the more he brushed it, as a faint hue of purple starting to overtake the brown. When he finished, a fifth of his hair was now purple as now longer bangs framed his face. It also reached to around his shoulders, but didn't fall any lower than this. Iseimo was now a lot more satisfied with his hair, but still thought that something was missing. Before he could ponder what it was, he noticed something else near the place he took the brush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's right. I forgot to put my ribbon on. I wonder why Xenovia or Asia didn't say anything about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ribbon was simple in design, white with a slight shade of lilac. He styled it up in his hair, with the bow on his right side. Looking at himself again, Iseimo was now pleased with the way his appearance was. He still felt that there was something that should be different, but he decide not to let it bother him for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, his T-shirt started to rise up from below, starting to reveal a bit of his waist, as the material began feeling a bit more soft than usual, losing the usual roughness it once had. His skin also lightened up and became a bit paler, as the times where he spent time outside training disappeared from his head, and was instead replaced with him going outside for a few walks, the rest of the time being spent inside his house, at a shop, or going to the local church, something he wanted to do, yet after becoming a Devil, he wasn't as fortunate as to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIseimo however didn't notice any of this, and instead he was concerned with something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did I leave my shirt open? It looks weird now being buttoned up... Not to mention it would be a little embarrassing to walk outside looking like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed off his shirt, unaware that his top underneath was still growing smaller or that the shirt itself was a little bit tighter on him. He still didn't know why he felt a little bloated before, and wanted to ask Rias or one of the other girls abut the milk, but he thought that he should ponder about this for later, as the strange feeling disappeared and he didn't want to worry the group with a simple stomach ache. After taking one last glance in the mirror, and giggling a bit, pleased by the way his hair now looked, he went downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On the way back, Iseimo's previous excitement of playing video games dwindled even more, no longer thinking that they were as entertaining as before, but he still found them fun, albeit not as much. Once Xenovia and the others saw Iseimo return, they broke from their talk, welcoming him back. They didn't think his new walking style to be any different than usual, despite the fact that his hips and rear shook a bit more than they did when he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Isemo, are you ready for the final battle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make it sound a lot more serious if you say it like that Xenovia-chan.\", replied the boy, not noticing the different name he was called again, or that his speech pattern became more childish and feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I usually take these games seriously. Maybe you should as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but I think I'll pass. You know you are nine times out of ten beating me, with no chance of me winning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows? Maybe today is one of your lucky days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to play if you don't want. You know Xenovia is a little too enthusiastic at fighting games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Irina-chan, but I think I'll play anyway. It's not like there's anything to lose, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit! Now let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Isemo sat down again, and took the controller, but this time picked a different character than before. With his current gaming skills and mentality, he should be grateful if he would find a fighting style that has a chance to beat Xenovia, than just fight with one character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game started and despite a valiant effort by landing the first few hits, Isemo was quickly losing the match. There really wasn't any plan in advance, he would either try to spam a move that would prove effective at first or land a lucky counter, but other than that Xenovia would usually dominate. He was once again distracted however, this time by his back feeling a little stiff, so he tried to reposition himself on the sofa. But as he did, his spine now arched, pushing his chest and rear a bit more. The round ended, without surprise, with Xenovia's win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Now one more time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not defeated yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second round started, and Isemo used the same pattern as before, without that much success. But the excitement left the swordswoman vulnerable for a brief second, in which he tried to punish her, which made the two combatants now having around the same amount of health. This surprised the girl a bit, and Isemo was starting to feel confident he might have a chance to win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was quickly thrown out the window as he felt a pleasurable sensation coming from his chest. He needed to suppress another moan as he felt his nipples grow wider and more sensitive, his areolae became lighter in color as they too expanded in width. But the peak was reached when his nipples actually inverted, the sensation being besides strange, also a little arousing. This was amplified by the fact that his top's red was fading away, becoming a lighter tone as the fabric continued to soften.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his focus broken, it really was no surprise that Xenovia won the match. But even if he wasn't distracted by his chest, he would've lost anyway, due to the fact that it took her a couple of seconds to recover and nearly destroy the opponent in one combo, as Isemo completely lost almost all of his gaming skills.In addition, despite the pleasant feeling lasting only a few seconds, Isemo felt strangely good after it, and he didn't feel as down about losing the game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I won!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha... I lost...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was no surprise really. But I do remember Isemo-kun asking you to take it easier on him, did he now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forgot, didn't you Xenovia?\", asked Asia a bit awkwardly as Irina was sighed and the blue-haired girl fidgeted a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Xenovia-chan. It was fun either way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Isemo. Next time, let's play something else, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, let's!\", exclaimed Isemo, knowing that playing something not as competitive should be what he would suggest next time they were in the mood for a game.</span></div></div>",

They were mildly surprised to see it was Koneko, who was walking causally up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Koneko-chan? What are you doing here? Weren't you supposed to do your homework?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I finished it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?!

Rias-senpai and Akemo-senpai have more to do, so that's why they aren't finished yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you mention it... Rias-san did say she had to do an essay... But how did you manage to finish so quickly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how to manage my time.\", she answered flatly, which made the others impressed by her, but also feel somewhat overwhelmed by how efficient she was working. \"Anyway, I see Senpai was again beaten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I put up a good fight Koneko-chan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but you are aware that you aren't good at all at these, right? Or do you think you will get better in time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I play them because it's fun, that all. I may not be the best at fighting games, but I am happy if we all are having a great time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. It's good to know that\", said the nekomata with a smile, which was shared with her friend, before sitting on Isemo's lap, which surprised the group by doing so. \"Anyway, I think it's time for a little retribution. Because Senpai lost it doesn't mean I can't beat the winner for him, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you challenging me Koneko? Heh, suit yourself. I wanted to see how good I would fare against you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck Koneko-chan!\", cheered Isemo as the small girl picked up the controller with a grin on her face, while Irina and Asia were also a bit curious to see if Koneko's previous gamer experience would beat Xenovia's talent at fighting games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Koneko sat on his lap, Isemo couldn't help but gush a little at how adorable she looked in her position, given her small stature. It felt a little strange seeing that his thighs were big compared to his junior because she was just a year younger than him, but he felt like this would be a good opportunity to spoil her a bit. However he decided against this, as he didn't her to lose her focus and lose. But he knew a good way to reward her is she won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Isemo's butt and hips continued to expand, getting plumper and plumper by the second, with his pelvis spreading out also contributing in increasing his proportions. Because of this, his boxers were stretched to their limit, making him feel a little uncomfortable, especially around his groin. But this quickly changed, as while his curves kept growing, his underwear started to follow a similar process as his T-shirt, as the fabric softened as the usual red it had began to fade away to the same pale cream color his top was also going towards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsemo did feel like his seating did become cushier than it did a few seconds ago, but he dismissed the thought , as the match was about to start. Koneko also felt like she was now a bit more elevated than before, but when he thought about it, she blushed a bit, without anyone noticing as she picked her character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot how developed Senpai was... But it does feel nice...\" </span></div></div>",

After checking the controls and the special move list, Koneko was ready to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle was a lot more heated than the last match Isemo had with Xenovia, as both were alternating between launching an assault or defending, although it seemed Xenovia to have an edge over the white-haired girl, since she played the game longer than her. During the fight, Isemo, Irina and Asia were were surprised to see how intense the round was, not expecting the nekomata to learn so quickly the mechanics, as she tried to counter the swordswoman every opportunity she had, her precision at doing this being way above average in their opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the battle continued, Isemo's skin paled a little more until it was resembling Rossweisse a little. Most of the time Isemo would spend the time outside was now replaced with him doing similar activities indoors, and instead of the physical training he did before, he now remembered times where he practiced his magic, which was proved by his new physique. In addition, most of the knowledge he learned about the Boosted Gear and the way he learned to fight with it was now limited to trying to offer support from the rear, instead of battling on the front lines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was something that didn't change. Despite his perversion being toned own quite a lot, his love for breasts didn't decrease in the slightest. While his thoughts weren't as dirty as before, he still imagined himself and the rest of the girls, particularly Rias, with Akeno coming not too far behind, in various scenarios where they would bathe together, sleeping together and other similar activities. His love for the girls wasn't gone, but with his more perky and childish mind, it would take a slightly different turn, at the very least least in how he expressed his affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first round ended with Xenovia winning, but Koneko didn't seem phased at all. In fact, a small smile crept on her lips as the second round started. It turns out she used the previous match to analyze her opponent and their strategies and found a way around them, as Xenovia was forced on the defensive, and soon was locked into one of the corners. This was enough for the junior to launch a merciless assault on her, as she won the round without losing half of her health bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad Koneko-chan. But now the real battle is about to begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Let's end it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bit funny how the two of them got so serious, so quickly, don't they?\", laughed Isemo, to which the other spectators giggled a little in approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the final round went on, Isemo could feel that his top underneath his blouse was getting quite tight on him, feeling similar to his boxers in a way. He couldn't understand why, but he didn't want this to prevent him from watching his friends' brawl, so he didn't think much of it. In addition to becoming smaller and tighter on him, the neckline of his former shirt was plunging even more, currently being just below his collarbone, as it starting to shrink around his shoulders as well.</span></div></div>",

She carefully saw what Xenovia could do in the first round and made a strategy to beat her. The second round was a way to see how good it would work against her and how would she respond to it. All this paid off, as she blue-haired girl was losing by a long margin right now, barely being able to land a few blows without being then bombarded by a multitude of attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsemo, and most likely Asia and Irina as well, was impressed a lot by the smaller girl's display of skill and how fast she adapted to the mechanics of the game. He wanted to cheer her on to victory, but he felt like there was something in his throat, and he gently rubbed his neck to make the sensation go away. Unknowingly, this made his Adam's apple shrink away until it completely vanished, evident by how high-pitched his breaths were sounding, but he didn't had time to wonder where the feeling came from as the match was already over. Koneko won with barely any damage on her character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You beat me... I knew you were a gamer before this, but I always thought that the things you and Gasper were playing wasn't anything like this.\", said Xenovia with a defeated sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't. But I gained quite a bit of skill in adapting to a different game, not just the ones I am normally familiar with. That's why-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Koneko-chan, that was amazing!\", exclaimed Isemo in a girl's voice which exuded both childishness and innocence, while hugging the nekomata tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did that, his underwear continued to shrink away along with his shirt, with the former completely losing its legs and the latter now resting to just below his chest, now revealing his softer stomach. He was a bit bothered by how tight said garments were now, but he felt nice wearing them anyway, especially around his chest, as his groin also felt a little good in his tighter confines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was surprised by being interrupted by the hug, Koneko couldn't help but blush a little as she felt how close she was to Isemo. \"T-Thanks Senpai. Now you can release me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry about that.\", said the more feminine boy as he released her junior, with the other girls commenting on his behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure like to hug us a lot, don't you Isemo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a bad thing Xenovia-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. But I think you should limit yourself to doing that just at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I got some pretty strange looks from a few girls at school last time you did this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Why Irina-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Let's say not a lot of people know about our relationship and... I think you get the rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... I see. Got it. I will be careful next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My... Trying to restrict Isemo on his embraces, are we? While I agree that it isn't really common to show this much affection in public, it's not really a bad thing, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing the voice, the group saw who else finished their homework, as the boy's eyes lighted up when he saw who it was.</span></div></div>",

And besides, it isn't that much of an issue, given that Isemo's hugs became something that was seen quite often, and recently, there weren't many voices that thought it would be uncommon for him to so something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter gently picking Koneko up and putting her back on the couch, Isemo ran towards her senior and jumped into her chest, digging his face into her chest, by doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akeno-san! I missed you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my... I was only absent for a few minutes. But if you are so eager to have me next to you, then I will happily comply.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Isemo was hugging the girl, he suddenly desired to have a bust-line as big as her. The reason for wishing that was because of his little fantasies that he kept for himself at the moment and the fun that with ensue by having such a big chest. But the thoughts themselves didn't seem perverted to him in the slightest, only imagining the entertainment that would come out of them more than anything else. It is safe to say that he was becoming quite shameless, even if he didn't realize that in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was a little more time before his wish would come true. Until them, his top now exposed most of his back, as the neckline plunged until it revealed a good portion of his chest, as the material now matched that of his underwear Speaking of them, they shrunk to the point where they hugged his rear and hips tightly, but without becoming uncomfortable for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoneko pouted a little after her senpai left suddenly like that, but sighed when she remembered his usual behavior. The other girls looked at the scene in front of them with various degrees of amusement or slight disappointment of not being embraced, before Asia asked Akeno:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... What do you mean Akeno-san? Weren't we told to show a little more restraint in public?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but Rias and Rossweisse-sensei never said anything about the hugs. I understand that us showing affection to Isemo and vice versa would be a bit problematic, but everyone is used to see him cling to us every now and them. And it's not like they can get mad, can they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\", asked the boy innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...\", said Xenovia as she and the others were a bit unsure by Akeno's statement. \"But speaking of the president, where is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is a bit busy with a few calls. It looks like she was discussing about new missions for us to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again? Didn't we just finished our requests this week?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is to be expected, given all the publicity we've gained recently. I believe she is taking her time trying to convince some of the customers to wait a bit longer and maybe talking with Ravel about the new schedule for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I wanted to see Rias-chan! Why can't those guys give us more free time?\", asked Isemo as he pursed his lips a bit in frustration as his hair changed further, the dark-blue, almost purple now overtaking two thirds of his mane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her darling a little upset, the vice-president smiled a bit slyly as she thought of a plan.</span></div></div>",

It's not like she can refuse you if you ask her politely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... Didn't she say she want some privacy? And is she even finished with her work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Koneko-chan. She was already more or less done when I left. And we won't take too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? So only you are Isemo-san are going?\", asked Asia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Not everyone can go there at the same time, don't you agree? Isemo could go and ask her on her own, but I need to be there and offer some form of support as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls knew that Akeno would have an ulterior motive for taking their love interest away like that, especially Koneko and Xenovia, but since Rias would be there as well it would be a bit of an inconvenience for her, as they won't be alone. And even if she would take him somewhere else, it would be easily for their King to find them when she would leave her room. Despite being a little reluctant, and not knowing what exactly she had in mind, they decided to accept the half-Fallen Angel's suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Isemo was completely clueless about why the other girls were looking at Akeno a little suspiciously, but didn't think too much of it, as he got a little giddy about the prospect of meeting Rias again so soon. Normally, he wouldn't find a brief departure of his lover to mean that much too him, but he was getting strangely excited for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was giggling to himself, his face completely changed as his cheekbones grew higher and his nose and ears became smaller. His lips plumped up a little bit while his eyelashes lengthened and his eyes became bigger. In addition, his hair also became fully purple as there was no sign of brown anymore, as the haircut greatly complimented his new innocent and girly visage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you should go. President is missing all the fun and it doesn't seem really okay to leave her out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She can finish her talks about the next missions later. Maybe I will talk to Ravel or Rossweisse-sensei to find a way to accommodate it to our schedule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I guess we will be taking our leave then. I hope this will not be too much of a problem to you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. I was going to ask Xenovia and Koneko-chan for a few rounds anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? You want to test your prowess against us Irina? I accept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye everyone! Play nice!\", saluted the boy as the three girls started to get into the game, with Asia waving at him before spectating the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Isemo and Akeno went up the stairs, the former asked: \"Why did you say only we will go? We could've brought Asia-chan with us too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Iomo, but there was no need for that. I already know more or less what you want exactly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do. And I'll help you with that, if you will allow me to take part in it as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a small pause as Iomo's testes tingled a little as they began to grow smaller while they were gently starting to get tugged inside of him, before he replied with a grin. \"Sure.

I am sorry, but this will have to be postponed for another time.... I am happy that you understand that sir... Yes, we will keep in touch.\" The talk ended as the crimson-haired president gave a long sigh. It took her a second to notice her two guests as she looked at them with mild surprise. \"Akeno? Why did you come back? And why did you brought Iomo here as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it would be beneficial for him if he asked you to finish your work himself rather than having me trying to make you leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Rias-chan. It's Friday. You don't have to do all the homework now. Let's have some fun! Everyone is already down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe King sighed again as she looked at Akeno. \"So this was your plan? Bring Iomo here and he asks me to come with you? You sure are cunning.\" The black-haired beauty only giggled in response as Rias stood up. \"I was going to come anyway. Those calls were more time consuming than the homework itself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. After what happened with Cao Cao we have been requested more often than before. I didn't think we will get this busy though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not your fault Rias-chan. You should just tell those people that the ORC is on vacation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha... Thanks Iomo. But it's not really so simple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess... So are you coming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I wanted to take a small bath before that... It was a while since I last unwinded, and it wasn't going to take too long-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Than how about Iomo goes to bathe with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias looked incredulously at Akeno, while Iomo was thrilled by the idea. He wanted to spend more time with his lover, and this would be the perfect opportunity to do so. And there was also the bonus that he wanted from the start as well... However he knew Akeno wouldn't suggest something like this on a whim, so he had an idea why she even proposed this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the conversation, his underwear completely changed into a pair of cream-colored panties that outlined a bit of his manhood, while what was left of his shirt finished changing into a bra of the design as the panties, with a few frills on top appearing as well. To finish their look, a red ribbon formed on the front of the panties and in the middle of the bra. Iomo felt for a brief second that the straps of the bra felt weird, before perishing that thought, believing it was perfectly normal. In fact, it felt even better, remembering it was one of the pairs he and Rias bought together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing her friend's shocked expression, Akeno chuckled a little as she continued: \"Isemo said he wants to do a bit more skinship with us, and given that you seem quite bothered of him showing his affection in public, I think this would be a good middle ground. Besides, it has been a while since the last time we bathed together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... You said \"we\". You mean you also want to take part in this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But of course. I don't see what issue there would be in this situation. And given that Azazel made that special jacuzzi for us to test out, this could be a good opportunity to put it to the test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we Rias-chan? Can we?\", asked Iomo full of hope, his puppy eyes pleading for a chance, not even realizing that their color changed from brown to a deep red. He had a feeling Akeno would desire to be part of the fun, and despite wanting a bit more private time with Rias, he nonetheless welcomed her other senpai happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that Iomo was now literally begging for it, Rias couldn't refuse anymore. But given that the others might notice that they would take a bit too long, she had to think whether or not this would be the appropriate time or not.</span></div></div>",

But I suppose it can't be helped at times like these... If only Akeno would let us be alone, it would be much better though...\", she said to herself as the other beauty in the room giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three then went to the bathroom, specifically to a special fairly large jacuzzi made by Azazel, which was custom-made for Sirzecks, but decided to give it to them as a gift. They still didn't know all the features the tub had, and were a little afraid what the features were, but they thought it would be a good chance to test it out and see for themselves. Inviting all the girls to bathe would be out of the equation, as despite being bigger than the usual size, it would be impossible to fit seven people in it, no matter how hard they tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bath was filling up with water, the three started to undress, with girls took a few glances at Iomo's figure without him noticing. Seeing the jiggle of his butt and thighs, the two blushed a bit, finding it strangely tantalizing, as Rias also liked the fact the he was wearing the underwear she picked for him last time they went shopping. As for Iomo, he found himself a little put off by his appearance. The new plumpness of his body seemed normal, but he felt he was lacking in the chest department. While he took off his bra, and saw how flat the area was compared to his senpais, he could only pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not fair that Rias-chan and Akeno-chan have breasts as big as they are. Why can't I have them like them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment he thought that, small pockets of fat began to gather behind his nipples. But that wasn't all, as milk duds began forming in his tiny breasts, as they slowly continued to expand. Also, his testes got pulled up further in his body, and it continued until they were completely inside him. His manhood was the only thing left to be seen, but even after he pulled down his panties, neither him, nor the girls got any sort of reaction upon seeing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they were all undressed, the three went into the jacuzzi. The warm water did wonders for them, as they let gave a pleased sigh went they went in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah... This is life...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds a bit like something an old man would say, but I agree with you on that. It's been too long since I got a good bath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean Akeno? You had one a few days ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but it didn't feel as nice as this. You know why? Because Iomo is here with us now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe... Thanks Akeno-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True... We didn't had a bath together in a while. But I would rather go in the pool downstairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, you said it yourself. You wanted to have some private time, without the others knowing, so here we are.

I thought that staying a few minutes in the tub would be enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? But why didn't you go to the big pool we have to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I did that, the others would wish to join in, and personally I wanted a little bit more quiet. And it would be impossible to go there without being noticed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say that, but aren't you happy that Iomo is also here? I am sure you are delighted that he is joining you, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akeno... You do realize you are here, too, are you not? It can't be called private time if someone else is here as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really get it... But it looks like the two will argue again...\", said Iomo to himself as he observed the girls start up another argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, his breasts now reached large A-cups, but there still plenty of room for them to grow. In addition, a new reproductive system replaced the old one, as his testes became ovaries and a cavity formed inside his abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost all of his memories were now replaced with new ones, while the few that weren't were slightly modified to suit his current form. He was still a devil, still wielded the Boosted Gear and was Rias's servant. But he was now a lot more na\u00efve, childish and innocent than before, a far cry from his initial perverted persona. He still remained quite shameless, strangely enough, but he was now completely unaware of that, as he enjoyed engaging the girls in various intimate activities that were more than just the shows of affection he usually shows at school or in public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd given the current circumstances, he got an idea as to how to have some fun. He went to the corner pressed a few buttons at the edge of the tub. After a few button presses, the girls stopped arguing as the Jacuzzi started to make bubbles. And then out of nowhere, Iomo jumped at Rias's back and grabbed her breasts in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you said you didn't want to wash Rias-chan, then how about we have a little fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Now?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my... It looks like you are a bit more eager today than usual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we are all in a bath. Did you expect me not to do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha... I guess you are right. But rather than just playing a bit... How about we service you instead for a change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused by Akeno's words, she took his hands from Rias and put them on her own bosom as she pushed him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now... Do you want to take part in this as well? Or do you instead wish to watch from the sidelines?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez... I knew you had a plan in mind... I can't leave you take Iomo like that, so of course I'll join in.\", said the crimson princess as she took one of Iomo's hands and placed it back on one of her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you still have it in you, Rias. And since you decided to add a few things to the bath, might as well add a few more, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he didn't understood completely how he ended up the way that he did, as his breasts reached B-cups, as he touched the girls' chests, Iomo started to giggle, starting to get more comfortable with the situation at hand. Especially after the bath made more bubbles as the color changed to a faded pink tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may need to ask Azazel what all these settings are, but for now, let's enjoy ourselves, shall we?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as the water became pink, a faint trace of smoke with the same hue appeared from it. Yet no one noticed, too busy with what were their doing. The girls came closer to Iomo, as they let him gently massage their breasts as in return they started to do the same to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made him moan a bit as this made the growth rate of his breasts accelerated, becoming bigger and bigger with each second, already passing C-cups and getting into the D-cups territory as the increased rate of estrogen coming from his new ovaries made his manhood shrink even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not fair... You are doing it at the same time. How am I supposed to compete?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can consider it a sort of punishment for not knowing when to stop with your hugs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...But to be honest, I think it's better to say we haven't had our chance to do this in a while, and we decided this to be a good chance for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias and Akeno both really enjoyed the whole situation, and didn't seemed to mind that they had to share their time with Iomo together. This was in part because the pink mist, which acted like an aphrodisiac. It was supposed to make the time Sir Zecks and Grayfia had to be more enjoyable, but since they didn't know of the properties of the mist, they didn't think much of it, too preoccupied with Iomo's growing chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Iomo was started to get quite turned on, struggling to get in control. His breasts grew to DD-cups, as he already ceased to consider himself a man at this point. When the tips of his nipples finally got out, and the girls pinched them, after a quick moan, he managed to gather enough strength to stand up and pounce on the two older women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so mean! You just put one of my hands on your breasts as you do all that? I think it's time for a little payback!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then started to massage their breasts as his hands then drifted to caressing the rest of their bodies, particularly their butts and waists, which made the two moan quite a bit. But while Rias was trying to keep a straight face, Akeno was thoroughly happy with the treatment she was receiving as without near-girl noticing, she placed her hands back on his nipples as she started to rub them, albeit more slowly than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIomo was unaware that his breasts grew until they became large E-cups, bordering F-cups, being just a little smaller than Rias's, or that his manhood became barely visible, as it started to get pulled in stronger than before. He was simply delighted to be together with the girls. While he initially he wanted to be just him and Rias, the addition of Akeno didn't make him feel disappointed in the slightest. He took a glance at his chest, and was now pleasingly surprised of how big they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa... I think I forgot how big I was... Well, I am on the same level as Rias-chan, and that's amazing! I may need to be a little bigger though for them to be as large Akeno-chan's... Still, all that can wait for a different time. Right now, I am having lots of fun! I don't think anything could ruin-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, he whimpered a bit as the last vestiges of his masculinity were completely pulled inside him, as the transformation was now complete, fully becoming a girl. But since Akeno believed it was just a sign of stimulation, she didn't stop with her fondling as Rias regained her composure, as she too started to join in the Queen's fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Tomo? Finally reached your limit? It is a bit sooner than I expected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Not at all. I just felt something off for a second, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so. What about you Rias? Are you going to take a break or continue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't talk as if I'm backing out. Tomo is mine, remember? And as such, I won't surrender so easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... I don't want to interrupt... But can we get to that part? If you start arguing again, we'll lose more time.\", said Tomo, which garnered a small laugh fro the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True... I don't want Asia or Xenovia to get suspicious, so I guess we need to go all out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. I am all for it as well. What about you Tomo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am ready! This is the best part anyway!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she said that, with a large grin on her face, she neared her mouth to Rias's chest as Akeno's came close to his nipples as well. What happened next was the way Tomo always wanted things to go whenever she was alone with the girls... Even if she would still want to add some milk to the whole picture as well, she was nonetheless enjoying their \"fun\" together...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

W-What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias suddenly came next to him, on the couch, with a very worried expression as the other girls, including Ravel and Rossweisse, came rushing in as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened Ise-san? Why did you yell like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything all right Ise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-The bath and... you were there and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bath? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you... dream of drowning in the bath?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Dream... No, we played some games, went to the bath together... b-but the entire time I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Was it really that bad of a nightmare to make you have that reaction?\", asked Xenovia. \"I mean... It sounds like something we would usually do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you need to calm down a bit and take a few deep breaths.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei was completely stumped. He couldn't believe everything was a dream. But he saw that the girls apparently just arrived from their shopping trip, as there were bags which were hurriedly discarded from his scream, and they weren't wearing their uniforms, but rather their casual clothes. He knew judging by their reaction and words that everything just happened in his head, but he couldn't understand how his imagination could lead to him turning into a girl. His transformation into Tomo, a character from one of the series he would sometimes watch seemed extremely real, and as much as he wanted to deny, it felt real as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think... I may know what caused this.\", said Rossweisse as she made a quick trip to the kitchen before bringing back an empty bottle. \"Issei-kun, did you by chance drink this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, I did. It said it would make you feel energized after a quick sleep...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that... the milk that guys weren't supposed to drink?\", asked Irina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is. But why aren't boys allowed to take it? It's not hazardous for our health and we drank it plenty of times before and nothing happened.\", added Rias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest, I also was confused at first... But Azazel told me that one of the key ingredients in the milk supposedly makes the dreams of males appear to become more vivid, as well as twisting them into nightmares, or completely change certain aspects of them without the person knowing. It seems like it is sometimes influenced by the last thoughts the man has before going to sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe explanation cleared out the mystery for Issei and the group. Normally such substances would be impossible to be found in the human world, but since since the milk came from the demon world, it wasn't something in the realm of the impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's the reason. I can't really understand why would they sell something like this and put only a label on it though... Still, I am glad it was just that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too... You don't know how happy I am it was all just a dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what exactly did you dream about Ise? It didn't sound like-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't. Ask.\" The answer came so quick and it was so adamant that the girls were taken slightly aback. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Senpai... Was it really so bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just... I don't want to talk about it. It insults everything that is manly about me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It does?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... I just want to forget about it. And don't worry, I'll be okay in a few minutes. You can go ahead and change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were quite confused and worried about Issei's dream, but decided it should be better not to press the subject. Seeing how much of a wreck he was, they didn't want to make him feel worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we'll go change. And please, if we can somehow help you forget about it, just tell us.\", said Rias, as she and the rest went to their rooms after picking their bags, discussing what was the nightmare all about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey partner...\" As Issei was trying to regain his composure after all that happened, Ddraig's voice came from his gauntlet, asking him in a slightly curious tone: \"I didn't manage to see what exactly you dreamed of, but I just wanted to know how bad it was. You said it insulted your manliness, but what does that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'll just say this: I won't drink milk for a while, and I will try to engage in as many activities with the girls as possible... I sure hope they won't ever fall for girls...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I am not sure I understand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just leave at that Ddraig. Any more, and everything will go south in a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... If you say so, I'll stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll stay clear from that show from now on...\", said Issei to himself, making sure his partner didn't hear him. \"As much as I would wish to see Tomo in real life, if that is to happen... I'll pass. It's a good thing it ended before... it got to the point of no return...\", shuddered the boy, fearing how things would have gone if the other girls would have joined Rias and Akeno in the bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Issei stopped watching several of his eroge anime and tried to spend as much time with his harem for the next few weeks, much to the pleasant surprise of the girls. Even Azazel and Kiba couldn't understand what got him so scared, but figured out he shouldn't press the matter as soon as they saw the boy sweat after the subject was brought up. One thing was certain though. Issei will never think of breastfeeding the same way ever again.</span></div></div>",

He laid down on his bed and let out a content sigh. \"Man what a day. . .\" Issei out in happiness as he remember the fun he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Issei.\" He then heard Rias call. He turned and saw Rias in a sexy black nightgown walking towards him. \"B-Bucho!?\" he got out in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could say anything else, Rias suddenly planted her lips on his and when he opened his mouth he slipped her tongue inside. He didn't know how long they were like that, and quite frankly he didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she broke away he saw a radiant smile on her face. \"It might've been accidental, but I'm glad you're here.\" Rias soon admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei's blush didn't go away as he looked at the red haired beauty. \"S-Same here Bucho. . .\" He got out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias in response merely giggled to that. \"Call me Rias <i>Issei-kun</i>.\" She ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei's eyes then widen to that that order. \"A-Are you sure?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias in turn giggled in response. \"Yes Issei-kun.\" She replied as she then began to kiss him once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei in turn gulped to this as he looked at the red haired girl. \"Bu-. . .I mean. . .Rias. . .\" He got out as he blushed. \"I. . .I love you to Rias.\" He finally confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias in turn smiled to that as she hugged the boy with some tears of happiness coming out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two soon enough cuddled with one another and eventually fell asleep together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the night, Issei's leg began to change.

He might not like this situation, but he wasn't going to blame her when she tried to help him. She did only have the best intentions in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Issei's right Asia.\" Rias agreed as she went over and petted the girl's head. \"It was an unforeseen circumstance that no one could have predicted.\" She reassured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do now then?\" Koneko asked. \"Is the vacation off cause of the perv turning into a girl?\" She then added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. . .\" Rias started but then trailed off, not sure wheather to do that or not. \"I don't know for all I know Issei will continue to change even if we do leave this island.\" She revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lose-lose situation. . .\" Xenovia stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So. . .Issei's going to become a girl. . .\" Rossweisse got out as everyone else became depressed the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" Issei responded, getting everyone's attention. \"I'll be fine. I'll just be a girl for two weeks. Now I know what Kiba felt like with the ray gun.\" He then added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias then sighed as she then kissed Issei on the cheek, causing stares of jealousy to appear from the other girls and a blush to appear on Issei. \"That is true Issei, we shouldn't let this get us down.\" She responded.</span></div></div>",

Issei was changing again. His hair grew brighter, and brighter and now seemed to have a faint orange tint to it as it grew slightly longer. \"Uh oh. . .\" She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei however noticed the concern look on the red hair's face. \"Rias?\" He got out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, his hair grew long enough that he could see it in his eyes. \"Huh?\" He got out as he grabbed the back of his hair and felt it growing. \"What the!?\" He soon exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Your hair. . .\" Rias replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is it turning orange!?\" Issei exclaimed in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know!\" Rias replied in a honest manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt might've been because of the costume. . .\" Asia soon suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That. . .would make sense. . .\" Rosseweisse agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXenovia then looked at the black haired queen. \"Satisfied?\" She then questioned in slight annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\". . .Yes I am.\" Akeno admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sped up Issei further change into a female.\" Rias then stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ufufu, oh come now, we all experienced changing into males with the gender bender gun.\" Akeno reminded in a sly tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it's my turn now,\" Issei soon commented as he looked at all the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias in response to that nodded in agreement. \"Yes, a promise is a promise, especially since your transformation was accelerated.\" She replied in a calm manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll let you pick Issei,\" Akeno said with saucy smirk, and Issei couldn't help but smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei's smile soon became perverted as he knew he was going to enjoy this. \"Just let me get out of this and then we can begin!\" He declared as he closed the changing room door.

Heck he looked like he might be going to Kuoh as one of the college students. He had sandy blonde hair and brown eyes. He was handsome enough. No where near as god looking as Kiba, but he was bound to get some girl's attention. He was wearing a black hoodie and jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guy's ready?\" He asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we're ready,\" Issei said and looked at the name tag and saw that his name was Akira.

Not that he could blame him, because he wanted to do the same with Jade's breasts. Their outfits had definitely changed since he last played the franchise and he would say for the better. Just like Issei and Matsuda he loved how much skin they were showing, and their amazing bodies that were on par with Kuoh's own great beauties, Rias Gremory and Akeno Himejima. He smirked as he decided to take the initiative in the fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei was imagining himself squeezing Kitana's melons and let out a perverted giggle. He heard a woman scream in pain, bringing him out of his perverted fantasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!\" Issei yelled, as he watched Kitana fly across the arena as her health dropped, and then get hit by a green boomerang, causing her health to drop even further. Motohama quickly followed up by having Jade use her staff to clobber Kitana, and by the time that the combo was done, Kitana had already lost a third of her health. Issei quickly tried to recover and he managed to get a few good hits in with his special attacks, but failed to win the round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to the three of them, the blue glow reappeared around Issei and his body began to loose the hair on his body below his eyebrows, making his arms, legs, and face smooth to the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cheated!\" Issei yelled, glaring at Motohama.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey not my fault you were distracted,\" Motohama replied, smirking. Issei grumble at his defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Round 2. Fight!\"</b></i> The announcer proclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Who won the next round?)</span></div></div>",

He couldn't allow himself to get distracted by their sexy outfits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitana's black hair had grown longer then the last time he played Mortal Kombat, and was now down to her lower-back. Kitana's outfit consisted of a sexy skin-tight blue top that resembled a bikini with a large window for her massive cleavage, and a majority of her back aside from one at her neck and a strap across the back of her back. The blue garment that she wore to cover her secret garden's front was like a loincloth, while the back of it was like a bikini bottom, that showed off her sexy ass. She wore blue high heeled thigh high boots, blue arm guards on her forearms, blue bands on her biceps, and a face mask that covered her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade's outfit was similar to Kitana's. Her hair went down to her bodacious butt and and she had dark caramel skin. She had a scroll in her hand that could grow into her staff. Like Kitana she wore a green face that covered her mouth. She wore a sexy skin-tight green outfit and black outfit that left little of her cleavage to imagination, a green loincloth that covered her garden. The blackout didn't leave much of her butt to imagination and acted like a thong. She wore green arm-guards, and two golden bands on her biceps, and green knee pads with high heeled black boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade charged forward an attempted to his Kitana with her staff, but Issei expected this and had her block it, and retaliated by having Kitana do a punishing uppercut with her war fan, that sent her flying into the air and then quickly followed up with a Square Boost, causing Kitana to jump into the air and fly toward Jade and tackle her, sending her flying. Kitana landed gracefully on the ground as Jade crashed onto it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap!\" Motohama exclaimed when his X-RAY Attack failed. Issei quickly used this opportunity and had Kitana grab Jade. Kitana grabbed Jade's shoulders and pull vaulted herself over Jade and landed gracefully behind her. She then pulled out her war fans and cut them into Jade's back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei quickly had Kitana pull back and then throw her war fans at her. Kitana's war fans flew forward at Jade right as she was getting up, and before Motohama could block with her they collided against her. Issei quickly charged forward `and had Kitana do a Fake Out kick followed by a Pretty Kick, causing Jade to fall onto the ground, defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit,\" Motohame cursed. The green glow appeared around Motohama, and his hair darkened to a dark black as it began to grow longer. It grew longer and longer. All the way down to Motohame's butt. Issei, Matsuda, and even Motohama didn't react to his hair's sudden hair, as if it never happened in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This last one's gonna be mine!\" Issei declared, intending to win the last round. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\"Round 3.

Kitana stood up and managed to get a few good punches into  before Jade Jade rammed her staff into Kitana's stomach, and then throw her across the arena. Kitana recovered and managed to get in a good combo to even the odds, and bring Jade's health down to less then half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade tried to jump over, but Issei quickly managed to stop her, by having Kitana do a high kick. He then followed up by having Kitana do another square boost and fly right into Jade sending her flying across the map. Jade stood and charged at Kitana and did a devastating combo with her staff that knocked her health down to less then half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please work,\" Motohama muttered, as he tried to use Jade's X-Ray Attack again to win the match. Jade charged forward again but Kitana managed to jump into the air and avoid Jade. \"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got you,\" Issei muttered, smirking. Kitana landed behind Jade n quickly did several kicks and punches, dropping Jade's health, and then grabbed Jade again. This time Kitana grabbed Jade's arm and then kicked her in the head, causing her to scream in pain. she then threw her over her shoulder onto the ground. Jade stood up, but this shakily stood up as if she was about to pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\"Finish her!\"</i></b> the announcer demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Farewell!\" Kitana declared. She threw her war fans at Jade and the war fans hit her. Kitana disappeared in a blue field and then reappeared behind Jade and stabbed two small swords into her skull. She then disappeared again and reappeared right in front of her and grabbed the handles of her weapons, and pulled them out of Jade's skull and then rammed them right into her eye sockets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade fell over onto the ground, dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitana bent over, giving the three perverts an amazing view of her jiggling cleavage. She danced and then threw her arm out and one of her war fans appeared in her hand. She brought it up to cover the lower part of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\"Kitana Wins!\"</i></b> The announcer proclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to add salt to the wound Kitana let out a giggle and winked at them. They all had no doubt that she was smirking underneath her face mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit,\" Motohama cursed, frowning. He was so sure that he had it. The green glow returned and Motohama felt his eyes begin to burn. He let out a faint groan and began to rub them to try and alleviate the the sensation. Unknown to him his eyes began to change. They slowly grew larger and larger as they began to look more feminine. His eye lashes grew longer softer as his eye color changed from a dull brown into a bright green, like emeralds. He now had a set of soft beautiful green eyes that were bound to get anyone's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Does Issei fight Matsuda now, or does Motohama demand a rematch?)</span></div></div>",

The fans hit Jade, and Kitana stepped forward, but that was a mistake that Motohama capitalized on. He did a devastating combo with Jade that caused Kitana's health to lose a quarter of her health. Kitana grabbed Jade and and pull vaulted over and hit her with her war fans. Jade got up and managed to deal a devestating combo that stunned Kitana, long enough for Jade to hit her with her X-RAY Attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally!\" Motohama yelled out, happy tat he finally managed to get her X-RAY Attack to hit. Jade ran behind her opponent and extended her staff, causing the bottom of it to hit Kitana's crotch and make them wince in sympathy. She then pulled it back and slammed the end of it into Kitana's back, causing the last of her health to drop to zero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\"Jade Wins!\"</i></b> The Announced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade pulled out her boomerang and threw it. It appeared behind her and she caught it. Kitana got back and got into her fighting stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son of a bitch!\" Issei cursed at his loss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue glow returned around Issei and once again his body began to change. His limbs began to get thinner and his hands shrunk slightly and became smoother as they began to get more petite and look more feminine. His shoulders began to become more rounded like a woman's. As his limbs changed, so did his face with it softening and his face shape changed until it resembled a heart. His nose got smaller and smaller as it changed into a girl's. Lastly, his eyes grew larger and his eye lashes grew as well, changing into a girl's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his limbs had finished changing, Issei now had slim, toned, trim arms like a woman that exercised regularly. His legs and thighs had changed and he now had a set of sexy, toned, thick curvy thighs that led down to a pair of stunning toned legs that girls would kill to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it so on now!\" Issei declared, now really wanting to win the match. His throat burned as his Adam's apple began to shrink until it was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Round 2. Fight!\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo start the match Issei used Kitana's X-RAY Attack and took Motohama by surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Farewell!\" Kitana declared. She threw her war fans at Jade and the war fans hit her. Kitana disappeared in a blue field and then reappeared behind Jade and stabbed two small swords into her skull. She then disappeared again and reappeared right in front of her and grabbed the handles of her weapons, and pulled them out of Jade's skull and then rammed them right into her eye sockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade fell onto the ground and Issei quickly charged forward and began to demolish Jade before she could do anything. By the time that Jade was able to get in a counter attack already more then half of her health was gone. Jade tried to charged forward and hit Kitana with her X-RAY, but once again she was able to avoid it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son of a bitch!\" Motohama yelled out in anger. \"Why is it I miss every time with that attack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like the start of their match Kitana ruthlessly began to beat the ever loving crap out of Jade until her health hit zero, much to Motohama's chargin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Kitana Wins!\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitana threw her fans up into the air in victory, causing her breasts to jiggle, much to Issei's pleasure. Jade used her staff to stand back up and then got back into her fighting stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God dammit!\" Motohama swore in anger as he began to change again with a green glow. His skin began to darken and take on a more caramel shade. The same shade as Jade's own skin in the game. That wasn't all as his face also began to change again as well. Just like Issei's, Motohama's face took on a more heart shape appearance as well, as his nose shrunk into a girl's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't all though. Just like, Issei his body began to change as well. Just like Issei his arms and legs lost all of the hair on them. When his limbs had finished changing he now had more rounded shoulders, slim fit arms, and a set of legs that men would love to stare at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This last match I'm definitely going to win!\" Motohama proclaimed, fully intending to win.

The two ranged weapons hit their targets, and stunned them for a moment, but they quickly got over it and moved closer to one another. Jade managed to get in a devastating combo with her staff and Kitana retaliated by using her war fan's combos in quick succession of one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the two weren't so busy on defeating on another they would no doubt be glaring at one another in anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now the two of them only had about a quarter of their health at most.

She pulled it out, causing blood to pour out of Jade's stomach like a river as she held it across her body. She stabbed her free one right into Jade's face and then unfurled it as well, splitting the top of her head wide open.

One problem was that unlike Motohama, Matsuda wasn't used to the controls at the moment, and hasn't figured out what was what. By the time that Matsuda had figured out what did what the first round was all ready over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Jade Wins! Flawless Victory!\"</b></i> The announcer proclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hair below Matsuda's eyebrows vanished as the hair on top of his head began to grow. His hair darkened into a beautiful dark shade of black. It grew down past his chin and stopped at the top of his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\"Round 2! Fight!\"</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Matsuda figured out the controls he was able to put up a good fight. When Jade charged forward at him he was actually able to block the attack. He was able to counter and managed to get in a decent hit, before the combo broke. Mileena threw several Sai at Jade and they managed to hit. Jade threw her boomerang in retaliation and managed to follow up with a devastating combo. One more hit and Mileena would be dead. Matsuda managed to get in a few good hits and then followed up with her X-RAY Attack. Mileena charged forward and slammed Jade's head down. Mileena pulled out two Sai and then began to repeatedly stab Jade in the stomach. She stopped and pulled her Sai out and then dealt a devastating hit with her knew to Jade's face, causing her health to drop to zero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Mileena Wins!\"</b></i> The announcer proclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got real lucky there,\" Issei commented, and Matsuda didn't deny it. He did get lucky. Extremely so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMotohama growled in anger. Motohama felt like he was sitting down on a cushion and he looked down to see if he was sitting on something, but didn't see anything. He shrugged it off and looked back at the screen. Unknown to him the reason why he felt like he was sitting on a cushion was because his butt had grown larger. His butt had grown into quite the large bubble butt that people would love to look at as it swayed side to side, and the bold would want to give it a squeeze and cop a fee of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Round 3! Fight!\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like before the two of them charged at one another with the intent to win. When both of their health was around half, Matsuda managed to get a few couple hits, but Jade aws able to duck at the last moment and hit Mileena, breaking Matsuda's rhythm. Jade immediately countered attack her staff, and with that last combo she brought the last of Mileena's health down to zero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Finish Her!\" </b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To easy,\" Jade remarked. She threw her staff into the air and then caught it in her hand. She threw her bladed boomerang and it cut of Mileena's head, and jumped into the air, but landed perfectly back onto her body. Jade zoomed forward and kicked Mileena's body. Mileena's head fell off and Jade caught it right as her boomerang came back to her. She then held up the head and boomerang over her head as if they trophies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Jade Wins! Fatality!\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glow returned and Matsuda's body began to change. His face softened as it took on a heart shape, and his eyes grew larger. His nose got smaller and smaller as it changed into a girl's. Lastly, his eyes grew larger and his eye lashes grew as well, changing into a girl's. His shoulders began to become more rounded like a woman's. His arms and legs began to get thinner and his hands shrunk slightly and became smoother as they began to get more petite and look more feminine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his body finished changing it wouldn't be wrong for people to think of him as a Trap. With the feminine tone to his face and curved toned female body it would be hard to tell his true gender. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Fight!\"</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMileena immediately went on the offensive, but Motohama expected this, and had Jade throw her boomerang. Jade charged in and managed to deal a good combo to Mileena, until she was able to block it. Mileena countered with a good couple of kicks and punches that brought her health down. Jade used her X-ray attack and managed to destroy the last of Mileena's health.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Jade Wins!\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatsuda groaned in disappointment as his legs began to change. His feet grew smaller and more dainty, along with his toes. His thighs became more toned and thicker with toned sexy muscle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\"Round 2! Fight!\"</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMotohama got in a good and strong early lead, but Matsuda managed to get in a couple good hits that managed to help even the playing field. It went on like that until Motohama managed to keep a good combo going, and deal a devastating amount of damage to Mileena's health. Seeing that Mileena was low on health Matsuda had her retreat. Jade ran forward to try and defeat her, but Mileena leaped into the air and kicked Jade in the face. She repeated this a few more times until she won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Mileena Wins!\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMotohama groaned in pleasure as he began to change again. A pleasurable heat began to build up in his chest, and his crotch. His penis and balls began to shrink and grow smaller by the second as it began to recede back into his body. His nipples grew larger in size. as his chest began to have two growing mounds. His breasts quickly went through a A-cup, and a B-cup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Round 3! Fight!\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes continued to happen even though the match had started. When his chest hit C-cups he found it much harder to stay focused on the game. Motohama closed his eyes in pleasure as his breasts grew into C-cups, and making it easy for Mileena to get in a few good combo's due to Motohama's current predicament. Motohama managed to counter and put in a good combo, but as the match went on it became even harder for him to focus when his breasts had become D-cups, and still continued to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Finish her!\"</b></i> The announcer proclaimed. Motohama struggled to get the correct sequence in for Jade's fatality. but was able to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade kicked Mileena up into the air, and then held out her staff and slammed in onto the ground as it extended. When Mileena landed she was impaled through her stomach. Jade then grabbed her head and ripped it off of her body and then slammed it onto the top of the pole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Jade Wins! Fatality!\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son of a bitch!\" Matsuda cursed as he began to change again. His waist began to cave in as his stomach began to get flat, and right as it did the mass from his waist seemed to go to his hips, causing them to expand and grow wider by the second. When his waist and hips stopped changing he now had a slim waist, and a flat stomach, that went perfectly with his legs,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last of Motohama's male genitalia was gone, and was replaced by a woman's vagina, and reproductive system. Right after the change, her breasts had finished growing and were now large E-cups. They jiggled with her breathing and if Issei could see them, then he would no doubt love to get his hands on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the last of the changes were done, Motohama could no longer be considered a man, and had the body of a well-endowed woman through and through. In fact he looked like a real life version of Jade down to the smallest detail. Motohama breathed heavily in and out, tired from the pleasure that the changes had brought onto her, and found it rather hard to keep her eyes open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt like she needed a nice nap.</span></div></div>",

Mileena leaped into the air and tried to kick her in the face, but Kitana threw her fans up and stopped Mileena. Mileena fell onto the ground and when she stood up, Issei was ready to deal a devastating combo to her opponent. Mileena health took a pounding, but she still had a chance for victory, and was able to land a few good hits in but Kitana was able to do so as well, and finished the fight with her X-RAY Attack, dropping Mileena's health down to zero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Kitana Wins!\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatsuda growled in anger at his lost. He wiggled in his seat as his butt began to grow. It grew larger and larger until he had quite the bodacious buttocks that men would love to grope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Round 2! Fight!\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitana charged forward, and Mileena countered. Mileena was able to get in a few good hits in with her sai and deal a good amount of damage with them, but Kitana was able to do the same as well. It continued on like this for a while, until Mileena got out of her opponent's reach surprising her. Now the positions were reversed and Mileena finished the fight with her own X-RAY Attack, dropping Kitana's health down to zero this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Mileena Wins!\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit!\" Issei cursed. Much like Matsuda's, Issei's butt began to change as well. It steadily grew larger and larger as it became more plump and round. Issei slowly rose up in his seat from the added mass to his rump, and when it finally stopped growing he had quite the large sexy bubble butt that everyone would want to look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Round 3! Fight!\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it. This would decide who won the match between them. Kitana threw her fans as Mileena threw her sai. The two weapons collided with their opponent and caused their heal to drop. The two rushed one another and blocked and punched, and kicked each other. It continued on like this between them, until they were both down to the last quarter of health each. As Mileena rushed forward Kitana pulled out her secret weapon. Matsuda gasped in realization that Kitana could pull out her X-RAY, and just like the first fight, Kitana dropped the last of Mileena's health down with the X-RAY Attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Finish her!\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitana placed her hands on her hips and laughed. She shoved Mileena and then pulled out her hands from behind her shoulders, and fanned them out. She cut of Mileena's arms, and then cut off her head. It fell down onto the ground as Kitana held her weapons across her bountiful chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Kitana Wins! Fatality!\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatsuda felt a sudden heat hit his body, and he couldn't help but groan as his nipples and suddenly became erect. they grew in size, and it wasn't long before his pecs began to grow as well and quickly entered the A-cup range. As his breasts grew, the reverse happened to his balls and scrotum. They slowly got smaller and smaller as they retreated back into his body. His breasts continued to grow larger and when they entered the C-cup range the pleasure grew more intense, and he couldn't help, but moan louder. When they entered the D-cup range his male equipment was just about gone, and in a few seconds it was gone and replaced with a vagina. Her breasts finally stopped growing when they became large E-cups, roughly the same size as Motohama's, possibly a little bigger or smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like Motohama, Matsuda panted in tiredness. He felt dead tired. As if he had just ran 2 marathons straight, and needed a nap as well. </span></div></div>",

He had fought Matsuda and Motohama earlier, and was more then warmed up for this. The first thing that he did was throw Kitana's war fans at Jax. The fans stunned Jax and he ran in and lifted him up into the air with his war fans, and followed up by delivering a good kick to him. Jax managed to deliver a good combo, and was surprised by how much his health dropped from the blows, but was able to counter and defeat Jax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" Issei got out as he pumped his fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't underestimate me!\" Jax demanded as he got back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Round 2!

The flew right into his shoulders and as he stumbled back Kitana teleported behind him with her war fans in hand and stabbed them into the back of his head.

He had come so far, and surprisingly didn't lose one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a freaking miracle that didn't happen,\" Issei thought with relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen soon became Shao Kahn's coliseum as Issei watched at the large human like demon come down from his throne. \"You shall pay for your betrayal Kitana.\" He stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Round 1! Fight!\"</b></i> The announcer declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Issei could do anything Shao Kahn had conjured a spear made of green ethereal energy and threw it at Kitana. Issei didn't have so much as a chance to block before the weapon impaled him, causing a good portion of health to evaporate. A green energy appeared around him, and he zoomed forward and slammed into Kitana. Kitana got up and threw her weapons at him, but he just summoned his warhammer and threw it at her. The weapon easily deflected her own and before he knew it, it slammed into her. He walked forward and Issei tried get a good combo off, but Shao Kahn easily shrugged it off and grabbed her. He slammed his elbow into her head, causing her to kneel, and then summoned his warhammer again and swung it into her face, destroying the last of Kitana's health.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Shao Kahn Wins!\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit. . .\" Issei swore out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei groaned as pleasurable heat began to build up in his chest, and his crotch. His nipples got erect as they grew larger in size. His chest grew larger by the second, and his breasts quickly went through a A-cup, and a B-cup. Between his legs his penis and balls slowly got smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitana then got herself back up and readied herself to fight again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Round 2! Fight!\"</b></i> The announcer then declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei's changes continued as the match started. His growing C-cup breasts, and shrinking male genitalia made it difficult for him to focus on Shao Kahn. Shao Kahn's green aura reappeared and he charged forward and slammed into Kitana. He quickly followed by his warhammer and then after that with his spear. Issei could only moan in pleasure. His mind drowned in the pleasure of his shrinking male genitalia, and D-cup breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShao Kahn rammed his shoulder into and sent her flying into the air, and did it again, followed by rushing forward. He then leaped into the air and summoned his warhammer. The attack nailed Kitana's head and sent her down onto the ground. He then grabbed her arm and slammed his foot down on top of her head. He then pulled her up and slammed his head into her's. The X-RAY showed her broken fractured skull and broken dislodged jaw as Issei's breasts grew into DD-cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>FINISH HER!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No. . .\" Issei got out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShao Kahn let out a laugh as he placed his hands on his hips. He then reached out and grabbed Kitana's neck and lifted her up into the air. Kitana coughed in the grip that he had on her. He threw her up into the air and summoned his warhammer, and held it up like a bat. He swung and when the hammer connected with Kitana her body exploded. Limbs, blood, and organs went flying all over the place. He held up his hammer with one hand as he stared out at the player. \"Foolish. . .\" He declared as the screen went black with familiar red text appearing written in blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>SHAO KAHN WINS! FLAWLESS VICTORY!

His penis and his balls were sucked right into his body and replaced with a with a vagina, and female reproductive system. He screamed in pleasure from the change as his chest finished growing into massive F-cup breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down tiredly, wondering what had happened since it was pitch black in the room. Just then, a loud screech echoed through his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> 'AHHHHHH! W-What the~' </i>He mentally wailed in confusion before exhaustion overtook him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she slept, her mind began to change. She began to see herself as a woman and that her name was Kitana. She was a elegant woman who exceed in proper manners and a natural born genius that gained her popular along with Rias Gremory and Akeno Himejima, her best friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then began to remember Motohama as her sister Jade. Her confident, sassy, and somewhat flirty sister. She had ability to calculate a female's body measurements just by looking at them, and got along well with her best friend Aika Kiriyuu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also began to remember Matsuda differently as well and saw her as her other sister Mileena. Her adorable, immature, and somewhat childish sadistic sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them were Jade, Kitana and Mileena Kahn, the Kahn triplets that lived with their mother after their biological father had passed away.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She then groaned once more as she realized where she was sleep before she sighed. \"We over did it again playing video games. . .\" She muttered in embarrassment while turning off the gaming system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made her way over to the wall, and turned on the lights. Besides the video game system, the room itself was elegant and mature as the girl who owned it. It was painted a light blue, her favorite color.In the room, she had a large television with several game systems connected to it, and even some not connected to it. Next to it, were several shelves filled with games, and movies of all kinds. Not to far from that was a bookshelf filled with books of all kinds, from novels to manga. In another part of the room was a closet that was filled with both causal clothing and school uniforms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitana then looked at the other sleeping girls. Jade was lying down on the floor asleep while Mileena was on her bed snuggling up with her blankets and pillows with a bit of drool coming out of her mouth. <i>'I better wake them up before mother scolds them again.'</i> She thought as she went over to her sister and lightly kicked her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Kiba-kun. . .\" Jade moaned with a perverted smile and a equally perverted giggle escaping her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis in turn cause Kitana to blush at hearing that. \"This sister of mine. . .\" She muttered in annoyance as she went over to her and poked her on the cheek. \"Jade, it's time to wake up.\" She stated in a calm tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Do they make it to Kuoh Academy?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade only continued to giggle in her sleep to the action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitana sighed to that in annoyance. \"Guess I'll have to take it up a notch,\" She muttered as she brought her leg back and gave her sister a 'light' kick in the stomach, causing her to gasp in surprise, waking her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOMHP!\" Jade got out as her eyes were wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jade, get up, we classes today.\" She then ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\"Jade replied. She then glared at her sister while she rubbed her stomach. \"Why are you so serious all the time sister?\" She then questioned in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitana narrowed her eyes to that. \"Because I'm not the perverted one.\" She stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does that make sense?\" Jade then questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does because I'm older.\" Kitana answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're triplets though!\" Jade then exclaimed her reminder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I'm still the oldest even it is by a few minutes that means I'm older,\" Kitana answered. She then walked over to Mileena, who continued to cuddle with the blankets. \"Mileena it's time to wake up.\" She then told the girl in a soft tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMileena snuggled deeper with her blankets and Kitana smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mileena I bet mom's making pancakes for breakfast,\" Kitana said in a tempting tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately just like that Mileena shot up with a happy grin on her face. \"Pancakes!\" She replied with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitana then giggled to that. \"Always my adorable little sister.\" She reassured as she then kissed the girl's forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you didn't wake me up like that why?\" Jade deadpanned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because she wasn't being perverted like you were in your sleep.\" Kitana answered. \"I mean really Jade? Kiba-kun?\" She then questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on. You can't deny he's hot!\" Jade shrugged, causing the oldest twin to roll her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls,\" A mature voice that they recognized as their mother's. Kitana's door opened and the three sisters saw their mother. If Kitana could remember her life back when she was Issei, then she would be very surprised by how much of a MILF she turned into. Her mother had long brownish black hair with white lines of it on the side. Her figure was practically a hourglass, much like her daughters bodies, and showed just where they got their curves from. She had large F-cup breasts, roughly around Kitana's own bust, and a bodacious booty. \"Ara ara, I see you three are awake.\" She happily replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitana nodded to that as she gave a respectable bow. \"Of course mother.\" She responded with politeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom.\" Jade casually replied from her place on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi mom!\" Mileena happily replied while waving to e.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir mother merely giggled to the responses. \"I'm glad to see that you up, now go take your group bath and get dressed, I'll be downstairs getting breakfast ready.\" She kindly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you make pancakes?\" Mileena asked in a giddy tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir mother merely giggled some more to that. \"I already started. I just have to cook them.\" She then answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Mileena cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir mother looked at her triplets and smiled. \"I'll make sure there's enough form my growing girls, now go get ready.\" She then requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitana nodded to that. \"Of course mother.\" She replied once more with politeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok mom.\" Jade responded once more in a casual tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hai!\" Melieena happily replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three sisters made their ways to one of the bathrooms to get ready or the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir mother meanwhile returned downstairs to the kitchen, continuing to make the pancakes. \"My wonderful girls.\" She sighed out in happiness. <i>'All of them so unique in their own ways. First is my elegant Kitana.'</i> She thought. <i>'Kitana was always such a sweet girl. Helping others when she could. Compassionate little thing as well. As she got older, she started to have a poise that others lacked, and only become more charismatic as years passed. That bearing making her noticed by all. As such, her friends Rias-chan, Akeno-chan and Sona-chan helped her refine her into the elegant woman that she is.'</i> She then added to her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in one of the bathrooms, Kitana was in the shower rubbing shampoo through her hair, and brushing it afterwards to get whatever suds remain out. <i>'Geez, Jade can be such a hassle at times, she should have more respect for mother. . .'</i> She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitana then grabbed a bottle of body wash and poured some of it into her hands, and then rubbed it over her body. <i>'Mmm. . .feels nice. . .</i>' She thought in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir mother continued cooking as then thought of her next daughter.<i>\"Jade meanwhile is such a free and fiery spirit. Always laughing and having a good time. No matter what it was, nothing could keep her down, much like her sisters.\"</i> She thought in a loving tone. <i>'Although I wish she kept better company like them.'</i> She admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade was humming a tune as she got her school uniform ready for the day. \"Man last night was great. . .though I really wish that Kitana didn't beat so much while we were playing Dead or Alive.\" She remarked with a pout. She then went and headed into her own shower. \"Time to get nice and clean now for the boys.\" She then added with a slightly perverted giggle. \"Wonder what's Aika-chan's been doing?\" She wondered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her shower, Jade stepped out and got her uniform on. When she was finished she looked at herself in the mirror, posing with a saucy smirk on her face before she then smacked her own butt. \"The boys won't be able to resist!\" She declared in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir mother soon placed the four plates of pancakes on the the the table.<i> 'Lastly there's my little Mileena.'</i> She began. <i>'Mileena is a little childish, but she has a stout heart, and loves her sisters dearly.'</i> She sighed out loud. <i>'Even if she is getting some questionable... tastes.'</i> She admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMileena meanwhile had already finished getting ready and couldn't wait to eat breakfast. She couldn't wait to see Koneko and glomp her. She was so CUTE! And she also couldn't wait to talk to Akeno either. \"Aaaah, time for another day of school! I can hardly wait to see Akeno-chan and Koneko-chan!\" She declared in a giddy tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three girls soon came out of their rooms in their school uniforms, though with some minor additions to make themselves look unique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitana had a blue hairband that was low to her hair along with star shaped sapphire earrings in in her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade wore golden bracelets on her wrists and triangle shaped emerald earrings in her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMileena meanwhile had a silver necklace with a heart shaped pendant around her neck with and pair of heart shaped rose quartz earrings. When she saw the readied table of food, she smiled widely. \"Yay! Pancakes!\" She cheered. \"Thanks Mom! She happily declared as she rushed over to the table and quickly took a seat, and began devouring her plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir mother meanwhile giggled as she watched the youngest of her triplets eat. \"Anything for my beautiful and lovely daughters.\" She kindly responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you mother.\" Kitana said respectively, and bowed a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Jade replied nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its nothing dears. Now eat before its get cold. You need a good breakfast before you go to school.\" Their mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hai.\" The three girls replied, though Mileena's was muffled a little from eating already as the other two sisters began eating themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls ate their breakfast happily and when they were finished, they made their way to school to begin the day.</span></div></div>",

When they arrived they saw plenty of students up and about, talking to one another, and others just lounging about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good we made it before the bell,\" Kitana commented. \"We wouldn't want to be late or else Sona-chan would be angry at us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another day another death course.\" Jade sighed with a grumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw don't be all doom and gloom sister.\" Mileena meanwhile said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey my grades aren't the best and it doesn't help that Sona keeps comparing me to Ms.Genius over here.\" Jade countered as she pointed her thumb at the eldest twin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitana then looked back to her sister. \"That would be because you have the tendency to fall asleep in class.\" She stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not my fault that the teacher are boring,\" Jade countered, folding her arms underneath her large bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMileena couldn't help but giggle at that since she wasn't wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that may be true, but you must at least respect them.\" Kitana once more stated. \"Now come along sisters, class is about to start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did we become your entourage?\" Jade questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am still the oldest and we are in the same class together.\" Kitana reminded once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo hearing that, Jade groaned in annoyance. \"You really love using that excuse.\" She muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and also because I happen to beat you in a majority of our spars,\" Kitana smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh,\" Mileena got out with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that you two are having your usual squabbles.\" A female joked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitana then turned around to see a familiar red head and smiled. \"Good morning Rias-chan.\" She greeted with politeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We weren't squabbling we were bickering,\" Jade answered. \"There's a difference.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias and Mileena meanwhile giggled to that. \"Of course it is Jade.\" Rias replied in a amused tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Akeno-chan and Koneko-chan?\" Mileena questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are in class already, something you three should be doing too.\" Rias answered as she then looked at the eldest twin. \"After school today, can you come with me, Akeno and Sona? We have something to discuss.\" She requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitana blinked in surprised confusion to that. \"What about?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias merely smiled playfully to that. \"You'll see.\" She replied as she began to walk away, swaying her hips all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was strange.\" Mileena commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Jade agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitana merely looked at the red haired girl walking away as she then turned to her sisters. \"Come on, class is going to start soon.\" She once again reminded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine fine,\" Jade remarked, taking the lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course sister.\" Mileena replied as she followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked to their first class, and when they arrived they saw Akeno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ufufu, good morning Kitana-chan, Jade-chan, Mileena-chan.\" Akeno greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Akeno-chan!\" Mileena chirped happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning,\" Kitana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hey,\" Jade said flatly. She didn't want to stay around her. She was a sadist and was the reason why Mileena was becoming one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ara ara Jade-chan, is something wrong?\" Akeno then asked while licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope nothing's wrong you sadist,\" Jade muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkeno however just giggled as she watched the three sisters sit down for class. \"So Bucho is going to give Kitana-chan the offer after school.\" She muttered. <i>'Ufufu, this will be very interesting indeed.'</i> She thought while licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to her, the three sister heard her and wondered. <i>'What offer? And why did she lick her lips?'</i> They all thought in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the class began and they all concentrated on their work.</span></div></div>",

Normally the other member of the perverted trio would be with him for this, but today it was just him. Matsuda was out sick, and Motohama had some nasty food poisoning the other day, and was recovering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Issei,\" a cold voice behind him said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei stopped and shivered in fear. He slowly turned around and saw Muryama and Katase, along with several other members of the kendo club glaring at him. All of them with shinai in hand. Before he could do anything to try and get away or defend himself they were upon him, and started to beat him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei moaned and groaned in pain when they were finished. As they walked back to the locker room Muryama noticed a small pearl down on the ground. She picked it up and looked at it. It was small little thing no bigger then a eye ball would be, but it was beautiful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if it's just one of them it's still to much!\" Katase exclaimed angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish that we didn't have to deal with Issei anymore!\" Murayama agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to her the small pearl that she had found glowed. When Murayama found the small pearl she was given a one wish. It couldn't just erase Issei from existence, but it could change him, and make him something far more preferable to fulfill her wish, in the best way possible. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He just left the classroom after the teacher was kind enough to let them fiinsh earlier as he had some business to do. But he wasn't going home with the girls this time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei sure had a bad day. Not only did he got caught again, but he was going to spend his afternoon alone. The girls went out to a spa for tonight and his parents were at a meeting with some of their old friends. He considered inviting Kiba or Gasper over, but he wasn't sure what to do with them other than playing some games or watching TV. And there were no requests at the moment from any clients asking for a Devil's services.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God damn it, this will sure be boring... Why did those two had to be sick today as well?\", asked Issei about Matsuda Motohama in his head. \"I could've played one of our games without interruption, and I could've asked more about that game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days ago...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa... These girls look amazing!\", exclaimed Issei after Matsuda showed him anew game on his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? I told you.\", said the bald teenager with a smirk. \"It seems to be called \"Senran Kagura Estival Versus\". It is about modern ninja girls who go to school and fight bad guys while wearing this sexy outfits! Isn't that amazing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While there is no private parts showing anywhere in the game, the outfits, the motions and even the gameplay should excite anyone.\", smiled Motohama while adjusting his glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei drooled at the images of the sexy girls before he wondered something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said these girls are modern ninjas right? They don't seem like that with these outfits. I mean look at Hibari, Ryona and Minori. I could buy the thing with going to a school, but still... It looks really weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they are supposed to be modern ninjas Hyoudou.\", said Matsuda as he pouted a bit. \"Do you really expect ninjas to wear the classic wear in these games? They are girls, not dudes who train in the mountain. Secret organization or not, that would be way too old school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And not to mention the repetitive trope of girls wearing armor in these kind of games. While I have nothing against that, I find girls wearing bulky armor quite uninteresting.\", continued Motohama.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But man, wouldn't it be awesome if the girls actually existed and would be enrolling to our school? They don't need to be ninjas, just regular people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. And Katusragi would be great for that. She seems quite a lot like us in terms of perversion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei looked at the phone and looked at the girl the two were talking about. He really found her really pretty and her clothes... would turn any guy on. He noticed though that despite the art of her groping other girls, thee were a few where she received the treatment and seemed as flustered as her victims. He wanted to ask about that, but instead asked something else he found curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the girl she is always with? The one with ebony hair and wearing an uniform?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean Ikaruga?... She's fine I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just fine? You don't seem like the guy who would turn down someone who looks like this Motohama.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get me wrong, I love girls with long black hair like Himejima-senpai. But I find her personality off-putting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. She's kind of like a foil to Katsuragi, always being the one who upholds order, behaves by the rules and hates indecent thoughts. As much as I would like a smart girl like her, I won't be able to get along with her. She's just like the girls from the Kendo club, you know what I mean? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see... Then what girl would fit your tastes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Perverted Trio continued their chat, they were unaware that Murayama and Katase heard the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe if they would stop being perverts, they would get a girlfriend. Even that Katsuragi would be turned off by them.\", murmured Katase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Maybe we would need someone like the Ikaruga girl that they spoke of instead of them... I kind of wish she existed.\", said Murayama.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the present...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well... Guess I'll surf the Web a bit and then play one of my eroge games. I guess that is an advantage of being alone.\", thought Issei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wish Murayama did would indeed affect Issei to no longer be a problem. But since making him behave himself wouldn't mean he still wouldn't be perverted. So in accordance to her wish and her thoughts from before, Issei would become an epitome of manners and politeness...</span></div></div>",

On the way, he started thinking about Rias and the others. While he cares a lot about them and knows that the person is more important than the body, sometimes he gives in to his lust and starts thinking about them in their underwear or even naked, due to their experiences together. Right now, with him feeling really bored, he began entering his fantasy world for a while. Suddenly however, he felt a sudden chill down his spine as this was the signal that the changes were starting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that? Where did that cold breeze come from? There was no wind all day and the guys at the news said that today is going to be warm... Whatever, maybe it was an air current or something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't think too much of what happened and went back to his fantasies. As he walked, his blue sneakers lost their laces as the color was gradually turning to brown and the material shifted a bit. In a matter of minutes, he got himself a pair of brown dress shoes, which corresponded to Kuoh Academy's female uniform. His feet felt a bit uncomfortable in his smaller shoes, but soon the discomfort went away as his feet shrank and his toes arched as they got a pedicure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, he began to feel itchy around his chest, arms and legs. This broke his train of taught as he began to scratch himself. It wasn't painful or anything, but it was quite aggravating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do I feel so itchy? First that shiver and now this? Did I get an allergy? Hey Ddraig do you know?\", he stopped as he realized his partner couldn't hear him. \"Right... He said he wanted to sleep a bit longer today. I can't blame him as he went deep in the Boosted Gear to try and access more powers... But still, where did this itch come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the itch went away, making Issei a bit relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew... Glad that's gone. I wonder what caused that. I think I should look in the mirror to see if it was a rash or something like that...\", thought Issei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat really was the cause of the itch was in reality the fact that the hair on his body, other than the one on his head was falling off. In the end, he ended up with a smooth, blemish-free skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made him be a bit more sensitive to his clothes. He felt that something was off, but he merely linked the feeling with the \"rash\" from before.</span></div></div>",

While initially a simple house, it has become an imposing mansion after Rias and the other girls moved in. He still wondered how Sirzechs and Zeoticus manged to build such a compound in such a short amount of time. But then again, anything is possible for them since they are Devils...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, he took off his shoes and went to his room to change. On his way, some strands of hair fell onto his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird. I could swear I cut my hair last week...\", hr thought as he decided to check in the mirror if something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went to his room and took off his uniform as he changed into his favorite red T-shirt and a pair of black slacks as he kept his white socks. He initially wanted to just leave his uniform on the bed, but he got a nagging feeling at the back of his head that he should put it in the dresser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I thinking so much about this? It's just my uniform and there's nobody home to scold me about it... Not that I ever want to be scolded for being lazy... I guess I can put it in its place. There's no rush after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put his uniform on a clothes hanger, without noticing that the pants were turning purple and were growing smaller. He didn't know where that urge came from, but he didn't mind it too much, as he wanted to put the clothes in the dresser anyways. Afterward, he went into the bathroom to check himself out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside the bathroom, he took his T-shirt off and got a look at himself. His skin was silky smooth and shiny, but when he looked in the mirror, he didn't notice that, instead looking for any redness from the itch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so the itch maybe it was from the clothes I guess...? It doesn't seem to be an allergic reaction though as there is no signs anyways... Well, I guess it's fine since since the itch is gone and there seems to be nothing wrong... As for my hair...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe natural spikiness that his hair originally had was now seemingly going away as portions of his hair were becoming flat and straight. Not only that, it has grown to the point it covered his ears as the color seemed to be a shade or two darker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks a bit off, doesn't it...? I wonder if it is because of the shampoo... I wonder if I used Akeno-senpai's shampoo by mistake... Heheh... I wonder if that will make my hair silky as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed to himself a bit, before the thought about Akeno began to change about her being in the shower. He was so absorbed that he missed his skin getting a bit more tan than it was before. He however snapped out of the fantasy for no reason, which confused him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Why did it end so suddenly? And it was getting to the good part as well... Oh well, I guess I shouldn't be spacing out like this so often...\", he thought as he washed his hands and then put his T-shirt on. Afterward, he headed back to his room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Issei returned to his room and with a grin, he began looking under his bed. While he kept the normal games he played with Xenovia, Irina and Koneko in a case near the TV set, he asked Sirzechs to put a small trap door under his bed to hide his eroge games. He crawled under the bed, excited to play the games, not noticing his calves starting to vibrate as the muscle in them began altering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he checked the trap door...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?! What the?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...he was shocked to find it empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are they? Did Rias or Akeno-senpai find them already? No, they couldn't have... They don't even know about the trap door and I know I haven't mention it before. Did I put them with the magazines?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up and went to check one of the nightstands. In it, there was a secret compartment at the bottom, where he put his magazines. The girls did found them a few times before, but fortunately for him, they handed them back to him as they were just teasing him. This made him find new ways each time to hide them. His most recent one was one he was sure, they would have trouble to find. He fumbled a bit with removing the false bottom as his hands became smaller and daintier, but eventually he opened it .When he looked inside... there was nothing to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?! This doesn't make any sense! Not even if they searched the place they couldn't have found both... Okay... Calm yourself Isasuei... Think logically...\", he thought as he took a deep breath, escaping the fact that he called himself a different name. \"They have to be here. I know for a fact that it is impossible to find both hiding spots. Not even Koneko-chan could do that... Yesterday I was quite tired when I came back home. It is possible that I hid the magazines somewhere else and the games must've been with them... I just need to check all of the room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a determined look, he then checked every single hiding spot he had before from under the TV set to inside the mattress to the air vent. As he was looking, he was troubled of the missing games and magazines, thinking of all the fun and pleasure he had with them, which in turn cause more changes to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis calves became sleek and slim, but remained toned as the rest of their mass went straight for his thighs. His hard-earned leg muscle he gained from running from Tannin's training was slowly melting away as his thighs became thicker. However, despite loosing some muscle, he kept a good balance of fat and muscle, which gave his legs a very appealing look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he looked in the closet, if he would've taken a look at his clothes, he would've seen that they are also changing. Some of his pants began to grow smaller and their material became thinner while some of his T-shirts began to change color with the red ones getting lighter and some of his black ones transitioning into yellow. As for his uniform, his shirt didn't change too much as it became a bit smaller, but his pants, which are now above his knees are now fully purple as a white fringe was appearing at the bottom as the legs began to fuse. His own lacks that he was wearing began to better conform o his changed legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued looking as from time to time he had to brush his hair from his vision as it grew longer again, this time to below his chin. But there was something else that was shifting. His desire to look for the magazines was dwindling, and this wasn't because he was getting tired or that  he wanted to take care of his hair to stop bugging him... It was because he didn't seem to want to look at them anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is stupid... Why do I need to look for those things anyway? They are all so perverted... I should find something else to do... \"</span></div></div>",

If they are not here, then maybe someone took them... as improbable as it sounds...\", thought Isasuei. \"... And besides, I don't need those things anyway. Why would I waste my time time with perverted things instead of- Huh?! What am I thinking? Those magazines are sacred to me. I wouldn't-\". His thoughts were derailed by another bang falling on his face. \"What's up with my hair today? This is the 100th time I had to pull my hair off my face. I need to brush it... And why are my pants so tight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, his slacks were a lot tighter on him than they were at the beginning. That was because of his soft, large thighs and his hips which were now slowly pushing outwards, stretching his pelvis a little. Also, the material began to get a bit sturdier as the black began to lighten towards a dark-blue. He blushed a bit as his manhood was a bit tight, but he managed somehow to not get aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope I did not put any weight... But then again, nothing else seems off but my pants seem off. Something must've happened during laundry then... I will wear them a bit longer to see if they will go back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then went back to the bathroom to check his hair. It has grown longer again, now down to his shoulders at it grew to his shoulders and it became completely straight, with the exception of some wild bangs here and there as the color darkened once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never thought my hair was this much of a mess.\", he grumbled as he took a brush from a cabinet. However, it didn't belong to his mother, but to him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he brushed his hair, his thoughts went back to his missing stuff for a brief second. However the desire to see the girls from the manga and video games posing quickly went away as he shook his head, not paying attention to his hands becoming dainty and his fingernails getting longer and gaining a manicure. The changes then slowly made their way up their arms as they started to slim down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking care of his hair, he washed his face, taking off the sweat. After washing his eyes, he needed to blink a few times as the eye color changed from brown to a deep-sea blue. Suddenly, he heard the phone ringing from downstairs. He quickly made his way to it and picked it up. But before he could speak, he felt his throat a little sore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Who is it?\", asked Isasuei in a slightly higher voice.</span></div></div>",

It's a shame you are on your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry dear. I am sure Rias and the others didn't mean not taking you with them to the spa with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know... But I am not going to blame them for something like that. They needed some pampering. I'll find something to do until they come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course... I have made some shrimp and vegetable tempura for you for tonight. I also bought some green tea ice-cream that I know you love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Okaa-san. Have a great night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then hung up, with a small smile on his face as he went to the fridge. Just as his mom said, his dinner was waiting for him inside. He then took it and put it in the microwave. While he didn't like microwaved food, this oven was made by Azazel. It had the ability to properly heat foot without making it soggy and seem reheated in exchange for taking longer to cook, for about 10 minutes. He didn't understand why he would make something like this, but he surely made use of his invention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting the food in the oven, he then took a small bottle of iced green tea and drank it. He didn't know why, but he started to like the taste of green tea more than before. Also, with each gulp, his voice slowly became higher and higher. When he finished drinking, he gave a pleased sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never thought I would like green tea this much but it sure tastes great.\", said the boy to himself. \"I have to thank Okaa-sama for buying these later... Speaking of her... She said something about Rias taking me to the spa with them... I am sure she knows that would be impossible... Although I personally would night mind it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he went into his dream world, imagining himself with the other girls at the spa, his stomach grumbled a bit as his waist began to shrink. Also, almost to snap him from his fantasy, his red boxers suddenly became skin-tight and increased the pressure he felt at his groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\", he grumbled... \"I think I need to use the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he threw the empty bottle in the garbage can, he slowly made his way to the bathroom. As he walked, his red T-shirt began to change as well. The sleeves got longer until they reached just above his elbows and the material became 100 percent cotton as some vertical lines were growing from it.</span></div></div>",

I can let a day pass without having dirty fantasies... But sometimes I just can't help it. I mean Rias and Asia-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped as a small wave of vertigo overtook him. As his mind was once again purged of the dirty thoughts, his seat got a lot more cushy as his rear inflated more and more, so that in the end, he was left with a gorgeous heart-shaped behind. But that wasn't the only change as his manhood started to shrink. Its size was reduced by half as his testes also became smaller. This was a major change, but the dizziness obscured everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the vertigo went away as he regained Isarui regained his composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was unexpected... I guess I must be a bit tired... But regardless, I must assert control over my mind. I am sure Rias-san and Asia-san would think as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he finished, he took a glance at his manhood and had the feeling that it shrunk, but he didn't pay too much mind to it. When he put his pants and underwear back on, he was happy that despite the fact that it still was tight, it wasn't as uncomfortable around his groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This surely feels a lot better... I wonder if this is somehow linked to how small it looked than normal... I don't think it matters anyways. Rias-san likes me regardless of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then went to the sink and started washing his hands an then proceeded to wash his face again. As he did, his features became softer as his nose became petite, his cheekbones rose up, his eyebrows became thin and his lips plumped up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis clothes also changed. His pants became a cyan blue as they became a pair of jeans as his white socks became just a bit longer, going to middle of his calves. But his boxers suffered the biggest transformation. The red started to darken as the material was turning a lot more stretchier as they were getting smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter washing his face and drying it off with a towel, he gave a small smile to his appearance as he went his hand a bit through his raven hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was exiting the bathroom, he thought of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Am I forgetting something? It feels important... But there's no problem. I will just ask Rias-san once she comes back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, inside the Boosted Gear, Ddrraig was just waking up from his sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haaah... That sure was a good rest. Sorry if I was out too much partner. I needed some time to explore the depths of the Boosted Gear. There still seems to be a lot we don't know about its true potential. But I am sure we will figure it out somehow.\" He stood there waiting for a response, but was confused as he didn't hear a reply. \"Hm? Partner? Ise? Why aren't you saying anything? You can't possibly be mad that my slumber was a bit longer than usual right?...\" Still nothing. \"Ise? He's awake isn't he?... Huh?... ?! What the?! Is link between us is blocked by something?! What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly then tried to connect himself to his senses, which fortunately it seemed to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I can still observe him through his senses.... Hm? Everything seems fine... He is still in his home and it doesn't seem to be any dangers around. Then why is the link- Wait, why is he walking like that?\", wondered Ddraig as he saw how Issei walked with one step gently put in front of the other. \"That looks like the way Gremory and the other women walk... I think I should be able to see if something is wrong physically. I doubt that he hit his head so hard that-... What... Is... This...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDdraig stood there speechless, his mouth wide open, unable to understand what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not still dreaming am I...?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the time Isarui returned downstairs, the food was unsurprisingly already done. Usually, he would often go to the living room and watch some TV as he ate. He would do that whenever his parents weren't at home and the girls, with the exception of Ravel and Rossweisse, wouldn't mind that as long as he didn't make a mess. He wasn't an unruly person, but sometimes felt the urge to eat that way. But now he felt like that was something inappropriate and instead decided to sit at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis large rear made the seat a lot more cushy, but he didn't mind that as he started to eat. He slowly chewed the tempura that his mom made, savoring the flavor as he ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okaa-sama's food sure is very good... Especially since I know how much passion he puts into making it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he ate, he felt a little bit of grumbling from his abdomen as it continued to diminish. He however was preoccupied with the food, so he ignored the feeling. The more he ate, not only did his waist shrink, his hips pushed further as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rias-san also cooks delicious food. And Asia-san and Akeno-senpai too... It would sure be nice to feed each other...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother tingle formed around his abdomen as he had that thought, as a new cavity formed inside it. At this point, Isarui would be really confused as to say if he was a boy or a girl due to his still-changing anatomy. But he didn't bother with that, as there was something else on his mind right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Why did I think that? I-I mean, it would be something exciting to do but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, he heard something beep in his pocket. He took out his cell phone, which now had a pink covering, and opened it. There was a message from his father that said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isaruga, we might be a bit late than expected tonight. Your mom seems to have gotten into some pretty intense talk with her friends. She also might've gotten a bit tipsy... She'll be fine eventually, but let me tell you.... I know you have 2 more years until you can legally drink, but when you do, please be moderated... Anyway, we might come home around the time the girls come back. If you feel sleepy, you can go to your room and rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he read the message, he aged up one year as he lost 2 centimeters in height. As he was right now, he was not only in the same year as Rias, but in the same class with her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled at his father's reply and messaged him back to not worry before putting the phone back in his pocket and going back to his food. When he finished, he was now in possession of a figure that would rival a model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took the plate and started to wash it, but as he did, his back felt a little stiff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did some cold air got me? Let's see if it goes away if I rub it... But I need to be careful not to get wet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed his back forward as he rubbed it. This made it gain an arch as his shoulders also became more rounder and narrower. His T-shirt's sleeves grew a bit as they now reached the elbows of his slim and athletic arms as its color stated to fade out a bit, going towards pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the pain went away, with a satisfied smile, he finished washing his plate.</span></div></div>",

They were quite a rarity to find at a normal convenience store, but his mom managed to find a place where they sell it. He took a few spoonfuls  and put it in a small bowl, and as before, he sat at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly indulged into his pleasure, he smiled to himself how at one point Xenovia joked that he would get fat from eating too much ice-cream, but he knew that it would be impossible. With the amount of training he does, that would sometimes be on par with Xenovia's, he knew that it would be impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Isaruga ate, more changes happened to him. Most of Isaruga's muscles were redistributed around the body so that despite not being as brawn as before, he still remained really fit. Some displaced matter however still remained unused... at least until the ice-cream came. The matter went right to his chest as it began to push outwards. His Adam's Apple, which has slowly been diminishing ever since he talked to his mom, was slowly fading away, and with the ice-cream, it completely vanished, giving him a very feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aah... That was really good.\" sighed Isaruga as he finished and then washed the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked back to his room, his boxers continued to change. They became pure black as the material now seemed to resemble that of a swimsuit. They also lost their legs as they became tighter once again, crushing his groin a bit. But the pain didn't phase him too much as he once again thought it was merely something temporarily. His top also finished its transformation. The neckline plunged some and the bottom lowered during the past ten minutes as the top section folded itself. In the end, the former red T-shirt became a pink jersey sweater decorated with vertical lines. Despite his more sensitive skin however, it didn't cause him any discomfort as the material didn't irritate him at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got upstairs, he went and opened his computer. He then thought for a second what exactly he would watch. For a second, he thought of one of the usual ecchi TV shows that he would watch, imagining the girls in provocative clothing and such...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis however got him a scolding from himself as he already told himself to stop doing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... I need to asset control over my imagination. I am not a pervert! Rias-san would scold me for this.... No.... She would never scold me... After all, she, Akeno-senpai and even Xenovia-san are really bold and don't mind me seeing them in their underwear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his mind drifted again, his nipples tingled as they became bigger, wider and a lot more sensitive as they stuck out a bit through his sweater as his AA-cup breasts began to accelerate in their growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I must restrain myself! I just need to find something to distract me from my thoughts...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Isaruga looked around to see if there was a good movie to watch, to distract himself. As he was browsing, he found a show about the bond between two girls. It seemed harmless enough so he clicked on it as he was curious what was the show about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started out detailing the relationship between the two girls, as childhood friends who now went to highschool and it showed the hardships of their daily lives. However towards the end of the episode, the two girls... started kissing as a form of closeness between them. While it was something innocent, this immediately made Isaruga imagine him and Rias kissing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made his currently B-cup breasts to grow another cup size as he felt rather uncomfortable as the nipples rubbed on the fabric. Just as he was about to scratch them, the discomfort went away as a black bikini top magically formed around his breasts, growing together with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, his former boxers finished its transition into the matching bottom pair of the bikini top as it hugged his manhood, which was shrinking once again. It was once again reduced by half as his testes were pressing on his groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaruga quickly shook his head, trying to recompose himself. He thought of switching the sow, but he was enthralled by the story and the characters, so he decided against his better judgement to watch a few more episodes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story developed as aside from the genuine closeness the two girls had, there were plenty of funny moments between them as well as two of their classmates becoming closer as well. While there was no perverted scene or inappropriate content, Isaruga found himself blushing whenever there was a kissing scene, which fueled his little fantasies of sharing such tender moments with the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he watched the show, he developed a small fever that he ignored. After the second episode, his left testicle was pulled inside him as his breasts jumped in size to large DD-cups as a silver tear-shaped pendant connected by a simple string materialized on his neck. His other testicle was pulled at the end of the third episode as his breasts ended their growth at large EE-cups. They were still smaller than the ones Rias had, but they were quite bigger than the busts most of the girls had. As for his testes, they linked themselves with the cavity formed earlier as they turned into ovaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the forth episode was rolling, his manhood, which has been reduced to a small nub, was nearly done shrinking, but Isaruga was too distracted by the show and his imagination as he didn't notice the fever, let alone the changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the show reaches the end and the two girls kiss after one believes she has seen a ghost, the small nub went inside of him, making him officially a girl, the nearly faints due to the heat he was experiencing, as the new girl's name entered her mind: Ikaruga Hyoudou.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the episode ended, Ikaruga made her way to the bathroom and threw some cold water over her face. After cooling herself down, she looked in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did that heat come from? I am sure the room temperature was normal. First there was that shiver that hit me on my way back to school, and now this. I hope I am not getting sick. Huh?\" When Ikaruga looked at herself in the mirror she was surprised to she that there wasn't any sweat anywhere on her clothes. \"How can this be?... Was the heat just my imagination...? I recall nearly fainting and the room felt hot, but there is no sweat and the temperature is normal... Or was it some reaction like the itchiness from before? ...I think I should rest now. Whatever happened to me before didn't seem to make that much of an effect on me other than some momentarily discomfort. I should consult Rossweisse-sensei about this tomorrow morning...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got back in the bedroom and saw that the clock was around 21:30, he closed her computer, turned the light off and laid on her back on her bed, feeling rather tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should nap a bit until Rias-san and the others come. They will wake.... me up once they arrive... And maybe I can kiss...\" She couldn't finish her sentence as she drifted into sleep.</span></div></div>",

That sure was pleasant. I must thank Sona for telling us about this place.\", said Rias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I really felt amazing. I never knew such massage techniques existed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right Asia? The women said that those massages also improve your reflexes and your mobility. Don't you think the same Irina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez Xenovia... You really care a lot about getting fit, huh? But other than the massages, the salt bath was fantastic. My skin has never felt as good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. The properties were really rejuvenating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Koneko-chan, the minerals used in the bath are said to have amazing properties that can also cure aches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You knew about it as well Ravel-san? I thought no one would look up for the remedies like I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ufufu... Seems like Rossweisse-sensei can get matched in knowledge in things that aren't related to magic.\", giggled Akeno as the others did as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still... I feel bad for Ise.\", said Rias with an apologetic face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... If we knew there was a section for boys as well, we could've had him tag along. And this was on the same day Matsuda and Motohama were sick as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it is a good thing since it means there will be less perverted things happening at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it still must've been hard for Ise-san to be alone as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree with Asia. We could've taken Ise-kun at the spa. I guess Sona must've forgotten since Saji-kun never went there as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if Kiba or Gasper were invited to spend time with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt it. Yuuto-san is busy with his upcoming test and Gasper-kun is still.... a bit apprehensive with going out at night on his own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're all going home now. So let's make it up to Ise!\", said Rias as the other girls nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if Kaa-san and Tou-san are already home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows? It comes down to how long their meeting was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of them... There was something weird that happened at the spa.\", said Ravel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when I took a break to look at the messages, Ise-sama's mother asked me if any of us wanted some green-tea ice-cream. She said that it was Ise-sama's favorite flavor as well as beverage and wanted to know if we wanted more. I said yes, but I wasn't sure why she thought that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls looked a bit puzzled for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asia, Irina, did Ise said he like green tea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As far as I know, no. He was never against it, but I wouldn't say it was something he would love to drink or eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he got to like it recently?\", asked Koneko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so. He never mentioned it before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the group reached their house and went inside. After taking off their shoes, Rias said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I am going upstairs to check on Ise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ara ara... Don't think you can get an advantage so easily Rias.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm coming too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Akeno and Asia followed Rias upstairs, the others sighed and began to wander a bit around the house. Suddenly, Koneko noticed something as she signaled Xenovia and Irina too come over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Koneko-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This.\", said the Devil Nekomata as she pointed towards an extra pair of brown dress-shoes. \"Did Senpai come at school with these?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... I don't... think so. I could swear he went with sneakers today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe something happened to them and replaced them? I know he has a spare pair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but look Xenovia! The pair looks a lot smaller than usual. In fact, it looks like one of ours....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group was confused by this and Irina asked a bit shaken:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think... He invited another girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impossible.\", said Koneko firmly. \"Other than us and Sona-kaichou's group, the rest of the girls still view Senpai as a pervert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and the shoes belong to our uniform, so I doubt she would be from somewhere else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girls were facing the dilemma, Ravel came over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I checked the freezer and indeed there was some green tea ice-cream inside as well as some green tea drinks in the fridge... I never knew Ise-sama would like this stuff so much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He wouldn't...\", replied Irina. \"I mean, he likes tea, but there isn't a type in particular that he likes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the four were ready to discuss the strange things, something happened... </span></div></div>",

Well, as much as we would've like to give our little Ikaruga a brother, I am afraid she is our only child. Although Ise does sound like a great name for a boy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing the father's words, the girls froze. They were confused, shocked and scared that something happened to Issei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Are you girls okay? Did you also drink a bit tonight? I mean I know Rossweisse-san isn't that great with holding her alcohol...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore any of the girls could mutter anything, Rosseweisse came over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry about that. One of the treatments at the spa was having us inhale some special incense that said could make our heads a bit of a mess if we do it too much. Now if you excuse us, we will go clear our heads a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay. We will go to the kitchen and eat a bit. Tell us if you're hungry. I know it is a bit late, but you can't just skip a meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young teacher nodded as se took the other four to the living room and after telling them to be quiet, Ravel asked frantically:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rossweisse-san, what's going on here? And what happened to Ise-sama?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did someone hypnotized the parents?\", asked Koneko, trying to find an explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not. Please look at this.\", said the woman as the showed them a picture. When the looked at it, their immediately panicked. It was the photo with Issei and Irina when they were kids. But instead of Issei, there was a girl with shoulder-length black hair and blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-That's impossible! I've never seen this girl in my life!\", cried Irina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you. Trust me, I've seen the photo before, and I know Issei-kun was in it. But it wasn't just this one. All the photos which had him before, instead were with this girl instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Then what happened to Senpai?\", asked Koneko, now very afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on... Isn't Buchou going to Ise's room. Doesn't that mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias, Asia and Akeno reached Issei's room and slowly opened it. They were surprised to see to see the lights turned off and somebody already on the bed. But since the figure was not under the sheets, they realized that the person was just resting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he got that bored he went to sleep. He may like to indulge in his fantasies, but I guess even that wasn't enough to keep him awake.\", said Rias with a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sure Ise-san did something else as well. Who knows?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can really picture him training a bit since he had nothing better to do. But right now, I am ready to give him a bit of pleasure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, no fair Akeno! I am the first to do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I will not back down either!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three ran a bit to the bed and almost jumped on it as they hugged Issei. But there was something off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akeno, move a little. I am only touching your breast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? but I don't feel anything. Also Asia, am I touching your hair by mistake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No. I thought it was Rias-oneesan's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? But I am on top of Ise. How can you touch my hair if you are on the side?... Wait. If you are on my left, Akeno is on my right and I am on top... Then whose breast am I touching.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the three heard a soft groan from the person sitting on the bed. After the person clicked their fingers, the light came on, and the three were shocked to see who was on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome home Senpai.... Ah... While I am happy you came home, can you please not squeeze my breast so hard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one thing the three could do right: scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KYAAAAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What Ikaruga looks like: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fu-reiji.deviantart.com/art/Cherry-Blossom-date-648694949\" target=\"_blank\">http://fu-reiji.deviantart.com/art/Cherr...</a>)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The three girls quickly got off the bed and jumped next to the door as the girl who was on Issei's bed rubbed their eyes as she looked at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you please not scream Senpais. I haven't been feeling well today. There was this shiver on my way home and the fever-like condition not too long ago. Not to mention the irritation- W-What's wrong Rias-san? Akeno-san? Asia-san? Why are you looking at me like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Who are you and what are you doing on Ise's bed?\", yelled Rias with a glare as she regained her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rias-san, what are you talking about? It's me Ikaruga. And who is this Ise you've mentioned?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of question is that? You come here right in Issei's bedroom and you say you don't know him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we we don't know you! And why are you here?\", asked Akeno in an angry tone as she also regained her composure, with Asia giving a pleading face to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please tell us what happened to Ise-san?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to you? Why are you acting like that?... I know. Rias-san please look for the Pawn Pieces you've put in me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Rias wanted to tell her off, her pleading eyes and genuine pleading she was receiving from Ikaruga made her check just in case. When she did, she got shocked to the point where she didn't know what to believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-How can this be?! The 8 Pawns you have in you... are mine....\", exclaimed Rias stupefied as Asia and Akeno looked at her in pure bewilderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see Rias-san? I am your servant, just as I said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But this can't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the rest of the ORC entered the room in response to Rias' scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buchou! What's... wrong....\", was all Xenovia could say before she and the others looked at Ikaruga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xenovia-san! Everyone, what's going on with Asia-san and Senpais? Why are they so frantic and....\" Upon noticing that the girls were staring at her and at her chest, she his hem a bit with her hands as she blushed. \"C-Can you please not stare too much ? It's a bit embarrassing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls immediately blushed upon seeing the nervous girl fidget and slowly turned their heads and apologized... Koneko didn't believe it was possible for someone to scold her for staring at a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rias-san, Please calm down. We don't want the parents to come here and see what's going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rossweisse, what's happening? Who is this girl? Why does this girl say she is part of my Peerage and why does she has the 8 Pawn Pieces that Ise should have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing that, the teacher's expression narrowed. \"It's just as I feared...\" Meanwhile, Ravel also managed to realized what happened... and with a dead voice she told everyone her discovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ikaruga-san... is Ise-sama...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls doubted their ears when they heard that, until they looked at the room. The opened closet showed a multitude of girl clothes complete with Kuoh's female uniform, there was a vanity in the back of the room, with a wooden sword next to it and after looking at the photo Rossweisse brought with her... Rias and Akeno were ready to faint, with Asia and Irina not far behind and Xenovia and Koneko stood motionless with their mouths opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please forgive them. They inhaled too much of an incense during the spa treatment. They said it could cause hallucinations and similar effects should too much be taken in.\", explained Rossweisse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my... Will everyone be alright? Do we need to call a doctor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't worry Ikaruga-san. It will pass after they will take a some fresh air. Now if you can please excuse us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. If anything happens, please call me. I am more than willing to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRossweisse nodded as she managed somehow to make the other girls to have the willpower to leave the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Rias' room, everyone has gather, still in shock of what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please tell me this is just the work of a magician or a Blance Breaker. I... How can that girl be Ise? It makes no sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that again. She even seems to be the complete opposite of how he is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already looked at the pictures on display and judging by Ikaruga-san's and her parents' response, it is likely the rest of the world doesn't remember Issei-kun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why do we remember then?\", asked Asia in half-tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe because we are Devils. Whatever turned Issei-kun into a girl seems to not have an effect on us. It is safe to say that Sona-san and her Peerage would also be unaffected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what could've made this happen?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. But I noticed something with Ikaruga-san's aura. Other than the energy that a Devil would emit, I also found some residual aura that seems to be the cause of what happened. It is possible it is something made by someone since it is odd to affect only him..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what would...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias and Akeno paused. Issei, a weird spell or curse and a person who was behind all this. This was a familiar pattern... The concern and fear on their faces was immediately replaced by rage as Rias made a communication circle next to her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What is it Gremory? It's quite late right now. Can't this wait until-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"What on Earth have you done Azazel?!\"\", yelled the two girls in unison. \"\"Why is Ise a girl?!\"\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! There's no need to yell. I can hear you fine and- Wait. Ise is a girl?! What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't play dumb Azazel. I know you are behind this! Whenever something weird happens to Ise, you are responsible for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear I didn't do anything! Look, I will see what happened okay? Until then, remain at your house and we will talk about this tomorrow... I know you want to come here and blast me to the moon without letting me say a thing, but we don't want to confuse girl Ise or your parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Fine. But you better find something by tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias angrily finished the conversation as Azazel gave a deep sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ise is a girl? How? Did the Gender Switch ray got lost? Nah, I made sure not to misplace that thing.\" He thought for a few more minutes as he leaned on his chair, until he looked  a box with various items in it. Then, a sudden realization came to him as he face-palmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please tell me I did not lost that thing... I'm so screwed...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as sunrise came next day, Azazel barely had time to come to to the ORC club before he was faced with Rias and the other girls. Most had a concerned look on their faces, but Rias, Akeno, Koneko and Xenovia in particular seemed like they were ready to attack him on the spot. After everyone went in ,as the possibility that a crater was to be formed where Azazel would be was quite high, if he didn't fins any solution, so they wanted to make things as conspicuous as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Where is Ise, or rather Ikaruga?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At home. We told her we had some private business with you so she went out shopping, waiting for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...That's a shame. I thought how she would be. She really seemed to be quite the beauty...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eyes that were looking at Azazel weren't amused at all by the joke he made as Akeno was ready to zap him as he must've put cameras in their house... again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better have an explanation Azazel. If Ise is to stay a girl... not even Onii-sama would be able to save you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right... Now, where do I start...?\", said Azazel with a nervous sigh upon hearing Rias' words. \"Not too long ago, I asked Zeus to give me some magical items to study from different gods. One of the things I got from Poseidon were these wishing pearls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wishing pearls?\", asked everyone in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... It is something the mermaids came up with, by injecting large amounts of magic energy into a pearl that exists only in Poseidon's waters, which already is something that has magic properties. After some trial and error, they managed to give the pearls the ability to grant wishes that, as long as they are not something massive that could change history or things like that, to be able to grant people's desires.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were shocked to hear this and Rossweisse was also awe-struck a bit by the news as well. But something was off for the girls...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on. Are you telling us Ise wished to become a girl?! That's beyond absurd!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rias is right. Why would he want that? He would rather wish for girls to appear in front of him, not to become a girl himself.\", continued Akeno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! And even if he would why would he turn into a random girl like that? She doesn't even look like a female version of Ise!\", said Xenovia s Irina followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why wouldn't he keep his memories or personality? As much as I like Ikaruga-san's purity, she is the complete opposite of Ise-kun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were waiting for the Fallen Angel to give as reply, as Asia prayed to herself to not be something serious. Sighing yet again, Azazel picked up a video game box and snapped his fingers as a screen appear out of nowhere. The games' name was \"Senran Kagura Estival Versus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you showing us this? And what does this have anything to do with Ise?\", asked Rias as the girls looked at him in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a game Ise told me to order on the Internet. He couldn't find this anywhere in the local shops, so he asked me to use my network to buy this thing online and pay me back for it later. The game is about modern Japanese school girls that live a double life as a ninja. Now take a look at this.\" He snapped his fingers again and the image went to an Internet page. \"This is the roster of the game. Now look at this character.\", said the Fallen Angel as he zoomed on an image of a girl in a white uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon looking at the character, the girls' jaws dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But that's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ikaruga-san?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. She is a character in the game. I doubt the Ikaruga you have at home wears this outfit, but it's surely the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... we know who she is. But why is Ise-kun-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please be patient a bit.\" Azazel then put on a recording of Issei getting beaten by the Kendo club. \"This is from yesterday... After I got the items I stored them in a box and went to my office. However, I tripped near the locker rooms and the box fell down. I guess there is where I lost the pearl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen one of the girls picked a small shiny orb as Issei left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the pearl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, aren't those two the girls who usually chase Issei around whenever he is found peeping?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed they are. And what the girl wished is that they wouldn't have to deal with Ise anymore... As for where Ikaruga came from, when he and his friend talked about the game and commented on Ikaruga's personality, which seems to hate perverted acts and such, they wished back then that she would exist. This is purely speculation, but I think when she made the wish, she must've thought of the Ikaruga thing as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were stumped. They could never think that such an innocent mistake, from Azazel of all people, could spill into something like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it really was just a chair of events...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Also you should be happy things didn't change more than they already did. If it was a complete replica, not only would she be a ninja, but she would also have a brother and would be a sword fighter as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would explain the chess pieces. She is still a member of my peerage... Wait what about the Boosted Gear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I manged to contact Ddraig after you called me... He was quite broken. He slept through half of the changes and had to watch the other half happen. As disturbing as it was to watch that, he manged to keep more or less his cool. she can still use the Boosted Gear's power, but Ddraig doesn't think she can use Balance Breaker as the link between the two is blocked by the change...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzazel continued detailing some more things as the others listened carefully.Soon, the girls finally understood the whole situation. Given everything that happened to Ise, they were relieved that it was something reversible as it was the result of a wish that can be undone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Azazel. Now jut give us another pearl to undo the change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err... You see, we could have a problem...\", said Azazel nervously as the girls looked at him a bit fearful. \"I... told Zeus to give me just one pearl, and since the one I had was already used, we might need to ask him for one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we have to wait for it to get here?\", asked Asia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... There's another problem as well. Zeus, and the other Greek gods will attend a meeting with the other European deities. And since the subject is about Rivezim and Trihexia, it will take a while...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two weeks... And add another week for the pearls to get here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\", yelled the girls in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to wait a month for the pearl to get here? I hope you are not pulling our leg here Azazel. because if you do-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear I am not lying! If you don't believe me, then put Rossweisse ask Odin. He'll tell you the exact same thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A month without my Ise... How will I survive this...?\", asked Akeno in despair as the girls were with their morale literally gone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Chill down okay. It's not as if he's not actually here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azazel. He's not here. I can tell you that based on last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax. I'll call Zeus as soon as possible. Until then, try to enjoy your time with Ikaruga. If she is the way the game describes her, it should be quite pleasant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls gave a sigh of defeat, thinking about their Sensei's words. Hopefully it won't be so bad...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The following weeks went by as without surprise, Ikaruga was already integrated in the modified reality. She was part of the Kendo club and really good friends with Katase and Murayama. She also was sharing their views with perverted acts, which made her punish Matsuda and Motohama whenever the peeped as well. However, she would also keep a small speech trying to persuade the two to stop peeping and be more polite, which however fell on deaf ears. What was surprising about the two was that they kept their word in the end and despite staring at her figure, the two never actually got too interested in Ikaruga. She also was deemed one of the beauties of Kuoh Academy as her grades were on par with Rias and Akeno and her jovial, kind and polite nature attracted both male and female fans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the ORC, things were... interesting to say the least. Since the events played in the ravenette's head just like they were before, but with her as a girl and other things here and there changed, the group had to behave like they normally did. It turned out that Ikaruga was actually bisexual, which made her attracted both to boys and girls. Kiba and Gasper, despite feeling honored to be praised by Ikaruga and enjoyed their time with her, felt quite awkward and embarrassed  around her since they knew in reality it was Issei and she won't stick around too much, so they tried to be as formal as possible, despite her slight affection towards them. Rossweisse wasn't too bothered and quite enjoyed the girls' company and liked her well-mannered nature a lot, despite missing Issei a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls... didn't take the situation too good though. Xenovia really couldn't have much time for her usual activities that she usually did with Issei such as playing games, going to the karaoke bar or going to the track field to run together. Instead, she went shopping, watched romance shows and went to traditional Japanese restaurants and cafes. While it wasn't actually unpleasant, the fact that she couldn't do what she loved to due to Ikaruga's more feminine nature, really brought her morale down quite a bit. Koneko, Ravel and Irina, while not as demoralized as Xenovia, couldn't really enjoy their time with Ikaruga since they really missed Issei a lot, as seeing a complete opposite of him in the form of a girl, that was against perverted acts really game a bittersweet taste in their mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias, Asia and Akeno were the ones that were the most devastated by this. Akeno really didn't find comfort in doing the same things she did with Issei such as cooking lunches for him, strolling through the park and studying together, with Ikaruga. In fact, she was actually slightly angry that she had to do these really enjoyable activities with someone who wasn't Issei against her will. As for Rias and Asia, besides the fact that they had to share the same bed with Ikaruga, the fact that they did all the things they did with Issei, including bathing, really made the two very uncomfortable. They just couldn't see her as the man they loved despite her signs that she is surely in love with them. The only thing the two found similar between Ikaruga and Issei was their shyness when it came to love, but she had an edge in terms of a bit more open than him. But all in all, it was unpleasant nonetheless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 3 weeks passed, Azazel received a few pearls  from Zeus and as soon as they arrived, the girls immediately took one and wished for Issei to come back. The wish was a success, and he returned to normal, much to everyone's joy. However, since it wasn't too explicit, he still found himself without any memory of what happened the past 3 weeks. With some help from Azazel, Sona and Ddraig, they managed to pull off the lie of a sudden attack from the magicians that made him lose his memories. He still was a bit confused about this, but eventually swallowed the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was now playing the game he asked Azazel to buy, playing Ikaruga of all people as the girls prepared to g on a shopping trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you don't want to come Ise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Rias, we went shopping 3 days ago. I personally don't need anything. And I must still study for the test on Monday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my break. Don't worry. I won't stay much longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so...\", sighed Rias as she and the girls looked at the character Issei was playing and sweat dropped a bit. \"So you're playing as Ikaruga?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I can't tell why, but I feel some sort of... affinity. I am not sure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I had this craving for green tea stuff for a while, I am a bit interested in sword fighting and I began to organize my dresser much better now.\", said Issei as the girls looked at him nervously. \"Also, I had these weird dreams with having her in my place... Do you find that weird?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\", said all the girls awkwardly before leaving quickly afterward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei wondered what was going on with them a they left. \"I wonder if something happened. Ever since the whole memory loss thing, they've been acting weird... What exactly happened though? They are not telling me anything too detailed and not even Ddraig or Sensei said anything... Oh well. I guess I will never find out then. But I doubt it's that important since everything turned out good.\", thought Issei as he returned to his game. \"I never thought I would like Ikaruga, but she is quite cute... I wonder how would she be if she really existed...? Or any of the other girls for that matter? Well, I guess I can still dream...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a rainy Monday in Kuoh City. It was about 10 in the morning and by now most students were already at school... However, Issei was not, and was right now yawning as he just woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sure was a good sleep... I really need to thank Rias for this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYesterday, Morisawa and Mil-tan kept him late into their night with their requests and on top of than, an incident with a rogue magician, which made him use his Balance Breaker, really drained him out as he went to sleep at 3AM. Unlike the girls who managed to rest a bit until the fight, he was so tired that Rias and Rossweisse told him to take the day off as it was no point coming to school and relax. He initially protested, but when the others, especially Asia and Ravel told him to not put his health in jeopardy just trying to make everyone happy, he relented and allowed them to excuse him for today. He was a bit worried, but Rias and Akeno assured him they also needed to have some rest days in the past, so there shouldn't be any problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter brushing his teeth, he looked outside at the dark clouds and the pouring rain..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, the weather is horrible. When they said it would rain a lot, they didn't joke. I guess I can't get outside like this...\", he murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then went into his room to dress up. Since he wouldn't leave due to the weather, he didn't bother putting on socks as it still was a warm day. It was laundry day today, so most of his clothes or either drying or in the hamper, so with no other option left at the moment, he put on the casual Kuoh Academy uniform with his signature red T-shirt underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dressing, he then checked the Boosted Gear for Ddraig. He was still sleeping as recently, besides trying to unlock more powers for him to use, he also suffered some migraines with the \"Oopai Dragon\" show as it gotten quite tiring for him listening the opening theme and all the discussion regarding it and so, he decided to sleep to get rid of his worries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that there was no distraction at the moment and since he was already feeling quite refreshed, he grinned as he took a game he hid in his mattress. It was \"Senran Kagura Estival Versus\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, It's showtime.\", he smiled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe learned of the game from Matsuda and Motohama, his fellow perverted friends, which were now quite angry regarding his closeness to the ORC girls, but still taked to him. While he didn't find the girls actually be ninjas like the game described them, he learned from the two that they were giving a \"modern\" take on the concept as the way people know ninjas was deemed by Motohama too \"basic\" and the game needed something new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bought it as soon as he could and started playing the game in secret from the girls. While there wasn't anything erotic or naughty, it sure seemed like something that was modeled to his taste. The gameplay, the visuals, even the characters were awesome. But there was one figure in particular he was quite curious about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard the next chapter will be featuring Haruka-san. I really wanted to play her for a while...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike most serious characters the game had such as Ikaruga, Yozakura and Yumi, which really put a stop to Issei's fantasies, Haruka charmed him with how despite the fact she seemed almost as perverted as him or even on par with him, she still was like a big sister to the group. It gave her a charm which made her similar to Akeno a bit even, with her playful, yet mature side balancing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was a problem with him playing the game... During the last game session, Xenovia broke the console after several losses in a row to Irina and Issei in a fighting game. She got really apologetic afterward and begged to be forgiven, but knowing her personality, Issei immediately forgave her as he knew it was an accident. Currently, the console was out being repaired, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got a prototype console from Azazel a few days ago. He said he made it to try and replicate, and even improve the conditions of playing games by adding several features such as virtual game immersion and real-life vision, and even the ability to make characters come into real life and become part of reality. Issei wasn't too sure of the last feature as it could really bring quite a lot of trouble... but nonetheless the console functioned perfectly, which made Issei really happy to have a replacement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe plugged the game in, and after enjoying the intro, he got into story mode and started to fight as Haruka, her unique fighting style showing through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man... It would be amazing if she existed in real life... She would be such good friends with Rias and Akeno-san... But I really don't think I need it. I have such wonderful people around me. I wouldn't trade my life for a game character.\", mused Issei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was playing, a stray lighting hit a power cable. While it didn't snap, it made the street go in a blackout. Also, the electricity found its way through the Hyoudou house and with the luck he had, it zapped Issei and and the console, knocking him off from the shock. Unknown to him however, the console made some weird noises as it was zapped as Haruka's data was transferred and was trying to activate the real-life materialization, but since it broke down mid-way, another method to make her become real was triggered...</span></div></div>",

Compared the the electric attacks he normally had to deal with, this was nothing, but his body felt a little weird for some reason... When he regained his vision, he saw that the lights were off that some smoke was coming from the console.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap! Did the lightning hit our house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he looked outside, he saw that the other houses on the street were also with their lights out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A blackout? That sure explains a lot... But how did the shock got here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took the console out next to the window to examine it. The cable looked fried, but the console itself seemed fine, only that it seemed that it's battery was also done for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, this is such a shame! And it worked fine too!\" He then took out his phone to try and call someone... only to see that he couldn't. \"What? Even the phone doesn't work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon closer inspection, he saw that he could still send out messages, but he didn't receive any reception for any calls or the Internet. Just then, a message from Azazel came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ise, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then replied back. \"Yes. But the lights are out and the reception is gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen that too. Seems like a power line somewhere was hit. I already looked it up and someone is trying to connect your street to a different line so that you will have energy until the damage is repaired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know that?... Actually, please don't say how...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I put a back-up generator in your house. If you wait a few minutes, I will turn it on. But the reception is something different. You should wait until later in the afternoon for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it.\", messaged Issei before he saw his phone blinking. \"Damn, looks like my battery is out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About that. You shouldn't charge the phone until the rain goes down a bit. The chance of another blackout may be possible, and you surely don't want your phone to die completely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Rias?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I'll tell her about the situation and that you are fine. I am sure that once school is done she will come home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please tell her to not rush it. I don't want her to miss any classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, aren't you considerate as always... Heh. Well, I'll tell her. Until then, just sit on tight until the energy comes back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I will.\", he texted just as the phone battery went down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed as he laid in his bed, his phone next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if I should've told him about the console as well... Nah, he won't be mad about it.. Knowing him, he will just build another one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he laid down, the data transmission was done. Soon, Issei was going to get his wish come true in a way he didn't expect...</span></div></div>",

Did I left the window open? I don't recall being this cold a little while ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up and looked at the windows behind the bed. Indeed there was a partially opened window, but as he closed it, he realized the cold air couldn't have come just from one opening. But since there wasn't any other direction the cold could have come from, he simply thought it was just a breeze that passed through as he sat back on his bed, trying to get a bit more warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout noticing, the cold was actually because his body hair completely vanished, leaving his skin a little sensitive. But he was slowly adapting to the temperature, and soon, he laid down as he didn't felt cold anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what that was... Well, I should actually think what to do with the game now that I think about it. I just hope it isn't burnt like the cable was... Either Sensei forgot to ground the socket, or the console was susceptible to the whole thing... Normally, it doesn't make sense, but i decided to drop that thing with Sensei's weird devices... I wonder how long the lights will be out... Oh well, I guess I can wait a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then went into his little fantasy world, imagining the girls, and sometimes remembering them, making advances to him in different provocative situations. As he did, his feet became smaller as his toes became dainty and getting a pedicure. Also, his black pants were starting to get tighter on him as they began to lighten a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he was thinking, he noticed something regarding his memories with the girls... which made him a bit disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I really that flustered around them? We've been for almost a year together, and I still feel shy around them? Man, i really need to pull myself together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his perverted mind and antics, he usually doesn't exhibit a lot of confidence around the girls, especially in public. He went over his initial trauma with Raynare, and was able to finally be together with Rias and everybody romantically, now that he knows they truly love him... But he always deflected any provocative actions made by the girls at school and was still getting flustered with their actions at times. He didn't pay any mind to this before, and decided to just let things go with the flow... but he suddenly was feeling that he was not only acting like a scared rabbit... but also like a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those girls need someone that can measure up to them in confidence. How can I compare myself with them in decisiveness if even Asia is getting bold? I need to think of a way to be more mature as well... I am still unsure of myself even now of what to do with the girls...\"</span></div></div>",

Along with some buzzing around the house, it signified that things went back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess Sensei brought back the energy.\", smiled Issei. \"But I can't charge up my phone until the rain dims out a bit... I should check myself to see if anything happened due to the shock from before though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then left for his bathroom and took off his T-shirt and shirt to see if there were any marks. He didn't notice any, but he did notice how hairless his skin looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What happened? Did the zap burn my hair? Weird that it was only that... Still, I guess I look better that way...\", he smiled to himself as he didn't know where the last part came from. As he admired his skin, his hands began to slim down a little as his fingers became longer. \"Well, I don't mind it if it is just that... I should see if the TV is working...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put his clothes back on as he returned to his room. He then sat in front of his large-screen TV and wasn't surprised to see the \"No reception\" message on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figures. But there should be some channels that should be available. I mean, it works on Devil Technology.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then surfed through the channels, most of them being either without service or the reception was so bad, it couldn't be understood what was on. As he was still looking, a part of him wanted to check the console to see if the game was alright. But he couldn't do that as he didn't want to zap himself again, so he began to imagine the girls in the game a bit instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe images of girls in swimsuits were popping out in his head. His thoughts stopped on a pink-haired girl names Hibari for a second before he went to the other girls. As he did, his calves started to alter as the muscles shifted. They became smaller, but remained toned as some mass was slowly going upwards towards his thighs. Also, his white dress shirt was losing his black highlights as his sleeves receded to around his elbows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was something he noticed. The image of a girl he was quite fond of, didn't seem to pop out in his head. He knew she was mature, but a bit devious and playful as well. He wanted to try and remember her, when a random strand of hair obscured his vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Is the humidity that bad? Why is my fair falling like this? I mean there was that cold air a second ago... but my feet don't feel cold. Hey Ddraig, is something wrong with my body?\", he asked his partner as he lifted his left arm up, but was surprised to not hear anyone. \"Seriously? He's still sleeping? Well, after last night and his own agenda, I guess I can't blame him. Oh well, i guess I'll ask him later. Besides, it's just hair.\", he told himself as he brushed the bang off to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he didn't notice was that his hair wasn't affected by the humidity, but was actually changing. His bangs were losing their usual spikiness and instead became a bit wavy in some spots as the color lightened by a shade or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter going through 50 channels, Issei only found some channels which were in different languages, a documentary about Antarctica, which didn't impress him, and a soap opera, which he didn't feel like watching. When he was about to give up and turn the TV off, he found something that caught his attention.</span></div></div>",

While his grades were in top 10 of his class, he never actually watched many documentaries outside the ones that he either needed for school or more recently, were about mythology. But this one seemed not just interesting to him right now, but also seemed helpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder... Maybe if I bring some of these concoctions in battle I would be able to inflict an ailment on the enemy. It sure looks helpful...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't an ace at chemistry, nor was it his favorite subject, but right now, he was diligently watching the documentary. As the host presented different substances that were either man-made or found in nature in different combinations which had various effects on people, some changes happened in Issei's room. At his desk, a small chemistry set appeared as a few chemistry and biology books popped up as well next to his \"special\" magazines. But there were also a few books about puppetry as well among them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... This is quite helpful. Maybe making some bombs with these things to confuse foes would be helpful. I can easily ask Sensei to bring me some of these ingredients...\", murmured Issei, without noticing his voice raised by an octave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued watching, the displaced matter that left his calves reached his thighs as they started to change. The muscles were slowly being replaced by fat, along with mass that came up. However, the muscles that remained unchanged were as strong as they were before, and maybe even a tad more flexible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made him feel a bit aroused by the fact that his manhood was a bit crushed now, but decided to ignore the feeling for now, desiring to watch the show. But as he did, he once again started thinking about the missing girl from his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder who she was? She was also very pretty as well... Well, not as good looking as Rias and- No, focus on the show Iasai. You can fantasize later.\", he scolded himself without noticing the way he called himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile his mind was wondering, his red T-shirt began to get a bit softer as while the show continued his sleeves were starting to recede as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after about 45 minutes, when the documentary ended and gave a preview of the next episode, Iasai smiled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, that should give some valuable information for my next concoction... Fufu... I guess soon I can really tell an enemy to \"pick his poison\". After all, I think I have quite a few ideas of how to win without working too much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to his closet, right near the window, there was now a box, which said \"Caution. Might cause severe ailments if not careful\", which contained a small number of Iasai's concoctions. And their number will soon multiply without a doubt...</span></div></div>",

For a second though, he wanted to sit down and was confused why would he try to do it. As he was doing his business, he went back to his thoughts about himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That show about those substances will be helpful for the next battle I will have. After all, I need to put on a lot more effort in my fights. All I do is relying on the Boosted Gear, and not actively doing anything else if I don't use it... I am sure Rias would appreciate it more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he thought, his hair once again grew, this time covering his ears. All the spikiness was gone as well as any greasiness his hair had, not being smooth and silky. Also, it became a lot more wavy. But while there were some bangs that here still unruly, the ones that were framing his face were curling a little at their ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, even she said not to depend on it too much to take care of my problems. I need a more diverse repertoire of moves... Maybe I could ask Rossweisse-sensei to teach me some enchant  or ailment spells. I know my magic proficiency is not as high as the one she or Asia have, but it is worth a shot. I mean, I can't picture me being a sword fighter. Despite having Ascalon, I barely use it, and I can't measure to Kiba or Xenovia in terms of ability... not to mention that I am not up for such a direct way to fight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his desire to go right up and fight the enemy, he now began thinking of ways to fight without a direct assault, as it seemed to him much more fitting to do that. Also, memories of using advanced techniques of the Balance Breaker were now replaced with him using spells that disorientate and damage foes over time instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he finished, he washed his smaller, more dainty hands and went downstairs to have a small snack. As he went down the stairs, the cold sensation from before returned as his skin softened and tanned itself a bit, becoming nice and peachy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is that cold again... Are there any opened windows left? But my feet aren't cold despite the fact that I don't even wear my socks... I am sure it will pass if I ignore it. I mean, until a second ago I was fine.\", he thought as he buttoned up his dress shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever as he walked, his walk began to change as he started to shake his hips, which started now to grow a bit, as he put one foot in front of each other. Also, his black pants continued to lighten as they became a dark grey color as they began climbing up his legs, now exposing half of his calves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs in regards of the game, he pretty much decided to forget about the girl he couldn't remember, as he saw it as a distraction... not that he will remember her anyway soon enough. And there was something else he was forgetting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was I going to ask someone something...? Was it about my health?... I am feeling quite fine though. That shock hurt a little, but it wasn't anything major in comparison to the electric attacks of those magicians... or Akeno-senpai for that matter... Well, I'll just ask Rias once the reception comes back.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once in the kitchen, he initially wanted to go for a desert. Irina and Asia practiced doing some desert mochi last night and his mom, taking some inspiration from Rias, made some fruit tarts as well. But there was a thought which made him not desire either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As good as either of these sounds, I must look for something else. I must keep my figure after all, and not to mention I don't want to put on any excess fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he thought that, his hips expanded once again, as beside his now larger pelvis, some fat was gathering on his sides as well as they stretched his boxers and pants a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then checked the cabinets around the kitchen to see if there was something else. There were some salty snacks around, but none seemed like what he wanted to eat. He then checked the pantry and inside was surprised to see something he never saw before in there: a bag of kombu chips. He picked it up and looked at the description on the package. It said it has been fried and seasoned with sugar, but it said it still packed a lot of nutrients and were a great source of dietary fibers and was great to break down sugars that were normally indigestible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile eating some algae was something that Issei would never eat on its own, he considered it a lot more now. Before, he also wanted to keep himself fit and healthy, but he would compromise from time to time whenever the girls wanted to give him something. That still applied now, but he seemed a lot more conscious about his weight than before though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took one chip from the bag and when he bit into it... he was surprised to find out how good it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, these are really good!\", he said out loud as he took another one. \"If the nutritious part about these is true, then I should buy these much more often... This nutty flavour combined with the sweetness and sourness really make them delicious! I would take these over a normal bag of chips any day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took the a few more, and slowly he ate them as he looked outside. As he did, his arms slimmed down, becoming slim, but still toned. Normally, he would cry seeing his muscles he earned so hard after Tannin's training and then some, but when he looked at them, he seemed oddly pleased with how they looked, also admiring his now manicured hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, it seemed the rain wasn't pouring as hard as before. There were still thunders roaring, but it surely looked like an improvement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it's not as bad anymore. Maybe it is safe now to charge up my phone now.\", he thought as he eat another chip before closing the bag and putting it back in the pantry. As much as he would've liked to eat the entire bag, he wanted to have some for later. And maybe even sharing them with Rias or Akeno, as they also were preoccupied with their figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then took a green tea drink from the fridge and drank from it as his waist was slowly starting to compress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah... Nothing better for digestion than some green tea after some kombu.\", he smiled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another gulp, he put the bottle back in the fridge and went back to his room.</span></div></div>",

He then took his charger and sat on a chair next to the socket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sensei said I should charge my phone after the rain dims down a little... But I don't know if it's safe yet. The storm doesn't seem to stop anytime soon...\", he thought. But then a he felt a bit down, upon noticing his behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is wrong with me? I am supposed to be a lot more confident and I am fidgeting over a socket that might zap me... As much as I don't want to get hurt over something like this, I still must be more brave in my actions... Just as the girls are with their advances...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon getting to the last part, Iasai's mind started to wanted off to the girls, remembering the times they tried to get more intimate with him. As he was thinking, his seating was starting to feel a lot more cushy as his ass was starting to get inflate, getting bigger with each thought. With his lower body growing, his pants became tighter and tighter as his thighs went through one more growth spurt and became large, but also toned, albeit not as muscular as they one were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I really need to step up my game. I mean, when they are trying to get closer to me, the first thing I do is panic and get flustered... It's quite infuriating.\" As he continued his line of thought, his pants turned a silver color as they were now just below his knees, exposing his new calves. Another thing that happened was that his dress shirt lost its collar as together with his T-shirt were starting to lower themselves, exposing his collarbone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must try and get more assertive. I am Iasuai Hyoudou, Pawn of Rias Gremory. I must be more bold!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then put the charger in the socket with confidence and unsurprisingly, he didn't end up electrocuting himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you look at that. Seems there was no need to panic after all. I must be like this more often.\", he smiled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIasuai waited for a few minutes for his phone to charge, before writing a message to Rias to tell about what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sure you know by now, but there was a blackout. Sensei turned on the backup generator for the house on, so we have power again. But there is no signal yet, so I can't call you yet. We will meet after classes.\" He took a glance at his message and felt it seemed to formal and uninteresting, so with a devious smile, he also wrote: \"I can't wait for you to come back. I may need an \"examination\" to see if I am still feeling sick. We might even need a \"nurse\" to come as well. See ya later!\" And then he sent it, with a sly grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fufufu... This surely is much better. I am sure at least Asia will get flustered about the message...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thinking was interrupted however by some pressure in his abdomen, which made him raise an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I need to use the bathroom already? But I just went not that long ago and I didn't drink much of that tea... Oh well, it's nature's call so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then left the phone on his desk and went towards the bathroom as the material of his pants was starting to become softer.</span></div></div>",

As soon as tey exited the classroom, were joined by Asia, who came up to them regarding the blackout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is Ise-san? Did Something happen during the blackout?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as far as Azazel said. He turned on the emrgency generator that we had and said Ise was fine when he called him. But his phone died and had to wait until the storm died down a bit, so that there was no risk to get electrocuted.\", replied Rias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But still... I haven't seen a storm like this in a long time. It reminds me of a thypoon a little.\", said Akeno, while looking outside. \"Fortunately it isn't. I checked the weather report, and they said that by the time we end our classes, the rain should stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't help but feel a bit bad for Ise. First that tiredness from last night, and now this? We should comfort him when we get home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... I think there is no reception yet as even ours is a bit jumbled up. He must be bored out of his mind by now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Rias received a message. Knowing the circumstances, she immediately knew it was Issei and opened it. She, Akeno and Asia read the message. They were happy to know that nothing happened, but couldn't help but blush when they read the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-That's a bit bold... Even for Ise...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ara ara, seems like our little Pawn is starting to grow... Fufufufu\", giggled Akeno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I am happy that Ise-san seems more open... But it is a little sudden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... I wonder where the \"nurse\" part came from, but if I were to guess, he may have gotten the idea from the time we took care of him before... Still, to ask something llike this seems a little too uch coming from- Eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias was confused when her eyes darted back to the sender of the message. She only saw the \"I\" at the beginning, so she thought it was Issei. But the name that was on the phone was something completely different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iasuai? What's that name?\", asked the hedhead as the othe girls looked at the phone at were now as bewildered as her regarding the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Rias... Did you wrote down Ise's name wrong? That's a pretty far cry from it though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I haven't... I-I don't know how it changed like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you pressed something by accident. The family name is still listed as \"Hyoudou\".\", said Asia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe... I'll rewrite it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter changing the name on the phone, the three went to meet the others and discuss about their plans for today. Although rias was starting to feel like something was off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at home, Iasuai went back to the bathroom and pulled down his pants and boxers, but this time, the need to sit on the toilet was much stronger and thus, he sat down. He didn't hink it was any problem with doing this as he was alone and was also starting to feel more comfortable this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was some pressure, but there I don't recall drinking enough for me to need to use the restroom so quicky. I wonder why...\", he wondered as his speech pattern was getting more complex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he sat there, his rear continued to inflate, making the sitting feel more cushy. As for the pressure he was feeling, it was in reality his waist caving in. It became a lot thinner, but despite the loss of mass in the region, it still was a bit toned, although it wasn't visible too much right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter se sat down for another minute, and seeing that there wasn't much of a reason to come as the pressure was not almost gone, he put back on his clothes. His proportions were nearly done, but he still needed a little more time for them to reach their final size. His groin was feeling a little tight now due to the fact that hid thighs and his tighter pants were making his manhood a little uncomfortable, and also made him a bit aroused. And f it wasn't enough, his own red boxers became tighter on him, as they began to get silkier as well. But he decided to ignore the feeling, as he compared it to the pressure he felt earlier, and deducted it would go away eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter washing his hands, he wanted to leave, but a few bangs fell on his face. When he looked in the mirror, his hair was now a light brown, much brighter than his original dark color. But he was a distracted with something else isntead...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn.. I didn't realize my hair was this messy. I need to- Hmm?\" His thoughts were interrupted when he noticed something on the counter.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was a large, pink bow on the counter next to the sink. But other than the fact that it appeared out of nowhere, there was something else that bothered Iasuai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who does this belong to? It can be Xenovia's or Koneko's that's for sure. Rias and Asia... they do wear bows at times, but not something this big... Is this some sort of replacement for Rossweisse-san? She did use one to tie up her hair... And speaking of hair...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he looked back in the mirror, the length of his hair was now around his shoulder blades, and while some of it was neatly kept, there was a bang that was falling on his face, along with some wild hair here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really need to brush my hair...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then took a dark-pink brush that was on the counter, that he assumed was either belonging to his mom or Rias, but he was slowly thinking that it belonged in fact to him. As he was taking care of his mane, the tips of the bangs that framed his face started to curl as he brushed them. Slowly, the curls were becoming a lot more prominent, so in the end, they would resemble two small cylinders. The hairstyle he settled for was a neatly done, with some unkempt bangs here and there to give some uniqueness, other than the two large curls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... This looks very nice. I wonder if Rias will appreciate my new hairstyle...\", he laughed a little before his face started to itch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing where the itch came from, he began washing his face, while still thinking about the girls, playing with his hair. As he did that, his face became rounder as his lips got a bit plumper and gained a small pout. His cheekbones grew higher while his nose and ears became smaller. Lastly, his eyes became bigger as they changed color from brown to green his small eyebrows enhancing their beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he dried himself up, he looked at himself with a hint of pride upon seeing his reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, while I may not be the fittest of the group like Xenovia or Irina, I sure am getting a lot of points for looking good. After all, it would be a shame if my smarts and my Devil abilities were the only thing I would be blessed with.\", he said in an higher octave as he posed a little. Without noticing, the buttons on his dress shirt completely disappeared as its color was starting to turn from white to yellow and the material was becoming tougher and thicker. \"But I must be level-headed. After all, Rias fell in love with Iasukai, the boy who is perverted, kind and caring. I surely do not need prideful in the profile.\", he giggled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before leaving, he look again at the bow and then remembered something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I leave my bow here? Huh... I must've forgotten with the black out and all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then put the pink accessory on top of his head, thinking how good it suits him before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of his knowledge about the Boosted Gear's power was mostly gone by now. He remembered the basics, and was able to enter Balance Breaker, but with a lot more effort than before. This was because his abilities were now distributed in other areas. His magic compatibility was much higher, giving him the possibility to use a vast array of spells. Combined with his new found dexterity and knowledge about plants and chemicals, he was able to inflict curses, various ailments, perform some healing, and even summon illusory soldiers that somewhat resembled a combination of robots and puppets for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the Boosted Gear, Ddraig was just waking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah... I haven't slept like this in a while. Forgive me partner, but it seems I haven't really recovered after all the things that happened recently. With all that fighting yesterday... and that blasted theme song... Forgive me, I know I said I was mostly over it, but I swear that bastard Fallen Angel is making new lyrics for another season of that show... Hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe expected Issei to respond back to him, or at least sigh, but instead he was mt with silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ise? Is something wrong? Why aren't you saying anything? I know you do like the show, but you can't possibly be mad for just that?\" The lack of response is starting to worry the Divine Dragon a little. \"Ise? What happened? I swear I- What?! The link is closed off?! How?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, there was no longer a way for Ddraig to talk to Ise anymore, which greatly worried him. He then looked in his memories a bit to see any recent events that must've cause it, seeing something that surprised him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He got electrocuted? How come I didn't notice that? Any physical damage should've triggered my awakening... Wait. Don't tell me that's the reason the link is closed... That's impossible. There's no way something that simple could've broken it. Is there something else that happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked through the other events that happened today as he was sleeping, and some of the things he saw didn't make much sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would Ise watch a show like that? He never mentioned liking scientific programs... And since when does he like eating algae? And what's with that comment at the end of that message?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDdraig then tried connecting himself to his senses. While he couldn't link with his mind, he managed with the rest of his senses. He then used Ise's vision to try and figure out if something happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing out of the ordinary... We all still at home, there doesn't seem to be any imminent threat, and that blasted rain is still outside... I don't get it. The link is blocked by something, but there doesn't seem to be.... Wait, why is he walking like a woman?\", he thought as he noticed the walk. \"He walks just like Gremory. Was it some sort of mind attack by someone to make him act the way he is? I must've missed something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went back to check his memories, and noticed a new segment, of him before leaving he bathroom was added. Initially, there seemed to be nothing wrong with it, except for the longer than usual hair, until he reached the part where he checked himself in the mirror. At that point, the Dragon froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... way... Please for the love of the Great Red, tell me I am still sleeping...\"</span></div></div>",

He didn't notice that it changed a bit while he ate and went to the bathroom again. There was a vanity mirror in the back of the room that wasn't there before. While Rias and Asia did sleep with him quite often, they still had their own rooms, so normally there shouldn't be the need of one there.... at least not yet. Also a Kuoh Academy female uniform was now hanging next to the dresser which became slightly bigger as well. Inside, most clothes have already changed. While there still were jeans and pants in there, there was quite a big number of skirts, leggings and a few dresses here and there. There also multiple shirts and tops which would belong to a girl as well.Normally, someone would think they belong to Rias, but it wasn't the case this time. They soon would belong to Iasukai. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the box with various \"potions\" became fuller as the amount in them doubled. This signifies that Iasukai's knowledge on making them was growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then took a seat next to his phone and saw that it was about half-way charged and that there indeed was a message for him from Rias. It escaped him that its covering was now a dark shade of pink. And besides, he was busy with a back pain that came to him around the same time he went to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My back feels a little stiff... I should try and fix it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then pressed on his back as his arms finished changing, becoming slim and strong as his shoulders became rounder and smaller. When the pain subsided, his back was now arched which gave him a bit more mobility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go. Now let's read the message.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already now of the incident Ise. Azazel told me about the situation, but I am nonetheless happy that you are fine. I regret not being there to keep you company. Anyways, I will return with the others at around 6PM. The rain should stop by then as well. And by the way, regarding the last part... I know you liked us nursing you before, but let's not jump the horse yet Ise. We will still ensure you a great afternoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIasukai giggled a bit at the message as his voice went up by another octave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Rias, you are still so innocent...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then texted her back, making sure to add his own little twist to the message to get another reaction from her. He loved to tease her from time to time as it would pay her back for the times she did that to him. As he wrote down his message, his red T-shirt completely lost its sleeves as the color was turning pink. On top of it, the material became much more silkier, almost looking like it's trying not to irritate him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then sent the message and smirked a bit. He then left the phone on the desk, but when he stood up, he was confused as to why his pants didn't let him to move too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's odd... Did I put on weight? Nah, maybe they just feel tight right now, I'm sure.\", he mumbled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pants, which were now resting above his knees and here tightly hugging his thighs, were now going through a major change. Their legs were fusing together at their seams, as they started to resemble a skirt.</span></div></div>",

Upon a small inspection, he found out that it worked, but certain features such as Youtube and Messenger not working yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was to be expected. It was impossible for everything to work. I don't have anything in particular I want to look up yet right now... Oh, maybe I should check the photos from our trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter closing the Internet, he went into his photo folder and opened up a file with their trip to a water park they went last week. It was a big location that they managed to have it all for themselves with a little bit of help from Sirzecks. They wanted to have a day to have fun without their usual missions or being chased by fans of the \"Oopai Dragon\". But there were two big differences about Iasukai since the last time he checked the page, other than his appearance. The first one was that in the pictures he looked a lot more energetic, excited and flustered when dealing with the attempts of the girls to seduce him. Now, he seemed more mature, calm and a tad sly and playful in them. And also, instead of wearing regular trunks, he was wearing a hot-pink bikini bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was looking though the photos, his T-shirt continued to change. What was once his sleeves became just two thin straps that held his top as the material became a lot smoother and silky as the pink became more visible. Also, his former shirt became almost completely yellow as the material became cashmere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then licked his lips a little as he saw the girls and himself interact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the day sure was memorable... Fufufu... To think even Rias and Akeno would get embarrassed by a little affection... They usually tease me as well from time to time, but whenever they are the ones that are on the receiving end, they just become scared cats. They really need to take some lessons from Xenovia in terms of trying to put on a calm face... But regardless, they all still look gorgeous as always...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Iasukai admired the girls and he got a bit naughty with his thoughts, his figure finished changing with his hips becoming large and alluring and his waist waspish as his rear became a large heart-shape that would make most girls envy of it. He now looked almost like a model, and could rival Rias and Akeno in terms of curves. But there were a few more changes for him to even start comparing himself with the two. Also, in the photos, his updated figure was now present alongside a bikini top that had a rectangular hole in the middle that matched his bottoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But enough of that... I should keep my fantasies a bit more discrete. I am pretty sure even Gya-kun could see what I am thinking...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at school, the girls were having lunch together. With Gasper being yet too shy to go out and eat in the cafeteria, Kiba went with him to eat somewhere more secluded. The girls were discussing about their day, their homework, and especially about Issei's bad day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, Ise really got short end of the stick... Tired as heck, stuck at home becasue of the rain, and now a blackout...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...Maybe his karma got up to him in a way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say that Koneko-chan.\", pouted Irina \"He wasn't nowhere as perverted in public since almost a month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you mention it... He seemed to give a lot more restraint recently...\", remarked Ravel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it was due to all that happened recently. I mean, we just put an end to the Hero Faction, and now Rivezim shows up to cause trouble... He didn't get much time to have his little fantasies to develop...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree with Rias. After the promotion test, we didn't get that much time of relaxation. And Ise especially.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ise-san has really been fighting a lot lately. I wonder if he is overexerting himself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Asia. We will just do our best to have him relax and have a great time. Just like we did at the water park.\", said Rias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all nodded, being more than eager to show the man they love some affection and offer him some much needed pampering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Rias heard her cellphone buzz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got a message... I wonder if it is from Ise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The last one was a bit more bold than I could imagine. I wonder what made him write that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean Asia?\", asked Xenovia as she and the rest went to look at the message on the phone, a hint of curiosity in all of them.</span></div></div>",

She then lowered the phone a little as the other girls were getting a bit to close to her, so that she would have a bit more space as the others spread out a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry if you got flustered because of the last message. But you must know by now how much you, Akeno and the others tease me at times. I don't have anything against it, but you should expect the same treatment as well... and since you like to \"show-off\" so much, how come you get flustered whenever things get serious? I feel a bit cheated with that... Anyways, nothing much happened, but I found something to do in the meantime. Still, I could use some fun tonight. After all, I need some \"sunshine\" after all this rain... And the nurse thing... could be an option... I'll be waiting for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls, especially Asia, Koneko and Irina got a small blush on their cheeks as they read the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\", started Koneko. \"It is true that we mess with Senpai from time to time, but I never thought he would put things this way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's not like we lose our cool every time we get intimate with Ise, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak for yourself Xenovia! I almost lose my breath whenever we are in public!\", exclaimed Irina. \"When we're alone... it may work. But in public I turn into my 12 year old self!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree... I also feel like I would melt whenever we go on a date... It may not be from others watching as much as having Ise-kun display his manly side in my case...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were expecting the others to continue the discussion, but they were surprised to see Rias, Asia and Ravel still looking at the message. Ravel had a confused look on her face while the other two looked a bit concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up? Is something wrong?\", asked Akeno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it tied to that nurse thing? Does Ise want us to dress as nurses again? I mean, I don't mind it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Me neither. It was a bit revealing... But I want to show him how much my cooking has improved...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not necessary that...\", sad Ravel. \"But there is something off with how he signed himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others were confused by this until they looked at the message again and were left utterly lost. It wasn't rare for Issei to sign himself on his messages, but this time, instead of his name, there was another one: \"Iasuka Hyoudou.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What is this?\", asked Koneko. \"Why does Senpai's name is written like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\", replied Rias. \"This also happened last time. Back there, his name was written wrong on my phone. It also was a weird sounding name, but it wasn't this one... I don't know what to think of this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither... I am relieved that Ise-san's name is written correctly on Rias-nee-sama's phone this time. But it is really confusing as to why this happened...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls got confused a slightly worried, until Xenovia remembered something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's just Azazel-sensei pulling a prank on us again. Remember when he hacked into our phones?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I remember that...\", said Akeno in an unamused phone. \"That guy started writing messages and sent them as if we were the ones writing them... I had a lot of things to clarify after he said I enjoy soap operas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really seems to be something he would do... Not to mention that the last messages may have come from him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girls began to suspect Azazel being behind the current situation, Rias still couldn't help but worry a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just hope it is just Azazel's prank...\", she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack home, Iasuka was still looking at the photos when he started to cough a little. In response to it, he started to rub his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is odd... I felt weird all day, and now this... Maybe it's because of the weather... Or maybe I am really getting sick...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he rubbed his neck, the bulge that was once there was now gone as his voice became feminine and also a bit alluring. Also, his clothes finished changing. He was now wearing a pink camisole with a yellow sweater over it with his camisole poking a bit underneath the sweater as their neckline plunged a lot, showing a lot of his torso. His pants lost their pockets and fused completely, becoming a white skirt. As for his boxers, they became made out of silk as the color was changing to pink and were slowly retracting as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs fast as the soreness in his neck came, it went away just as fast, which confused Iasuka a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So many odd phenomena happened today... I must ask the others or Sensei if there is something wrong with me... Whatever, I can just relax with the girls first. I doubt it's contagious.\"</span></div></div>",

This time, he was happy to see that the previous unusable functions were now working again, as the rain outside as slowly getting less intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's see... What to watch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIasuka already had a few selections of what shows he wanted to see. But something happened to some of them. While he preferred shows with more girls than guys whenever it came down to his \"personal time\" ones, he still enjoyed it if there was a male protagonist here and there. Right now, that idea was gone, and was now more pleased with only-female casts instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, despite all the changes, he was still into girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked to see a more recent show he discovered, a sports one with girls playing a very \"entertaining\"  game. While there wasn't any scenes that were going overboard, he was enthralled by the way it was presented, with the girls showing off their best \"assets\". And since he was alone right now, he could watch a small marathon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... Let's have some fun.\", he smirked as he licked his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe already admitted to himself that some of the scenes in the show were bizarre , funny or ridiculous, but even so, he liked it for the serious tone it had as much as the scenes. Speaking of them, a special skin-tight swimsuit was introduced in the current episode. This made him imagine Rias, Akeno and even Asia in it, which slightly turned him on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made his originally flat chest to grow as his nipples became wider and more sensitive as the areolas grew along with them. Also, his small breasts started to form as well as his current A-cups were gradually growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing that the suit was actually made to restrict movement, his broke into a small laugh, imagining the girls fight in said costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha... Now that would ruin almost every type of attack more than a hex... Although me and Rossweisse-san might pull it out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then paused the show a bit as he thought to himself:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I still have a lot to catch up to Rias and the others. I am fairly new at being a Devil and all and I do not have that much combat power... But it's fine. Rias said I should take it in my own stride and that's exactly what I am going to do. I know I will figure out all of the Boosted Gear's secrets in the end. Until then, I'll just use my spells, potions and mind games until then.\", he said to himself with a smile. \"After all, I am Iaruka Hyoudou. I am the Oopai Dragon, one of the school's divas... Fufufu... It's quite the oxymoron if you put those two titles together. I wonder what the girls at school would do if they find out my hidden side... But a lot of people are counting on me, so I better not disappoint them... But until that time, I should enjoy myself while I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then went back to his show just in time to see the girls in the show try the suit on as well. Upon seeing them, his silky boxers finished changing into a pair of panties as his breasts became B-cups. Also, his groin began to tingle as a cavity was forming in his abdomen.</span></div></div>",

There also was this weird, but pleasurable feeling that was happening in his chest and his groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis breasts were gradually expanding, pushing the camisole and sweater outwards the more he watched the show.  Also, his manhood started to shrink as well as his testes were already losing their function, testosterone turning into estrogen as they became a bit smaller as well. But despite all that, he soon started to feel that the feelings were normal, not being at all disturbed by his C-cup breasts or his diminishing manhood that didn't poke through the skirt anymore when he looked down for a second. Lastly, a simple necklace with a silver sphere in the middle materialized on his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point in the show, in which the girls were eating together, sparked a small idea in Iaruka's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I wonder if I could make a small snack for everyone... After all, it is after school, it is a bit too early for dinner... and is a sign of appreciation for how much they helped me. Sounds like a solid plan, fufufu.\", he said to himself as he paused the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's see... What should I do? Sushi? A bit too simplistic... Karaage chicken? A bit too heavy... Although maybe if it goes like when Akeno and Rias fed me... Well, I can't complain...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was remembering said scene, his testes went inside of him as they became ovaries. This made more estrogen to be produced, as his D-cup breasts were now growing a lot faster as his manhood became a small nub. This made him grab his head a bit as a small migraine took over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a problem... Seems today I am a magnet for random illnesses... Am I truly sick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he waited for the headache to pass his breasts grew past DD-cups and even E-cups as a few more, final changes happened to his psyche. Once his chest reached large F-cups that were on par with the ones Rias had, if even a big bigger, his small nub finally went away as a new name filled his name: Haruka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the changes ended, the headache went away, which made the new girl sigh a bit relief before standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now that settles it. I need to do a check-up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went near her box of different chemicals to pick a device from a smaller box. It was an measurer for different ailments or weaknesses that she built together with Azazel. It would show any form of illness that a person has as well as the reason behind it. While she would also make strange contraptions with Azazel... she showed more restraint in regards to how far he would go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA scan ray came out of the device as he pointed it at herself. Once the scan was complete, she was confused to see that it said there was nothing wrong with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odd... I could swear I felt off a few times today... Was it all my imagination? There was no other effect other than the temporary strange feelings that I happened at random times... Now that I think about it... The cold could have been a breeze from outside, the itch was just a reaction to something and the migraine may have come from tiredness... I even checked myself in the mirror earlier and nothing seemed wrong physically...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding it wasn't anything serious, she decided to wait until tomorrow to ask Azazel about it. Looking outside and seeing that the rain stopped at last, he went back to his earlier thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Classes should end soon. Now what to do... Something healthy, nutritious... Hmm... I think I may have an idea over what to do... I am sure the girls will like it too, fufufu.\"</span></div></div>",

For a second I thought it was the Great Flood...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Irina, don't go that far... And besides, if that happened, where would we find an ark?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fufu...All jokes aside, that is something that has a chance of happening this season. There have been similar storms in last years as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The guy on TV said something about strong air currents from the Pacific. That is most likely the cause.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Did storms like that happened before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsia looked at Rias for an answer. But she seemed to be busy thinking about something else. When she noticed Asia staring at her, she replied back a bit flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Huh? Oh. I am sorry Asia, I didn't pay attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's rare for you Rias to space out like that. Is something on your mind?\", asked Akeno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is about the messages from Ise. I don't know, something feels off about them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is obvious this is Sensei's doing Buchou.\", said Xenovia. \"I mean, something like this kind of happened before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but it is indeed odd for Sensei to write in replies that doesn't quite capture Ise-sama'a personality. Especially the playful remarks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he is just fooling around.\", said Akeno in an unamused tone. \"This could be just a way to toy with us. Malice or not, it isn't out of the question for him to do this. He just has a knack for jokes... that only he enjoys...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you are right. I will talk with Azazel tomorrow... Now let's just go home and relax for the day. We are quite fortunate that we already did our homework for tomorrow. Thus I could spend more time with Ise.\", said Rias with the last part being a murmur for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce home, after they took their shoes off, they were surprised to see what was in the kitchen. There was an assortment of small dishes that seemed to have been made for a picnic. There were spring rolls, bitter melon salad, tofu gyoza and a few more together with a salad with cherry tomatoes, asparagus sticks and star-shaped carrots. Next to the food there was a piece of paper which said: \"Today's healthy snack. Be coming right up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn! Ise outdid himself with this!\", exclaimed Xenovia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know he was so much into healthy food though... It sure is a pleasant surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks really good... But there is no meat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now don't be picky! Ise-sama worked a lot for these dishes. I know for certain I will like them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ara ara... Seems like Ise-kun wanted to make us a surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks delicious...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does. Really, Ise needs to stop trying to pamper us. I will, without a doubt enjoy his cooking. But I want to see what is he doing right now. And to make a little surprise. Try not to eat until I come back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I am coming too then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So am I. I also want to thank Ise-kun personally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsia and Akeno followed Rias upstairs, as the three started a small race to his bedroom as the others sighed and waited for their return.</span></div></div>",

As much as they wanted to indulge themselves, they knew they had to wait for the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew Ise-kun knows how to cook, but this is above my expectations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did Senpai take cooking lessons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so. Besides, lately, we have been busy with our Devil work. I would have noticed if he went for something like that.\", replied Ravel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, isn't it a bit odd that there is only healthy food here?\", asked Xenovia. \"I mean, if it is Ise, he should make something like fried chicken or something like that. Having no meat is weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Ise-sama thought it would be a nice change of pace. Or maybe he thought we were eating too fatty lately...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoneko noticed something as Ravel talked, thus leaving with the others not paying much mind to it. Xenovia then pulled out her phone and was confused as to what she saw on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Who is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I thought maybe Sensei played with our phones as well. Turns out, he did... But there isn't a weird name like when Buchou showed us her phone. Now there is a girl named Haruka where Ise's number was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two were surprised by this, so they took put their phones and indeed, there was someone named \"Haruka Hyoudou\" on their call list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is weird... If I were Sensei, I would put an unrecognizable name. But the family name is normal, and just putting a girl's name is just odd...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Irina, does Ise has a cousin named like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that I know of... In fact, I do not know any relatives that Ise-kun has named like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Replacing Ise's name with a random girl's name is too weird even for Sensei... Did it mess up something else as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXenovia went to see if there was any other anomaly with her phone. There didn't seem to be any except the fact that where Issei's name was on the call list and the messages, now there was Haruka. But when she looked at the photos, her heart stopped. In the photos taken at the water park last week, now there was a girl with large breasts, brown curly hair and a playful smirk where Ise was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-H-Huh?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's... wrong...\", was all Ravel could say before she and Irina saw the pictures, not sure what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Xenovia... I know you took some photos, but did you took them with this girl? I don't recall seeing her there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No... I haven't seen her before in my life... In fact, she is where Ise was in the photos! In fact- What?\", she paused seeing the girl pose with her and Irina for a selfie they took in one photo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! I don't recall that!\", exclaimed Irina. \"I made that selfie with you and Ise-kun, not with this girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Do you think this is that Haruka on the list?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't panic. I am sure that Sensei-\", started Ravel before she heard a yelp from the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey headed there to see Koneko, wide-eyed, confused, but mostly scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Koneko-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-The photos...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they looked at the pictures of Ise and his family on the wall, they froze. Instead of him. There was a small girl, which looked really similar to the one they saw on Xenovia's phone. That girl grew up in the pictures and the most recent one, taken not too long ago was of the whole ORC, with her standing where Ise was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Ravel... I-I don't think Sensei is fooling around this time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, upstairs, Rias, Akeno and Asia reached the bedroom. They were a bit surprised to see that it was dark inside and called for Issei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u00cfse? Are you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, two hands sneaked from behind Rias and groped her breasts. She yelped at first, but quickly calmed down. The figure, then stroked Asia and Akeno's hair before it went for the light switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, Ise. Don't scare me like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really was a surprise. I wouldn't have thought you to do it. Ara ara... It seems you have gotten a bit more bold...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you wait for us in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure, then turned on the lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In order: I didn't meant to give you a heart attack, I just wanted to play a bit. I always am bold when it comes to this, I just hide it really good. And yes, I waited ever since I heard you get here.\", said Haruka. \"And Rias, who is \"Ise\" and why did you think I was this person?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(This is what Haruka looks like : <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pre10.deviantart.net/a9f9/th/pre/f/2017/016/b/e/picnic_with_haruka_by_fu_reiji-davn5ek.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://pre10.deviantart.net/a9f9/th/pre...</a> )</span></div></div>",

They were filled with confusion, not just for there being a random girl who knew their names in Issei's room, but more as to how she got there, as it would be highly unlikely for Issei to let anyone inside, even if it was someone to nice-looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it is not as if it really matters. I am feeling a bit tired after making a that food downstairs. I need a small drink. I'll go and take some ginger ale. Do you want something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who... are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What do you mean Asia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't fool around!\", said Rias in a serious tone. \"Who are you and where is Ise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkeno was also glaring at the girl with intensity as Asia just looked concerned. But the girl looked at them quizzically as if there was something wrong with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this Ise and what does he have anything to do with me? And you already know my name. It's Haruka. Haruka Hyoudou.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"H-Hyoudou?!\"\", exclaimed Rias and Akeno in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two are not making much sense... Did you and Asia drink something from my collection?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka looked at the box in the back of the room at which the girls looked as well. They didn't remember said box being there, especially since there was a \"Warning\" label on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I keep my elixirs and tonics I made there, but you should know that there is also where I keep my potions if you would call them that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Potions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you know... poisons, concoctions that give other ailments, the usual, and a few new recipes I have been making recently. You never know when you need them in battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Xenovia and the others entered the room, ready to tell Rias about their findings, but stalled when they saw Haruka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, perfect timing everyone. Seems like Rias and Akeno drank something from my box and they-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Are you... Haruka?\", asked Irina in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Then is it r-really true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka looked at the confused girls quite surprised as she gasped a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me... You drank something as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough of this!\", yelled Rias. \"Tell us who you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being a hint of anger in Rias' eyes, Haruka merely sighed before responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess a full introduction is in order then... I am Haruka Hyoudou. I am a student at Kuoh Academy, and along with Rias and Akeno, we are named the three beauties of the school. I also am Rias' Pawn as well as the Sekiryuutei. But despite that, I am still a beginner at using the Sacred Gear's power, so I rely on other methods to fight using my high magic pool, like using my concoctions and such. And my dream is to have my own personal harem, be it girls or boys... Is this better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls froze. They were shocked, confused and afraid that something happened to Issei as the girl didn't seem to lie in her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah... You must've drank something that clouded your memories...\", sighed Haruka. \"Honestly, after that whole fiasco with the truth serum, I thought you stopped trying to take things out of the box without my consent...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I...\", was all Rias could muster to say before they were interrupted.</span></div></div>",

He took a glance at the confused look of the ORC members, and upon seeing Haruka, he gave a small sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you today... Sorry Haruka, they snuffed one of your potions by accident. I think it was the one you made last week with Rossweisse... I saw it through a video camera installed in your house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were ready to ask what was he talking about, when they saw him wink at them, noticing them that he knows what's going on without Haruka noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah... I should've guessed. There was no way the girls I love would act so strange without a reason.\" Some of the females blushed upon hearing \"love\", especially Asia, Koneko and Ravel before she continued. \"I know I have told them to not mess with my formulas, but I guess I am also a bit responsible for not putting the box away... I will make an antidote right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no need. I already made some preparations to solve it back at the club.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great. Just wait for me to get ready and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I talked with your parents and they will soon come home. You should stay and wait for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course... I am sure they are a bit hungry as well. Don't worry, I'll keep some for you too.\", smiled Haruka to the girls as they felt a bit awkward, a small trace of red in their cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thanks Haruka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. Oh, by the way Sensei, please turn off the feed on that camera tonight. Things should get... fun at some point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way the girls wouldn't get nervous once they saw her smirk as Rias started to fidget at that remark. Azazel gave a small sigh before he opened up the portal for him and the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then waved at her as they left, Haruka getting now ready to wait for her parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the ORC building, once the transport was finished, the girls exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?! Do you know what's going on Azazel?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you behind this? You have to! be\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just bring Ise-san back! It feels weird having someone else look at me like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this Haruka? And why does she says she is a Pawn and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One question at the time.\", responded Azazel as he cut them off, with a tired expression. \"Yes, I know what happened. And no, this was not something I planed to do. As for bringing Ise back... there is a small snag. Believe it or not, it sounds ridiculous, but is the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haruka is Ise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that response, Rias and the others had their lights go away from their eyes, ready to faint any moment, but somehow all stood awake, as Azazel continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It happened just before you left school. Rossweisse called me and said that Ise was gone from the yearbook and that a girl named Haruka was in his place. I checked my files, and there it was, her profile with a full picture of her. I looked at the cameras in your house, and as expected, there she was, making some snacks.... And when I checked the recording from today... I couldn't believe it. Between the start of the blackout and not too long before you guys got home, I saw Ise gradually turn into Haruka... He didn't even notice. It was like things went natural.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-How did i-it h-happen?\", muttered Rias, not believing what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I said that I didn't turn Ise into a girl... but I had in a way a hand in this... Ise's console broke a few days ago, so I gave him a prototype to play games on. One feature on it was to bring the characters from the game in real life. Just when the lights went out, a shock hit the console and zapped it along with Ise. He didn't suffer any physical damage, but there was a problem with the system... He was playing a game where Haruka was one of the characters. I guess that when the lightning striked, it activated the summon sequence for her. But since some circuits broke down, and Ise was in direct contact with it... it transferred the summon program by using him as base for it. That's why the Haruka that exists now is not only having a different life than the one in the game, but it also adapted to Ise's life as well, including having the Boosted Gear and being your Pawn... I am guessing the reality shift thing is some sort of secondary effect...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls couldn't believe it. But as much as they wanted to punish Azazel for this, they knew that he wasn't actually responsible for this, and instead tried to calm their nerves for a few minutes.</span></div></div>",

She was also dumbstruck, but managed to swallow it. It seems all beings that are not quite \"human\" are immune to this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Haruka is a game character... How does Ise always get himself in all these weird situations?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not going to ask what kind of game it was the one she came from, but I am happy she is mature and calm... I wonder how will she respond to this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We shouldn't tell her. This is something temporary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. Just turn Ise back already. I know you have a device for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... It is a bit more complicated.\", said Azazel as he pinched the bridge of his nose. \"I have a gender switch gun, but that will only turn Haruka into a boy, not into Ise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Then how are you going to turn him back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to check that console and see what happened to it. It was the cause of the transformation after all. But... depending on what exactly is broken and how much, it will take a while...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls looked at him in shock as Ravel meekly asked back:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-And how much do you think it will take?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if only the summon program is damaged maybe a week, but since that is the best case scenario, we might get two weeks out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two weeks?!\", yelled at the girls in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Is there no way to make it quicker?\", asked Xenovia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it is, but it is too risky. We don't want to end up with an Ise with Haruka's personality or something like that right?... Judging by how things are, the world might see Haruka as someone who is already part of this world. She has Ise's life after all... We will have to continue acting normal until I repair the console\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others were thinking how to deal with the situation, until they remembered something. A mixture of embarrassment and dread took over them as it dawned on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hold on! T-That means I and Asia have to sleep... with Haruka?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Eh?! I-I don't think I-I can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't have my special talks with a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Senpai is H-Haruka-san... W-What should I do...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way I can spend time with her! She's just my opposite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-My love can't be pure if it is directed towards a girl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What should I do? Ise-sama is my hero, but he can't be like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, sorry to interrupt...\", said Azazel. \"But shouldn't you worry more about the \"special night\" Haruka mentioned that you promised her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls turned to stone. They couldn't imagine how will tonight go... Or they were too afraid to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will you do is none of my business. I will turn off the cameras in the house just as I promised. As much as it is a show for me, I can't just to that to Ise. I'll come tomorrow for the console.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait. What should we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, I will not butt in into this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made the console! You have to owe us something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you could've told me about this sooner, when there was a way to reverse this. I saw on my phone how Ise's name gradually changed. I thought my phone was glitching out, before I rewrote it correctly. What is your excuse? There was seven of you, and I am sure you just thought I was messing with your phones. None of you thought of calling me about this either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest couldn't say anything at this point. For them to be scolded by Azazel was something they didn't expect to happen. As the Fallen Angel began to search on replacement parts for the broken console, the girls returned home... not sure what to do except to play their part... and what to expect of this afternoon.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next week and a half was surely unique for the ORC members. Unsurprising, Issei's parents and the rest of the school didn't remember him, and instead knew only Haruka existing. With her politeness, maturity and knowledge, she was  a hit for the girls, always admiring her alongside Rias and Akeno, while the guys, particularly Matsuda and Motohama really wished to pursue her. But she was firm in having herself choose who should she date, and even that thought was mostly obscured by her attachment to the ORC members... even if they had difficulty to keep up the act of always having her as a member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba and Gasper weren't that distressed with the situation. Other than Haruka's teasing and their awkwardness around her when doing more private activities such as studying, they got along with her pretty well, with Kiba in a sense, linking her to Rias. Ddraig, while initially panicked over what happened to Issei, upon learning from Azazel that the situation is reversible, calmed down and decided to observe Haruka. While he was disappointed that she couldn't hear him, thus making her unable to use more of the Sacred Gear's power, he was impressed of how meticulous she was with her spells and potions. But he still admitted to himself that he missed Issei... Not to mention that her likeness of girls and the fact that she was still called the Oppai Dragon confused him a lot... Rossweisse, while shocked and concerned at first, began liking Haruka as she also liked to study magic as much as her. But despite their lessons together and learning more spells from her was, she still waited for Issei to come back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rest of the girls... things sure got uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoneko and Ravel were practically screaming inside and were ready to run whenever they were alone with Haruka. Whenever her \"playful\" side came out and started to tease them and try to get intimate, for the sake of not blowing off their cover, they had to endure it. Even if that meant for them to have their faces red as they can get. Even if it was mostly \"harmless\", they still couldn't help but starting to get some fantasies in the end... which they tried to erase from their minds... at least until Issei came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXenovia and Irina also had a lot of troubles. While they didn't mind shopping with Haruka, they found it quite boring, as they would rather go to a karaoke bar or to an arcade with Issei rather than just walking through the mall. And while they loved her cooking, the lack of protein, at least in Xenovia's case, was surely a big downside for her, as she considered to need to eat more hardy to keep up with her training. As for their private moments, Irina was unable to have too many of them. She thanked God that she could use the excuse of her becoming a Fallen Angel to get away, as she could handle Issei's perversion much better than Haruka's teasing any day of the week. And Xenovia, while not as flustered as her juniors, she nonetheless felt awkward spending time with Haruka the same way she did with Issei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Rias, Asia and Akeno... they sure got the worst out of it. Due to their constant behavior of sleeping together with Issei before, Haruka wished to do the same. And the three could hardly sleep as not only were they sleeping with someone they barely knew, but whenever she moved around in bed and her breasts started to touch them... they could start to understand why Ise had issues sleeping with them before. As for the rest of their free time, they merely spent time with Haruka for the sake of keeping up their cover, mostly thinking about Ise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the night when all this started... is something they all wish to forget...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Azazel managed to make a device using the console as a base to reverse to process, which brought Issei back, though with no memory of the past week. The girls played it as a result of a device Azazel made which made him lose his memory, which although not too happy with the lie, Azazel supported it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, Issei was ready to go to bed, with the rest of the girls joining him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you all a bit more clingy this week? I mean, I understand Akeno-san sneaking in at times, but it is rare for all of you to come to my bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we are feel like we didn't to that enough Ise-sama.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we wanted to have a good night's sleep and I feel here is the best place for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... While I appreciate that you think that, you sure seem a lot more eager to be with me. Are you sure you are not hiding something? I mean, a week is a week. A lot can happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it Ise. There was nothing of importance that should concern you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Indeed. Nothing major happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's just go to sleep. It is pretty late and I just want to snuggle in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei began blushing at Akeno's comment and was ready to turn off the lights, when he remembered something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, did all of you came to my bed when I lost my memory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I had this dream for a few days. It seems like a memory, but it's a bit strange that it comes back from time to time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A dream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it was with all of you and me lying in the bed... and then there are lot of pauses, as I see just fragments of something... It didn't look different than what we are usually doing whenever we go to sleep.... but you girls seemed a lot more flustered and the weirdest part was that I was a girl... I had huge breasts, long curly hair, and you called me Haruka... Is it weird?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls stopped for a second before they yelled back: \"No! Not at all!\" in unison, as Ise blinked in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-There was nothing special that time period! I-I am sure it was just a weird dream. Let's just go to sleep now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIse jumped on the bed as the girls went to their usual \"clinging spot\", but he noticed they seemed like they were panicking a little as well. Before they started to fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if nothing really happened.... Well Sensei, Kiba and Ddraig there was nothing wrong...  I guess it really is a weird fantasy... I remember this Haruka being a character in that game. But I wonder why did I put her in my place... Well, I am sure it's nothing...\", he mumbled to himself as he went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Rias ans Akeno and the others already made plans for tomorrow to have Azazel wipe the dream out of his mind...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Issei was having quite a boring day today. After another failed attempt at peaking at the girls ruined by the kendo club and Matsuda and Motohama's stupidity, he was currently walking home alone. The girls all went to the mall to do some shopping, and as much as he wanted to join them, they wanted what they will buy to be a surprise for when they would come back, thus making him be alone until the girls or his parents came back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Issei didn't had any plan whatsoever. He could play a video game or read an eroge manga, but today he felt a little drained after being told off for the millionth time by the kendo club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, why can't they just leave me be with that? It's not like I was looking at them in particular, and I am pretty sure Rias, Asia and Akeno-senpai told them it's not a problem. I can't really explain my situation, but to be honest, it's getting a little on my nerves. They must think I should be a girl like them... all mannered, and against all the sexy stuff...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried a number of times to get their point of view. But because of them, most of the student body still labeled him as a pervert. He could still remember that one time at the school festival when he was beaten just because he cosplayed as a zombie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly... I can never get why they should get that serious with something like this? Don't they consider a man's feelings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was grateful Rias and the other weren't like this. He wasn't against politeness to important or older people, and he hated when others tried to ignore or abuse someone's feelings. But he couldn't help but feel like he was done and injustice. He was a pervert, but never disrespectful towards girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with admiring a girl's breasts? Even they must acknowledge if another girl is beautiful or not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got close to his house, he could faintly hear a small beeping noise coming from inside. He sighed as he started to sweat a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I nearly forgot that Sensei said he'll come over to test another invention of his... First a clone ray, then that UFO, and there's also that gender change ray gun... Whatever it is, I hope it's nothing targeting me specifically...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong partner? Scared of one of Azazel's toys?\", asked Ddraig from the Longnus. \"Given all that happened until now , and all that we faced, I am amazed you still fret over this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but... I think even you agree that I am the recipient more often than not of Sensei's inventions, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... am not going to argue with you there. But things always turn up okay in the end, don't they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven that he was more often than not the unfortunate target of Azazel's inventions, he could only pray that if something is to happen to him, at the very least it would be enjoyable... Although he wanted nothing to happen in actuality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter shaking his head, he went and opened the door. For a brief second nothing seemed to happen, as he took off his shoes. The second immediately after, he was engulfed in bright light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, Sensei! All the time! Why always me!\", yelled Issei as he disappeared along with the light, leaving only his shoes behind.</span></div></div>",

While he hasn't been in a while to the coast, he definitely didn't recognize the place, and on top of it, judging by the Sun and the temperature, it was as if it was summer again. The weirdest part however was that Issei was in his dark-green swimming trunks, his school clothes now gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sensei! Why does this always happen to me?!... Well, I escaped that gender change ray... but still!\", cursed the boy loudly. \"But where am I anyway? And why am I in my swimsuit? Was that teleportation device or something? But why is it hot like it is in summer? Hey Ddraig, do you know what's going on?... Ddraig?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was starting to get worried as to why the dragon wasn't answering him. He feared the worst, thinking that somehow the link between them was damaged by whatever sent him here, but just before he could try to use Balance Breaker, he heard someone coming from the forest behind him. As much as he wanted to make sure everything was fine, he didn't want to scare anyone with his armor in case it was a regular human, so he decided to wait for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he saw stunned him. In front of him, coming from the forest, was a beautiful girl, around his age with white, snowy skin and light blue eyes. He short silver hair was tied in the back by a white bow with blue stripes and she had a blue swimsuit with the bikini top having white polka dots and a black ribbon in the front while the skirt-like garment she wore was covering the white bottoms she was wearing, with a few white frills completing the design. But it wasn't the girl's impressive chest that drew Issei's attention, but the fact that he knew who the girl was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... I am sorry that I interrupted you... I thought I heard someone talking and I was curious who it was... Are you perhaps a tourist?\", asked the girl politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Y-Yeah... It is the first time I came here... and since I didn't see anyone around I thought it was deserted...\", said Issei as he tried to come up with a story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same goes for me as well. This isn't a regular place for people to come, given that it is in quite a remote location... I believe I heard you yelling. Did something happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No... it's nothing important, don't worry about it... Haha... Uh, so are you alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I am here with a few of my friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do... you mind if I come with you? It is a bit lonely here and I don't want to spend the whole day on my alone. Only if you want of course...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I suppose you can join us... But some of the rest might consider  it strange to invite a boy... But I guess that being alone here would be quite depressing as well... You can come, but only if you behave yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Understood...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl nodded and began leading the way before she stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I nearly forgot to ask for your name... Forgive me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it. My name is Issei.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yumi. It is a pleasure to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterward, the two continued walking, with Issei staying a little behind, with a slightly worried expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name clinches it... This is Yumi from the Senran Kagura series...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Senran Kagura was a series Issei was introduced to not that long ago. Given the context of beautiful, hot teenage girls in a variety of outfits, with ninja powers, he needed little time to be charmed by them. While he couldn't play the games of the series with the girls or Kiba and Gasper, Azazel was more than happy to partake in enjoying the fanservice. But since Azazel had a few ideas as to how would they be able to interact with the girls, his past record of inventions and the fact that Yumi, the girl Issei was walking with now, was one of the main characters of the series, as the leader of the Gessen team, Issei could only wonder if this was a curse or a blessing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me Issei-san.\", said the girl as she looked at the boy. \"You seem a little deep in thought. Is something the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, don't worry about it. It's just that I think my Sensei pulled a prank on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A prank?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say that he is the type to joke around a little too much... I would tell you more, but I don't want to get you involved in this mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\", said Yumi a bit unsure of what the \"mess\" was about. \"Still, it is unbecoming of a teacher to pull pranks on his pupils.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I think so as well.\", replied Issei a bit nervously at Yumi's cold tone. While he was grateful he could see such beauties in real life, due to the fact that not just Yumi, but the rest of the girls of Gessen were very against perverted acts, with only Shiki being the more open one to it. The one he was afraid the most was Yozakura, a girl who was even more strict than Yumi, and acted a lot more like an enforcer of order whenever the leader wasn't around. \"She will be a lot more trouble than the girls from the kendo club... Between shinai and armored gauntlets, I would prefer the former hands down... If I was a girl they wouldn't be so mean, but if I am a guy, it's a crime for them... Damn those strict girls...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was thinking that, he didn't notice that all his body hair, except the one on his head suddenly vanished, leaving his skin a little more sensitive to the cold air of the beach. He also didn't see how his height dropped a little, from 5'7 to 5'3, now making him slightly smaller than Yumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Are you here alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I am with a few of my friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how many of you are there right now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are currently four.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... Just four?\", asked Issei, confused, as he always thought all groups were made out of five members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it is a bit strange just for four of us to be on a beach so far from the city, but we are expecting another group to arrive shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also... I know it will be a bit hard\u2026 But could you please not stare too much at us? I know we are all girls, but would appreciate if you refrain from any perverted acts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I promise\u2026\u201d, said the boy. Despite the promise though, he was suddenly made aware of the situation, and began to take a few peaks at Yumi\u2019s rear, which shook a little through the swimsuit. \u201cDamn it\u2026 You just had to go ahead and say that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t notice that his new height made him better see the girl\u2019s butt, as he was a little too preoccupied with the sight at the moment. In the meantime, his hair started to lose its usual spikiness it once had, as it became smoother, and also straightened out a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs awesome as it is to check these girls out\u2026 What\u2019s the deal with one of them not being here? Is the one who\u2019s missing sick or something like that?... Yumi-san sad others should be arriving soon. Maybe whoever\u2019s not missing will come with them\u2026 Still, I should have said I was waiting for someone. I need some alone time to see what\u2019s going on with Ddraig. But why am I in my swimwear? Couldn\u2019t Sensei send me to their school? And why the beach in the particular? Well\u2026 It\u2019s not like I am complaining\u2026\u201d, thought the perverted boy as he took a few more glances at Yumi.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a few minutes, the two arrived to a small beach shack, with three girls laying next to it. A petite brown-haired girl which she held in two pigtails, with a frilly, yellow one-piece and green bracelets was making a sand castle. Helping her was a girl, who wore a bikini and several other accessories which gave the appearance of a Sengoku period armor, with her brown hair tied into a side-ponytail. But was set her apart was the scary oni mask she had on, which gave her a more intimidating aura. Lastly, on a beach chair was a blonde girl wearing a strapless black bikini and a large hat with a bat motif, that was casually playing on her phone. These girls were Minori, Murakumo and Shiki, member of Gessen's elite shinobi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei couldn't help but stare at the beauties in front of him, their swimsuits perfectly showing their impressive busts, which ranged from around Ravel's size to Rossweisse's. This undeniably made him more than a little aroused. But for the sake of not getting in trouble, he tried to suppress his excitement and averted his eyes from looking at their breasts. What was strange was how easy the process was. Usually it would be a lot harder, due to his nature of not being able to hold himself back whenever he saw a beautiful, well-endowed girl. But this time, while he still admired the other girls's looks, he found himself a lot more able to control his emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please wait here a bit until I brief them over the current situation. I don't want them to think you are intruding us forcefully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure...\", said Issei as Yumi went to the other girls, the others looking at him a bit in curiosity as they noticed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon looking at the group again, he noticed that indeed, someone was not present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is Yozakura?...It's weird not to see her around. She usually is with the group, and I don't think there was a time in the series she wasn't with them. Is she sick? Was there an emergency?... I could ask Yumi-san about her, but that would pretty much blow my cover...\" Issei then took another glance at the girls, particularly their butts. \"But I am not really complaining. The less girls to watch me like a hawk and scold me the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was looking, his feet started to tingle as they shrunk down as he got a pedicure. On top of that, the color on is dark-green trunks started to lighten a little as the yellow knot it had vanished. Suddenly, he shook his head , again his perverted thoughts being easily disrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shouldn't do anything bad though. I can't have Yumi-san and the others be mad at me for something as trivial as this... But this a once in a lifetime opportunity. Who knows when I can look at these girls again?... But it would be inappropriate of me to do something like this... Ugh! Being around these girls makes me more conscious than I am. Why couldn't this be Homura's team?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Issei was busy with his thoughts the other girls were discussing about whether or not they should let Issei sat with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think this is a good idea Yumi.\", said Murakumo. \"You never know when he will start acting perverted and invade our privacy. We all know how boys act around us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but he seems harmless enough. I can't deny he might give us lustful gazes at times, but he appears to be quite tame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to mention he is lost in thought by the looks of it.\", said Minori as she looked at him. \"I think he is busy with other things right now. And I think it will be a little more fun with him here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Like, he looks like an okay guy to me. And being alone on a beach like this for the first time is so not cool. This is why we invited Asuka-chin and the others with us, right? To have a good time? Maybe, like, he was supposed to come with his friends and they didn't come or something... And who knows, maybe he could be quite fun to be around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe masked girl sighed at Shiki's words as the relented. \"Very well. If all of you think it is a good idea, then I will not object. But I think we will need to tell our friends from Hanzo about this as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I will. I am supposed to greet them anyway where the bus leaves them. I will have plenty of time to explain it to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other three girls nodded at their leader's decision as they went to greet Issei.</span></div></div>",

While he still wanted to know what happened to Yozakura, he knew that he had to keep quiet for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We talked with each other and we agreed to have you stay here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I... appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you came here on your own, though... Were you supposed to come with someone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Yeah. But something came up and they couldn't come. I decided to come check this place out anyways on my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sure sucks, doesn't it? But don't worry. We will make sure you will have a great day! Name's Shiki by the way.\", said the blonde as she bent over a bit, showing her breasts as she leaned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! We will play games, make sandcastles and swim a lot! My name is Minori if you want to know!\", said the petite girl with a toothy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Murakumo. I am a bit unsure if you're going to cause trouble for us or not, but as long as you don't do anything stupid, we will do our best for you to enjoy this day.\" Even though the words that came out from the mask seemed cold, it was obvious that by the way she was hugging herself that she was a bit nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei was without a doubt charmed not only by their behavior, but also by their looks. He has seen Rias, Akeno and Xenovia in numerous swimsuits and while none of the girls reached the same level of sexiness as the girls form the peerage, Shiki's swimsuit came in pretty close. He was also liking Yumi's as despite the fact it didn't reveal as much as Shiki or Murakumo, it kind of gave the same type of vibe Asia or Irina would have when wearing something less daring as Akeno or Rias. While he blushed a little at their sight, he tried as much as he could not to make a perverted face. He didn't feel how his calves started to vibrate as the muscles in them got more compact, while their overall appearance changed, as they turned sleeker while some of the mass from the area started to go up to his thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Iosei. it's nice to meet you. And... thank you for... allowing me to stay here.\", said Iosei as he noticed the different way he called himself. \"Huh? What was that? Why did I say \"Iosei\"? And why does Yumi-san doesn't notice the difference?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he thought, Yumi didn't look bothered by his misspelled name as she started talking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no need to act so formal Iosei-san, but we appreciate your thanks regardless. Now if you excuse me, I will now leave for a little while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Where are you going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another group of friends is supposed to come here as well, and I was planning to go and greet them. You can stay here with Murakumo-san and the others while I am gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Other friends?\", though Iosei. \"Is Yozakura among them? But she said group...But what's with her calling me differently as well? She seemed to understand my name before... Wait, don't the others think this name is kind of weird?... They don't look like they do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, don't worry. We, like will have a little fun until Yumi-chin comes back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now don't be shy Iosei-chin. There's n need to feel awkward...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I will not take my leave. I promise I won't stay long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more exchanges, Yumi left to wait for the other group of friends. As she left, Iosei couldn't help but stare at her rear. He didn't understand why, as of all the girls around him, Yumi seemed to attract him more all of a sudden, but he was glad she left, so he could push these thoughts aside. He was unaware that his hands started to slim down quite a bit, as his fingers lengthened slightly as well.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It won't take long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he went inside the small wooden building, with the girls looking at him as he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He seems decent enough. I was a little concerned he would be a perverted trouble-maker, but he seems quite well-behaved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was looking at us a bit though. Is that normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Minori-chin. Even girls tend to do that. It's just that we are too gorgeous.\", said Shiki with a smile as her friends went back to making the sand castle. She hummed to herself a little with a sly look on her face as she looked at the shack. \"Although it seems someone might have a small crush on Yumi-chin... This will surely get interesting once he gets back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Iosei found the restroom, but realized that it wasn't separated for men and women as there were no signs of urinals. He didn't think much of it, as he went into a stall, to make the impression he was doing his business when in reality he was trying to piece the things that happened so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... This is really weird. First of all, where is Yozakura? I have never seen a scene in the games where she isn't around. Did something happened to her? It's not like I can just ask the others, it would make me look a stalker. And it's bad enough the girls at school think I am like that.<br>\r\nI don't want to ruin everything, so I have to try and keep my cool. And on top of that, I have to not focus on the girls' looks too much as well... Damn it... If Rias was here she would back me up on this. How am I supposed to not look at those amazing oopai?! Shiki and Murakumo must be around Rossweisse-sensei's size. And Minori looks like a more childish Ravel with those twintails. As for Yumi...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could voice his thoughts, he suddenly started to cough with no explanation whatsoever. He was this way distracted by how his trunks got tighter on him, clinging to his legs a lot more than before. This was also partially because his thighs started to get thicker as the mass from his ankles reached them before converting into fat. They still tingled a little but the swimsuit didn't get any tighter on him for the moment. The coughing fit stopped as quickly as it appeared, which confused Iosei a little, but didn't ponder too much on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was weird...\", said Iosei quietly, not noticing that his voice raised in pitch quite a bit, his perverted thoughts from before vanishing completely, much easier than they should have. \"Anyway... I tried to contact Ddraig, but he didn't seem to respond, and I didn't feel any demonic energy either. I still faintly feel the Pawn Pieces, but that most likely is because of the contract. This means that there is no way for me get home unless Sensei brings me back... Jeez, he and his inventions always give me so much trouble... He should be a lot more responsible. He should be more like Yumi-san. She has a good head on her shoulders, she is well mannered, she has a great figure and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly stopped, as he realized what exactly was he thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What's with me praising her all of a sudden? I mean, sure, she looks amazing, but I would rather go for Shiki or Katsuragi. She is too bossy. Well... not like that's such a major issue, given that she is not blunt and does listen when someone tries to defend themselves... Great, I might fall for a character from a game at this rate. On the bight side, she is not here right now, so I will have enough time not to think about it... In the meantime, I can enjoy a little time with the rest of the ladies.\", smiled Iosei to himself as he left the bathroom.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once outside, Iosei noticed that Minori and Murakumo were continuing on their sand castle while Shiki was checking her phone, until the latter noticed him and called him over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Iosei-chin, I brought you a beach chair\" Come sit with us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen smiled and headed for the open chair right next to Shiki, thanking her as he sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. But it wasn't necessary, I could've took one myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're our, like, guest right now, so a little hospitality doesn't hurt.\", said the blonde while the boy gave her grateful look before she continued. \"And don't worry about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Checking us out.\" That answer made Iosei freeze for a second. \"We get a lot of looks from both boys and girls, so we are used to it. I mean, Yumi-chin and Murakumo-chin do get embarrassed or angry if someone stares at them too much, especially boys, and Yumi-chin would start and reprimand them, but they won't get too aggressive... unless you grope them or something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Noted...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for me and Minori-chin, we don't really mind that much. Minori-chin is not having any dirty thoughts, so she's okay with it if you don't stare too long. And I, like, think that is is perfectly normal, you know? I mean, we look amazing, and some of my girl friends say we look like models. I would actually feel proud if someone looked at me and said I was attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiki pushed her chest forward to emphasize her statement, which made Iosei look intently at the girl's breasts. While they weren't as big like the ones Rias and Akeno had, it was surely up there. But as he kept looking, he slowly found himself thinking that he shouldn't stare at a girl's chest like that. While he was already aware that he should respect a girl's feeling when it came down to it, even the prospect of checking someone out like that was starting to feel wrong to him, which started to confuse him, given his general thoughts on the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't aware that he needed to reposition himself on the chair as he looked, as his back started to ache a little. As he tried to find a suitable position, his back arched forward, as his spine formed now a permanent arch. On top of it, he didn't notice yet, but he was starting to forget the three sizes of his harem, numbers he considered sacred. The only ones that remained untouched were Rias's, but in his mind her numbers didn't feel exactly right either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIosei shook his head, trying to get a hold of his thoughts, as Shiki giggled, finding his slight embarrassment a little funny. Before the boy could say anything, they could hear Minori gasp which made the two look at her direction. What they saw was the petite girl gushing over at the sandcastle she and Murakumo made, which resembled a Japanese castle. She smaller girl started to praise the older one for guiding her and for helping her do the castle, as the latter tried to dismiss it, without much success as her posture showed that she was more than a little proud of their accomplishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Even Murakumo-chin can't fool us with that mask, can she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't look like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two laughed a little at the scene in front of them, neither noticing that Iosei's face started to round up and soften. As soon as they stopped laughing, Shiki flashed a sly grin before she asked: Hey, Iosei-chin, can I ask you something? And be honest when you answer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like Yumi-chin?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Iosei immediately started blushing, as Shiki was ready to laugh again at his shocked expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, you can't fool me. Sure the others didn't really notice, or maybe Murakumo-chin did a little, but didn't think much of it, but I saw that you were looking at Yumi-chin quite a lot while she was here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-And I wasn't looking at you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did, but you weren't as thorough with us as you were with her. Admit it, you were liking her swimsuit a lot, weren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't blame you for it though. She may not have a chest as big as me or Murakumo-chin, but she is drop-dead gorgeous anyway, right? Like her white skin, bright blue eyes, an amazing figure with well-proportioned curves... You sure liked seeing all that in that cute swimsuit she had, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more Shiki went on with the details, the more Iosei's mind started to wonder. He started to imagine Yumi playing with Rias and the other girls, before she started making advances to him in a more modest way than Asia or Irina, with her cute and shy side surfacing a little as she did that, as she pressed her breasts on is back, much to his pleasure, and some of the other girls' amusement. This made him a little turned on, a feeling which was augmented by his thighs expanding once again, a nice layer of fat covering his more lean and sleeker muscles of his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the more he imagined, the less right it seem to do what he was thinking off. It wasn't just putting Yumi in the position she was, but for him to be around so many girls, all attempting to make advances to him seemed wrong all of a sudden. That was especially the case for Akeno and Xenovia who were acting a little too immodest for his taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Just stop it, okay? You see I am not comfortable with this.\", said the boy as she shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Iosei-chin. It's not like I'll tell anyone about it. And there's no need to feel embarrassed either. Yumi-chin is a great pair for you if you think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Like, would you imagine yourself with someone else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIosei was taken aback by that statement. He always believed that if he would be in a relationship with a girl form the game it would be Katsuragi, Haruka or Shiki. He always disliked the bossy type that always seem to want to obey the rules like Yumi or Ikaruga. And the worst of all was... Iosei blinked in confusion as he couldn't remember the name of the girl he was thinking about. There was someone that was in a way Yumi's second in command, but he couldn't remember who. For a split second he thought it was Murakumo, but he knew that wasn't the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to try and figure what was going on with his head, but he had a hard time doing so due to Shiki constantly trying to get an answer out of him in regards to his feelings for Yumi, which even those were cloudy for him. At the small itch on his scalp wasn't helping either, not knowing that it was because his hair was now mostly straightened out, as all the greasiness it once had disappeared, the overall look of it becoming softer.  </span></div></div>",

I am sure Yumi-chin will actually be flattered to know you like her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIosei was getting increasingly frustrated with Shiki's insistence. At this point, if Minori would've joined in, he would be a step away from losing his mind. It wasn't the question itself what bothered him, but her desire to have him answer. He was slowly thinking that Shiki's behaviour wasn't just infuriating, but childish as well, as a thought of her acting more mature was sounding more and more correct than to just stop. He didn't want as much to tell her off, but to reprimand her instead. He was a little perturbed by this, as it wasn't in his character to scold someone, but once again, he couldn't focus due to the continuous questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clenched his fists subconsciously in the meantime, as he tried to hold back his annoyance. His hands gained a manicure as the overall appearance of them became dainty. But strangely enough his grip strength seemed to actually increased, while his arms started to slim down as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you really not going to say anything? It's between us. And maybe when you'll get enough courage to tell her-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\", said Iosei firmly as he stood up, fed up from all the times Shiki told him to answer. \"...am going to take a walk to clear my head a bit. I expect that when I return you to stop with this questioning. Got it?\" The girl, slightly taken aback by his tone, nodded her head in confirmation. \"Good. Now if you excuse me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked away from the group and put a little distance between them. Minori looked a little confused by this, while Murakumo sighed and shook her head as she put the finishing touches on the castle. Shiki, while feeling a little bad, puffed her cheeks. \"Jeez, what with him? I just want to help him. If he can tell it to me, it will be easy to tell it to her later... But I guess Iozaei-chin is a little to stubborn to just admit his feelings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little further, where Iozaei stopped, he massaged his temples with his daintier hands as he started to organize his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Iozaei... Just calm down and take a few deep breaths.\", said the boy to himself, not noticing the different way he called himself. After a few seconds, he calmed down, but he was still faintly blushing \"Damn you Shiki, you just had to say that bout Yumi-san... I need to push this aside for now. The whole situation about my supposed feelings for her is absurd. I could just say I am in a relationship, but I don't want to screw up and say something regarding Devils that I shouldn't have said. Truth be told, Yumi-san is indeed beautiful, and Shiki's comment about her oopai isnt' actually wrong and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was snapped from his thoughts as his swimwear became even tighter on him, tightly hugging his legs. Also, their legs started to slowly recede as their color lightened faintly as well. His manhood was a little visible now through the fabric, as he was still a bit turned on from Shiki's words, but at the moment he didn't seem to notice, focusing more on the tightness. He also escaped the fact that his arms continued shifting, as they became smaller, but their muscles retained their strength, if not gained a bit more as his muscles became more compact, becoming a tad stronger than his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with my swimsuit all of a sudden? Are they tighter or is it just me?... Well, that aside, I need to get my thoughts from Yumi-san and focus on Rias-san. She is the one I love after all. It's a shame she isn't here though. It would've been a lot better that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Rias still was his main love interest, and he still remembered the others, he was starting to feel a little weird including the other girls in the small dream of his master being with him. It felt almost wrong in a way he couldn't figure out yet. But before he could ponder more on it, he heard someone approaching him from behind.</span></div></div>",

Are you still angry?... I know Shiki-chan is a gets a bit too excited when things like love and all that is involved. But she never was interested in it before, so she might be influenced by some of her other friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't say... And no, I am not angry, I just needed a little breather, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Murakumo-chan is talking with her right now, so you should be clear from her questions for a while. Just don't bring the subject up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIozaei was glad he managed to dodge the proverbial bullet for the moment, as he gave out a small sigh. \"Thanks for telling me Minori-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\", chirped the smaller girl happily. \"Say, can we play with the ball in the water for a bit? Murakumo-chan is currently working on her manga, and Shiki-chan is texting her friends right now, and I thought we could play for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy smiled, as he replied back: \"Sure. I don't mind playing a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! Let's go then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the two began going in the sea, with Minori skipping forward, ahead of him. He couldn't help but feel like she was just like a little sister. In a way, it reminded him of Asia, but a lot more childish and bubbly. It was somewhat endearing to have her around him, especially in compare to Shiki. It almost reminded him of his own little sister... The second he had that thought, Iozaei felt something was off. He was always an only child, so why would-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly felt a lot colder all of a sudden, as a small gust of wind blew over them, making him shiver a bit, especially around his chest. Minori noticed that and turned towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you a little cold?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, a bit. And I don't know why. Maybe it's the wind and the water combined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can take a shirt from the shack if you want. We said we could borrow one if we get cold or forget our swimsuits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we take them in the water?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They said we could. I think it's the same type that people wear at the pool if I remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see. Can you wait a bit until I go and put one on me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Take your time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIozaei turned around and went back to the shore, as he tip-toed back to the shack, to not make Shiki notice him and pester him again. Inside the small building, he noticed that indeed there were a few shirts, towels and umbrellas, most likely for the tourists to use if necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, I never noticed that when I came for the bathroom... But why did I get cold all of a sudden? Is that the beginning of a cold or...\" He wondered a bit until he noticed a full body mirror in the back of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked at himself, he saw that his nipples were already a little hard, and a tad swollen. but in his head he saw nothing else out of the ordinary. He missed the fact that his skin was completely hairless, except for his hair. Speaking of which, the shade of his mane also started to darken a tiny bit from it's usual light-brown, as it continued becoming less unkempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... I wonder if it was just the wind. Normally I am perfectly fine with the cold...\", thought Iozaei as he put on a white shirt that fit him and went back outside.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Strangely though, he saw that he started placing one foot in front of the other, as his steps were a bit smaller, as he wiggled his hips a little due to his new walking style. He found this slightly odd, but didn't ponder on it too much, as he continued walking. He didn't see that his pelvis started to spread outwards with his new walk, which was somehow not painful, as he felt just a small tingle from the whole process. After putting a respectable distance between him and the girls, he then walked into the sea, before going back to Minori, who was patiently waiting for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry if it took a bit too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem. It was a little odd to see you without a top on anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I think you must've forgotten because Shiki-chan distracted you. You always wear something to protect your chest, so it was strange to see you topless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIozaei was a little confused by that statement. Normally he wouldn't wear a top or anything of that sort, as long as it wasn't necessary. But a few memories of him covering his chest with a shirt or top... or something he couldn't clearly remember at the moment  whenever he went to the beach. Combined with the fact that his more sensitive nipples felt quite fine in the confines of his slightly wet shirt, made him brush it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's just us, so it really isn't a real issue, but I guess you're right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so. But the way...\" Minori trailed off, with a slightly embarrassed and nervous expression on his face which stood to the boy as a little odd for her to make such an expression. \"I know it sounds a bit mean to ask you this after what Shiki-chan put you through, but after listening to the reason why she got to leave like that, I am a bit curious... Do you like someone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started blushing immediately, before Minori tried to explain herself. \"I-I am just asking to know if there is someone you have a crush on, not who the person is. It doesn't need to be Yumi-chan like Shiki-chan thought. Y-You don't need to tell me the name, or... to answer if you don't want to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he felt a little relieved he wouldn't need to disclose anything about Rias or the other girls, he was nonetheless nervous. How would he be able to explain the whole harem situation? He could just say he has a crush on several girls, but it would sound strange no matter how would a normal person would look at it. He felt a little bad for lying about not liking Akeno, Asia or the other girls, so he decided to only talk about Rias at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is someone... But promise you won't tell anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will, don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is a year older than me, has long red hair and...\" Iozaei's thighs were growing once more as more fat poured into them, but his leg muscles didn't disappear, as like his ankles, became a little more flexible. He was however distracted for a brief second as they crushed his manhood a little.\"... and icy blue-eyes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. That red hair is something unusual though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-She is from another country, so her features are indeed a little foreign...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She sounds beautiful... I kind of want to see her if I could...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's a shame\", said Iozaei as he thought to himself with a frown: \"Why did I say \"icy-blue\"? Her eyes were always towards azure. But were they...? I think I recall her having a lighter shade of blue... Whatever, I can't go back now. I'll feel stupid if she looks at me as if I don't know  how Rias looks.\" He shook off his head a little before he and Minori went a little deeper into the water for their game.</span></div></div>",

He received it as he then hit it back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game wasn't too competitive, as they were doing it just for fun, but both were eager not to drop the ball literally in any case. While hitting the ball, Iozaei was still slightly concerned about what was going on inside his head, so while he was playing, the tried to sort things out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do I see Rias with light-blue eyes all of a sudden? If there's someone I should know best it would be her. And I know her eyes were always deep-blue... But now all of a sudden, they look a lot lighter in my head... I should still remember what eyes the others had, right? Akeno-san's were violet, Asia's were... green, Koneko-chan's were... yellow, no amber... What's going on here? I know I am still frazzled with the whole situation here and the fact I am at Sensei's mercy to get out of here, but I should remember basic stuff like this, right? Oh I know, I'll just try and see if I remember how big their oopai were. This should be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could even try to remember his shirt tightened around him as his nipples tingled a little as they pushed out a bit as they became pink in color and the areolae expanded as well, increasing their sensitivity. They were visible through the wet shirt for a second before the material started to thicken and shift, becoming a little tougher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ngh... No forget about oopai... I mean breasts right now. Minori-san is right in front of me, I can't let my mind drift on something like that right now... Just push that aside for now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to try not to imagine any perverse images in his head, as it was too distracting for him. But unknown to him, by doing so, the memories of Akeno and the other girls were starting to get foggy, the prospect of a harem was beginning to sound wrong to him, as he began to become more modest and less lustful. Rias's image also changed a bit more, as her skin lightened, becoming quite pale in the process, as she didn't lose her loving expression that she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I guess I must be alone again before I start to think about that... Everything else aside,  I think Shiki-san's provoked all this with her assumptions. Regardless of all that, I am a bit busy at the moment, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Iozaeri-san! Slow down a bit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Huh?\", asked Iozaeri, noticing that Minori was two feet further than the last time he paid attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You started to hit a ball a little harder every time I threw it at you for the last two minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh... I am sorry...\", said the boy as he scratched his cheek sheepishly. He couldn't see, but his arm muscles became quite toned, a lot more than his legs. While his arms did in fact became slimmer and smaller, their strength increased quite a lot, a blow from them possibly rivaling one from his Crimson Queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about. I know how hard you hit anyway. And you seemed to be thinking about something, so I didn't want to interrupt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I should apologize for not noticing. Let's talk about something for a while then.\"</span></div></div>",

For example, the ones you are supposed to meet today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean Asuka-chan and her friends? Sure, but why did you say like you wouldn't meet them? Yumi-chan went after them, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes... Sorry, I forgot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreferably Iozaeri wanted to leave without staying in this place for much longer, but a voice in his head seemed to calm him down, telling him to stay, as it was no real real reason to leave at the moment. This in turn made him much calmer, deciding to enjoy his time at the beach. Still, he was now satisfied to know that Hanzo's Shinobi Elite would be joining them. He remembered their personalities and personal traits, but before he could start thinking about their figures, the thoughts were swiftly removed from his head. Also, his initial view on Katsuagi's perverted antics changed from funny to unnerving, as he believed that groping a girl to be something reserved for private times and only with permission, and no other time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they the only ones coming or are Miyabi-san and Homura-san coming as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miyabi-chan and her team are busy with their training today and Homura-chan and the others are working part-time, so they won't be coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I am so excited to meet Hibari-chan and play today! I just hope Yagyu-chan will let her. She is a bit too clingy to her than she should...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe... I guess so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Murakumo-chan is really happy to see Ikaruga-chan. She said she wanted her input on her new manga that she's making and wants her to give her opinion about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what is it about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I took a peek or two, but it seems a little complicated. There was a girl that looked like Shiki-chan at one point, but I didn't manage to get the plot or anything like that. It was supposed to be action-themed from what I understood though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalking with Minori seemed something a lot more natural for Iozaeri than he thought. He believed it would be a little difficult, but they were having a conversation as if they have done it before. Also, as he stood in the sun with his arms crossed under his chest, his skin tanned a bit more, making his skin resemble the tan Minori and the other girls had, as he didn't seem to feel cold from the water anymore. On top of that, his darkening locks started to gain a bluish hue, as his now completely straight bangs began to restyle themselves to a new haircut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just hope Katsuragi-san won't be causing too much trouble with her usual way to show \"affection\".\", huffed the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it is a little strange to touch a girl's chest like she does, but she doesn't seem that harmful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as she keeps her hands away for this trip, I'll be fine... But I suppose that if Ikaruga-san and Asuka-san allows it, I will relent a bit, as disgraceful at the act is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they seem to be used to it by now..\", said Minori with a slightly nervous smile. \"Speaking of Asuka-chan, she was very thrilled about the invite we offered her and her team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is a leader. And I can tell that she knew her team needed a bit of relaxation, given she asked everyone, including her grandfather about it.\", replied Iozaeri, knowing now details that he shouldn't regarding the meeting with the Hanzo girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she was a little sad when she heard Homura-chan wouldn't be coming today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what I understood, they are rivals, and very good friends, so I suppose it's natural for her to feel like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But there is something I noticed last time when we went together with everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?

In what way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I wouldn't say staring, but it came pretty close. And whenever Asuka-chan looked at her, she started to get slightly nervous as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Most of the times, Homura-chan acted normally, but when the two went to have a talk among themselves, like a \"rival talk\", or something like that, me and Shiki-chan saw that Homura-chan was slightly red, while Asuka-chan was a bit worried about her before she brushed it off. They than talked about defeating each other and becoming stronger, but after 10 minutes the same thing happened again before they rejoined the group.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was surprisingly strange and at the same not really that much. It was pretty clear that in the later games of the series Homura developed a crush on Asuka, based on several dialogue lines the two shared at times, and what MInori said pretty much gave another confirmation to the fact. However, Iozaeri was starting to forget about there being games about the people he was now talking with, but this didn't stop him from understanding the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Homura-san likes Asuka-san more than a friend it seems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Really?!\", asked the younger girl with her eyes wide open. \" I mean, I knew Homura-chan blushing was strange but to be actually this is kind of... unexpected...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a little. But given that they knew each other for quite a long time before we met them, it is safe to say they grew close as a result of their rivalry... But I think Asuka-san might not be yet aware of her feelings, based on what you told me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so... But it makes sense why she thought that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... You liking Yumi-chan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing that, Iozaeri's cheeks once again flushed, as he went into a small inner panic attack. He didn't notice how his shirt started to shrink away, partially exposing his belly button as its bottom part began to fade towards green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-\"What do you mean?\", asked the boy in a little country accent, that wasn't too noticeable, but still present nonetheless, as his voice climbed up a little more as well, the bulge in his throat shrinking a little as well..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Please hear me out! I know it sounds a bit over the top, but please listen. This is all what Shiki-chan told me, okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying not freak out further, Iozaeri started to calm down, not even sure why he reacted the way that he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that? That's so not like me... Usually I would be happy if someone said a like likes me. Why did I become so flustered all of a sudden? Is it because she mentioned Yumi-san again? When Shiki-san mentioned her, it wasn't so bad... But I need to get a grip. I don't know what she will tell me, but I already like Rias...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he once again thought about Rias, her image changed a little more as she lost a few centimeters in height as her wavy hair started to straighten out as it also began to shrink, going form her tights to her back. His memories about her also changed a little, as while she still remained the leader of the group, he was now remembering her using ice-magic as well. He wasn't aware how his bony hips were now spreading a little further, as they were complimented by a small layer of fat, while his butt expanded a little as well, pushing his trunks further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But anyway... I'll just listen to what Minori-san will say\", thought the boy in his head \"I am pretty sure Shiki-san told her a bunch of things that she only thinks it's true based on her guesses.... I bet Ryona-san gave her a funny idea...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After a few seconds, she decided to begin while Iozaeri listened carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... You know that you are by far one of the most respectful people we know, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Okay...\", replied Iozaeri a little confused. \"What does she mean? I mean, sure I do listen to other people's needs or opinions, but is that all?... I wouldn't go that far. In comparison, Yumi-san... I mean Rias-san would fit this description way better than I do.\", thought the boy, not minding much of his small slip-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we know that Homura-chan and Asuka-chan's relationship is based abound the respect they have for one another... So with that in mind, and the fact that both you and Yumi-chan always try to improve yourselves like they do, together, she said that you pretty much are like them in a way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's way too far-fetched! It's not like we stutter or blush around one another. And there's more to liking someone than just that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that! And that's what I also told her... But then she said that you are more like Ikaruga-chan and Yomi-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We... don't know if they like each other or not, but Shiki-chan did say they are like a married couple at times. I still don't see it really... but you two do kind of remind me of them, with how caring you are for us, and how much you both take charge at times... It kind of makes sense...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIozaeri was starting to have his cheeks red again, but there was also something unsettling regarding what Minori said that concerns him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is this coming from? When did I ever say anything about taking the lead? And what's this thing about caring for them or training with Yumi? Is this another one of Shiki-san's pranks? It has to be. The whole thing about romance is one thing but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thought process was interrupted when his already tight shirt seemed to massage his chest. While it wasn't visible, this made him slightly aroused, as both his shirt and trunks continued to shrink. His bottoms settled for a light green color as their legs almost completely vanished, while the same green appeared on his shirt too, but only on the bottom part, the top staying white. In addition, its sleeves disappeared entirely, as it now resembled a tank top, while it now exposed his navel. Lastly, his chest started to push out a little, as small fat deposits started to accumulate there, forming petite A-cup breasts due to the massage, but they remained invisible for the time being. Despite all this, he managed to get a hold of his feelings, as his blush getting a little deeper was the only thing that was noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally he would have a lot more difficulty to control his urges, but his mind was also changing with his body, which made him feel less excited currently. Also, his memories of the other girls from the ORC were starting to vanish, as the group that Rias led was no longer the members of the club, but a completely different team that he currently couldn't remember.  His perspective of her also changed a bit more, as her expression turned from alluring and seductive to modest and caring, while her hair now reached to her mid-back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinori didn't seem to notice the changes to his clothing, but was getting a little worried to Iozaeri's pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you feeling okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, I'm fine, don't worry about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to sit down?

We still need to have enough energy for when Asuka-san and the other would be coming. You did say you were looking forward to play with Hibari-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! But are you dizzy? You looked a bit lost back there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries. It's just a small wave of vertigo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two started to walk back to the beach. Iozaeri did feel his shirt was tighter on him and that it didn't feel the same on his skin, but didn't bother to think too much on it. He was a bit confused where that small period of arousal came from or why it even happened. He initially thought it was due to a fantasy he imagined of him and Yumi after the whole conversation with Minori, but he couldn't remember having any dirty thoughts. There was also something that Minori said before that unsettled him, but he was having a little bit of trouble remembering what exactly it was that made him nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't see that his figure was becoming smaller as his shoulders became less broad and more round or that his waist started to pull in. While most of the muscle he developed during his training has vanished, but despite now having a washboard-flat abdomen, it still remained well toned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the pair arrived back at their spot, with Murakumo still working on her manga, but with Shiki nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Where is Shiki-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She went to be restroom not that long ago. Did you two had fun?\", asked the masked girl with a monotone voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we had lots of fun! We played a lot, it was almost like a mini tournament!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha... I wouldn't go that far Minori-san... But we did play quite a lot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. So what are you going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to play cards until Hibari-chan arrives. Do you want to join?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I need to finish my work for today. After Ikaruga arrives, I don't know if I'll be able to complete my draft, and I want to show her my sketches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. I'll just play with Shiki-chan instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I think I'll rest for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you feel tired?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not in particular, but I feel like I need to lay down for a little while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. You may as well. And don't worry about Shiki. I'll tell her not to disturb you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Minori sat down, next to Murakumo while Iozaeri sat on the beach chair. The second he did that though, he felt like the chair was more cushy than before. But he quickly dismissed the thought, as he knew there wasn't a pillow or anything of the sorts on the chair. He didn't see that his butt continued growing, slowly becoming larger and firmer as he sat down. He closed his eyes just before Shiki apparently arrived, something which he considered lucky for. He didn't want her to ask him all those questions again, and was grateful when Murakumo told her to let him rest before sitting down to play with Minori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't entirely wrong when he said he needed to rest a bit, due to all the things that confused him, but in reality he wanted to try and figure out what exactly was wrong, as he felt more and more like the things that weirded him out before were getting more and more natural for him.</span></div></div>",

And I thought when I went to the bathroom was bad enough. Now I am not even sure what to think... First of all, why did Minori-san say all those things regarding me and Yumi-san? Sure, the whole thing about having a crush on her aside, training with Yumi-san and caring for them is strange... Sure, I do care about them a lot, and they are all very dear to me, but even so, it's not like they are just like my siblings. I just can't picture Shiki-san as one and... Wait, siblings?... I am an only child, right? No, that doesn't sound right... I could swear I had a younger brother, no two... and a sister... Wait a second... I am the oldest of twelve, aren't I? It sounds weird, but that's the truth, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIozaeri was gradually remembering the faces of eleven children, all of them hugging him, and laughing with him, the oldest of which didn't look more than ten. For a brief second, he thought he was their caretaker, but then he realized they were his siblings. He was getting fond memories of them helping him around the house cleaning, cooking and then playing various games in he living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was relishing these memories, his hair styled itself into a bowl-cut, with all of his unruly locks of hair straightening out. On top of that, the faint blue accents that appeared not that long ago were slowly getting more dominant as the color of his hair was gradually changing, the brown gradually being replaced by a dark-blue. While it would be a little longer for the color to reach the proper tone, it surely no longer resemble his original haircut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs pleasant as the memories were, Iozaeri decided put them on the side for the moment. There was something else regarding his parents that he should remember, but for now, something else was his focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I also acted a bit off, didn't I? Normally I would just enjoy looking at a girl in a swimsuit, but now it feels wrong to do so... I mean, there is no real problem as long as you don't stare and make tasteless comments. I respect a woman's body and their features. It is natural for a girl to take pride her figure... As long as they don't do the same thing Shiki-san does and try to show her appeal whenever she wants. I always wonder now Murakumo-san manages to deal with her on a daily basis... It would be great if there were more girls like Rias-san. She has great style, is modest and cares about her appearance, while not trying to get attention. That's why I like her so much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, his mind drifted towards Rias, but unlike before, when her physical allure and charm would be the first thing for him to notice, particularly her chest, this time it looked more like Iozaeri was instead drawn by the serene, composed and caring expression Rias now had. but he didn't notice how her more mature features that she had were now gradually replaced with a much younger visage, as the face of the woman he adored was slowly starting to resemble someone else's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of that, another faint wave of arousal emerged from within him, but it was nowhere near as intense as it would normally be. His top massaged his chest again as the small breasts he possessed grew quite a bit, as they became a little visible through the shirt as the became large A-cups. Also, his manhood tingled a little as his trunks started to do the same process as the top. This made its size to start diminishing along with his testes, as its size was now roughly a little bigger than half of its size. He grunted a little and was about to question what was happening when the massage stopped as quickly as it started.</span></div></div>",

He strangely felt a little better though, even if the fog in his head didn't disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubbed his eyes as he looked around and saw Muraumo still drawing and Minori and Shiki playing cards, with the former winning a few times already based on her grin and the smaller girl's pout. He couldn't see it, but his original hazel eyes were now not only bigger, with his eyelashes now being longer as well, but their color completely changed to a deep blue, resembling the same shade as his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you sleep well Yozakeri?\", asked Shiki as he noticed him awake, with the other girls also looking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't call it a sleep, but I managed to rest a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry if we woke you up.

I can't trust too many people on this, and I can't show you my sketches, as I want only Ikaruga and Yomi to see them.\", said the masked girl as the boy nodded in response before she continued. \"It is in a way a story about fictional beings like devils, angels and such in a medieval setting, but instead of knights or magicians fighting them this time a group of shinobi are the protagonists.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story sounded quite interesting to Yozakeri, but there was something that resonated within him as well the more that he listened to the story. However he was unable to say what exactly. When he heard \"devil\" he felt a little nostalgic, but without knowing why, he shook his head a little as he listened to Murakumo's description.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts on Rias continued to change as the group that she lead was now composed of shinobis, but it was far smaller, with only her and four other people fighting what appeared to be a demon or yokai of sorts, although he felt like it had another name as well. Also, as weird as it sounded to him, he started to believe he was one of the members of the squad, even if he currently didn't think of himself as a shinobi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe missed the fact that his top was now losing a good amount of material in the back, slowly exposing more of his back, while the bottom resembled his trunks perfectly in terms of color, as the upper part remained white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am also thinking to add some romantic elements to the story as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? How are going to incorporate it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I wanted Ikaruga and Yomi's input on this. Or do you have a suggestion as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... are asking me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I know you read quite a lot of books with Yumi, so if you have an idea, I would be curious to listen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know... I am not really into those types of books...\"</span></div></div>",

I tried to be subtle, but after she saw my hand she kind of figured out I let her win. She needs to play serious from time to time though. Like, with someone more serious like you two or Hikage-chin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She will give up after the first match if you have the two of them together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough... So you were talking about the manga?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I was hoping I would get a few ideas for it from Yozakeri.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, why don't you ask me? I also have a few good ideas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Have you forgotten what happened last time you gave me ideas and I, foolish as I was, tried to implement them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't so bad. Sure, it was like... a little too mature for Hibari-chin or Mirai-chin... but you know that Ryona-chin also contributed to that mess, and you seemed intrigued by it in the end. And besides, it's not that your story is something that would turn like the last one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You looked at it when I wasn't looking, were you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In my defense, you just let it there on the table in the lounge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I should've known...\", said Murakumo with a large sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYozakeri wasn't sure he wanted to find out what the last manga was about judged by what he gathered from the conversation. Normally, he would try his best to try and catch a glimpse of a dirty magazine, or even hear the story of it if possible, especially since this might be the only chance he would have. But right now, the thought of such a story made him nervous and a little disgusted and embarrassed. And the thought that a manga with a such a content was made by these girls actually made him a little angry as well. A sense of responsibility was slowly growing in him, as he felt like it was his duty to keep these girls in line, even if currently he couldn't understand why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the discussion, his waist compressed further, which combined with his hips and still growing rear, gave him the bottom of an hourglass figure. He also felt something in his throat, coughing a bit, before the sensation vanished, as his Adam's apple disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure hope you don't plan to make something like that again.\", said Yozakeri in a girl's voice, which somehow sounded familiar to him before brushing the thought off, thinking his current voice was his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not. That was just an error that we won't repeat.\", said the masked girl, which made Shiki sigh in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure... It's not like I wanted something like that to be made by Murakumo-chin. though it would be funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shiki!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll stop. So are you going to play with Minori-chin too? Me and Yozakeri-chin did our part. It's just natural for you to do the same before Yumi-chin and the others arrive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Very well. But don't look at my work in the meantime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yozakeri, make sure he doesn't look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiki became a tad upset at this as Murakumo went to play with Minori, leaving Yozakeri and Shiki alone. The latter however started to get a little nervous as a grin crept on the blonde's lips. He knew where this was going.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But given that I made you left and you were quite angry because of it, I will put it on the side for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave a small sigh of relief, thankful that he escaped the \"interrogation\". \"I appreciate the thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. But keep in mind what I said and what Minori-chin said, okay? She told me about your little talk while you were sleeping. And don't worry, I didn't ask for too many details.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYozakeri was still a little bothered by how accepting Shiki was and that she knew about the conversation he and Minori had before, but given that she didn't seem as keen to ask him any more made him ease a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, I wanted to ask you something. How do you see Asuka-chin and Homura-chin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In... what regard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their relationship. They seem a little too close to be just rivals, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You also told Minori-san about it. She said you believe Homura-san might have a crush on Asuka-san, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it is kind of obvious. I mean, she is also Miyabi-chin's rival in a way, given their past, but like, those two are a lot closer than you expect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I thought that they are acting a bit more like sisters...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest, it kinda looks that way at first, but then is Homura-chan's constant blushing whenever the tiniest bit of skinship is involved. Sure, most of the time she acts perfectly normal, but there are times you see her flustered, timid or nervous around Asuka-chin. She even is like a tsundere at times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow this was odd for him. He always thought Homura to be a tomboy that is interested in fights more than anything that acts like a strong, but caring leader when needed. So to hear something like this about her was surprising... But when thinking back, he didn't interact with her too much or knew her that good like the girls from Hanzo's Academy did. She seemed like a more reckless, and less perverted Katsuragi, but didn't spend that much time trying to know her. Not even when battling her squad did he learn much about her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something in that line of thought that seemed wrong to Yozakeri, but before he could ponder on it, a his face started to itch a little. He scratched himself a bit, but he could feel a small buzzing sensation which worried him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. It's just that my face itches a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's a towel if you need one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiki handed him a light green towel that he used to rub his face. As he rubbed it, he could feel the itchiness going away, but this was more that his face finished changing. By the time he was done, his cheekbones grew higher as his lips became a little plumper while his nose and ears shrunk down. When he put the towel down, he now was in possession of a beautiful face that no longer resembled his previous boyish visage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, his former confusion over his thoughts vanished as now in his memories he could remember the time he and his team fought the other shinobi schools in a battle royale as more images of his past with the girls at Gessen appeared in his mind. This now made him think of himself as a shinobi as the team that Rias lead consisted of him and the other girls of Gessen as her hair now just brushed her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I don't know where that itch came from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it happens. And it was your towel. You did say you wanted to only use yours after all.\", said Shiki, not finding anything wrong with Yozakeri's new face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right... As for what you said before, I am kind of amazed of what you said. But still, are you sure it's true? I find it a little hard to believe Homura-san would be in love with Asuka-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true, but... I kind of got some really interesting stuff from Yumi-chin, and don't ask how I manage to have her tell me this, but it really sells it for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\", asked Yozakeri now really interested in the topic.</span></div></div>",

But when we had that battle royale a while back, after talking with both of them, Yumi-chin actually thinks the two are perfect for one another and neither seem to deny it too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? How did she find out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we fought Homura-chin and her group, she got super flustered and blushed a lot from what I understood when Yumi-chin joked that she and Asuka-chin were more like lovers than rivals and admitted with quite a lot of difficulty that Asuka-chin wasn't her property. She tried to deny there being anything, like, romantic between them, but she didn't sound too convincing by the looks of it. And when we went at Hanzo's for our rematch, after being told that Homura-chin might have feelings for her, Asuka-chin was surprised, but didn't seem bothered by the idea in the slightest . In fact she was actually enjoying the thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Is that true? But what does she think of their relationship?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said they are rivals, but I think she might have feelings for Homura-chin, but she is most likely unaware of them just yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the conversation, Yozakeri's hair turned completely dark-blue, just like his eyes, as he brushed off a bang from his bowl-cut, without noticing the color. ON top of that, his butt also finished growing to an amazing heart-shape that perfectly complimented the rest of his figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's really surprising... I knew the two of them were close, but I didn't expect them to be like that. This is quite the revelation... Does anyone else know about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wouldn't say they know too much, but I think Haruka-chin and Katsuragi-chin may know, given they seem to taunt Homura-chin quite a bit when it comes down to her feelings... As for the others, maybe Ikaruga-chin or Miyabi-chin might have a clue on it, but I think that's mostly limited to their closeness more than anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... Wait, why exactly did you want to discuss this? This was quite random and...\" Yozakeri stopped as he remembered something that Minori told him before and frowned a little. \"...Is this tied to how you think me and Yumi-san might have a similar relationship?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Maybe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you we aren't like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know... But I thought I should tell you about this since Minori-chin did brought it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not going to, like, pressure you if don't want to talk about. But just try to think of the idea rather than outright deny it. And besides, you really think I came up with this stuff just to mess with you? We've all been together since, I don't know, a lot, so I do know how a few things about us... Who knows, maybe you are unaware like Asuka-chin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYozakeri was unable to see Shiki's viewpoint. It wasn't like there were that many mirroring elements between his relationship with Yumi and the one Asuka and Homura have. And besides, he wasn't into Yumi in the first place, as he still had Rias... But his image of his lover in his head was way different than it was in the beginning. And the fact that she was now the leader of she shinobi group he was part of seemed wrong as well, so he decided to close his eyes to think better about this, with Shiki silently looking at him, pondering what was he thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout anyone seeing, Yozakeri's top continued to change as its straps shifted their position, wrapping themselves around his neck, while the portion that remained white was now differentiated form the green parts. Then, the top started to shift around, with its right side seemingly getting tugged behind the left. Also, his bottoms shrunk further, completely losing their legs as they tightened around his groin. And yet neither Yozakeri, nor Shiki noticed anything out of the ordinary.</span></div></div>",

But there were a few things that didn't sit right with him. For starters, he had the feeling that Rias was the leader of a club, not the shinobi elite of Gessen, like he currently remembered, and also thought that there should be a lot more people, not just them, Shiki, Murakumo and Minori. There was also the fact that in most of his memories, he recalled various training sessions, battles with other shinobi groups, like Asuka's or caring about his friends like they were his family, but nothing else that would involve the fate of the world or anything of the sort. And while he still fights with his fists a lot, he now seems quite reluctant to use his legs for combat, and the idea of him fighting while donning an armor doesn't seem as normal as it should.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something's really off... There are so many conflicting things in my head, but most of the things I have doubts over are silly. I don't know where all of these things are coming from, but I need to put these things away right now. I need to focus on Rias  for the moment...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he cleared his head, all of the thoughts that contradicted his current memories vanished, making him fully believe his past as a shinobi to now be genuine. As he did, his top finished becoming a bikini top, as the fabric now perfectly matched the one of his trunks, while a flower motif began to appear all over his swimsuit. His back was now almost completely exposed, save for a band that felt his swimsuit to his body, while the neckline plunged a little more, revealing a bit of his cleavage. Then, just like before, the top and bottom started to seemingly move on their own as they massaged his chest and groin, as Shiki, who was still looking at him didn't seem to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe once again focused on Rias, not noticing anything out of place regarding her appearance, as he enjoyed imagining her. But while he was attracted to her, he tried to purge any perverted thoughts away, thinking that they are ruining his mood. As he admired her, a white bow with blue stripes appeared in her hair, as any sign of waviness, including her ahoge were completely flattened out. Lastly, her chest started to shrink a little, as the breasts that made her stand out as one of the most endowed ladies he knew slowly grew smaller, albeit not by much for now. But while usually Yozakeri would freak out from something like this happening, right now, he also thought that Rias should have smaller breasts to not inconvenience her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the massaging came to a halt, and while his chest didn't grow this time, his manhood did in fact grew smaller once again, now being only a third of its original size, as his testes also shrunk down considerably, not being quite small compared to how they were at the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She looks the same in my eyes... I already have someone I like, so there shouldn't be any issues whatsoever. I don't get why Shiki-san keeps trying to convince me I may like someone else. And besides, there's no way you could find a Devil like her... Wait, Devil? Where did that come from? She is nothing like that... Although she does look like a yuki-onna when she wears her obi...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny lingering thoughts that had any tied to Devils and Angels also disappeared from his head, as he only thought yoma and yokai to be the only supernatural beings that he believed existed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It looks like Asuka-chin's bus that was supposed to bring her and her friends here was stuck in traffic. She said that she will wait for them there anyway.\" Just then, her phone beeped, indicating she got a message, making her read what was sent to her. \"And speaking of her, she said the bus just arrived and is now coming with Asuka-chin and her group. She should be arriving pretty soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! They're finally coming!\", exclaimed MInori as she and Murakumo sat next to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was a bit worried before when you said they are going to be late, but I am relieved they arrived safely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Murasaki-chin, did you really think they had an accident or something? You sure are pessimistic...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop taunting me Shiki. I was just expressing my concern over their safety...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinori giggled as she watched their exchange, which continued for couple more minutes, with Yozakera also looking at them from the side with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They never change, do they? Well, it is to be expected, but I am nonetheless happy that they don't... I am also happy Yumi-san is also returning. I was wondering what was taking her so long, but I guess it was also my fault for not asking earlier... I don't know why, but I feel a little happy that she's returning. How strange...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was too distracted by his thoughts to see how his breasts grow once again, going all the way to C-cups, which made a bigger window of cleavage than before. Also, on the left side of his swimsuit, on the white section, a cherry blossom flower magically appeared. Lastly, he began to feel a faint pulling sensation in his groin, as his testes slowly started to be pulled inside his abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hm. Something feels off. I can't say for sure, but it seems like there is again something that seems to be against my memories... I may need a bit more time to contemplate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYozakera once again started to remember Rias, but he felt that he was instead having a crush on her rather than outright admitting it. He also didn't confess his feelings yet, but it didn't seem to be an issue as he initially thought. But there was also a thought that made him think that \"Rias\" wasn't the girl's name, and that instead it should be something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Yozakera-chin, are you alright?\", asked the blonde, snapping him out from his thoughts. \"You looked like you were distracted... Were you perhaps thinking about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No. It was about something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we need to get this place for when Yumi-chin and the others are coming...

And he was a little like, lost back there for a second, so who knows, maybe he needs some time for himself too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Why do I have a feeling you were involved in this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not like you didn't say I can't tell him a few things...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurakumo sighed a little frustrated with her friend's answer and behaviour, but didn't comment on it while Minori was a little worried about the situation as well, but followed her senior's decision and went to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, after putting a respectable distance between him and the girls, Yozakera slowly walked in the direction Yumi went before. But while he was a little excited to meet his leader, he was still bothered by his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his head, the girl's name didn't sound as right as before, as \"Rias\" seemed more and more inappropriate for her. The girl's bust shrunk until her breasts were smaller than Shiki's but still bigger than average nonetheless, which didn't seem to be an issue to him. The last think that was to change about her was her hair. The crimson mane she once had, was now barely touching her shoulders as the vibrant red was now gradually becoming dull, and darkening a little, with a few strands actually becoming grey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... She is the girl I love... no, I like, isn't she? I am a little too inexperienced with romance, and I don't even know how she feels about me. The only thing I know is from a few movies and soap operas... I am glad Shiki-san did not go with the subject further, as I would have no idea how to go from that... But something is not right. Why can't I remember her name? I don't know why I thought her name was Rias for the longest time. It sounded way too foreign, and it doesn't suit her at all... I know my mind was a little in the gutter today, especially after I came to the beach, but it shouldn't be so bad. It's surely Shiki-san fault with her taunting and for making me imagining... all those things...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his mind once again went to the slightly perverted thoughts from before, he gave out a small yelp as his testes were completely pulled inside him and changed function, becoming ovaries and pumping more estrogen into him. This, as an effect made his breasts grow even further to D-cups, as they were almost to their final size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that? It felt really weird... And I am not feeling a little light-headed as well... I think this is punishment for my improper thoughts.\", said Yozakera to himself as he shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, there was nothing in terms of personality that would be similar to how he was when he arrived at the beach. Not only he was now a lot more responsible, caring and rule-abiding, he also developed a small maternal-side that made him care after his friends a lot more, especially Shiki and Minori, his juniors, while any perverseness he had was now completely purged from his head. His memories of his former world were also gone, along with his ideal to be a harem king. There was still a small side that had troubles with figuring out who he was in love with, it it wouldn't be a problem for long.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After recovering from the slight surge of hormones, Yozakera attempted once again to recall the name of the girl he liked. It bothered him quite a lot to not be able to remember something so crucial. He tried for a couple more minutes, but he only managed to say that her name started with \"Y\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is this so hard?... It is so embarrassing to forget her name...I just hope it will come naturally, as I can't have a migraine right before the others are to come... I guess I should at the very least try to get my feelings in check...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind went through a small shock when he went from being madly in love to simply having a crush, which made him a little disoriented and confused. Given the fact that his head played games with him the whole day, right now he wanted to finally be able to sort everything out. He once again imagined the girl, looking at her icy-blue eyes, pale skin, amazing physique, and her short hair. But there was a problem in terms of its color as he struggled to say if it was grey or red. Something told him that it should be the latter, but the more he remembered, the more the red was becoming less vibrant and more dull, slowly turning into grey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he tried to remember, his breasts finished their growth to large DD-cups, a few inches away from E-cups, which were displayed beautifully by his swimming top, being slightly smaller than the ones the girl he was thinking of had. In addition, his manhood started to tingle as it became even smaller as a small pulling force was beginning to pull what was left inside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that just the physical aspect wasn't enough, he then went to try and remember their past together. He recalled the times she asked for a training partner, and he always volunteered, which made her very happy, the times where she acted as a leader, when she showed her care and love for her friends and when they would go together with the others to enjoy themselves in their spare time. But there was also something else that he admired about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...When he had that shinobi battle royale, we went with the intent of getting rid of the \"evil\" shinobi and to correct Hanzo's academy for helping them before, but we soon realized that we were too narrow in our thinking. Everyone we met was just like us, with simply other ideals than our own. I expected her to be reluctant to change, given how close she was to grandpa Kurogane's teachings... but the fact that she managed to acknowledge that there is more to know about the other shnobis and their views on the world than just a label that put on them, was a sign of growth... I can feel that she became a lot more open ever since, allowing us to meet with Asuka-san's, Homura-san's and Miyabi-san's groups quite regularly after that... Not to mention that she herself decided to be more relaxed and less strict.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYozakera then started to blush a bit. \"... But to call me stronger than her? And to let me take the lead when she isn't available? I know she is quite modest, but I can't view myself as a leader. I do help her to make the others listen to us and obey the rules, but... I guess it is a sign of how much she trusts me. I am quite happy that she thinks that much of me...  I don't know why, but I always feels better to have her tell me that I have improved or when we train together... It's also something I don't feel if someone else does that. I respect her fully, I want to be able to lead Gessen after and Murakumo-san graduate and I want to make her happy, given that she is always stressed out because she is a leader and... Oh. I see... So it is in a way like Shiki-san said...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could say anything more, he gave out a small whimper as his manhood was replaced with still virgin flower, effectively making her a young woman. With a cherry blossom, like the one on his swimsuit appearing on the left side of her hair and with the girl's hair becoming fully grey in his mind, his transformation was now complete, as now thought of himself as Yozakura, a second year shinobi student at Gessen High School.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was weird... But I guess I did realize something in the end... I think I should keep going after Yumi-san and the others.\", said Yozakura to himself, as he said his crush's name with a little more affection than he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She started walking faster in their direction, which made Yumi and the others see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yozakura-san? What are you doing here?\", asked the Gessen leader as her friend stopped a few steps in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know when would you arrive, and I thought I should come looking for you in case something happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is really something you would do. Thanks for caring about us, but we're fine, there's no need to be worried.\", assured Katsuragi as Ikaruga then added:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I suppose we are a bit at fault for not telling you about our delay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're really sorry. There was this big traffic jam for almost two miles. A lot of people went for the beach and it was really crowded. It wasn't until we left the main road that we finally had a clear way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no need to apologize Asuka-san. It was to be expected, given the weather, that people would leave their house and go for a swim. We ourselves got lucky by arriving earlier this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. There weren't many cars on the road when we left, but their number was slowly picking up as we got closer to this place.\", continued Yozakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Perhaps we should've woken up sooner then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it Hibari. We needed sufficient sleep for today anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any case, should we continue? We should be arriving soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the group nodded before continuing their walk to their beach spot. While Yumi and Yozakura lead the way, they silently listened to the conversation the girls from Hanzo were having.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man.... After that trip, I am now really bored. Well, I think I know a very good way to regain my mojo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katsuragi-san, I hope you aren't thinking of once again fooling around with your way to show affection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Ikaruga, don't be so stiff. Hikage might be at times like a doormat, but she at the very least isn't so against it as you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bringing Hikage-san in this discussion means nothing and you know it-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? Think I will spoil her? Well, she is quite fun to be around... but we both now that you also don't mind a playful grope from time to time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What? O-On what basis are you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we not have this discussion now?!\", asked Asuka, exasperated. Ikaruga blushed as she decided to stay quiet while Katsuragi pouted a bit, but also didn't continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait to play with Minori-chan!\", said Hibari, as she tried to steer away from the awkward conversation from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I also play with you two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing Yagyu-chan... Just don't try to make me win all the games like last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Got it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really is a shame Homura-chan isn't here... I'm sure she would have had fun here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure bring up Homura-chan quite a lot lately.\", noted the pinkette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you perhaps missing her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. But why do you ask Katsu-nee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No reason in particular...\", hummed the blonde, while Asuka looked a bit confused by this, while the others sweat-dropped a little at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued talking, the two Gessen girls giggled a little at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They never change, do they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They sure don't. I guess it's a good thing in the end. It means that despite everything that happened they are still the way they were before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed... Although something tells me Asuka-san and Homura-san might have in fact change a little recently. In more ways than one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't mind me. I don't want them to hear about this anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven the talk she had with Shiki and Minori before, Yozakura understood what this was all about. And speaking of the relationship the two had, she blushed a little, remembering what she wanted to do before she took a deep breath and asked her leader, trying to suppress her accent:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, Yumi-san... I did find a nice teahouse recently, and I was wondering if you would want to go together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A teahouse? Of course I would like to. But I don't think Shiki-san would rather go to a caf\u00e9 instead and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I mean just the two of us...\", said Yozakura, surprising Yumi as she continued: \"Uh... I want to have more time dedicated for trying to understand each other better... And the only time we get to do this is d-during training. So I was thinking that maybe this would be good opportunity for that. J-Just the t-two of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew she had difficulties trying to properly convey her thoughts, her blush made her look even more nervous. But to her surprise, Yumi, while taken slightly aback by the request, also had her cheeks slightly pink as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh... I see. Then I suppose we can. Its been... some time since we had a private talk. I... would be happy to go with you Yozakura-san...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it wasn't as bad as her own stuttering, Yozakura understood that Yumi accepted, which made her answer back quickly. \"T-Then once we get back, we should talk about when to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that would be wise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two smiled at each other as they continued walking, hoping the other girls didn't hear them. Yozakura on the other hand was very happy that the girl she liked may indeed return her feelings based on her actions just now. But she would have to think about it later, as the last thing at the moment was to have Shiki or Katsuragi tease her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would act normal for the rest of the day, but when they would return home, she and Yumi will without a doubt have a serious talk... If she will think it would be the right moment for it...</span></div></div>",

He was sweating bullets as he tried his best to maintain his composure, in front of the eyes full of fury that Rias, Akeno, Xenovia, Koneko, Irina, Ravel, and even Rossweisse, while Asia was having a more dejected and disappointed stare than pure anger, but she was still very upset nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Um... I guess you already found out about my project, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I asked Grayfia to install cameras in the house to record you, in case you once again did something ridiculous.\", answered a very pissed off Rias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I should've expected that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough beating around the bush. Where is Ise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And don't there to sugarcoat it. Or I'll give you a little shock each time you do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon listening to Akeno's statement, the fallen angel gulped hard before opening his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Me and Ajuka talked about a way to integrate ourselves in the virtual reality, without just inserting ourselves into the story and change everything by doing so. In the end, we came up with the idea to make our avatars be the characters from the game or movie, thus keeping everything more or less the same. I decided to use Issei as a tester for one of the games I had, which had the opportunity to make an additional story line if you know how, without changing the overall story or narrative. The process worked, but... let's just say that because of the fact that the device was only in the beta phase. there were some... problems. So, to keep it short, it also changed his memories and personality to match the character's in addition to his physical changes... which resulted in him not remembering anything about us or this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing the explanation, the girls had their eyes wide open before they yelled in unison: \"WHAT?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean to sent him there, not even knowing our stupid machine could do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well, it wasn't like I could go there, since I need to monitor everything and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the point!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Ise-san doesn't remember us at all?\", asked Asia in a sad tone while Koneko inquired: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... What character is Senpai right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... About that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't make him an animal or something did you....?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not Rias! Why would I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why are you so panicked?\", asked Xenovia full of suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think... seeing the game will be a better way to show you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls nodded, but didn't until Azazel, as he instructed Rossweisse to get to the VR display screen, showing the modified story he was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are those a group of girls on the beach? Did you really had to send him to a harem gave of all things? But where is Ise? I don't see him anywhere...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a harem game... And Issei is there... He's... the one with blue hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon looking at the group again, they didn't saw any boy with blue hair among the girls. But then, a girl with short, blue hair in a bowl cut appeared on screen and going into the sea with a few other girls. It took them group five seconds before they yelled again at the same time: \"YOU MADE HIM A GIRL?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah...T-The other choices weren't all that great anyway, I thought I should give Issei a more likeable scenario...\", said Azazel. which didn't stop Xenovia and Irina point their blades at his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think we care about your excuses?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I promised the Lord not to take a life for petty reasons, but I find myself in a situation where I must-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why... Is Ise-sama holding that girl's hand like that?, asked Ravel as she saw the girl he has become holding hands, and giving a loving expression to another girl, with silver hair and pale skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About that... I guess not all of Issei was gone when the changes ended, and I guess he kept his sexuality intact despite him becoming a girl... If I were to say, I think that girl might have taken Rias's position while the whole thing about harems was most likely eliminated and- R-Rias, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all the girls were now shocked by the fact that Issei was still interested in girls, they were further angered by the fact that just one girl replaced them. And Rias, who was the closest to her Pawn than everyone emitted a frightening aura as she closed the distance between her and the fallen angel, the latter starting to lose his calm as he saw the girl's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will allow it just this once. Rossweisse-san, please put on a barrier to not destroy the house. After that, everyone is to make Azazel receive his punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait! I-I know I screwed up but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can talk after we're done, if you can of course. Now it's time to get your just desserts...\", said Rias coldly as she and the other girls, sans Asia readied themselves and their weapons while the barrier was put up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five seconds... a power light came from inside the house that would blind anyone that would look straight at it.</span></div></div>",

Just the idea of him liking a fictional girl, while he himself is one is something I can't accept.\" The rest of the girls nodded in response to that statement, and let the fallen angel to his job. But after taking a look at his equipment, which was also blasted away during his \"punishment\", he let out a sigh and turned towards the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how do want him? As a girl in mind or body? Or as pixels if we are at that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you took your time making a barrier to protect the house, but it seems the same couldn't be said about my stuff.\" He then stepped to the side, letting the girls see what was left of the device, which made them open their eyes as wide as before as they sweatdropped with a terrified expression on their faces. \"Most of the systems are burned to a crisp or smashed to pieces and I can't vouch that the motherboard will work properly... The monitor is still working, which means we can still see him, but that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... we can't bring him back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I told you to wait before.

Her name is Yozakura, is a modern ninja girl, likes to be polite, well-mannered and to always fight fair and with her fists, acts sometimes like a mother to the others, since is the oldest of twelve and...\" On the screen, Yozakura leaned her head on the gray-haired girl's shoulder with a peaceful expression on her face. \"... and since this series is heavily coded with having the girls have feelings for each other as there are no guys in it, she is usually shipped with Yumi, the leader of her squad, who is more or less the same as her, but also seems to like cute things. And if you were wondering, it's because of that she is attracted to her in this scenario. It's not a surprise Issei would find attractive...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls listened to his words, without trying to say anything about the plot or how different their love interest did a 180 degree switch in terms of personality, but were nonetheless having a hard pillow to swallow. They had to accept that for two weeks Issei would love someone else...</span></div></div>",

Upon looking around, he saw that he was in his bed, which confused him as to how he got there. \"Why am I in my bedroom? I don't remember getting here... Hey Ddraig do you know how I got here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Did you wake up partner? To be honest, I am not sure. The last thing I remember was that you were hit by a bright light before I lost consciousness. Everything after that is a blur. I do remember a girl's voice somewhere down the line, but I can't recall anything else. That beam must've put the two of us to sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were were asleep too?... Wait, a girl's voice? Was it Rias?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not sure, but it sounded different from Gremory's. But why do you look so confused?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I had this weird dream and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the door opened, as his harem made its way inside, with Asia running towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ise-san are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Yeah, I am fine, but what happened? You look a bit nervous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can blame Azazel for this. He apparently hit you with a ray that made you go into deep sleep for two weeks.\", said Rias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That long?... I am not in trouble at school, am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, he made sure to cover for you. You will have to do a bit more homework, but that should be all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That a relief... But a sleeping ray? That's a bit weird even for Sensei.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should you even be surprised at this point? We all know none of us understand why he needs all these ridiculous inventions for, even if sometimes my brother or Ajuka-sama asks for them at times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that everything in order Ise, do you want to see my notes? I made sure to write the essentials.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, not fair Xenovia! I also took notes for Ise-kun! You were supposed to say \"we\", not \"I\" to begin with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"School work aside, I am sure you must be hungry after all that sleep. Should I make something for dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-If it's okay Akeno-san, can I help too? I want to learn a bit more about cooking too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I took out some games to play. You will need to relax a bit before the struggle at school comes, so let's wind-off a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Me too! I know Ise-sama will have a lot work, but I want to join in as well if it makes it more relaxing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usually I am against playing games before studying, but I will make an exception this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like everyone is already trying to have some time with you after this long. I hope you will have some time for me as well Ise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Anytime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the group was debating what to do, Ddraig asked Issei again in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... What was this dream about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?.... Oh. It was weird, that's for sure. You remember about that game with ninja girls from a while back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That ridiculous one, with the girls not wearing anything that resembled ninja garb that was pure fanservice? If you're going to say that it was-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't just fanservice, and it was weird. It was almost like, I saw things as if I was there, it was extremely real. But after a while, I didn't feel like myself. It was like I was somebody else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It started off with me meeting a girl from the game, Yumi, and her friends, but one of them, Yozakura was missing. It was not seeing her there, when everyone else was... But after that, I forgot about her and it seemed like I took her place in a way... After that, it was like a few weeks have passed, with me not feeling like myself, but like Yozakura. Does that make sense?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wouldn't be the strangest thing to dream about... But to see yourself as someone else is indeed unexpected...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think the girls knew about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you sat that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When they came in, they looked nervous, but after telling about Sensei's ray, they were a lot more relaxed, almost happy that I believed what they said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you mention it... They were a bit tense. Are you going to ask them about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I don't think I should. They must keep quiet for a reason, and I really don't want to think about Sensei's ray actually did, so I think I should just forget about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... That's most likely for the best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei never knew what exactly happened, but he wasn't going to really ponder on it too much in the future. As for the girls, a repeat of what happened would most likely have them go through a mental breakdown, as it surely was an experience they would never want to see Issei as a girl kissing another girl, among other things. As for Azazel... Let's just say he never tried to create another virtual world for a long while...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
