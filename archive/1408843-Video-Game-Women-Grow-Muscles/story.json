Two years later, Khdaj and by association Sephiroth were stopped, the world was safe yet again.  This was great and all, but one problem remained, Tifa Lockheart couldn't help but feel that she didn't help enough.  Especially the second crisis, Cloud practically handled it himself.  Looking in the mirror, Tifa knew that men liked what she saw.  Hell, she liked what she saw, a slim toned body and a huge pair of breasts.  One thing though, Tifa couldn't shake the feeling that if she had some more muscle on her body she could do much more damage.  Her intense martial arts training allowed her to get much more strength out of her body than the vast majority of people, but if she added more muscle, then she could be so much stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow would Tifa go about gaining this muscle?</span></div></div>",

She wondered how it came to all this, how a simple accident led to the destruction of her beloved city, the death of her mentor and countless others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeary from both climactic battles for survival against the beings of mitochondria, she stumbled back to the meager collection of police officers left standing, greeted them and started walking home for much needed rest. Out of nowhere, she remembered Maya... no, Eve's warning that Aya was simply the more evolved of the two and she would eventually seek to dominate the world and make it her brood. The very idea sent a chill down her spine. If a simple, and small, transplant caused Melissa Pierce to grow into a nigh unstoppable monster hell bent on birthing a new species, what hope would she have with the Eve gene and mitochondria native to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost home she walked by some kids wandering in the direction of the police, when a forty foot piece of a compromised building fell on the street below, right onto the kids. Aya froze in shock thinking she had just seen yet two more lives snuffed out thanks to this carnage. Thankfully she heard crying and ran over to discover the piece was supported by an steel ibeam barely holding the mass of the object from slamming the children into the pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya didn't have much time, it'd take too long to go and get help, it'd give way by the time they got back to lift it up enough to get the children to safety. She gripped the slab, hoping beyond hope that somehow she'd be able to shift it. As the fatigue started to set in, her limbs shaking violently, brow furrowed in effort, she could think of only one thing:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed more power. With that thought, and her desperation at the situation, Aya never noted the shivering in her arms decreasing, her breaths deeper and her strength increasing. The massive piece started to rise, its girth and mass no match from the growing titaness letting her will be known. Still, she lifted, determined to save the children. The children, whom had stopped crying and started staring in shock as the person's legs and feet who was lifting the object were visibly growth thicker and larger, even through the pants and shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one mighty heave, and an equally impressive flash of violent growth that threatened to create tears in her clothes, the flab was flipped off the children. Ecstatic, but exhausted, she fell to her knees and the newly grown musculature compressed itself back into her original muscle's dimensions. The kids were grateful they had been saved, and gave her tons of kisses, something she appreciated in this time of crisis. She had tapped into her maternal power and protected her young... This thought froze Aya in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have kids, she didn't believe she had any maternal instinct and the shudder of pleasure that roared through her when 'power' was mentioned, worried her. She quickly pointed the kids back in the direction of the officers, and started on the way home again. Stumbling through the door, she moved her sweat drenched body to the shower... and found the water was still on. She quickly stripped down, stepped into the warm stream and relaxed... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile in the shower she drifted off into daydream, or at least one reminiscent of a date she recently. She was home with a fellow NYPD detective, donning her little black dress and inviting him into the bedroom. Grinning at the memory, since it was a very memorable night. Something was wrong though. As she removed her clothes, and he his. As they nuzzled and licked at each other's necks, ears, chests and lips she felt an arousal well up in her that definitely wan't there when that memory took place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started sweating profusely, and quickly hastened things to where they could fuck, her mind nearly snarling the word and her dream counterpart almost as savage. The penetration was incredible, it was as if the floodgates had opened in her soul. As he first entered her he noticed back spasm and bulge out in all directions, but this was beauty to him, this was POWER. He rammed into her further, to reveal more of her true self, to set her free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAya's dream mind was in complete meltdown, she felt something give inside her, something primal and overwhelmingly pleasurable. What she thought was an orgasm causing her back to tremble, wasn't. She was losing control...</span></div></div>",

A triumphant roar sprang from her increasingly supple lips as her neck thickened, her back erupted with an avalache of audibly growing and pulsating muscle down her widening back. So much so that she was left with chasms of shadow between each defined slab of she-meat. Her jaw thickened and her face pushed out into a slight muzzle as her arms joined the party, quickly leap from as thick as a telephone pole to as thick as two, with her hands spreading out to match, thick fingers with brutal claws adorning their ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs saw the most dramatic shift, her knees reversing and tree trunk muscles causing her hips, legs, ass and vagina to grow to match. The latter of which was so active with the rutting from her mate and its own excitement would could mistake it for a mouth chewing on something. Sadly her muscle building body consumed her breasts, leaving her with carapace-like pectorals several inches thick and abs imitating steel plate armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting her long spotted tongue hang out of her mouth reveling in the sights, sounds and smells of her arrival as queen she roared once again, a sound of human pleasure and agony and of animal lust. In a moment of duality, both the Queen and Aya gazed at each other in the mirror across from her. Shock and Pride, Desperation and Exilaration at their form. And in one moment, glancing back her beloved colleague, observing her mate she felt a swelling within her. A limitless bounty blossomed from within her, he was neither mate to discard after use or a sexless acquaintance. To both, to the Queen's surprise at her own capacity for pointless sentimentatlity and emotion, he was their love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe physical reaction and agreement of both caused an enormous boost in growth. She felt her ovaries multiplying within her, growing larger. Her uterus forming dozens more within her colossal frame, now almost 21 feet tall and 8 feet wide. Her breasts returned with a passion, with new nipples, larger mammaries and muscle within for the conscious dispensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven after the roaring he didn't stop, and Aya finally realized why: He was her ideal for a lover as well as her desire to let her true beauty be known. With that she grunted and squelched as a wide muscular tail the same color as her skin and with a stinger at the end burst from above her lower back and plunged its stinger into her lover. The reaction was almost instant, he became a male beast counterpart to her, positioned himself just outside her hungry nether maw and plunged in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir union caused both, but especially Queen Aya to experience explosive growth while they roared like the beasts they'd become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Aya do now?</span></div></div>",

She knew Ryu fought and train hard so she had to do the same if she was going to match him in any sort of way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she had the training aspect down pact the actual fighting was a bit lackluster. Being challenged by the local scrubs wasn't exactly something that was pushing her to the limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Sakura met and treated every fight as a welcomed challenge and never pulled or purposely held back but despite not being the best in the world Sakura was still miles ahead of them so they were exactly helping her to improve...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving stopped to grab a soda can out of a venting machine Sakura shrugged slightly as she popped open the top and downed a bit of the soft drink.

That guy's a total beast he'll tear through or should I say throw any poor bastard that gets put up against him.\" stated the excitable boy, most likely a huge fan of the Russian pro wrestler. At the mention of the Russian's name however Sakura's interest was equally peaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZangief, she remembered him well. A mountain of a man who lived off competition, the admiration his fellow countrymen had for him, and throwing around his opponents as if they were simple dolls. Truly a fierce some fighter that would have had his complete way with Sakura had Cammy White not interfered when she did...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterested in the competition mentioned Sakura finished her drink, tossed in away in a nearby trash can, and sprinted up to the two calling out as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, this competition you were talking about. Where is it being held at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fanboy to the Russian wrestler and his friend turned around and were rather surprised to see Sakura meeting them with a curious expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...not far from here actually. You know of the dome where all the wrestling matches take place, well that's the place. But why do you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, it's been a long time since I've last seen \"The Red Cyclone\"...and I'm itching for a rematch!\" Sakura stated excitedly with a mild fist pump. Then with a simple goodbye she took off running in the opposite direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey wait! The competition's till tomorrow, today's just the sign-up date you're probably not going to find him much less fight him today!\" called out the wrestling fan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she really imply she's fought \"The Red Cyclone\" before?\" questioned the second youth a look of surprise still present on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I think she did...not only that but she's still standing and wants to fight him again! That's either one hell of a girl or she's out of her damn mind...\"</span></div></div>",

Once again she found herself giddy at the thought of fighting the Russian and blissfully wished Ryu could be here to watch her do so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that note Sakura found herself wondering if her perhaps by some chance Ryu was in fact here and had signed up for the tournament, fighting and showing off her strength to both her mentor and Zangief would be a dream come true for young Sakura!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly as she exited the sports arena a voice called out to her effectively bringing her back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kasugano Sakura?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around Sakura stared intently at the dark suited man approaching her, as he did so she clenched her right fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here on orders of my employer Konzuki Karin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura blinked as she heard her rival's name, \"What does she want now?\" Sakura asked humorously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately Miss Karin states that she can not be a part of tomorrow's competition.\" the man stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah...darn that's a shame I guess...\" said Sakura with a bit of a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But on that note she wants you to win in her place...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't work for Karin, if I win I do for my own personal goals not hers!\" exclaimed Sakura as she cut off the man's word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said you say something of that nature. Regardless she wanted her to have this.\" Digging into his shirt pocket the man brought out a small box before handing it over to a slightly confused Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inside Miss Karin says should help you win the tournament, use in good faith.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his duty done Karin's hired help made his exit leaving Sakura to ponder at Karin's \"gift\" to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me win huh?\" Sakura smirked as she tossed the box up and caught it on it's decent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, Karin.\" she mumbled before stuffing the box into one of the pockets of her pants.</span></div></div>",

With the Red Cyclone being at the event Sakura knew she had to fight as best she could if she wanted to face the overly muscled Russian one more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This time I'll win for sure.\" Sakura mumbled with a grin as she pounded her fists together. But before she could enter the building the entrance doors flew open as Karin Konzuki made her exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karin-san?!\" called out Sakura as she caught somewhat off guard by her rival's sudden appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? Oh Sakura-san...figures you too would end up coming here.\" stated Karin rather bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I see you joined as well.\" retorted Sakura with a bit of a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it will be an honor to go up against \"The Red Cyclone\" himself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think you're going to make it that far!\" interrupted Sakura her smirk growing ever larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please Sakura, I will mow through these no-names and find myself face to face with the mighty Zangief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Karin spoke Sakura could almost visualize her rival's head inflate with confidence so she decided to bring the blonde girl back down to earth for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you forgetting that I'll be in the tournament as well. I'd hate to crush your dreams of glory Karin but I'm looking for a potential rematch with the cyclone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You? You'll be destroyed by him.\" stated Karin as if it were a matter of fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why you...you don't know how strong I've become!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't be enough. In fact if you and I end up battling it still won't be enough.\" Karin stated earning her a sharp glare from Sakura, \"But I suppose I can do you at least one kindness...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura wondered what her rivial was going on about as she fumbled around within a pocket of hers. A few moments later Karin brought out a small vial filled with some oddly colored liquid. Tossing it over Sakura caught the small object rather easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use that if you want true strength Sakura-san. It's the only way you're going to defeat me or The Russian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said Karin made her exit leaving a dumbfounded Sakura in her wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" Sakura wondered as she eyed the mysterious vial, slipping it away in her pant's pocket Sakura decided to put more thought into it back home as she remembered she still had to register for tomorrow's competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night as Sakura laid on her bed she thought back to the vial that Karin had given to her, the vial now resting on her desk beside her fighting gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True strength...what's Karin getting at and how does that apply to that stuff she gave me...\" she thought out loud eying the vial once more.</span></div></div>",

Sakura cursed at Karin for giving her something completely horrible but suddenly she felt her body tremble for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura gasped as a strange feeling of tension overcoming her entire body frame!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karin...if you poisoned me...\" Sakura gasped once more as she heard a faint yet distant stretching sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazed Sakura began to notice attire stretch and tear away as her body was seemingly growing but instead of height it was more her already tone muscles expanding slightly outward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer already muscled legs swelled thicker as they tried to force their way out of her simple jeans, her upper body causing her t-shirt to ride up and expose her new six pack set of abs. As Sakura watched her widening shoulders and biceps begin to push the sleeves of her shirt closer to it's limit she felt the rear and front section begin to tear away as her back grew thicker and wider same for her breasts as they rose a cup larger and her growing pectoral muscles assisted them in tearing away at her simple shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth soon subsided and Sakura found herself gasping for a moment astonishment washing over her as she looked over her new size. Tip-toeing out of her room and into the bathroom Sakura eyed her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was had shot up two inches possibly three but more importantly she could visually see the strain her new muscles were putting on her attire. While neither her shirt nor her pants had fully torn Sakura knew if she had continued growing they wouldn't have lasted much longer, which reminded her to remove her bra before it would snap in two or apply a painful amount of pressure on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing a short flex of her arms Sakura watched in amazement as her biceps swelled for several inches and a brief tearing sound could be heard not wanting to completely ruin her shirt Sakura released her flex and instead gave her legs a try and giggled softly as she watched them swell to rival those of her friend and Interpol agent Chun-Li.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I finally have legs as big as Miss Chun-Li!' Sakura thought to herself before releasing the flex once again not wanting to ruin her attire...well anymore then she already had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura smiled as she did a quick turn and eyed her larger back and wider shoulders, even her neck seem to have grown a tad bit thicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to admit Sakura really enjoyed her new look, arms as big as Ryu's, bigger breasts, a solid set of abs, and legs as thick as Chun-Li's yes Sakura was indeed very pleased with the outcome of Karin's strange formula. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then she realized that must have been what Karin had meant earlier and why she gave it to her in the first place. Sneaking back into her room Sakura decides to wear some more loose clothing she had tossed around in her closet and could only ponder away at how she was going to explain the growth spurt to her parents and younger brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomorrow was going to be a rather interesting day.</span></div></div>",

Wake up, it's me!\" called out her long time friend Kei. The long-haired girl knew Sakura had a bad habit of sleeping-in but after phoning her last night about the competition today Kei figured she'd best make sure her street fighting friend didn't sleep away the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKei called out once more as she gave the door a mild knock.

Shrugging she decided it'd be best not to keep Kei waiting and merely show her friend the new her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on in, the door's unlocked.\" said Sakura in response, a moment later Kei entered the room to find a very different Sakura staring back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" said Sakura with a simple wave and smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what happen to you? You're huge, Sakura!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah Kei keep it down will ya, my family still doesn't know about this.\" stated Sakura as she made her way over to her door and closed it shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" asked Kei still rather stun that her friend had grown into a miniature amazon over night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because of that\" Sakura pointed over toward the vial at top of her desk, \"Karin-san gave it to me and it's the reason I'm like this.\" she explained while mildly flexing her right arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Konzuki-san? But why? I mean you told me yesterday both of you were going to be in the competition today so why...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura shrugged slightly, \"My guess is that she's going to use some of this stuff as well and while I would have still fought her without using any of it...um my curiosity got the better of me and I drank just a tad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura giggled as Kei slapped her forehead with a single hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figures you'd go and do something like that. Anyway what are you going to tell your family?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Growth spurt?\" responded Sakura as if it was the simplest answer in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure they'll completely buy that...\" Kei stated with a deep sigh, at times Sakura truly tired out the poor girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...well here carry this for me, Kei-chan.\" handing over the vial Sakura smiled at Kei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not thinking of taking anymore of this crazy stuff, are you...oh wait it's you of course you are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What no not right now anyway. This new strength I have is just fine and I can just train with these new muscles of mine. Karin's formula is only a back-up if I ever need it that and I don't want mom or dad finding it here and thinking it's something much worse then it actually is. So do this for me, Kei, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura pleaded her case with a somewhat puppy-dog expression which contrasted somewhat with her bigger form making her appear a bit comical. Thinking it over Kei sighed once more in the end Sakura was a good friend and Kei knew Sakura could always depend on her if she needed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh alright but first we have to deal with your parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time it was Sakura's turn to sigh, \"I overslept again right...well hopefully we can sneak out without them noticing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You're going to have to tell them eventually...' thought Kei with a mental groan.</span></div></div>",

It seemed this time Karin was ready to go full-force on her and being the fighter she was Sakura welcomed the challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting her weight and turning over Sakura came to eye Karin face to face.</span></div></div>",

He has come a long way though and has restored peace to Hyrule once again. On his travels he has met many interesting young ladies including Midna, his companion throughout his journey, Ilia, his childhood friend and maybe more, and most notable of all, princess Zelda, who helped him defeat Ganondorf in his final stand against the legendary hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spirits of light have restored Midna to her former self, an imposing woman of nearly 7 feet and stunning beauty. Before they say farewell to Midna as she travels back to the Twilight realm, princess Zelda and Link ask her to stay for at least the burial ceremony of their fallen comrades as well as the burning of Ganondorf\u2019s body. She agrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the heroes and most of Hyrule pay their debts to the heroic knights that gave their lives defending the land, the Triforce of Power in Ganondorf\u2019s body is experiencing a major calamity due to the death of it host. Tricked into thinking there are no other signs of life anywhere, the Triforce transforms into a Triforce of its own, able to grant any wish to the bearer while still retaining its Triforce of Power abilities.

Midna heard it too but she didn\u2019t recognize it. Suddenly she noticed the mark of the Triforce on her hand, glowing! She quickly hid her hands behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-If what?\u201d Midna asked hesitantly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026if you would join us in the memorial ceremony as our other guest of honor with Link.\u201d Zelda said with clear suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah! Of course! Yeah, I\u2019ll be there, don\u2019t worry about it!\u201d Zelda gave a \u2018thank you \u2018 nod and bow and left with a soft smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecollecting her limited Hyrulean knowledge of legends past and the Triforce, she remembered that it could grant any wish to the bearer of all three parts. Just then, as she was staring aimlessly at the mark on her hand, she noticed that all three portions were lit. Did that mean she possessed all three parts of the Triforce? But how could that be? Zelda noticed she had the Triforce. So Midna decided to stop wasting time and make a wish to test this new found treasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow what do I really want most of all...?\u201d she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really wanted to be strong, and independent, and didn\u2019t want to rely on a hero next time she was in danger. She wanted to be able to lead her people properly and not be some sort of cowardly, spoiled-rotten, royal princess. She wanted to be a leader and the center of attention at all times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got it!\u201d she exclaimed to herself. \u201cI wish I was a strong and independent princess of Twilight with unquestionable power.\u201d Instantly the Triforce on her hand began to glow and a golden light surrounded her. She felt a surge of power flow through her body and a pleasant warmth rise up from her core. When the glowing had stopped she felt really strong, but, in a physical sense! She got up and looked at her reflection in a nearby fountain, what she saw she couldn\u2019t believe, or stop loving!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer once petite legs now rounded with definition. Her claves stuck out at an impressive 15\u201d and grew to an awesome 22\u201d quad. Moving her fingers up, she could feel bumps on her stomach and instantly fell in love with her new pronounced abdominal muscles. Her breasts have increased in size dramatically to a size C at least with pectoral muscles that put those of most men to shame. Her shoulders broadened as her frame began to adjust to her new physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, my,\u201d she said as she stared in awe, in amazement and in a little bit of lust. She flexed her magnificent 14\u201d bicep peaks \u201cwell, this isn\u2019t what I planned would happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she heard someone\u2019s footsteps coming closer and closer! How would she explain her new found strength and muscularity? Could she reverse it? And if so, could she also increase her muscular development?</span></div></div>",

No one has ever managed to ask the Triforce of a wish before, so we can\u2019t really determine the Triforce\u2019s reaction to such a wish. Perhaps it thought literally about physical strength and granted you that. You see, the Triforce is an animated \u2018living\u2019, so to speak, object but has no free will or thought.\u201d Zelda explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidna cast a glance at the back of her right hand where the Triforce was, and all three Triforces were still there!

Secretly Link had a special affinity to muscular women but never really wanted to reveal it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, you poor thing\u201d Midna cooed \u201cHow about I show you what I REALLY look like?\u201d Midna clasped her hands together and began to glow a bright golden color and Link gulped expecting what was to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMidna! No!\u201d cried Zelda as she dashed towards Midna to try and stop her.</span></div></div>",

She felt a powerful surge of erotic power coursing through her mixed in with a little bit of pain from so much power entering her system all at once. When the glowing stopped, the muscle growth effect began to take effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidna was the first to be affected as her calves seemed to separate even more as the crack in the middle of her calves turned to groves. They grew until they reached a massive 21 and half inches of pure feminine muscle. Her quadriceps were next to grow as the cords of tight tree trunk-sized muscle began to expand even further surpassing the 30\u201d mark and stopping at just barely 31\u201d thick of female meat. Her abs became even harder and denser, thicker and appeared to form canyons from the definition on her lower torso. Her pectorals and breasts also began to flesh-out as mounds of muscle seemed to generate out of no-where onto her already muscular frame escalating a whole new breast size level. Her shoulders spread out to make room for her growing back as they began to just out away from her adding more to her intimidating yet hypnotizing appearance. And finally her biceps and triceps grew to such an extent she could no longer reach her head. She gave a congratulatory flex to herself and watched as her biceps rose to an arousing peak at 22\u201d of pure, hot, hard, erotic, feminine muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda had a similar experience although not as intense. She was not expecting this and she began to see change to her body her mentality about feminine muscle changed dramatically. Her calves began as a mere 11\u201d but soared to a substantial 15\u201d of leg-raising power. Her thighs, originally 20\u201d grew to a noticeable 25\u201d of hard and flexing muscle. Her flat stomach grew mountains of abs as a substantial 6-pack became noticeable. By now her dress was growing tight as muscle was making progress in a desperate cry for air. Her unimpressive A-cup breasts inflated to a D-cup at least with enough pectoral muscle to put any man in the audience to shame. When her back began to add muscle is when her dress gave in and ripped at the seams as pounds of female muscle began to squeeze through. Her gloves grew tighter and tighter until they were shredded by the enormous cords that ran through her forearms became visible. And finally her biceps shot out with no mercy to any garment that stood in the way as it grew from an ignorable 9\u201d to an erotic 13\u201d as boulder-like muscle curled up into a tight ball under her soft, womanly skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the crowed, before running, now stopped dead in their tracks as their lovely princess turned into a gorgeous mountain of womanly muscle while still retaining her beautiful face. Many also noticed the even larger 7\u20195\u201d of twilight beauty at its finest as Midna stood there flexing for Link to see. Even with all this new found strength, Zelda still felt a little weak-kneed and nearly collapsed out of the sheer pleasure that experience brought with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Now look what you did!\u201d Midna cried out in protest! \u201cwell I hope your happy, \u2018cuz the next one\u2019s gonna cost you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was trying to help you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp? Me? As I am now I could crush you or anyone else in this pathetic excuse of a kingdom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou take that back! This is a proud nation and people and we will be treated with respect!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCommon, Zelda, admit it: you were always jealous of me and how while I was with Link, you were trapped in you castle doing NOTHING!\u201d<br>\r\nZelda grimaced and clenched her fist as she used every last bit of her will power to stop herself from jumping Midna\u2026again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what? I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m still in this stupid land of light anyways. You people are weak. While you were being spoiled and loved by the goddesses, we Twilight have been trapped in your shadows, literally, growing stronger and stronger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda couldn\u2019t help but admit to that truth and lower her head in shame. Midna paused for a moment then turned her back to Zelda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe Zant was right. Maybe shadow WAS destined to take over light.\u201d A sudden wave of surprise swept through the crowd as many were filled with uncontrollable fear and ran for their safety. Link, sensing this was not the Midna he knew drew out his mighty sword of evil\u2019s bane and clutched it in his left hand and pulled out his trusty Hylian shield, ready for anything Midna might do. Zelda in turn pulled out, as if from nowhere, her Light bow and arrows and aimed it directly at Midna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that Midna. I know you. You\u2019re better than this. Whatever happened to you we can fix it.\u201d Zelda said in a concerned voice. Midna just smiled a mischievous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, do you really think that would work? Not only am I far superior to the both of you physically, but magically as well!\u201d Midna then, with a giant burst of energy, flexed her mighty legs and jumped up in the air an incredible height, overshadowing both Link and Zelda. She preformed two forward flips in the air as she landed behind Link and put him in an arm lock choking position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I know you are well known to have extra reserves of magic in times of danger, but what about Link? Can he defend himself if I decide to kill him right here and now?\u201d Midna said as her voice seemed to deepen and her eyes suddenly become darker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMidna, something\u2019s happening to you. I think the Triforce of power is corrupting you!\u201d Zelda pleaded to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidna tightened her squeeze on Link until she cut off his air flow. Not being able to breathe, Link instinctively grabbed Midna\u2019s thick forearms with his seemingly tiny hands in comparison. A blinding light shot out from the back of Link\u2019s hand and surrounded the two of them. The light burned through Midna and she was forced to release Link and instantly the light died down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAARRGGGG\u2026!!!!\u201d Midna screeched in a loud voice. \u201cThat hurt\u2026\u201d she nearly whispered as she looked menacingly to Link. Both Link and Zelda had a pretty good idea of what was going to happen next and each braced themselves accordingly. \u201cTHAT HURT!!!\u201d she now screamed as she leaped towards them at blindingly fast speeds.</span></div></div>",

And with just a faster speed, Midna flexed every one of the muscles in her arm and unleashed a deadly punch that could kill if not severely injure a man. Luckily for link his shield happened to be in the way of her blow and he was flung back a great distance. A large fist shaped dent appeared on his shield where her punch made contact. Link tried to get up and counter but as soon as he put his shield hand down to push himself up he heard a loud crack and collapsed to the floor. The pain was unbearable. With a single blow, Midna was able to not only punch and dent a sacred shield that was passed down through the generations of Hylian knights, but also fractured his arm severely enough through the shield that his arm broke when he put the slightest bit of pressure on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink pushed himself up with his other hand and slowly removed the shield off his crippled limb. Meanwhile Zelda decided to take an offensive of her own. With blazing fast speeds the two titans fought vigorously. Link could barley even see their fist as they exchanged punch for kick. Both seemed evenly matched with each blocking the other\u2019s attack. Finally Midna managed to land a kick right in Zelda\u2019s rock hard abs. Zelda cried out in pain as the wind was literally kicked right out of her. As she landed with a thud, Link charged with his sword at Midna crying out an ear-piercing battle cry. The blade made contact with its target...but there was something wrong...Midna just stood unaffected! She was able to stop the Master Sword using just the muscles in her forearms!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, my. I guess I don\u2019t know my own strength.\u201d She ridiculed. With that, she gave a mighty shove while still holding onto the blade of the Master Sword as he flew and landed on Zelda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidna took one final look at the blade and then tossed it like a piece of trash. She gave another lightning fast burst of speed as the muscles in her leg contracted and relaxed again. She stopped right in front of them as she scanned them in their condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, well, well. The tables have turned, haven\u2019t they?\u201d both Zelda and Link remained silent. \u201cI could easily kill you both right now.\u201d She paused again as she stared at them. \u201cBut I still need the princess to formally surrender her people to me.\u201d She then turned her attention to Link. \u201cAs for you, you\u2019re worthless. You\u2019ve served your purpose. You would be much more useful to me dead. So I can show Hyrule just how strong their mighty hero chosen by the gods really is compared to me!\u201d She laughed almost as if like Ganondorf\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she laughed Zelda quickly regained consciousness as she realized what had happened. When Ganondorf\u2019s remains were burned, his corrupted piece of the Triforce travelled to the one it deemed most worthy and corrupted them, just as it has Ganondorf! But Zelda knew just as well as anyone, she was no match for the titanic Midna in her current state. So Zelda had a plan, but she only got one shot. As Midna continued monologing, Zelda concentrated her reserves of strengths and leaped towards the surprised Midna. She grabbed both her hands and quickly wished for\u2026</span></div></div>",

For nearly eleven minutes, she couldn't find a stream of water or lake or any water source, but she did find something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlowing under a pile of leaves, Dawn and Piplup discovered a strange object. It smelled heavenly and Dawn couldn't help, but pick it up. A small powder went on her fingertips and she tasted it. To her amazement, it tasted like sugar and it had a strong hook on her taste buds. She didn't know it, but she discovered a rare candy, which boost a Pokemon's level. Not wasting anytime, she ate it. \"Hmm, tasty.\" she said. Suddenly, she noticed her right arm was growing as well as her other arm. She watched her whole body growing stronger and taller. The feeling she was getting was simply amazing. Her clothes ripped to shreds as she grew to 14 feet tall and weighed around 350 pounds of muscle. Flexing her arms, now a foot around, she felt stronger as she smirked and posed in front of Piplup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile putting on a show for the penguin Pokemon, she...</span></div></div>",

Kneeling down to get a closer look, she realised that it was another Rare Candy!  Rather than eating it like the first, though, Dawn decided instead to put it aside and save it for now.  'As much as I've enjoyed growing,' she thought, 'I think it might be for the best if I took some time to get used to my new body before trying it again...'  Carefully picking up the tiny candy with her large, powerful hands, the muscular giantess slipped it beneath her white hat, the only article of clothing to survive her growth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the second Rare Candy safely squared away, Dawn turned her attention back to her new muscles.  As much as she'd enjoyed idly flexing them, she now hoped to put them to the test.  \"I wonder if I'm actually as strong as I look...?\" she said aloud, turning toward a nearby tree.  It was clearly an older tree, several times taller than her, and with a wide trunk.  Wrapping her thick, muscular arms around the tree, Dawn began to pull upwards with all of her might, hoping to wrench the mighty oak from the ground.  Every muscle in her arms and upper body bulged out as she pulled, and many engorged veins snaked across their surface.  After about a minute's worth of effort, it seemed a losing battle for the tree, and with a powerful roar, Dawn tore it right out of the ground, before swinging it in a circle and hurling it over the horizon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter staring in awe for several moments at her feet of strength, the blue-haired girl squealed and hopped up and down with glee.  Piplup soon joined her, cheering for his Trainer.  Dawn's spastic jumping caused the ground to shake for quite some distance, alerting anyone nearby to her presence.

Responding to their trainers' commands, Seviper's tail glowed purple and was about hit Dawn...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhen she caught it in dead air! Seviper gasped as Dawn gave it a grin. Then she grabbed its neck and using her new strength, she swung it around a few times and with a final twist, she tossed it against a tree. The tree was tore from its roots from the impact. Seviper was out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seviper!\" Jessie cried. Dawn smiled, but then she was hit by Carnivine's bullet seed and a cloud of smoke appeared. \"Nice work, Carnivine!\" James cheered.

Firing several sonic booms, the dragonfly Pokemon managed to hit Dawn, but like before, she wasn't harmed. Grabbing Yanmega from the air, Dawn began to use it like a baseball bat.

Now good-bye.\" Using only an ounce of her strength, she tossed them away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like Team Rocket's...\" their motto broke when they hit the ground. \"Oh, Piplup.

I've never felt so powerful...\" she rambled to herself, trembling in awe.  \"I have to have more!\"  With that, she immediately crammed the tiny candy into her mouth and swallowed it, before bracing herself for the ensuing growth.  It came seconds later, causing Dawn to let out a skyward scream of pure pleasure as the feeling spread through her body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, her body stretched itself out, growing to more than twice her current height in order to make room for all the muscle that would soon follow.  This caused the size and definition of her current muscles to decrease a bit as they spread across her bigger body, but they immediately returned with a vengeance, swelling out so huge as to make her previous self look tiny by comparison.  She flexed her enormous biceps over her head in jubilation, feeling as their peaks rose high over her head and continued to grow from there.  Though it felt to her like forever, her growth ended within about two minutes, leaving a 30-foot-tall, massively muscled Dawn to explore her newly-augmented body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to look down at her body, she found she could not see anything past her breasts, which were each bigger than her fully-flexed biceps.  A brief, experimental flex of her powerful pectoral muscles caused them to bounce up and down, which she found endlessly amusing.  After a few seconds of that, she left on hand on the side of her right breast to squeeze and massage it while her other explored the parts of her body she couldn't see, tracing across her ten pack of rock-hard abs, her bulging thighs, and her firm, round glutes.  Flexing everything at once, she erupted into a bout of ecstatic laughter, unable to properly articulate just how amazing she was feeling at the moment.

Finally had it with their failures,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on top on a stone in a sandy ditch all alone, she sighed and said, \"James and Meowth think they can catch that twerp's Pikachu without me? I'd love to prove them wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig words, but Jessie didn't have any plan on how to capture her prey. She pondered for some kind of idea and to help her brain work, she paced in circles until she tripped on something metal. Falling on the ground, she turned back to the metal piece and dug it up. \"You little piece of metal.\" she grumbled, \"You'll teach you to...\" Her sentence was cut off by something she never thought existed: a black metal lamp like those in fiction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A magic lamp?\" she smiled, \"Let's get rubbing.\" She rubbed the lamp and then a cloud of purple mist smoked out of the lamp, revealing itself into a purple-colored female genie wearing typical genie clothes and had black hair, green eyes and a light-purple vapor under her waist. \"Okay, how can I serve you?\" the genie spoke in a bored manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, a real genie and I get three wishes of my choosing.\" she chuckled to herself, 'For my first wish, I wish I can grant wishes for myself.\" \"Sorry, can't do that wish.\" she replied. \"Okay, I wish I was the queen of the world.\" she spoke. \"That one's impossible too.\" replied the genie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting frustrated, Jessie spoke, \"Is there any wish I can be granted?\" \"Besides wishing for more wishes, power to rule the world and you to make yourself God, anything goes. Might I suggest you wish for something you really desire? Maybe something simplier and more realistic?\" the genie spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie about this for a while and she knew what she wanted. \"Okay for my first wish, I wish for...</span></div></div>",

Thanks to Mercy's healing her previous wounds had completely disappeared and the Brit was ready to get back into the fight and with a quick thank you she did just that joining up with D.Va, while her MEKA's shield wasn't as powerful as Reinhardt's she was still able to prove some cover for herself and Tracer who sped in and out of enemy lines tagging as many opponents as she could with gunfire and her sticky bomb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two worked well together D.Va even protecting herself and Tracer from Junkrat's remote tire bomb! However in doing so the Korean girl's mech was in critical condition any more pressure and she'd have to abandon it until she could call forth a new MEKA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I say, toss it love! If you get what am saying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette shot her a wink that D.Va quickly picked up on. Right she'd send the enemy a bit of a surprise of her own!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the caught sight of Roadhog turn the street corner, the large strong-fat man ready to blast the two girls down instead Tracer took the offensive and began to distract the big man while lined up just right, boosted forward, and ejected right out as the MEKA sailed toward Roadhog. Tracer spotted the approaching mech and darted away far too fast for Roadhog to catch her, however D.Va was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Korean yelped as the man's chain latched onto her right leg her body suddenly being flung right at Roadhog with the MEKA seconds away from detonating, she was sure to be caught in the blast radius!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracer realizing what had happened sped back as quick as she could hoping she could reach D.Va in time. She did landing a quick pistol whip on the bigger man, it didn't do much damage but D.Va was shaken free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on, love. This is gonna be close!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the other girl by the hand Tracer blinked away just as the MEKA self destructed. Wither or not that took out Roadhog didn't matter at the moment all that was getting herself and D.Va to safety unfortunately Tracer underestimated the speed of the blast...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing D.Va remembered was being rescued by Tracer from Roadhog and her own MEKA's self destruction however the blast had caught up to the speedy brunette she remembered screaming and then everything went black for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body ached which was a sign she was still alive, although in tremendous pain, to her side however laid Tracer and D.Va gasped realizing that she was still unconscious!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, Tracer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She must have shielded her or simply taken most of the blast either way the brunette wasn't moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tracer, come on stay with me. You have to wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nD.Va wanted to lift her up but she simply lacked the strength to do so instead all she could was cradle her fallen teammate until hopefully help arrived.</span></div></div>",
