She wanted to see what the little mite on her foot was up to today. It wasn't just an ordinary mite mind you, it was a person, well it used to be a person. It was a woman that through no fault of her own, found out her secret and needed to be dealt with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese mortals were far too nosy for their own good and the pathetic microscopic tramp occupying the big toe on her right foot, or wherever she was now on her foot, heard too much and needed to be punished. This wasn't the 1st time she had to do this either. Her body had plenty of occupants through the millennia she was in this world, but she decided that her feet needed some attention. So she shrank the nosy woman who dared to go snooping around her and condemned her to eternity on her right foot. Or at least until she died. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda smirked. Those who knew her didn't see her as a cruel person, but she delighted in the power she had over these mites. She wiggled her toes, which was sure to jar her little pet awake if she had dozed off. Using her powers, she focused on the mind of her new slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Have you finished exploring your new home yet, my little dustmite?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>Nicole's PoV</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the better part of the night, Nicole begged the witch to let her go home but found that her captor didn't hear her or didn't care for her pleas. Placed on the ridge between her big and second toe, she could not see beyond the red-headed witch's ankle. Her world was only a total stranger's right foot, which to a person of normal size, it was smooth, clean, and well taken care of, but being the size of a dust particle, she was literally part of another world. A world no one would ever see with their naked eye. A world in which she'd never be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lines below her toes were about as massive if not even more massive than the grand canyon itself. The landscape was incredibly uneven with bits of dead skin from the size of her head to a small building littering the endless landscape. The wiggle of her toe caused tremors and earthquakes strong enough to knock her on her ass and a single footstep sent her flying several feet, but Nicole had found an imperfection in the woman's skin and took shelter in it. What was also interesting is that when her captor got into bed and laid on her side, she did not fall off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot had its own gravity. It was quite literally her world. Nicole was terrified. Her night was too scarring to her psychologically for her to sleep as peacefully as her captor did and when morning came, her torment began as her captor wiggled her toes, causing Nicole to scream and come loose from the imperceptible cut on Miranda's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice of the witch rang in her mind once more; <i>\"Have you finished exploring your new home yet, my little dustmite?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole looked up, but could only make out the ridge of her foot. She could not see anything beyond that. Remembering that she couldn't see her captor's face until she brought her moon-sized face down to her foot, Nicole was blind to her captor, though not necessary since she was all around her. It was a strange feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Answer your goddess when she addresses you, little one.\"</i> Her words came again. They were stern yet calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears started streaming down the young woman's face. What had she done to deserve this? Why would God let such a horrible monster walk this world and shrink people like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I know you're still alive down there,\" the planet-sized red-head with a received pronunciation English accent spoke to her, \"I can sense your lifeforce on my foot. I thought I had told you that I wanted you to be at the tip of my big toe by morning.\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world rumbled again as the witch flexed her big toe. Nicole yelled and fell to the ground but the rumbling did not cease. That's when she noticed something in the distance. The witch's fingers were massaging her foot. Her great, fingers on either side of the area between her big and second toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I hope you don't plan on being a defiant little speck.\"</i> Miranda said. <i>I can be a merciful goddess, but not when my subjects disobey me. So what will it be?\"</i> Her voice sounded nonchalant, but the sinister intent was there. <i>\"My fingers are like countries to you, but I'm not entirely sure if I can squish you like this. Do you think you'll survive in my saliva if I spit on you? Probably not.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda was getting impatient with her captive. She wanted an answer from the insignificant creature on her foot and Nicole was so afraid. She wanted it all to end, but something within her gave in to the demands of the goddess and she spoke to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My... I... I couldn't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well done, my pet.\"</i> A termor rocked the ground as the woman removed her fingers from her foot. <i>\"I knew when I shrank you to the size of a mite, you wouldn't be as dim-witted as one, but you're still a mite nonetheless, just not as dim-witted.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole was trembling, but she didn't know if it was out of sheer terror or out of hatred and anger. This woman stole her life from her for no reason and now she was treating her as if she was less than nothing. She bit down on her lip so hard that she cut it and started bleeding. She wanted out of this, she wanted her life back and right now she had this woman's full attention, but before she could say anything to her, the witch's words dominated her mind and thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Now, here's what's going to be our little routine from here on out; Your home is the landscape of my feet now and I want you to traverse them as I go about my daily routine. You will collect smaller parasites and bring them to the tip of my big toenail to pay homage to me, your goddess, each and every month. After every month you will be expected to switch between my feet, so that means, next month, you will traverse my left foot and do the same on there. You are to continue this cycle until you die. if you fail to complete these tasks or disobey any of my commands then you will be punished. Understand?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole couldn't believe what she was hearing. She was essentially reduced to a parasitic slave on the foot of a witch with the power to shrink people on a power trip. Who does this bitch think she is? What gave her the right to do this to someone with a life, friends, family, and a son?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey wait,\" Nicole began, \"You can't just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>In case you haven't noticed, you are a mere parasite on my foot. Nothing more.</i> Miranda's voice rang again. <i>The fault was yours for eavesdropping on me and finding out who I am. You gave me no other choice. You, mortals, have persecuted my sisters and me for thousands of years and we have no choice but to resort to these kinds of methods to keep our Covens safe from prejudice and persecution.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-so you really are a witch?\" Nicole quavered. \"I would've never told anyone about you, who could believe me!?\" Nicole cried in outrage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You'd be surprised, little bug.</i> said Miranda. <i>\"700 years ago, my cousin was burned at the stake for using her healing magic to purge the Black Death from the very peasants she saved. Just recently, a friend of a friend went missing trying to make a failing small town in rural America better. There's no shortage of ignorance, fear, and brutality from your kind and if I could do what I've done to you on all mortals, I would.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole didn't know what was more frightening, the fact that there were people like her capable of shrinking people to the size of a parasite on a whim, or the calmness in her voice as she described what she would do to all of humanity if she had the power to do so. Not only was she at the mercy of a psycho. She was at the mercy of an all-powerful psycho who could do lord knows what to anyone she wanted. She dreaded the full extent of her power and what she could do to anyone else if they crossed her. What dreaded her the most is that if she flat out admitted feeling this way, then that meant that Miranda had no intention of ever letting Nicole go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'll keep conversations with you to the minimum.\"</i> Miranda said. <i> \"I realize the world is perilous for you, but I don't want you to take up too much of my time. After all, people don't talk to parasites. Your new life starts today, little one. You'd better get moving so that you can pay homage to your new Goddess.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait no. Please don't leave me here, I'll do anything you- AAAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother earthquake hit as Miranda started to move her leg. Nicole tried to see what was going on above her, but she was still blind to the outside world. A stronger termor hit, sending the microscopic woman tumbling into a deep ravine deeper into the witch's skin. All this chaos was caused by Miranda taking a single step. Nicole screamed in frustration. She wanted her to fail so she could torture her more. How was a human the size of a dust mite supposed to survive on a person's foot?</span></div></div>",
