The Doctor's wondrous time/space ship was thrumming with energy as the Doctor's companion flicked through some controls on the console panels. She was looking through TARDIS database files, having recently discovered that they weren't the first person the Doctor had invited to travel with him. Resentment had burned throughout her at the very idea of not being as special as the Doctor had made her believe that she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's why she was looking through files of everyone who ever had (or ever would) travel with the Doctor. As far as she was concerned, she was<i>the</i> companion, and she wasn't going to settle for second, or third, or fourth, or even twentieth place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving travelled with the Doctor long enough to pick up a little bit of knowledge, she set the controls for her destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ship wheezed, and the time rotor repeatedly rose and fell as the TARDIS was in-flight, she eagerly awaited, bouncing with anticipation for what she planned to do next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the noise came to a stop, signalling that they had materialised at their destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raced towards the doors, ready to meet her fellow companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was the companion?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amy exited the TARDIS doors to a nicely decorated flat. As she took in her surroundings, she noticed that the woman she'd come here to meet did not seem to be around anywhere, and she couldn't hear any movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall Scotswoman had come here with a purpose. Earlier that day, she'd come across a note, signed by her future self. At first Amy had taken it as a joke. She might have only been travelling with the Doctor for a few weeks now, but she still wasn't quite as open-minded as she would likely become over time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever as she had read the letter, she accepted that it was indeed her handwriting. Her future self had not given much of her future away, only vaguely suggesting that one day the Doctor would need cheering up, and one woman would be there to do that for him. Her name was Clara, and Amy's older self instructed her to go seek Clara out at her flat and thank her for being there for the Doctor. The older Amy made it clear that she was no longer in a position to do it herself, which was why she had turned to her younger self for the task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara had been relaxing in her living room, laid on her couch, when suddenly she watched the TARDIS materialise in her living room. This was far from the first time this had happened. She was used to her grey-haired Doctor turning up unannounced in her home at any time. The round-faced woman grinned widely enough for her dimples to become very pronounced as she sat up. However as the TARDIS doors opened, they didn't reveal the Doctor stepping out, but a tall ginger woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, hello?\" Clara asked. Bizarrely, the mysterious woman didn't take any notice of her. In fact, she didn't react at all. She just continued to look around the living space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy huffed. There was no sign of Clara anywhere in her flat. 'She must be out,' Amy thought. All the while, Clara was actually asking her who she was and what she doing there from her seated position on the sofa. Yet Amy didn't acknowledge her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Clara, the TARDIS' perception filter had malfunctioned when the Doctor had dropped her off the previous night. An invisible field, the perception filter prevented anyone from noticing the TARDIS' presence, behaving as thought the object was not there. The Doctor usually kept the field down to a minimum, allowing everyone to notice it, but not feel compelled to investigate it further. However, the full strength of the perception field had latched onto Clara, covering her with an invisible bubble that would prevent anyone else from seeing or hearing her. Usually the field merely altered one's perception. But turned up to full strength and latched onto a human? Clara was effectively invisible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to sit and wait for Clara to show up, Amy turned and walked in the direction of the sofa, heading straight for Clara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara sighed in relief as she saw the stranger approach her. Finally she was going to give her some answers. \"What-what are you doing?\" Clara asked as she saw the long-legged ginger stop just in front of her, and turn around so her tight ass was right in front of Clara's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed again as she began to lower herself to sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara's eyes widened before grunting as the woman plopped her heavy body down onto her lap, their height disparity becoming crushingly clear. 'Dear god, how much does this woman weigh?' Clara thought before she pushed against the strange woman's back in a fruitless effort to force herself off of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy flinched as she thought she felt something push into her back, feeling almost like hands. It did feel like she had sat down on a pair of legs. But there was no one else there. She turned around just to check, confirming that she was indeed alone. She decided to lean back a bit to get comfy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara groaned again in pain as the red-haired woman lifted her butt up an inch before scooting back and plopping it back down. Her groans were muffled as the woman began to lean backwards, forcing her back into Clara's face, pinning her head into the back of the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy felt a ticking sensation against her back, but thought nothing of it. It was probably just an itch. Little did she know, that she was now sitting on the very woman she was waiting for, and had trapped her head between her back and the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Have you ever wondered what it would be like for Amy to sit her taller body on Clara? If Rose decided to grind her crotch on Rory's face? If Clara motorboated Martha? Then this is the story for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith how poorly Doctor Who companions tend to react to the information that they're not the first to travel with the Doctor, maybe they might be jealous enough to go find them and teach them a lesson? Or maybe they might be jealous enough of their bodies to want to find them and beg them to smother them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe they might land on them without realising that they're there? Or maybe a perception filter might come in use to cause some purposefully planned or unaware smother?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Rules:</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) No toilet stuff/scat/peeing. Farts are acceptable.<br>\r\n2) F/F or F/M only.<br>\r\n3) Please use adequate standards of grammar/punctuation. Please don't let this discourage you; just try your best! I don't mind fixing chapters myself if this is too much of a problem.<br>\r\n4) Please make sure to write a decent chunk rather than just a few sentences. Aim for at least 1,000 characters.<br>\r\n5) I'll allow growing/shrinking, but the characters can only grow/shrink by a couple of feet at the most.<br>\r\n6) Not a hard rule on feet stuff, but I'd prefer to keep it to a minimum.<br>\r\n7) Please try not to make it too violent. I've rated this 18+ to be on the safe side, but I'd rather people try to keep it more closer to 13+.<br>\r\n8) No death.<br>\r\n9) No going back in time for interaction with them as a child. All interaction must be from the time the character became a companion. I shouldn't have to state this, but just in case.</td>",
