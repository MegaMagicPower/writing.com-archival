Under one rule, great progress occurred in physics, aero-space, biology, medicine, and many other areas of science and technology. Much of this progress came as a result of the Research and Development division within the government. This department was in charge of bringing the world forward toward the future. However, this was not a shared dream by all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Resistance existed to overthrow the current world order, seeking to become the main power. To keep the battles in their favor, the World Government had the Research and Development division continue its efforts in military technology, and a peculiar breakthrough in the super soldier program arose, the composite soldier. The human body, with its biological limitations, could only be enhanced so far, but when combined, the human body suddenly has almost exponential potential. The researchers found that they could combine two individuals into a single, composite person. This new person would have all the skills and knowledge base of the two original people and would be able to complete far more complex tasks with ease. The composite person would also have significantly higher than typical levels of stamina, strength, agility, reaction time, intelligence, and other qualities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis super soldier, while retaining the knowledge and training of the two individual people, would have a simple, straight forward personality: 'The mission would come first.' The composite soldier would attempt anything in its power to finish what it was assigned. One other benefit was that it was completely reversible, with the appropriate technology from the government of course, and the two individuals would have no recollection of their composite form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story follows two soldiers in this super soldier program. Perhaps they are siblings, or two friends who have known each other for years. Research had shown that individuals who got along tended to make the most efficient composite soldiers. Or perhaps, the two soldiers have never met but were plaired together given their unique knowledge/training for a crucial mission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the case, it will begin with the Resistance infiltrating the base; the technology obviously coveted by the secret group. What will the heroes or heroines do when the base is attacked?</span></div></div>",

Growing up they were pretty good friends.  Being so close in age, and looks, a lot of people confused them as twins.  But they had subtle differences in looks and major differences in personalities.  Logan, being the eldest brother always was more of the \u2018take the lead\u2019 type of guy, take action first and ask questions later.  Mason, being the younger brother, was the more reserved brother.  Always looking for a good book and is a major history buff.  Mason always loved to Learn what he could and ask questions on things he didn\u2019t understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Logan and Mason are similar in height, Mason being 5\u2019 10\u201d and Logan 5\u2019 11\u201d.  Both have brown hair and fair skin.  However, Logan has Brown eyes whereas Mason has Green eyes.

The Resistance had targeted an important figure from the World Government during a speech. While intended target had been killed in the explosion, many other innocents were lost as well. The Resistance called the attack a 'wake-up call' to the sheep following the herd. The brothers, filled with rage, wanted, needed to avenge their lost friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very next day, they were shipped off to boot camp, where they excelled. Logan appeared to be a natural with any gun handed to him, having precision aim. He broke record after record with his sharpshooting. Mason learned and mastered more subtle approaches compared to his brother. He excelled at hacking, infiltration, and stealth. And when paired together on mock missions, they made an unbeatable team. At the end of their 2-year training, the brothers were recruited into the super soldier program, joining four other pairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow having just turned 25 a month ago, Mason relaxed in his quarters, which he shared with Logan. Though at the moment, he was alone. His eyes were closed, and his mind began to drift towards sleep. A sudden rumbling, almost like thunder woke him with a start. The base, which he had worked at for the last four years was underground. There was no thunder underground. Another rumble occurred, and Mason was on his feet rushing for the door. They were being attacked...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"How did the resistance learn of the base?\" Mason asked himself as he rushed down the corridor. Another rumble, louder and stronger than the others shook the ground. He nearly toppled over but caught himself on the wall. He took off again, navigating the maze of tunnels to the lab. He hoped that his brother would be meeting up with him there, as it would do no good if he was the only one there. He needed his brother. And besides that, he was worried for him. Mason had no idea where is brother was within the base. He kept his mind from drifting to the worst possible thoughts. \"Please... Logan. Just please make it to the lab safely...\" He said to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he figured it was the Resistance attacking, there were just so many unknowns about the forces. How many people were part of the assault... 25... 50... or more? Was there objective to only damage a World Government base, or was it something else? Could they have gathered intel on the secret operation here? Did they know about the fusion chamber?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMason stopped himself as he made a wrong turn. \"Dammit!\" He cursed aloud. His mind was so preoccupied with questions of the enemy that he started running towards the armory on instinct. \"Well a weapon would not be such a bad idea to grab...\" He told himself. He continued further down the hall and made it to the armory without a problem. He swiped his base key card, and the electric lock buzzed. Mason stepped inside and grabbed an FN Minimi, a light machine gun. He also put on a bullet proof vest and grabbed an extra. Before leaving, he decided to grab a shotgun as well, knowing his brother's favored weapon. It was not like their combined form could wield the two weapons at the same time, or even wear two vests, but just in case, it was an extra precaution. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the shotgun strapped to his back and the FN Minimi in hand, he sprinted back the way he came. He then turned in the correct direction of the lab. As he ran, the lights began to flicker, before returning to their normal brightness. \"They must be trying to go for the generator...\" Mason thought aloud. It was a smart play on the Resistance's part. The fusion chamber required a large amount of power to function. Without the power, the super soldiers would not be able to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Mason arrived at the lab, to see a few of the scientists running around busily. \"Mason\" a man, with a thick accent, called his name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Mudrov\" He gave a quick greeting the man. \"Is my brother here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" Dr. Mudrov repied. \"You are the first to arrive. And we are running out of time.\" Sweat dripped off the older man's forehead. \"The base is overwhelmed by the Resistance forces. There... there are so many... And they will soon make it to the generator!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck... Where is he?\" Mason asked aloud, to no one in particular. If they had a chance of saving the base, he and his brother, and the other super soldier pairs, were going to have to merge. He bit his lip. Now he was worried. He hoped Logan was on the way to the lab, and not caught up in a confrontation with Resistance soldiers. And if the Resistance shuts off power before he, or another pair arrives, there would be nothing they could do. Fighting back would likely result in many casualties on their side. After all, this was more of a research base of operations than a military one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I be fused with someone from your team? If worst comes to worst?\" Mason tried hard to keep his voice level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would not be safe... there are too many risks for people who do not share blood?\" Dr. Mudrov answered. \"But, I can see if there is someone who could be a safe enough match...\" The man turned and began working on the nearest computer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMason knew that it was a long shot, but they needed a contingency plan. When he and his brother first arrived, the dangers were explained to them, but given that they were related, the risks were fairly low. In fact, three of the other four pairs were related. There was only one pair who had been long-time friends who happened to also be compatible for a merge. Compatibility was partially due to genetics, and Mason was not sure what the other part had to do with since the fourth pair did not share any DNA. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA noise in the hallway drew his attention. He aimed his weapon into the doorway, waiting for whomever was on the other side. He hoped that they were a friendly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A man shuffled into view, and Mason immediately recognized his brother. \"Logan!\" he called as rushed him. He took note that his older brother had a limp and blood on his shirt. \"Logan, are you okay?\" He wrapped an arm around him and braced his legs from the extra weight of his brother. He lead his brother to an open chair and helped him sit down. \"Are you okay?\" He repeated his question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine. The blood on my shirt isn't mine.\" Logan waved off his brother. \"I just need to rest a moment.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do not look fine, Logan.\" Dr. Mudrov said as he approached and lifted back the pant leg of Logan's right leg. Underneath was a hastily wrapped bandage over his shin. The bandage seemed to be controlling the bleeding of whatever wound he had suffered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bastards flanked us.\" Logan recounted what had happened. \"We managed to take that wave down, but one got in close enough with a knife. Sophia bandaged me up, and it seems to be holding. She and Jackson are on there way here too... They were helping the base soldiers hold the line to the generators.\" Logan looked around the room and sighed. \"So Olivia and Addison aren't here... or Henry or Alex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMason shook his head. \"No, I was the first to arrive.\" Olivia and Addison were the siblings of Sophia and Jackson, respectively. Henry and Alex were the best friends who were also in the super soldier program. Mason looked at the doorway again, hoping for one of the other pairs to pop in, but no one did. He noticed his brother doing the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights flickered for a moment and the ground rumbled. \"Come on Mason, we got to get ready so Atlas can take care of business.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, lets kick some ass.\" Mason smiled. 'Atlas' was the name that they had agreed on for their combined form. Not that they remembered what or who Atlas was. Logan fancied superhero stories, and he wanted their joint form to have a superhero title. The others caught on, and of course, created their own superhero names. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cannot be serious...\" a younger man asked. He was one of Dr. Mudrov's assistants. \"You're injured.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Mudrov sighed, \"It is not ideal, but the injury should mostly heal during the fusion process as Mason's cells bind with Logan's. Any left over damage will rapidly repair itself afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not like we have a choice anyways. We need a super soldier to help defend the base, and we're all there is right now.\" Logan stated confidently as he stripped out of his shirt and pants. He carefully began taking off the bandage as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMason followed his older brother's lead and began stripping as well. It was a safety precaution as the fusion chamber only combined organic matter, and clothing or any other non-organic material could interfere with the process. Normally, curtains would have been drawn for them to undress in private, but that was a luxury that did not have at the moment. So, he and his brother undressed in front of the small group of researchers, though they did have the decency to turn around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMason grabbed Logan's left shoulder and helped him to a standing position. Carefully they stepped into the small, egg-like chamber, barely big enough for the both of them. They sat side by side, squished onto the narrow metal seat. By now, the steps to follow were routine for Mason. He pressed a button on the side, and the chamber door arched downward to seal them in. The inside was fairly dark. There was one internal light source at the top but it was dim, as if the bulb needed to be changed. Mason pressed another button, and spoke, \"Dr Mudrov... we're ready.\" The chamber was air tight, so the intercom was needed to communicate with them outside. Mason wrapped his right arm around Logan, and his brother did the opposite with his left arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, initiating the fusion.\" came Dr. Mudrov's voice through the speakers. A few moments later, the chamber began to fill with the familiar gas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, it was not really gas but millions upon millions of nanites, tiny robots about the size of a grain of sand. They surrounded Mason and his brother like a cloud and began working. Moments later, he felt a warmth all around him, beyond his brother's body heat. That was the sign that the merging process had begun. He and Logan were now joined by skin and small blood vessels along their thighs, hips, and the arms around their shoulders. Mason's right leg began to fall asleep, but he knew that the muscles and bone of the leg were blending into his brother's left leg. A few seconds later he lost all sensation of his right leg, but his left seemed to become larger and longer. He pressed his foot up against the metal frame. Next, his right arm seeped into his brother's left shoulder, as if it was submerging into a pool of water. He felt himself being pulled sideways along the bench towards his brother, like two magnets rushing together. The small chamber no longer felt narrow and squished. Mason knew that the fusion was shifting to its last phase. He and Logan were nearly completely joined together, and he figured they were sharing a single pair of hips and one torso. The heads were always the final step as it required the most delicacy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring their fist fusion, it had been very disconcerting feeling his body fade away, in a sense, as it blended into this brother. It was like nothing he had ever experienced. His body simply seemed to vanish. While not as unsettling, it still made Mason's heart beat faster. He closed his eyes, and trusted the nanites to do their job. But then, the chamber rattled violently and the only dim light source snuffed out. Mason's heart pounded in his chest, as if it was trying to break through his ribcage. Another thud vibrated through the chamber and it seemed to lurch to the side. His head hit the wall of the small chamber, and then something not as hard hit the side of his head. Unconsciousness swallow him. </span></div></div>",
