She pulled out the small chocolate cake from the fridge and set it out on the dining table, so that her son would see it. She knew that her boy was an early riser, and she wanted to be ready for him when he would get up. The chocolate cake had the words \u201cHappy Birthday Henry\u201d written on it in bright blue frosting on the dark brown chocolate background, knowing that this was the type of cake that Henry requested every year for his birthday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom\u2026\u201d Henry moaned, as soon as he got out of the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHappy Birthday, sweetheart!\u201d Cindy grinned, as she gave her boy a big hug. \u201cI got you your favorite: Chocolate cake!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sat down early in the morning as she cut two pieces from the cake and served them up on two small plates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, mom\u2026\u201d Henry smiled, as he took his spoon and began to take a bite out of his first piece. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJustin, the boy next door, had invited you over to play video games when he\u2019s up. I have to go to work, sweetie, so you got the house all to yourself, okay? Call me on my cell if you need anything!\u201d Cindy said, as she continued to eat her slice of cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, mom! I\u2019ll be here. I\u2019m not going anywhere, with this bad weather. I\u2019m just happy I don\u2019t have to go to school in the pouring rain!\u201d Henry noted, since it was in the middle of summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy quickly finished her cake before she showered and got dressed to go to work. She worked in a large office building near the downtown area in Miami, and she was already looking forward to the weekend so she could take Henry to the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, take care and lock the house if you go out to Justin\u2019s. We\u2019ll go to the beach this weekend, okay?\u201d Cindy said, as she was about to walk out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOkay, see you tonight. Bye, mom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry finished his cake and put everything away in the fridge for later. Then he just put on his shoes and a pair of shorts and a t-shirt before he headed out to the house next door. As soon as he knocked on the door, a tall, lanky kid with curly hair opened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Henry! Happy Birthday, dude!\u201d Justin said; as he held the door open wide for the shorter boy. Henry ran inside since the rain started up again, and the two sat down on the couch for a few minutes until Justin led him to the garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, I wanna finish my work out before I hit the video games, okay? You can spot me if you want!\u201d Justin instructed as he got down on the bench and wrapped his hands on the bar. He began lifting the bar up and started pressing the bar up and down as he lay flat on his back. Henry just stood there, where Justin\u2019s head was, and looked down while he watched Justin do his work out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Justin did his final rep, he struggled to lift the bar back up. It took him longer to raise the bar up to the metal post, where the bar would rest on. Henry saw that Justin was struggling with lifting the bar, and he realized that Justin needed help. He quickly reached under with his hands and grabbed hold of the bar, raising it up and gently placing the bar on the posts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude! Are you okay? You had a hard time during that last rep!\u201d Henry noted, as Justin got off the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 I couldn\u2019t lift it. Do you want to give it a try?\u201d Justin asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry got on the bench and began lifting the bar with the weights. Immediately, he felt as if his arms and his pectorals began getting tighter and stronger. It almost seemed weird. It was as if his muscles started growing right away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry did about fifteen reps, when he set the bar back on the post. He wasn\u2019t even tired at all! He sat up, and flexed his arm. He noted that his chest felt very firm and hard as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude! Have you ever worked out before?\u201d Justin asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! This is my first time\u2026 ever!\u201d Henry replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? You look like\u2026 Your arms and your chest\u2026 You look like you\u2019ve already gained some muscle! That is amazing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry just shrugged. Nobody grows muscle that fast, could they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was the fourth week of the summer vacation, and you had just acquired a part-time job at a sandwich restaurant. During the day you help your mother around the house, and you take care of Lucas, your 12 year-old brother. Your parents are divorced and you're pretty much the man of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, you're laying in bed, and you're having a hard time falling asleep. You look up through the large window, which is right above your bed, which is in the corner of your small bedroom, and you see what appears to be a falling star in the nighttime sky. Then, moments later, a bright light appears shining through the window, lighting up your bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, why is someone shining their flashlight at my window?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light grows brighter, and you can't even look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, out of nowhere, a man appears standing in your room. He is tall and muscular, and he's wearing a strange jumpsuit, all white. It almost looks like some sort of superhero costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thomas!

What are you d-d-doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange being extended his right hand and aimed his index finger at your face. Then, a blue beam of light shot from the tip of his finger, striking you in the forehead, and instantly knocked you unconscious!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up, hours later, not remembering anything that had happened and finding yourself all alone in the bedroom. Nothing was moved or touched, and everything seemed the same as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man... What a weird night...\" you say groggily, as you slowly roll out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the bright light shining through the windows you could tell that it was already daylight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom had already gone to work and Lucas was sitting in front of the TV, playing his video games, when you stumble into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear the sound of a car passing and stopping in front of the house. You just look up, at the front door. Next thing you know, the door, and the entire front wall of the house seems to become transparent to you, allowing you to see the front lawn, the sidewalk, and the street, which ran in front of the house! You saw the mailman pulling up, and placing the mail in the mailbox!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mail just got delivered!\" you mumble out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know?\" Lucas replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I... I just saw it!\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas just turned and stared at you with a confured look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? How can you see that from inside of the house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it dawned on you: You have x-ray vision!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man... I... Uhh... I have no idea how I did that...\" you whisper to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

His hands are expanding, while his muscles are bulging everywhere. Your brother is aging before your very eyes, thanks to you! You see a 12-year-old boy go through puberty in a matter of seconds, as he passes through 13, 14, 15 years-old. He shoots up like a weed, and he's the same height as you in no time the moment he turns 16. Then, he passes you, as he grows older. Hair sprouts everywhere, and his face ages gracefully. He grows a thin beard and a mustache, while his muscles continue to expand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you cut off the hypno vision when you guess he has reached age 20.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Lucas says, in a deep, baritone voice. \"This is amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're now looking UP to your former \"little brother\", who is about 6 foot 4 inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were 4 years younger than me, and now you're 4 years older!\" you say to the big, tall man standing before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Tom...

As he went to get dressed for another day at school, he heard an audible clicking sound. Looking around, he saw it was the Geiger counter his dad had given him. Artemis had always been interested in anything nuclear, so his dad had given him an old counter from the power station he worked at. This time, however, the clicking sped up rapidly as Artemis picked up the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, weird. It's never done that before.\" he said. After getting dressed, he put the counter in his bag, to see if it kept going like that.

Artemis was then thrown into the wall, leaving a small crater. As he struggled to his feet, he was hit by chunks of ice from one of the other boys. Then, Artemis felt a large pain shooting through his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARGH!\" he cried, kneeling on the ground clutching his head. At that moment, the leader of the group noticed the Geiger counter that had fallen from Artemis' pocket. Instead of a steady clicking, the device was screaming like a siren. Then, the third boy charged at Artemis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, wait!\" the leader shouted. But the boy kept running. However, once he got close to Artemis, the boy screamed, before collapsing on the ground, dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That idiot! Everyone back off! This guy's putting out serious radiation!\" he shouted. Turning to Artemis, he said \"You monster! Look at what you've done! You'd better leave this place before I kill you, and don't come back!\" Artemis realised the boy was right. He couldn't control his powers, and he was dangerous. Artemis concentrated, focusing the radiation around his body, By ionising the air, itr made surrounding air rush in, creating thrust. Artemis lifted up off the ground, before soaring away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Cynthia, Mom, Dad, I'm sorry.\"</i> he thought, crying as he flew away.</span></div></div>",

He realised that the radiation his body was generating had to have come from somewhere else, otherwise it would stop after a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So that means, if my body absorbs radiation, I can survive on radiation alone.\"</i> he thought. After this, Artemis decided where he could go, so that there would be no people around, and the background radiation would be more than sufficient; Chernobyl. Aboandoned following a nuclear meltdown at the local nuclear reactor, the city had been a ghost town for years. His route decided, Artemis headed for Chernobyl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>A day later</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, Artemis landed on the outskirts of Chernobyl. It looked just like what the documentaries showed; buildings falling into disrepair, cars abandoned on the street, complete silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, at least here, I can't hurt anyone.\" he said, walking off to look around. Surprisingly, he didn't find it as spooky as he'd imagined. It almost felt...peaceful. After a few hours wandering, Artemis found a building with a reasonably intact top floor, which still had galss in the windows and a decent view of the city, and the power plant beyond.</span></div></div>",

It stands for Sieverts per Hour.  uSv/h is microsieverts per hour, etc.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this seems like a nice place to live for a while.\"  Artemis said to himself, shedding a tear.  He realized that until he understood his powers, he's have to quarantine himself in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.  \"Well, for starters, my powers seem to be tied to radiation.  So, I need to lots of things out.\"  Artemis continued talking to himself.  \"Well, I'm obviously not harmed by the radiation.  So, there's that.  Maybe more radiation makes me stronger...\"  He pondered.  Artemis whipped out his trusty Geiger counter, and looked at the reading.  It said 5 uSv/h.  Higher than the average background radiation of Earth (0.1 - 0.2 uSv/h), but not high.  He decided to see if his physical strength was augmented by the radiation.  The teen walked up to a large wall, and punched it.  He noticed many small cracks in the wall that were not there before.  \"Now, let's go somewhere with more radiation.\"  He said as he walked out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chernobyl Reactor #4.  Caution, deadly radiation.  Perfect.\"  Artemis grinned as he entered the building.  He checked the Geiger counter, and noticed that it overflowed.  However, he realized that he was able to measure radiation levels himself.  He measured that the control room, where he was standing, was reading at 300 Sv/h.  To a normal person, this would mean a lethal dose of radiation in one minute.  However, radiation acted differently with Artemis.  He noticed that he felt very powerful in the room.  However, he was there for testing purposes.  He figured that if he was going to notice any differences in strength, it would be in this room.  Scanning the room, Artemis found a large piece of debris on the ground.  Artemis walked towards it, and tried to lift it.  While it was larger than him, he lifted the debris like a piece of paper.  \"Okay, more radiation equals stronger me.  Good to know.\"  Artemis said to himself as he put the debris down.  \"However, I need to figure out what exactly I can do, and how to make sure I don't continue emitting radiation.  I don't want to give people cancer.\"  Artemis used the same tactic he picked up in the school to fly out of the reactor, and into the heart of Pripyat, a city in the exclusion zone.  He noticed that the radiation calmed to a relatively low 1 uSv/h.  Artemis held his Geiger counter next to himself to see how much radiation he was emitting.  It read 10 uSv/h.  Too much.  He wanted to lower it to that of the natural background radiation of Earth, and somehow, it worked.  Artemis had no idea how he did it, but it worked.  \"So, if I can lower the amount I'm emitting, I must store it somewhere.  I wonder if I can use it as an attack or something...\"  Artemis wondered.  He did just absorb a lot of radiation in the reactor, so he theoretically could do something with it.  He tried concentrating the radiation in his body into a beam coming out of his hand.  Immediately, a beam of white shot out of his hand and impacted a building, causing a large explosion.  As the smoke subsided, he noticed the building was completely destroyed.  \"Okay, too much.  Maybe try something smaller.\"  He focused on making a beam again, but much smaller.  Another white beam appeared, and hit a tree.  Rather than cause a large explosion, there was a small explosion.  The tree did not survive it though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued testing out his beam power, trying to figure out how to control it's strength better, Artemis noticed that he started feeling weak.  He was using all his radiation reserves.  He needed more.  Artemis looked around, and noticed that there was a lot of radiation coming out of the site of his first beam.  He walked up to it, and noticed that there was a lot more radiation at that one site than he absorbed in the reactor.  Artemis found that he was a source of radiation.  He didn't just absorb it, he created it out of nowhere.  He violated the laws of physics.  \"Huh, that's very interesting.  I have an idea.\"  Artemis figured that if he wanted to stop The Blessed, he would need to become some kind of superhero.  He's always loved the idea of Iron Man, and how the suit was powered by the Arc Reactor.  Maybe Artemis could channel the radiation he created naturally to make his own kind of Arc Reactor, and become a real life radiation-driven Iron Man.  Artemis figured that if he could pull it off, he would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>One month of hard work, practice and learning new abilities later...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All done!\"  Artemis smiled as he gazed upon his masterpiece.  \"I guess those engineering classes payed off.\"  Standing in front of him was a 6'4\" metal suit.  It was very similar in design to the iconic Mark VII Iron Man suit.  However, looks were the only similarity.  During the month he spent building the suit, Artemis learned that he could perform different kinds of radioactive decay on elements in metals.  He could also alter the properties of the metal so it could be what he wanted it to be.  In the case of his suit, nigh indestructible yet very flexible.  He also learned about his physics-breaking energy creation, and was able to use it to power the suit.  He also took a bunch of Uranium from the reactors and lined the interior of the suit with it.  That way, he was constantly absorbing more radiation.  Artemis also made sure that the suit was insulated enough to not let people outside be damaged by radiation from the inside of the suit.  While the interior of the suit averaged 100 Sv/h, right outside never reached above 1 uSv/h, which is a very safe amount.  That's about as much radiation as a bushel of bananas.  When in the suit, Artemis had super strength (100 tons), heightened agility, supersonic flight (Mach 3), the beam ability, and the ability to control radiation outside of the suit.  The suit, as stated prior, was nigh-indestructible.  Bulletproof, concussion proof, and able to take a very strong beating.  The suit is durable enough to withstand a tactical nuke, extreme temperatures, underwater pressure up to a depth of 1 mile, space, and a blow equivalent to being hit by a tank going 100 mph.  Needless to say, this suit was very strong.  Artemis was very proud of his creation.  He put on the suit, and flew back to his hometown, ready to take on The Blessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd of Chapter.</span></div></div>",

With no other people around, he couldn't hurt anyone. Also, he'd discovered that he could live off natural background radiation, meaning the location was perfect. However, Artemis was still worried about what The Blessed might be doing back home. So, he decided to create a suit that would contain the radiation he gave off, meaning he wouldn't have to worry about accidentally killing anyone again. The suit would need to be big however, as due to the radiation, Artemis had quickly grown to 7 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, he went around the city, collecting all the steel he could find. After a week, he had roughly ten tonnes of it. By using his radiation, he altered the steel's structure to be like that of diamond, increasing its strength by about 100 times. Then, he forced the atoms as close together as possible, to the point where the electrons were touching nuclei. This meant that the new steel took up the same space as 100kg of normal steel. After this, Artemis shaped the steel into a suit of armour, giving it a very squared appearance, since he wasn't going for aesthetics. Despite the suit's immense weight, by fitting powerful motors, Artemis could easily move around in it. The motors and the suit's systems, such as navigation, were powered by a small reactor driven by Artemis' own radiation, preventing a build up and explosion. To get off the ground, the suit was equipped with twin rocket engines on the back, and one on the back of each leg. However, as these were special nuclear-propelled rocket engines, they would never run out of fuel, and each produced roughly 100,000lb of thrust, more than enough to get the suit aitborn, and up to a speed of at least Mach 2. Also, the huge density of the steel meant that it was virtually indestructable, short of a nuclear bomb blast.</span></div></div>",

Cynthia still hoped that he would come back soon, especially since The Blessed had been increasing their numbers. She was especially afraid, because one of her other friends, a girl named Anna, had told Cynthia that she had powers as well. Her power was telepathy, so she'd been able to hide from The Blessed for quite a while, but she was worried that they would find her soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, Cynthia and Anna had been talking during lunch, when the same group of Blessed from two months earlier, minus the boy that Artemis had accidentally killed, stormed into the school again. Anna threw up her telepathic barrier, hoping to conceal her powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right people, we know someone else here has powers. Now, this time we'll do things differently. If you don't join us, we'll start killing each of you until you decide to fess up!\" the leader announced, as one boy in the group created a  wall of ice, trapping everyone inside. The girl again searched for the person they were looking for. Despite Anna's best efforts, the other telepath was too powerful and broke through her barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's her.\" the girl said, pointing at Anna. However, before the leader could respond, a loud rumbling sound was heard. The leader turned around, as something dropped from the sky and slammed into the ground. As the dust settled, it revealed a large humanoid figure, covered in thick, genmetal-grey armour, red eyes glowing in its helmet. Another red light, circular this time, glowed in its chestplate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell? Titan, get rid of that pile of scrap metal.\" the leader shouted, gesturing to the tall, strong boy behind him. Titan nodded, charging towards the figure. His fist slammed into its chest with such force that the air shook. Amazingly, the armoured figure didn't budge. Then, it grabbed Titan's head with its large armoured gauntlet, lifting him off his feet. Suddenly, a red-coloured wave of energy erupted from the gauntlet. Titan screamed, as the energy coursed through his body. After a moment, his head exploded, blood splattering over the figure's armour. The figure slowly started to walk forward, its armour clanking loudly with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You monster!\" yelled the leader, trying to lift the figure with his telekinetic powers. However, he discovered the armour was so dense, that he couldn't lift it, no matter how hard he concentrated. The girl tried to blast the figure's mind, but the armour's density meant her thoughts couldn't get through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave, now!\" shouted the figure, raising its right gauntlet again. The Blessed, already terrified, ran ffor their lives, desparate to get away from this nightmarish thing in front of them. The figure then approached Cynthia and Anna. the twpo girls screamed, afraid of what the armoured figure might do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't be scared. I don't want to hurt you\" the figure told them, its deep voice now quiet. It then knelt in front of the girls. \"Are you alright, Cynthia, Anna?\" it asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-How do you know our names?\" Cynthia asked, still frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynthia, it's me.\" the figure replied, removing its helmet. Cynthia gasped. Even though his hair was now bleached white, presumably a side effect of the radiation, and his eyes were glowing green, she recognised that smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Artemis?!\" she gasped, her eyes brimming with tears. Artemis nodded slowly.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you're still okay.\" he said. He was surprised when Cynthia hugged him tightly, despite the blood on his armour. Artemis placed his hand on her back, careful not to crush her with his armour's strength.</span></div></div>",

You were then picked up, by other two and, outmatched, they took all Shane's money and possesions.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Let's go,\" says tattoos, seeming nervous, but was still holding you, along with the smaller one.<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" starts the smaller one himself, \"he did screw your nose up, mabey you should teach him a lesson,\"<br>\r\n\"sure but keep him still,\" says tattoos laughing.<br>\r\nAt the moment you are more than furious.   You just wished that you could... i don't know stop them somehow, hurt them.   Blow himself out of the guy's grasp.   Suddenly, Shane feels immense energy that just had to come out, so powerful that it felt that the smaller one's grasp was flimsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't take it any more, he let the energy out and he found himself free.   The man who was holding you was knocked against the wall.   Confused but almost understanding, Shane focused on a trash can, and imagined it hitting tattoos.   He felt a small strain, then the can catapulted into him, knocking him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally their was just the leader, standing amazed.   Shane narrowed his eyes and sent the man flying up, and then crashed him on the ground, knocking him out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you notice someone behind you.   She was a small woman who looked very bookish.   She didn't look at all suprised at what just happened.   \"Come with me,\" she ordered in a bored voice and started walking.   Confused, you follow her to her car, and she drives off with you.</span></div></div>",

Shane is bored out of his mind but for some reason he doesn't want to say anything.   It's a strange feeling.   The weird thing is, he would usually  think he would be pretty annoyed.   But for some reason he is just content (but somehow bored at the same time) to just sit their.<br>\r\nShane decided that he didn't want to be silent, no matter how strange this is.   So he started the conversation up again.   \"So what is your name?\" he asks, feeling proud that he fought back the feeling,\"<br>\r\n\"Its Ann,\" she says in an annoyed voice.<br>\r\nSuddenly Shane grasps it, he shouldn't be here and he should be asking more important questions.   \"Hey do you have any powers?\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she says.<br>\r\n\"What can you do?\" Shane asks.<br>\r\n\"Actually, I can make people to do almost anything I want, which is how I got you in here, actually most people can't struggle past the first wave I send toward them, but maybe your just stubborn,\" she explains.<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Shane thinks that there was a compliment somewhere in their, but the feeling came back again.

She landed around twenty foot away, the thing turned and prowled towards her, you couldn't let that monstrosity kill her, taking in all your courage you climed out from behind the wall and shoughted \"O Ugly, leave her alone, whats the matter not brave enough to get me, your humongous blod of orange fat\", it heard you and snalling charged towards you.

Wolf stayed in the living room constantly flipping channels. A dog lazed beside the couch motionless. Wolf slurped his pop and looked at the dog. She slept there, groaning away the pain of her weak old bones. Wolf decided to experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed to the door behind him and focused really hard on the old dog. To where only Oprah shouting Johnny Depp's name could be heard. He breathed, making straining sounds. As he stared at the sleeping dog. Soon the dog opens it's eyes and Wolf began to grin in growing excitement as the dog got up and walked to the door. <br>\r\n  \"Yes\" Wolf said filling himself with acheivment. Then he pointed to his feet and focused on the dog again. Wolf squints as a sweat bullet slowly inches its way to his cheek.<br>\r\n\"Wolf, do you want a soda?\" Jake shouted, startling Wolf and breaking his concentration. Wolf feels his heart beating rapidly. \"Wolf?\"<br>\r\n \"I got one! Wolf shouts back out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The bothers re-enter with their sandwiches as Wolf attempts to clear his throat. As Wolf's friends take their seat on the green couch next to the lounge chair, Kyle looks at Wolf's feet and giggles in delight. Wolf look and sees the dog is laying on his feet. <br>\r\n \"How did you get her to do that?\" Jake asked. Wolf just held up a piece of sandwich and feed it to the dog. \"That dog don't do anything on command. You must have mind powers or something.\" Wolf gagged on his food. Causing them to laugh. \"I was just kidding, Wolf.\" Just felt ashamed. At the same time he felt vengeful. But how. He watched Jake carefully to seek his chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kyle took a bite out of his sandwich enjoyed watching SpongeBob flunk his driving test with Patrick's radio broadcasted advise. Jake look at his best friend as he picked up his pop can drew it closer to his mouth. He grinned as Jake stared feeling awkward with his friend staring at him. Jake readied to sip his soda. <br>\r\n\"Drop it\" Wolf whispered. Jake's pop gets closer as tips it's opening for his mouth. That is when it dropped and spilt itself all over.jake's lap.<br>\r\n\"Mom Couch!\" Kyle yelled, standing up.<br>\r\n \"Shut up!\" Jake said standing up. He heads for the kitchen until he stops and turns around. Kyle looks at Wolf who whispers under his breath, then his attention turns to his bother. Jake gets down to his knee and rubs his face in the spill.<br>\r\n \"Jake!\" Kyle shouts with concern. Jake finally lifts his face while Wolf sit there watching. Kyle steps closer to his brother. <br>\r\n \"are you ok?\"<br>\r\n \"yeah! I need to get some towels for my face\"<br>\r\n 'If you didn't want a sticky face then why did you...? \"<br>\r\n\"I-I hmm uh.\" Jake felt ashamed \"I don't know\"<br>\r\nThey left the room.

Charms can make water able to stand on, or fire that doesn't burn or even create a bubble of breathable air around a person's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the thing is still made of the small thing, and still posses its strengths and weakneases, if the objects wood, then it will still burn like wood, if its metal it will still conduct heat, electricity and melt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt can't change the object any way what so ever, expect for making it do something it shouldn't,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't effect living things though, expect for plants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay now that's sorted what gender are you Male or female?</span></div></div>",

They are very tiering but last till the victum dies if you want them too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are however some who are more ressilant to the effects than others,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand you can cancell all but the one that kills instantly by thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow thats cleared up, what gender are you?</span></div></div>",

I have left it here in the a wall crevice within my cave. Yes, you heard right, my cave, it is and will forever be. Until you come along. I give this cave to you now, along with this book, my spell book, the medallian with a serpant on it, and The Rose. The rose is dried, and in a glass case in the back. Please I beg of you, never touch it! It is the single most inportant object in my life, take good care of it. <br>\r\nI will now tell you my story,<br>\r\nIt starts much differently than you may think. I was born in a orphanage, to a poor mother who died in giving birth to me. She loved my father very much, he was a Protector. He died guiding her to the orphanage. But They found me anyway, They are the Protectors. My father wanted me to have no part in thier ways, in thier magic. However, he was powerfull, and the Protectors knew I would be to. So they watched me, when I was five, they stole me. They took me to their training center, they told me about my parents, about themselves, their duty. They told me about magic. They taught me my first spells, how to use my gifts, how to fight, how to run, how to live, and to always, always love.<br>\r\nThen I was taken, again, only this time, it was by the bad guys.<br>\r\nThey were the Shadows. I was kept in a room all by myself they had taken me for my power. They hoped they could turn me.The Shadows had done this many times before to many people. I was seven at the time, I could see into the room next to me. In that stall there was a boy of eight,I watched him. He was do to leave for their training village, he had already been turned. He looked at me through the bars, I will never forget his eyes. There was never any others like them.<br>\r\nThey were the most stunning shade of green ever to exist. They glowed bright, electrically, jumping like energy. He was handsome even then, but thin, like a skeleton. <br>\r\nI was rescued only moments after he left, my teacher had come to save me. Later at the age of ten I was captured again, they took me straight to thier camp, not bothering trying to convert me first. He was there, his name was Johnathen. I spoke with him often, I fell in love with him. <br>\r\nMany people, in many stories turn good for the ones they love. But he was not good, he did not love me, but I needed him, he was all that mattered to me. So I turned bad. I could never leave his side, so even after opertunity after oppertunity presented itself for escape, I stayed.<br>\r\nThis is the briefest outline of my past, I will elaborate in further chapters but this is my warning before you read further,<br>\r\nI am not the good guy, I am, for the man I love evil. If you can not stand this, and can not read this through, then do not read any farther. Sighn you name on the list in the back so that whomever  can will know how many hands this has passed through. If you can not read this leave, and never come back, this is not your cave, nor are these your belongings. For if you can not bear an evil womens life story you must not hold her possesions. Leave them for someone who can.<br>\r\nIf you can then please, Read on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was just a few miles south of Miami, in the state of Florida. The truck had arrived there, and was heading towards a small concrete platform, which lowered straight into the water. It was 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, and nobody was around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver put the large dump truck in reverse and allowed the truck to slowly slide down the concrete slope until the rear tires were barely reaching the water. Then, the driver reached down, and pulled another lever, causing the engine to engage and rise up the big dump bin in the back, which contained all the trash. As the dumper raiser up higher and higher, the rear side remained level, so that all the trash slowly moved to the back until it fell out of the back of the dumper and poured out of the dumper into the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the dumper bin was completely raised up and had dumped all of its contents into the ocean, the driver pulled the lever back up, and the front end of the dump bin got lowered back onto the chassis of the dump truck. This time, the dumper was empty, and all the trash had been dumped into the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver then put the truck into its first gear, and drove off, having completed its job, of adding more trash to the ocean, not knowing that he was being watched by two mysterious beings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man and a woman were standing there, observing the scene from a distance. They were clearly troubled by what they had seen. The couple was young, tall and strong. They wore sandals and they were completely dressed in long, white robes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cModern man has no respect for the sea! This is a crying shame!\u201d the man shouted out angrily. \u201cWhat must I do to teach these humans to respect the seven seas? They use the sea to dump their trash! It is a disgrace!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe we should show the humans that the sea can be used for good things\u2026 Not just to dump their trash\u2026 Maybe\u2026\u201d the woman thought out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will use the sea to destroy them! ALL OF THEM! The sea that takes their trash and their refuse will flood them! I will flood their cities and beaches and towns! I will make them respect the seas!\u201d the man growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney! Come down! You won\u2019t teach them anything by doing that!\u201d the woman pleaded to her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have any better ideas, my love?\u201d the man asked her calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShow them, how powerful the seas can be! Show them, what the sea can do! Live among them for a while!\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy love, I\u2019m a god\u2026 I do not wish to live among ordinary mortals who eat fish and who pollute the seas with their filth\u2026 It disgusts me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen\u2026 Send someone else\u2026 Or\u2026 Let\u2019s\u2026 Let\u2019s create someone\u2026 \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man stared at the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy love\u2026 If we create a son\u2026 He will be a god on Earth\u2026 he will live and walk among ordinary humans as a deity\u2026 He will stick out like a sore thumb\u2026\u201d the man said angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but he will be able to command the seas\u2026 he will command water and live in the ocean\u2026 he will be a hero among ordinary men\u2026\u201d she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if\u2026 he were a boy\u2026 a child?\u201d she wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man and turned to face the woman and smiled\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will create a young boy from the sand and the stones and the sea shells found on this beach\u2026 He will be a god who will live among ordinary people\u2026 He will have the divine power to command the oceans and he will learn at a very young age to demonstrate that power before all other human beings. And, because he will be a god, he cannot be harmed or hurt in any way\u2026\u201d the man said calmly. \u201cSo, it will be done\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree days later\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard and Maria were a young couple who had moved from Michigan to Florida. They had been in Florida for twenty years and they both worked as part of a cleaning crew for a large hotel near South Beach near Miami. They had managed to work their way up and save some money so that they could afford a small house and buy a used car so they could get around town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery Sunday they would go to church and they would help collect food for the homeless shelter and they would teach poor or homeless children as well. Eventually, they had a son and a daughter of their own, named Miguel and Diana, ages 3 and 2. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, after both Richard and Maria had come home from work and Maria had just serving chicken soup and beans for dinner, there was a loud knocking on the door. Since they lived walking distance from the beach, Richard thought that it was one of the fishermen, asking for something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Richard opened the door, he found, sitting at his front doorstep, a large wooden basket with a little baby boy, wrapped in fine blankets and a small card attached to his blanket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe card read: \u201cPlease take care of Arnon and raise him to be big and strong. Treat him special, for he is a god of the sea. Poseidon and Amphitrite\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Richard wondered, as he looked down at the little baby in the basket. The baby looked up at him and smiled. Realizing that he couldn\u2019t just leave the baby outside, Richard took the basket with the baby boy, and took him inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnon grew up quickly and became a strong, healthy boy. He was never sick. He never even got a cold. When Miguel and Diana came down with the flu, with chicken pox, or even with dengue, Arnon never caught any of it. He was always perfectly healthy and strong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard always wondered why that was. He had hidden the card, which said that Arnon was a god of the sea. He decided to keep it a secret, until the day would come, that the secret had to be revealed to Arnon about his origin\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thirteen years after the mysterious basket was left at Richard and Maria Medina\u2019s doorstep, the young baby, named Arnon, had grown into a strong, young man. He was short, with black straight hair and bright blue eyes, but he was far more muscular than most other boys of his age. He wasn\u2019t taller than them, but he seemed to be more athletic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, a young couple was visiting and they were wading in the water. They had just gotten married the previous week, and the man was showing his new wife the new wedding ring. The wife had placed the ring on her finger and decided to go swimming, when she suddenly let out a loud shriek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no! MY RING!\u201d she shouted. \u201cI lost my ring!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer husband quickly waded over to where she was standing, since they were both about knee-high in the water, and they frantically started searching for the ring, which had slipped from her finger and dropped in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiguel, Diana and Arnon had heard the commotion, along with Aaron and Paul, two boys who lived right down the street from Miguel and Arnon. All of them suddenly raced into the water and started searching for the missing ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere were you standing, when you lost the ring?\u201d Arnon asked the lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight here!\u201d she replied. \u201cI just can\u2019t see a thing, because of all the water!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnon walked over to where she was standing, and then he took a few steps back. The water wasn\u2019t clear, so it was pretty much impossible to see where the ring would have landed on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely enough, Arnon began to feel a sense of calling, as if the sea began to call out to him. Something inside of him told him, that he could utter silent commands, and that the seas would obey them. He wished for the water around him and the lady to pull back, so that he could see the ground. That way, he would spot the missing ring and find it for the lady, who was so upset about losing her wedding ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeas\u2026 Go away!\u201d he said out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it happened. The moment Arnon had uttered his command, the seas pulled back, right where he was standing, uncovering all the ground where Arnon, the couple, and the other kids had been looking for the missing ring. Now, they were all standing in wet sand, surrounded by rocks and shells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh\u2026 I see it!\u201d Arnon, smiled, as he bent down and picked up the ring, which was covered with sand. \u201cHere you go, ma\u2019am!\u201d he smiled, as he handed the wedding ring back to the lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my gosh\u2026 Thank you! Thank you so much!\u201d she stuttered. \u201cBut\u2026 How\u2026 What\u2026 W-w-what happened? Is there\u2026 l-l-low tide?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnon turned to face the ocean and wished for the water to rush back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeas\u2026 Come back!\u201d Arnon commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just as he commanded, the sea returned and soon, the boys found their legs surrounded by flowing sea water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d Miguel gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! How did you do that?\u201d Aaron said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 Uhmm\u2026\u201d Arnon stuttered. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 I just did\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Richard was walking past the beach, when Miguel ran up to him, with Diana right behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaddy! Daddy! Guess what just happened? Arnon made the water go away from the beach, so that he could retrieve the ring for that lady! He made the whole beach grow wider by pushing back the water for a minute or so! Isn\u2019t that cool?\u201d Miguel shouted at his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh dear\u2026 Ooooh dear\u2026.\u201d Richard sighed. \u201cArnon, Miguel, and Diana\u2026 Let\u2019s get in the house\u2026\u201d Richard ordered his children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiguel and Arnon dashed out of the water and ran towards the house, with Diana running right behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they got to the door, they grabbed the towels, which were hanging from the stairway by the door, and they dried off. Then they took turns to shower and they put on some clean shirts and t-shirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiguel and Arnon shared the same bedroom, and both boys were sitting on Arnon\u2019s bed, when Richard walked in the room, carrying a small card. Maria and Diana also joined him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArnon\u2026 I got this when you were delivered to our doorstep, thirteen years ago\u2026\u201d he said, as he handed the boy the card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhmm\u2026 Arnon\u2026 that\u2019s me\u2026 god of the sea\u2026 Poseidon and Amphitrite?\u201d Arnon wondered out loud, as he read the text on the card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Poseidon and Amphitrite are your real parents, Arnon\u2026\u201d Richard said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? You\u2026 You\u2019re not my real dad? Mom?\u201d Arnon replied, with a tear coming from his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, my boy. You\u2019re the son of Poseidon. You\u2019re a god of the sea. You were left on our doorstep for us to raise\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA god of the sea? No way!\u201d Miguel said out loud. \u201cMy little brother is a god?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is a joke, right? This can\u2019t be true! I\u2019m just a kid! I\u2019m a normal kid! I\u2019m just like Miguel and Paul and Aaron!\u201d Arnon shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid not, Arnon\u2026. \u201cRichard responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard and Maria walked up to Arnon and they embraced him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe still love you like our son, Arnon\u2026\u201d Maria spoke. \u201cYou\u2019re still our son\u2026 No matter what the card says\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I love you too, mom\u2026.\u201d Arnon replied, no longer able to hold back the tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Miguel and Diana had gone back outside, where they had spotted Paul and Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys want to come and play with us?\u201d Miguel asked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno dude\u2026 I saw what your little bro did at the beach\u2026. That was really, really weird\u2026\u201d Aaron sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys\u2026 Arnon can do that\u2026 He\u2019s a god of the sea\u2026.\u201d Miguel said honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT!? Ohmygosh\u2026. Now this is really getting weird!\u201d Paul laughed. \u201cWell I\u2019m not going to bow down and worship your little bro if he\u2019s the god of the sea! Forget it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul turned around and walked away, angrily\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiguel became very sad and worried, wondering what it would be like when the new school year started the following week. Paul was in the same class as Arnon, and now that he knew about Arnon\u2019s powers, things could only mean trouble\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Is she  babysitting you?\"Susie replies with confusion.<br>\r\n\"B-but Susie..... I am Sophie!\" Susie has wide eyes and stands there with a blank look.

I gained these weird powers and I can change peoples age!\" Sophie closes her eyes and gives a slight smirk as she imagines Susie being six.<br>\r\n\"Um what are you smiling at?\" Susie asks.<br>\r\nSophie opens her eyes and points at Susie \"Ha!\" But Sophie feels her clothes fall to the ground. \"Oh wait crap, um I don't exactly have perfect control of it yet...\" Sophie grabs for her clothes as she is now in a five year old sized body.

Fresh and clean and no caffeine! teehee\" Susie giggles as she steps back and admires her work. Sophie sits up and looks down at her now padded crotch. It is an unusual diaper. It is much poofier than any baby diaper she has seen, and but it has all the babyish designs. She swigs her legs over the edge of the changing table and leaps off. She lands and as she tries to stand she notices the diaper is too thick for her to even close her legs. She stands there with her arms folded, poofy bottom, and a pouty face.<br>\r\n\"Well?\" She asks<br>\r\n\"Well what?\" Susie replies confused.<br>\r\n\"Are you just gonna leave me in a diaper?

Some say he came from a far away world on the other side of the Universe. But we knew better. He was someone we knew. A good friend who was somehow corrupted by power and greed. His father had become head of a large company developing weapons for use in the military. It was during an experiment to create a serum to create bullet proof skin, our friend got caught in the middle of two fusion lasers. The lasers were not calibrated right, so the bullet proof skin wasn't the only effect of the change. Any bullets shot at him were absorbed and his skin became tougher. He took over his fathers company and used the machines to create an army of robots imbedded with the bullet proof serum. He eventually took over most of the United States and moved on to conquer Europe. In Britain, we prepared for the worst. </span></div></div>",

We would not allow Bullet Man (as we called him) to get to our home in Britain. The boats were surrounding the whole of Britain. \"Activate the shield\" said Ben. A large shimmering purple dome rose up from the boats, covering all the area around Britain. Our plan was to force the Bullet Man to take the Channel Tunnel. It was easily defensible and it made flanking almost impossible. The British Defense Force was getting ready for the battle. The copper bullets had been replaced by iron. Ben had had a theory that if we could force the bullet robots to absorb iron instead of the copper that other people had been shooting at them, they would eventually corrode. Since Iron was a stronger metal than copper, the bullet serum would reject the copper in favor of the iron. It was a good theory. We stepped into a speedboat and were taken back to Britain. <br>\r\n\"Iron needs air and water to rust\" said Ben \"Dam the rivers and direct them towards the Channel Tunnel, do not release the water until the men have shot at least one bullet at each of the Bullet Men\" <br>\r\n\"We should get ready too, Ben\" I said \"We're going in too\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah\" said Jane \"We still need a strategy for the Bullet Man\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
