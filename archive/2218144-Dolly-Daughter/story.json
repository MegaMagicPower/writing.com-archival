Sitting down on the cold tile floor, you raised your hand to your head. It felt like you had a bad hangover or something. Everything was still hazy, but you tried to remember what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your name is Kara Maidenhead. You're 16, turning 17 in only a few months. Yeah, that sounds right. The last thing you remembered was your mother dropping you and your sister off at the front of the mall so she could find somewhere to park. You and your sister had shot ahead into the mall to find your friends. Claire had run off somewhere to do something, leaving you in the mall square\u2026 it was a circle, but whatever. You walked over to a somewhat secluded spot to sit down, and all the sudden you woke up like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Looking around, you attempt to get your bearings. Everything was towering over you at giant proportions. Laughing to yourself you try to sit up, thinking that you were still laying on the floor\u2026. But you were sitting up. Panicking, you shoot to your feet, which didn't change much. Looking around, you couldn't be no taller than six inches. You stumble back down into a sitting position, having a small\u2026 no, major panic attack. You sat there for about 20 minutes, trying to figure out what happened. Eventually though, you realized you needed to get up and find help. The people around you were humongous. You went to nervously pick at your necklace, but couldn't feel it. Looking down, you were naked as the day you were born. Covering up your naked self, you looked around for your presumably giant clothes, but they were nowhere insight. You stuck to the side of the wall, thinking where you could go to get help. Everything was about equal distance from where you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The cafeteria would be a good way to be seen, but being so small you might get stepped on and trampled. You were supposed to meet your friends there before you went shopping. Off to your right there was a clothing/lingerie store. You would definitely stick out there, but again being trampled would probably be the biggest problem there, unless you went into the back room where they fixed all the broken items and maybe find a scrap cloth to cover yourself with. It was Amelia's work, but she would have to push last her problems with you to help you\u2026 yeah most likely not. There was a doll store off to your left for collectable items. Probably the best place to get fitting clothes, and best place to get mistaken for one of them. Across the mall was a popular\u2026. Martial relief store. There you could get the attention of anyone in there. Though that might not be a good thing if they are into that sorta thing. And finally, you could attempt to make it outside and to your mom's car, though the risk of getting lost was very high. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After debating on it for a few minutes, you sucked it up and started to make your way carefully towards\u2026..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Born a normal girl, Kara's life is turned upside down after her mom takes her and her sister shopping at the mall the day before her sister leaves for Europe. Shrunken down to 6 inches tall and at a somewhat malleable state, she's forced to endure the wrath of unaware friends, family, and strangers as she tries to find the person who's shrunken her and return back to normal life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara Maidenhead (16) (You) Your typical highschool teenager obsessed with her grades and making friends, you quickly rose to be a shining example at your school and in your community as you've helped more than needed, wanting to make the world a brighter place. Easily one of the more popular kids in school, you could charm your way through just about anything. Not really interested in relationships or boys in general to get in the way might have helped that too; Not that you had any problems finding one, but just not interested at the moment. You share the same Blonde hair and electric blue eyes as your twin sister, which has caused a few times where they have mistaken you for one another. Made it a tad bit awkward meeting your sister's now ex boyfriend for the first time though. Even your mother has difficulty telling you two apart at times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren Maidenhead (33) (Mom) Curvy, blonde hair, and green eyes, just taller than you and your sister, and the sweetest innocent person you've ever met, your mother is a wonder woman. Giving birth to you and your twin sister at the young age of 17, your mother had a bit of rough time, but managed to get through it thanks to your dad. Starting off as a teacher for the local highschool, which is now your school, she's now your science teacher, the gym coach, and sometimes the Sex Ed teacher. Constantly on her feet, she barely ever sits down. If things weren't bad enough with the sucky pay, she loved your dad with all of her heart, and when a drunk driver took him away from her, you, and your sister a few years ago, she vowed she would never remarry, caring for you and your sister all on her own. The only reason she still teaches there is the joy she gets from teaching the youth. You don't know how she's able to do it all these years, but she still makes time for you and your sister. Though, sometimes you can see through a crack in her smile, a darker side of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire Maidenhead (16) (Sister) Claire wasn't as popular as her sister, and mostly resented her for all of the attention she got, though would enjoy it whenever someone mistook her for her sister, playing it out to see how far she could take it. She's big into theater and lives to put on a performance. Recently, she's received a scholarship to travel to Europe for 6 months on a performance arts exchange program. Combined with her \"older sister\"'s popularity, and being picked for most of the schools plays, she easily earned it. Though she loved to watch her sister squirm when she messed with her, but always acted innocent when someone questioned her, getting away with it every time. She's become best friends with your bully Amelia. She seems to be planning something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara \"Bibi\" Sinclair (16) A natural bombshell that's skinny, red head, green eyes with large breasts that happens to be one of your best friends. Not on the top of the cheerleading pyramid, but close enough. She's got the classic cheerleading personality. Not the sharpest tool in the shed, but at least she's passing. Beautiful as she is ditsy, she's usually followed around by some poor sap trying to get her attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatherine Keyes (18) (other best friend) Your Raven black haired, Hazel eye colored, llama loving, flirtatious best friend with curves in all the right places with boobs to rival Bibi's. She has dated guys and girls alike. As fiery as she seems on the outside, she's very loving and caring deep down\u2026 like deep deep down there somewhere. You two became good friends after she saved you from her younger sister. Being put into awkward situations with her isn't out of the norm either, some almost getting out of hand before you catch yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Hound (41) (Teacher) Easily one of your favorite teachers besides your mom, she's sweet until someone drives her mad. She's a little lazy, usually teaching from a sitting down position. Her and your mother sometimes hang out after school, occasionally seeing her at your house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia Keyes (17) (Bully) Mean. No other way to put it. She's constantly picking on you and pulling cruel pranks on you. It all stemming from you rejecting her at the beginning of highschool. She's even gone so far to trying to open your locker to put glue on the insides of your panties, thankfully she didn't, because that wasn't even your locker, it was your mother's. You safely keep your stuff hidden away in her office. She's somewhat nerdy, getting straight A's in almost every class. She works part time in a lingerie store, specifically the sewing section in the back to repair torn pieces<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnything goes, just try to keep it f/f<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry to write more than a descriptive paragraph on chapters, one sentence chapters will be deleted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease grammar check and make the chapters readable.
