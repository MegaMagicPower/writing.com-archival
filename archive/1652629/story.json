You played the card game when you were little older than six years old, you watched the amazing things some of the world's most famous tamers had done, and when you were old enough you even got hired to take pictures of Tamers and their Digimon for a magazine. Whether the column you got hired to is a temporary thing - a fad to be thrown away with next year's garbage - or a permanent position worries you sometimes, but you don't really care. You got your dream job, which lets you hang around just to photograph these amazing creatures. Somehow, the beauty of nature just can't compare to the beauty of what man created in the Digital World.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday has been a rather slow day, unfortunately. There have been no sightings of wild Digimon, nor have their been any particularly exciting events going on between Tamers and their Digimon, like the Tournament you were overjoyed to report on last week. You've come to the park to take pictures of the Tamers who work with their Digimon there on off days like today because, well, the only other Digimon related thing in the entire city at the moment happens to be the kids in the playground on the other side of the park playing their Digimon Card Game. Not exactly the most exciting thing to report news on, but then again what you're doing now isn't really invigorating either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you snap a picture of what looks like a young boy and a Gabumon practicing their attacks on a statue made flame-proof just for the digimon's target practice, you noticed something out of the corner of your camera lens. You thought there was something in the tree. Perhaps it was just your imagination, but it looked like a branch moved, enough for you to know it wasn't wind. You moved the camera to look at the branch, and you tried to see if there really was something there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you see?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     You DO see something in the tree! In fact, the moment you get your camera focused on where you thought the movement had come from, you see a second movement, a small blurred color mix of white and something else, and then nothing. Whatever it was just moved before you could see it. But you saw that as it disappeared, another tree jerked a bit. You focused on that one, and the movement pattern repeated itself as whatever caused the movement tried to avoid your camera lens. This repeated itself all the way through the park, until you realized what the movement was doing now - it was heading towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You took the camera off from your face to get a better look - and wonder if you should start running the hell away - when a big golden blur shot out from the tree and landed on you, causing you to fall backwards. You landed, hard I might add, on your back, with the figure on top of you, feet driving into your stomach. Thank god you'd at least been to the gym twice in the last month or you would be in some serious pain in the gut area right about now. More important than that, though, was figuring out why the figure that you now identified as a golden fox was crouching on top of you in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"...Why do you photograph us, human?\" The Digimon said, slightly puzzled and cocking its head to one side ever so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     This sentence confused you quite a bit. You had been out here to photograph and make notes of the trainers quite a few times before, but you had never even had a Digimon bat an eye at you before. They were all used to getting noticed by humans, particularly the ones that were excessively large or noticeable in a crowd. And now that you thought about it, you really couldn't remember having seen a Digimon like this one ever, even in other parts of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Not knowing what else to do, you decided to answer her question before she wondered why you were so silent. \"Well, I'm a reporter. I do a magazine column called 'The Digital Plane and Simple', so I come out here to take pictures of the Digimon and their tamers.\" You made a mental note to change the name of the column later if your superiors would let it go. Obviously they didn't think making a play on the 'Digital Plane' was as bad of an idea as you knew it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"A reporter? That's good.\" The Digimon said, smiling slightly as she stepped off your abdomen, giving you a much needed relief from the surprising weight of the Digimon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Good? What's so good about that?\" You said, wondering why she hadn't thought of you being a reporter earlier. Camera, and all that stuff after all. But more odd was why she was so happy to see a reporter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well, I'm new to this world. I wandered through a portal and found myself in your 'Real World' by mistake. I don't think its so bad, though, and you humans are rather interesting, so rather than going back I was hoping someone could show me around this city. I want to at least spend some time in human civilization before I go back - your society intrigues me.\" The Digimon said, standing there as you continued to lay on the ground. Obviously the society had yet to teach her the human manners to at least offer a hand up to the person you just tackled hard enough to break bricks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You forced yourself up off the ground anyway, noting a spot on your chest that was mildly numb and was sure to be one hell of a bruise by tomorrow. \"Well, uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     What do you say?</span></div></div>",

Well, I suppose that's for the best. Tamers and their Digimon tend to pick fights when they see Digimon like me wandering around without a Tamer.\" The golden fox said, sighing a little bit. Obviously she had had experience with the Tamers before. Not hard to believe - many Tamers were under the impression that any wild Digimon that showed up were inherently evil, and if they weren't causing trouble they were thinking about new ways to cause it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yeah, I see what you mean, Miss... actually, I don't know your name.\" You said, a little embarrassed. Even though you were a very, very new Digimon Photographer, to have come into contact with a Digimon you hadn't heard of before was a little disappointing. You had considered yourself a minor expert, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"My name is Renamon.\" Renamon said, bowing her head slightly as a gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"And my name's [...]. Glad to meet you, Renamon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"It is my pleasure to meet you, as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well, around city there's a lot of buildings, but you'd be surprised how many of them are just big corporations. Most of them don't even have anything to do with Digimon, despite the fact that this is probably the biggest destination for Tamers on the entire East Coast of America. Probably the two biggest places to visit that actually have to do with Digimon would be... the Arena, on the Eastern end of town. That's where all the big tournaments are held, and they even have smaller sparring rings for individual fights that don't attract big crowds. That's a big destination, that and the entire Northwest corner of town. That's the area of town that is the unofficial 'Digimon Square'. Most of the Tamers that actually live in the city have apartments over there, and there's even a few stores run entirely by Tamers and their partners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I see.

Wild Digimon like you aren't usually so... well, tame.\" You looked at her to see if she took offense to anything in that sentence, and thankfully she remained passive. \"In fact, usually as soon as one shows up the Tamers are all over them. Its actually kind of weird that you managed to get past all the security screens that they put up between our world and the Digital one without even causing a minor alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well, I always was good at being unnoticed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You rubbed the back of your head at that. \"Yeah... don't remind me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You both walked together in a (mostly) comfortable silence for a few more minutes, until eventually you wound up in a bustling square. Tamers and Digimon were everywhere, here a Gabumon and its trainer eating cotton candy and over there what looked like a Patamon playing in a small playground with its Tamer. The entire square was bustling with life and activity. Fortunately, with you at her side - and with the general abundance of Digimon - nobody questioned the identity of the new golden fox Digimon appearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well, this is the square. Its where most of the Tamers who don't fight with their Digimon spend their free time, and anyone who is on a break from the Arena is too. But right now they're holding an unofficial group training session, so there aren't as many Combat Tamers as there are people who just enjoy hanging around with their Digital partners. Its actually a pretty upbeat, happy place most of the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Your Digimon companion lets a smile come to her face. \"I can see that. Someone could really get used to spending their time in a place like this, with all these happy people around.\" Renamon said. You smiled back at her, happy to see that she was quickly adapting to the new world. And you had to admit, even though you were used to it it was still a pretty nice sight seeing all these people gathered together to do nothing more than have a little fun.</span></div></div>",

In it, a man and a woman were handing out plastic packages to children and teenagers closer to your age. They were all looking very happy, the people in the little store because they were earning money and everyone else simply because they were happy to be getting their package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"What is that place?\" Renamon said, obviously confused by the children and the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well, since this is your first trip to... our world,\" You said, still very uncomfortable about referring to the human world and the Real World just because Digimon were - obviously - real. \"I guess you wouldn't know about those. Those packets all have cards in them, and that's why its the most popular destination in Digimon Square. Whether you're a tamer looking for a new boost in power, or you're just a little kid who loves to play the game, its the best place to take your money.\" You said, glazing your eyes across the rest of the square and looking for something else important to name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"There's also the Digi-Daycare, where a lot of Tamers can drop off any Digimon they have if they need to go somewhere where Digimon aren't allowed. It's a pretty nice place, but it isn't very used even during busy hours, because most Digimon are capable of taking care of themselves. Only Tamers with baby Digimon or who are overly protective usually use it, so right now for example it's probably about empty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Hmph. Being coddled won't help them become any stronger. If they're going to learn to live on their own, they need to start now.\" Renamon said, a bit coldly. You had to agree a bit, sometimes, just because of how ridiculous the concept of a daycare center for beings who could quite easily destroy a human in a fair fight was, but it still struck you as a bit heartless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yeah, well... aside from that, there are quite a few stores around here who offer discounts to Tamers and their Digimon, as a service to all the good people who help keep this city safe if an evil, wild Digimon should ever invade the city. And beyond that, there are-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Before you could even finish your sentence, something strange happened. The entire city seemed to vibrate, and your ears were set on fire as a huge booming sound came through the air. Renamon put her hands to her ears at it, probably in even more pain than you because of her sensitive ears. And as soon as that booming sound disappeared an even worse sound came through, this one more like the sound of nails on a chalkboard, but quieter. The reason it was terrible wasn't because of the sound, but because of what it meant. You had enough experience to know exactly what was happening - a Digimon from the Digital World was breaking through the security fields between the two worlds, and it was doing so forcefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The first voice began to be raised as a great, red tear broke through the fabric of the world above in the sky. \"DIGIMON ATTACK!\"</span></div></div>",

Why? I thought you said that this place was full of Tamers.\" Renamon said, obviously confused as to why you, and everyone else for that matter, seemed to be acting so crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"It is, but just look around you.\" You said, gesturing across the park. All around, people were picking up their Digimon and leaving, heading for the hills with all the speed their legs could carry them with. And what was more, you noticed even those with advanced Digimon in their Rookie or Champion states rather than the younger Digimon were running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Where are they all going?! Don't they see that there's a Digimon to be battled?\" Renamon said, looking around herself with disappointment and maybe a hint of disgust at the people running away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"All the Tamers who actually fight are over at the Arena today, if I figure right. They probably just fully recovered from the latest Tournament, and they'll be training for the next one already. They'll be here in about ten minutes, but until then we need to get out of the way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Another screech broke through the air, and you suddenly realized that the Digimon was on its way in. You recognized it now, it was the head of a Greymon, and it was going to be here in about fifteen seconds. \"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"What?\" You said, looking ahead as the Greymon ripped another length of tear in the sky and fell through a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I refuse to run away. If none of these Tamers are brave enough to stand and fight, then I will instead.\" Renamon said, and then took several steps forward toward where the Greymon would land when it came through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You had to give a hand to her - even though she probably knew she didn't stand a chance, going up against a Champion Digimon when she not only had no Digivolution of her own but didn't even have a Tamer to give her the advantage - she was still willing to go all the way and stand up to the Digimon. But at the same time, you had to ask... was she nuts?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     And just what the hell were you supposed to do?!? </span></div></div>",

She was already almost at the tear, and you were still standing around like an idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You started running down the street just as the Greymon tore through what little of a barrier remained between the two worlds and fell through, landing with a huge thump that shook the ground under your feet and cracked the pavement in a huge radius around it. You nearly fell over, but managed to keep moving towards Renamon as she started to unleash attacks on the wild Greymon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Diamond Storm!\" You heard her yell, and you watched with amazement as a huge array of, what else, diamonds formed in the air and shot at the Greymon. The diamonds didn't even seem to scratch the huge Digimon, though, and the diamonds just bounced off of its huge skull plate. What the attack did manage to do, though, was get the Digimon's attention fully focused on Renamon. Definitely not a good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Nova Blast!\" You heard the Greymon roar as it fired a huge ball of fire at your new friend. She rolled to the side, though, and the attack hit the pavement a few yards behind her, actually melting the road where it hit. You were shocked at the sheer strength of it, but you weren't deterred and you continued on, making your way closer to the Greymon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As you moved closer, trying not to draw its attention toward yourself by accident, you could see that Renamon had started another wave of diamonds flying at the Greymon, this time going for its chest. The diamonds cut in a bit, but they didn't do much damage. In fact, the only reason you even realized any damage had been done was from the way that Greymon winced as the attack hit him. It was kind of confusing, looking at digital creatures with no blood to tell you when some damage had been done to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     But as the Greymon winced, you saw it lift its leg. And then, it jumped up off its good leg, then quickly came crashing down, stomping hard on the ground. Unlike before when the Greymon had simply been falling out of the portal, this time it was actually trying to force an earthquake type vibration through the ground, and you could tell the difference. The very street shook and broke in places as you were swept clean off your feet, catching yourself on a traffic sign and knocking it down. Obviously, this was a very poorly maintained street sign for you to be able to break the metal so easily; or maybe the Greymon had just weakened it with the massive shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Looking out, you almost felt your heart stop as you saw what was happening. Renamon had fallen on the ground during the shaking, and from the looks of it Greymon had knocked over a street lamp, which was now laying across Renamon's back. She was pinned to the ground, and even though she could probably get out if it, the fireball growing in Greymon's mouth meant she might not get the chance if you didn't act fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Before you even knew what you were doing, you grabbed the sign you had fallen on and ran up to the wild Digimon, letting loose a battle cry as you swung the sign as hard as you could over your head, bringing it down smack on the Greymon's tail. It let out a roar of pain, but you saw that it was still firing its attack as it did so. You yelled out as you saw the blast hit by Renamon, worried for her life. She didn't deserve this. But you saw that the blast had only hit her left arm, burning it and probably breaking the bones with the force of the attack, but at least she would be alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Unfortunately for you, the Greymon no longer seemed to care about her. Instead, it was turned toward you, and it looked pissed off. And so did the Nova Blast it had in its mouth building up slowly. \"Uh... maybe I didn't think that plan all the way through...\" You said, as you stumbled backwards, trying to get away from the digimon. You were just beginning to say your prayers, when suddenly the Greymon's mouth snapped to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You looked around to see what had caused it, and suddenly you saw a blur heading for the Greymon's mouth. It slowed down as it impacted, and you finally recognized it; it was a WereGarurumon, and it was really starting to kick the crap out of the wild Greymon. In fact, before you even knew what had happened the WereGarurumon was standing on top of the Greymon's body as it slowly faded back to the Digital Plane. Obviously, this one didn't feel like screwing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Taking advantage of the fact that there was no longer a hostile Digimon in front of you, you ran around the WereGarurumon and knelt down in front of Renamon. She didn't look to be in too bad of shape, but she seemed to have passed out from the pain in her arm and it looked pretty burnt up. You had to get her to the Digimon Hospital, which was rather inconveniently one of the few Digmon-related buildings not located IN Digimon Square. Picking her up in your arms, you began to run off towards the hospital, not bothering to look back at the WereGarurumon or anything else as you kept running.</span></div></div>",

In fact, you had to guess that most of her body mass was fur, because there was no way she should weigh this little. But you were getting sidetracked, so much so that you almost ran smack into the boy who stepped into your path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     At first you didn't pay much attention and just tried to step around him, but then his Digimon stepped into play as well, a huge ExVeemon stepping in front of you and blocking off what little of the alley you were in was left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Uh, excuse me, but I'm kind of in a hurry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"We figured. That's what we came to talk to you about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You didn't know whether the kid meant that they were going to help you get Renamon to a hospital or what, but you could tell this much - you didn't like the tone of voice he had. It sounded... dangerous. That was the best way to describe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"We saw that little incident you had back there at the plaza. Terrible stuff... and it makes me wonder, why exactly didn't you use your digivice to help out that partner of yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well...\" You said, trying to think on your feet. \"It's a little embarrassing, but... I left it at home. I'm always forgetting stuff like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"You would think that a real Tamer would never leave his home without a digivice, wouldn't you? I mean, it only seems like the smart thing to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yeah, well, I never really said I was smart...\" You said, still trying to edge around them. You didn't like where this conversation was heading, at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well, let me tell you this. You'd better get smart, real fast. Because if I didn't know any better, I'd say that was a wild Digimon in your arms right there. And you know what we do to wild Digimon, don't you? We send them right the hell back to the digital world, in a million fragments of code. Let me make this clear to you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Reaching forward, the kid grabbed ahold of your shirt. You would've loved to sock him right in the face, but your hands were occupied at the moment with a large bundle of yellow fur. \"...if I even THINK you're trying to protect a wild Digimon, I'll make sure you never give me reason to think that again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Without even expecting or waiting for a response, the kid just turned around and walked off, his own partner following him as they vanished around a corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"What a jackass...\" You said to yourself as soon as you were sure he was out of earshot. Ignoring the events that just occurred, you continued on your way to the nearest digital hospital.</span></div></div>",

They were already prepared to take in any of the injured - they were excellent about knowing the moment a digimon attack hit the city thanks to the latest scanner technology. Almost the moment you were in the door, the medical staff had picked Renamon out of your arms and taken her off to whatever room they had availible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You went to a waiting room chair and sat with your head resting on your hands. With little else to do, you found yourself thinking about how they would help her. It seemed odd - the Digimon were data, even in the real world, and that meant that there wasn't any way to heal their bodies. They must have used some kind of... code repair sequence or something. You didn't know. Wow, that was the shortest distraction for your mind ever. And now you were back to worrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     For thirty minutes - which seemed like an eternity - you sat there, worrying about her. One of the biggest problems with her injuries was that Digimon could only recover all the way if they spent weeks recovering and testing themselves, or by being bonded with a Tamer and using the Digivice's mysterious energies to heal themselves. And with a wild Digimon like Renamon, she was going to be suffering for quite awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     But at last, a doctor came out of the room. He wore a special uniform marked with the Digital World insignia on his jacket to signify his position, and to your great relief he didn't look sad or troubled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well, she didn't get too bad of an injury. Even for a Rookie level I don't think she was in any mortal danger, but you did good getting her here so fast. We've put her on a dose of pain medication just to ease the burns, but she should be awake within a half hour or so, and I can release her back to you immediately afterwards. Just link her up with the Digivice and she'll be in fighting form by tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You put on your best fake smile and nodded at him, which he returned before walking away. That wasn't going to be good. The doctors were probably used to people coming in for injuries even though the digivice could do most of the work - a lot of Tamers still hated to see their Digimon in pain for any amount of time. On the other hand, if someone you had met today happened to see that she wasn't recovered within a couple days, there were going to be suspicions. And you doubted she wanted to just sit inside until she had fully healed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Standing up with a sigh, you opened the door to her room and then prepared yourself to do some hellacious damage control.</span></div></div>",

The idea that this creature was a digimon form the digital world was quite far fetched even for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right ok, I must still be dreaming\" you say covering up again. You knew this couldn't be real and so tried to go back to sleep however Bearmon didn't seem to get the hint as it began to shake you with it's right paw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for about ten minutes till finally you sat up again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Bearmon\" you say now getting rather annoyed at the whole situation. You tell the Bear that if he really was a digimon it would mean sometime very weird happened and that would make you his tamer.

Since you don't seem to be the usual digimon tamer I think I'd like to invite you and your bear to the digital world.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow this was enough for you.

End this stupid dream now, end it now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever this was no dream and without warning you suddenly felt the bed you lay on become very light.

After all you thought this was a dream however slowly it came to you that this was no dream.

You are a villager in the Village of the Hidden leaves, working your everyday life as a street sweeper. You've never been overly happy with your life, but since you just recently turned sixteen and were able to move out of your parent's house it was still pretty decent. At least you had a roof over your head that you could call your own and you had a job that left you free to do whatever you want - at least, until the sun went down and you had to start cleaning up the village for the next day's activities. You had actually been the one to suggest the nighttime shift to the people directing all of the people who took care of Konoha's upkeep - for two reasons. Firstly, it would be damn near impossible to keep up with the messes that were created during the day with all the crowds. And secondly... you loved Konoha at night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Even though all the normal folks were sitting in their homes, resting in their beds while you moved silently through the streets, making sure it was in proper shape for the next day, there were others besides you who were awake at this hour. And these were probably the most important people in the entire village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Ninjas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You loved to watch them whenever they were passing through. The way they leaped through the air, so gracefully and yet so deadly, crossing from building to building was amazing to you. And when you had seen them in action - during a day trip to the academy, or when you watched them training with each other - their powers with Chakra were nothing short of incredible. And at night, there were no other distractions for you other than watching them move about, even your bosses never checked in on you to see if you were working because they were too busy sleeping for all their bureaucratic nonsense the next day. So what if the ninja occasionally broke a few shingles by a powerful step or misstep, you didn't care. It gave you more of a reason to climb up on the roofs while you were fixing them and realize just how intimidating the things they did were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Tonight was an unusual night. The activities of ninja had been unusually quiet - and not the quiet that meant that they were probably moving about, you just didn't hear them. It was... almost too quiet. The sound of your broom sweeping over a spill from earlier that day and gathering up the mess and dust that was starting to build on this rarely used street seemed to intrude on the sounds every moment. Feeling slightly disturbed by the city's silence, you casually placed the broom against the wall and leaned back between two buildings for a moment, allowing yourself a small break before you wrapped up the rest of the night's duties. The silence was giving you a very bad feeling for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     But, even as you thought about the silence, it was shattered. Not by any particular noise, but one simple sound, like fabric on fabric, but you knew better than this. The sound brought a smile to your face - it was the sound of one of the village's many ninja moving through the village. From the sound of it, probably moving across the ground. You had learned quite awhile ago to tell the difference between what sounds their footsteps made, it came with the months you had spent cleaning up the village by night. Turning to the side, you suddenly saw the figure. The blur, black in the dark night, went just slowly enough for you to look at it for several seconds as it passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     But, as you watched it pass, it did something none of the other dozens of soundless shadows you watched through your nights on the job did. It stopped, and from the look of the black silhouette, it was looking at you. And as it looked at you the moonlight hit it just perfectly, illuminating its eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Its white, blank eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Hm?\" You said, almost unintentionally. The figure seemed to react to this, or perhaps it was just choosing that moment to move, heading back along its way and moving on down the village road. It didn't take you very long to figure out what you had just seen - you had caught a rare glimpse, for you anyway, of the eyes of a Hyuuga. Sadly, which one it was you would probably never know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Still, the event made the night just that much less ominous and mysterious for you. Whistling softly to yourself - very softly, people were still sleeping after all - you went back to sweeping the floor, hoping to be done at least a few hours before sunrise tonight. You needed a good rest after a night like tonight.</span></div></div>",

Today was an unusually slow day, especially when you compared it to your exciting, if mostly uneventful previous night. Things around the village weren't normal, they were worse than normal .They were downright dull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You sighed and leaned your head back even farther, trying your hardest to think of something you could do. The Academy was off for a day, half of the ninja in the village were gone, and most of the other half were simply stationed around the village on guard duty, or on a short vacation. All in all, the village itself was bustling with activity... but none of it was even remotely interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     But there was one, vaguely possible option for you. You could head out to the Training Grounds, and watch the ninja at work. The grounds were technically off limits to civilians, and since you were off-duty cleaning you fit into that category for now, but plenty of people still cleaned during the day. If you took a broom with you and looked busy, there was a chance you could get away with it. Whatever you were going to do, you had plenty of time to decide, so you went to the refrigerator in your kitchen and poured yourself a cup of coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You cleared your mind as the delicious flavor vaguely tinted with cinnamon hit your tongue, deciding what your next move was to be.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     By the time you managed to arrive at the training grounds, it was almost noon. You had to stop off at your office to pick up most of your supplies - after all, just having a broom would hardly make you look busy - and then you had to circle around the training grounds until you found one that wasn't being used that day. You finally found one near the end of the training grounds, and began \"cleaning\" it, scraping up some of the leaves off of the ground while you were secretly checking around to see if anything interesting was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     At first, you thought you were completely out of luck. You looked into the zones to your north and west, but you didn't see anyone. Whether it was a stealth exercise, or whether you were simply unlucky in the field of watching amazing ninjas at work, you didn't have a clue. But as you peered into the final zone, off to your east, you spotted something. A jacket flapping in the wind, and then beyond that you saw a gathering. You couldn't make too much out of them, but you could see that there were three students standing in front of a taller person, their sensei most likely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You crept closer to that side of the fence, raking up the early autumn leaves as you did so. You finally got to a place well surrounded by trees, one which you could pretty safely watch the ninja without them really taking notice of you. At least, as long as you stayed still. After all, they wouldn't be looking for you, so it was pretty safe to say that the Genin, at least, would look over you rather than actually spotting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As the ninja began to spar with one another, you had a bit of difficulty trying to judge how the fight was going. In fact, you couldn't see enough of the battle to really even tell who the ninja were. But you did see that they were moving fast enough you wouldn't have been able to catch it anyway. You sighed, and leaned back against a tree, fanning yourself with a particularly large leaf you had found. It was hot for the time of year, and even sitting in the shade of all these trees didn't help too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     But then you heard sounds moving closer, and you peered back to see one of the ninja moving closer. You froze, instantaneously, but it seemed like she was too busy running your way to pay much attention, and you saw why. One of the ninja behind her was chasing her, and she probably was looking for a spot of ground that would be advantageous to her. But, as she moved, you finally were able to make out which Genin she was, and you were amazed. It was Hinata Hyuuga, the heiress to the Hyuuga's... throne? You didn't know what to call it, as little knowledge as you had about the ninja customs of the clans. Either way, you were impressed. And you recognized the boy behind her as none other than Inuzuka Kiba, hot in pursuit. As soon as you looked at him, though, he disappeared, leaping away into the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Hinata turned to look back at where he had been, but even she was unable to locate him. And you could just barely make out the motions she was making with her hands, then. They looked familiar somehow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     And then she turned around, and stared straight at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Instantly, you knew what must have happened. She had spotted you with her Byakugan, and must have been so surprised at seeing someone non-ninja in an adjacent training ground that she had turned to you instinctively. Probably not the smartest thing, because as soon as she turned, Kiba leaped behind her and karate chopped her across the neck, knocking her out cold on the ground. You stared in horror, knowing it was really your fault that it had happened - she had been surprised by you, that was the only reason she hadn't easily dodged or blocked that move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Kiba looked concerned as he stood over her, and you gulped in fear you hadn't realized you had as well. Whether the move was powerful enough that  it had really damaged her, or it was simply the fact that she was totally off-guard, something about the move Kiba did was more damaging than he had thought it would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Feeling terribly guilty about what just happened, you sighed and decided to return to your home. You had caused enough trouble today, no need to make it worse.</span></div></div>",

You spent the rest of the day thinking about what you had just gone through, and although you realized that it wasn't totally your fault, that didn't change anything. By the time that the clock finally reached six p.m. on your wall it felt like you had been there for an eternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Probably the biggest motivator for this guilt was some depressing news, indeed. Hinata had wound up in the hospital after her injury. It was nothing serious that would even leave a mark for too long, but because she had been totally off guard it had given her enough damage that she was sent there to ensure no complications developed while she recovered. Although it was probably just her father being overly protective for no real reason, you still felt horrible about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     So, with only about three more eternities of waiting until it was bed time, you decided to do the only thing you could think of. You confronted your guilt head on, which had brought you right to the spot where you were now standing... directly in front of Konoha Hospital, just waiting for the courage you were seeking to bubble up out of the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well... screw it all, I'm dead meat anyway.\" You said, sighing as you walked into the hospital. You knew visiting hours were over in about half an hour anyway, so there really was no time like the present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As you opened the doors, you welcomed the blast of air coming in from the hospital - it was definitely much nicer than the cool autumn air you had been standing in until just then. Your sight immediately showed you something more impressive than a heater, though, and that was the two people exiting the hospital almost at the same time you were entering. You didn't remember their names, but there was no mistaking their looks - it was Hinata's father and sister. You tried for a second to think of their names, but nothing came to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     With nothing better to do, and very glad you hadn't come in earlier while they would've still been in the room visiting Hinata, you casually walked over to the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Excuse me, miss,\" you said to the nurse behind the counter, \"where can I find Hinata Hyuuga's room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The nurse smiled at you and immediately cited it off. \"Room 124, down the hall, second on your left.\" Obviously she remembered it from telling Hinata's family where she was because she didn't even take a half a minute to remember the number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You thanked her and then proceeded to walk down the hallway, only entering the door on the left after about ten seconds of standing there, wondering exactly what the hell you were getting yourself in to. With one final sigh of resolve, you pushed open the door and walked into the room, looking at the single bed to see what Hinata was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You entered the room with an apology halfway off your lips, but as you did so you saw something even more shocking and horrifying to you than seeing Hinata get injured in the first place. Hinata was sitting on her bed, crying with her arms crossed in front of her. She must have thought she was alone, because the moment she saw you she tried to turn and hide her face away from you. Whoever had caused her this much pain... you promised yourself you would make them pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she seemed to realize who you were, because she stopped crying and wiped her eyes, trying to take a closer look at you. \"I... I know you. You're the boy who was in the Training Grounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Here it comes...\"</i> You thought to yourself. The yelling, the hating, the most likely pummeling, any of these were going to hurt you either mentally or physically. \"Look, I'm really sorry about that, I was out there to clean, and I just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-It's okay. It was my fault. I shouldn't have been so easily distracted.\" Hinata sniffed and stopped her sentence there, though she looked like she had more she wanted to say. But you weren't focusing on that, you were focusing on the fact that she seemed to think it was HER fault? What was up with that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, it was totally my fault! I shouldn't have even gone out there to clean, it was a stupid idea.\" You neglected to mention the facts that not only were you not actually cleaning but you also weren't even supposed to be on duty that day. Or ever... nobody really cleaned the training grounds. Unless they wanted to punish a new guy by making him work alone all day in an empty lot, they left them alone; ninja couldn't really dirty the place up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N...no, I shouldn't have been so easily distracted. I'm... I'm a bad ninja.\" You could almost see the tears coming out again as she said that, but she fought them back. And you thought you now had an idea about why she was crying only seconds after her family left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, um, if you ever need anything, I can't really make up for this, but, uh, I'd be glad to help. I mean, you probably wouldn't need anything from someone like me, but if you did I'd be willing to help...\" You tried to stop your tongue from tripping over itself, but somehow it didn't work that way. You could barely put a coherent sentence together for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, that means a lot to me.\" She smiled at you, but you could tell that she was almost as uncomfortable with the situation as you were. Visiting time was almost up, anyway, so that gave you a bit of an excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, even as you thought that another woman came into the room. \"Sorry sir, but visiting hours are now over. I'm going to have to take him away, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata and you both looked relieved - although somehow neither of you actually noticed it on the other's face - and you gave her one last 'goodbye' before heading off with the nurse. Your walk out of the hospital was plagued by thoughts of the accident still, but this time instead of them being guilty memories they were simply confusing. How could any of that incident have made her feel bad about herself? Maybe she tried to hold herself to a higher standard or something, but you were the one in the wrong, why should she be punished by her family? Or be punishing herself so much?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, and slowly walked out of Konoha Hospital's doors. You didn't know the answers to any of these questions, and you probably never would. Either way, it was time for you to get out of there and go about your life.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     Two days had passed since your encounter with Hinata. You were still confused as hell about the whole thing, but at least you were a little better off as to knowing why she acted the way she did. With some careful asking around the town, you had found out that she had always been naturally shy, but despite that her father put all the responsibilities of a Hyuuga clan leader on her. And when she couldn't live up to the full expectations of her father, well, that didn't make things any better for her position or her shy personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You were really mad about that, but unfortunately there wasn't actually much you could do about it. The matters of the Konoha Clans were hardly open for meddling by the public, and Hinata herself would probably not thank you for the interference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You had just wrapped up your afternoon cleaning and put away all your materials when you heard a knocking sound at the door. It was a strange knock, though, it sounded like it came from down low, and it was louder than usual. Sitting up, you raised an eyebrow at the door as though you expected it to answer your unspoken query, and then got off of the couch and walked to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     But to your further puzzlement, nobody was there. However, you did see a piece of paper sitting on the step, with a small rock on top of it holding down the paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Opening the door and grabbing the paper, you held it under the sunlight and then looked at the writing on it. It was a letter written to you, in rather informal handwriting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"You said you would help me if I needed it, so please come by the training grounds we met at in half an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You didn't understand what she would want your help for, but it was easy enough to figure out that this might be your only chance to help her out more. And you also knew the training grounds were a good half hour away if you were just walking there, so you needed to leave right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Way more questions raised than answered by the letter, you set out immediately towards the training grounds.</span></div></div>",

Man, this day was so boring, not to mention how boringly average your life was. You craved adventure, and besides, it`s not like anyone would really miss you if you left. Just then, you turned your head to the side and saw a person in a trench coat drop a brown paper bag on the ground near the fountain and continue walking. You jumped up to return the bag. \"Hey, sir you dropped your-\" you began trying to get the person`s attention, but somehow they disappeared. \"What the hell? Weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you looked back at the bag. For some strange reason, you felt compelled to open the bag. \"I know I shouldn`t, but maybe I`ll just take a peek...\" You crouched down and picked up the bag, and it felt pretty heavy. Opening the bag, you found what looked like a purple apple with a swirling pattern all over it. \"What the hell? Is this a Devil Fruit? No, it couldn`t be. I mean, Devil Fruits don`t exist, and this is probably just a prop for a L.A.R.P.`er... (Live Action Role-Play `er) But it feels so real, and this doesn`t feel or smell like it`s been painted or made by hand. Maybe...\" You decided to take a bite of it, just to see if it was real. Worse comes to worse, you hurt your teeth a bit. You open your mouth wide and surprisingly take a bite out of it, and swallowed it, but it really tasted horrible. \"Ugh! That tasted bad enough to be a Devil Fruit. But I don`t really feel any different...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a strong wind literally knocked you off your feet and sent you tumbling into the fountain. You instantly lost all your strength and began sinking, but somehow you didn`t hit the bottom. \"This fountain shouldn`t be that deep!\" you said in your mind. \"And why can`t I move?! Oh crap... my lungs...\" you exhaled the last of your breath and took in water, your mind slowly beginning to black out. \"Crap...

The last thing I remember is drowning in the park fountain after eating that disgusting apple.\" Just as you got out of your bed, a woman in a nun`s outfit came in with a bucket and what appeared to be some towels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you`re up!\" she said in a mix of shock and joy.

You know One Piece pretty well, and you know Luffy and the Straw Hats should be here in a few days. And since I sank in the fountain, I did gain a Devil Fruit power. I just don`t know what it is yet. So I need to find out what kind of power I have, and I need to make sure I`m not labeled as a member of Baroque works, cause I don`t need Zoro cutting me open like a can of tuna. Alright, so first priority after I eat is heading out to the town outskirts and trying out my powers. But maybe I should give Igarappoi a bit of a heads-up that I know who he really is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the door opened and a cute black-haired girl in a skirt and tube top came in with a plate of food and a glass of juice on a tray. \"Feeling better already I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as good as I will on a full stomach,\" you said joking a bit and you gratefully took the tray  and began wolfing down your food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Lunch, you decided to...</span></div></div>",

You turned around to see Igarappoi with an attractive looking girl with long blue hair tied back in a ponytail. \"What did you mean when you said 'Baroque'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was referring to the style of art, but I guess it has a dual meaning for those following Baroque Works, right, Mr. 8, Miss Wednesday?\" you said with a small smirk on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know that name?\" the blue-haired girl asked as she pulled out a bottle of what looked like perfume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let`s just say you two aren`t the only ones with information,\" I said getting into a defensive stance. \"And as you may know, I don`t exactly know how to fight at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then this will be easy,\" Miss Wednesday said as she sprayed the perfume, opened her button shirt, and began shaking her body from side to side. \"Miwaku no Memaii Dance!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dropped to the ground to stay low so the perfume wouldn`t affect you, and a strange feeling came from beneath your hand as it lay flat on the ground. You somehow knew what to do, and you willed the ground to rise from under your hand as you stood back up. The spot you had touched glowed as a weapon handle came out of the ground, shocking Mr. 8 and Miss Wednesday, who had stopped belly dancing out of shock. The handle continued to rise as it met your outstretched hand, and the back of the handle met your palm. You then grabbed it and pulled the rest of the weapon out of the ground, revealing the weapon as a black metal staff. \"Looks like I got a good Devil Fruit,\" you said holding the staff in a fighting stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You`re a Devil Fruit user?!\" Mr. 8 said in shock. \"Fine, then it looks like we`ll have to eliminate you for knowing about Baroque Works and add another tombstone to the Cactus Mountains.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now Igaram, I think Princess Vivi and you would rather talk things out with someone with information,\" you said, again shocking Igaram and Vivi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How... how did you know who we were?\" Vivi said looking at you in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, I`m a man with information,\" you said calmly. \"Look, I`m not here to kill you, or extort you for money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why are you here?\" Igaram asked. \"It seems a bit suspicious that you know who we are and are asking for nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I`m not asking for nothing,\" you said. \"I`m asking if I could help protect Princess Vivi. I know the kind of trouble Alabasta`s in, and I want to help in any way I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think Igaram?\" Vivi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I`ll think about it,\" Igaram responded. \"I`ll give you my answer after we deal with the pirates who recently arrived.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then I`ll be out here practicing,\" you replied. And with that, Igaram and Vivi left you alone to practice as they resumed their disguises as Mr. 8 and Miss Wednesday. \"I`ve got till midnight to at least get a good understanding of my power. The power of the Busou Busou no Mi...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>~~A few hours later~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun had set and it was clearly dark out. The full moon and stars were shining brightly that night, giving you a clear enough view of your surroundings. You were taking a break after all the practice you did with your Devil Fruit when you heard a multitude of gunshots go off. \"Looks like it`s party time,\" you said as you slapped your palm on the ground. The familiar light of transformation appeared under your hand as a copy of the Medajalibur from Kamen Rider OOO rose from the ground and you clutched in in your hand, running back into town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, quick run-down of what I can do,\" you said to yourself as you ran. \"I can make any weapon that comes to mind, and it retains the qualities of the object I made it from, and the more of something I use to make a weapon, the better and stronger it is. I can`t substitute elements though, so I can`t make bullets without an explosive, or a bow without something for a bowstring. When I tried making a sword from the air, it was harder to do and required more concentration to form the weapon, even though it was very light and cut like nothing was there. So elemental transformation is more costly, but more effective. And from what I can muster, any inanimate object I make into a weapon will stay a weapon until I will it to do otherwise, but I think I can only have about 5-6 weapons active at once, cause I tried to make six swords, and my staff disappeared. Still, I should probably lift a few weapons from the bounty hunters around here. Not like they`ll need them after Zoro`s done with `em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that kid from earlier is coming to kill us!\" one of the Baroque Works agents said drawing their attention to you. \"Shoot him!\" They all shot their guns at you simultaneously, and on instinct, you jumped above them. However, it was much higher than you would have jumped back home. A few tests earlier showed your physical strength, speed, agility, etc had somehow been multiplied!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad,\" you said landing in the middle of the crowd. \"But not good enough!\" You spun around in a circle, blade extended, and took out the small group of Agents that tried to shoot you. They all dropped to the ground and you picked up a few guns and had an idea. \"Maybe if I can make weapons out of elements, maybe I can combine weapons too.\" You grabbed about six of their flintlock pistols and a good ten dozen bullets the Agents didn`t need anymore and focused on them. Your light surrounded the guns and bullets and when the light faded, a pair of modern Magnum pistols were in their place. \"Nice, now I`m a bit more balanced.\" You also grabbed a few of their swords and made a tough drop-shaped shield with a blade on the pointed end of it. You then grabbed a two holsters and slipped your guns into them, and ran off. \"Thanks for the upgrade guys!\" Just then, you saw a very large explosion to the right of you. \"Crap! Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine`s Day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrived just in time to see Mr. 9 get blown up by one of Mr. 5`s boogers. \"Gross, but that could make good ammo,\" you said to yourself. You watched as Vivi, sans her hairband, just stood there in shock on Carue. \"Why isn`t she moving?! She could get killed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. 5 just picked his nose again and rolled up a second shot. \"Looks like she wants to die. I`ll be glad to oblige.\" He lifted his arm and pointed it at Vivi ready to fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit!!\" You yelled as you jumped in front of Vivi just as the shot was fired. You quickly lifted your shield in between you as the booger, and the booger exploded on impact with your shield. \"You know, you keep picking your nose like that, and you`ll get a nosebleed.\" you said as the smoke cleared, revealing you unharmed from behind your scuffed shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Mr. 5 said a bit shocked at your appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It`s you!\" Vivi said a bit astounded and relived on your appearance. \"What`re you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you I wanted to protect you and I meant it, Princess,\" you said still looking at the pair of Baroque Works agents. \"I`ll give you some time, so move it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you`ll...\" she said sounding concerned for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said move!!\" you yelled to her, still not looking. \"I`m a nobody and you`re a princess of a kingdom in turmoil! If I die, no one cares, but you have to survive! Now go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right...\" Vivi said as she and Carue high-tailed it out of there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be pretty brave to want to fight us,\" Mr. 5 said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that or pretty stupid!\" Miss Valentine`s day replied. \"Kyahahahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, a stupid guy wouldn`t know the identity of Mr. 0, now would he?\" you asked trying to get them to focus on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we`ll have to eliminate you,\" Mr. 5 said as he picked his nose again. \"Can`t have a nobody trying to spill our secrets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck trying,\" you said. \"Cause I already know how your Devil Fruit powers work.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh, do you now?\" Mr. 5 said as he aimed at you again. \"Nez-palm Cannon!\" You ran at the shot, blocking it with your shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you`d learn after that!\" you yelled as you swung your sword at Mr. 5. He stomped on the ground and made an explosion that knocked you back from the force, and sent Miss Valentine sky high, leaving her floating in the air from her umbrella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyahahahaha! We aren`t the novice grunts that work here!\" Miss Valentine said from above you. Then she dropped very quickly on top of you, trying to crush you with her now increased mass. You jumped back just in time to dodge Miss Valentine, but you got hit by Mr. 5`s booger, sending you flying back through a building or two and covering you in rubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA good while later, you managed to pull yourself out of the rubble with your sword and shield, and Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine were nowhere to be found. \"Damnit! They got away!? An explosion went off a few blocks away, signaling where Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine`s Day were. \"Looks like I`m about to play Track Runner. I hope this works...\" You slipped the shield and sword onto your back like Link from the Legend of Zelda, and placed your hands on your hips, over the holsters where your Magnums were sitting and they began to glow. The light moved from your holsters down to your feet, and when the light faded, you were now wearing a pair of metal-lined boots with the pistol chamber and clips hanging out the back. \"Time for a test run...\" You moved into a sprint starting position and then a small clicking noise was heard. \"Magnum Step!\" you yelled as your hands left the ground and you took the first step. As soon as your foot hit the ground, a bullet shot off, increasing the lift you got off the ground from your step, and shooting you across the area and onto a rooftop. \"Better than I hoped!\" You said as you landed on the roof and sped across the rooftops to catch up to Vivi, each step using up a bullet. \"Please let me make it in time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made it just close enough to see Miss Monday get crushed by Miss Valentine, and get off her.\"Kyahahaha,\" Ms. Valentine cackled as she stood up . \"Do you really still think you can escape from us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have a chance of getting out of here in one piece,\" said Mr. 5.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Vivi bit her lip in frustration, probably because of the sacrifices her friends Mr. 9 and Miss Monday had made. \"I will survive, I will escape!\" she vowed. \"I will make it back home to Alabasta Kingdom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh-hah,\" Mr. 5 chuckled as he stuck his finger up his nose and pulled out another piece of nose gold, aiming it at Vivi. \"TAKE THIS! NEZ-PALM\u2026 CANNON!\" Mr. 5 flicked the booger at Vivi who stood there in shock not knowing what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou used both barrels of your boots at the same time, sending you flying in front of Vivi as you pulled out your shield in mid-flight. You saw Zoro get in front of Vivi and you got in front of him, blocking the explosion with your shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You survived?!\" Mr. 5 said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don`t have time for this!\" Vivi yelled at Zoro as she lunged to attack him. \"Don`t you ever give up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vivi, hold it!\" you yelled, pausing her attack. \"He just tried to defend you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the cover,\" Zoro said as he looked at you and then to Vivi. \"And I`m under orders to rescue you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rescue?\" Vivi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then get with the rescuing and get her out of here!\" you yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're the swordsman who beat up all the lowly employees who were stationed out here,\" Ms. Valentine realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you want to protect the Princess of Alabasta?\" Mr. 5 inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm under orders,\" Zoro admitted completely honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good reason,\" Mr. 5 remarked, \"but one way or another, we're gonna have to eliminate you because you're in in the way of our orders You too, shield boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyahaha!\" Ms. Valentine laughed, \"Aw, what a shame!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh-hah,\" Mr. 5 chuckled as he once again stuck his finger up his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, this is getting tiresome,\" you said as you sheathed your sword and shield again. \"I`m just gonna shoot you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyahahaha! With what?\" Miss Valentine asked. as your hands moved to your sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour boots glowed with light again and your Magnums re-formed in your hands, shocking everyone but Vivi. \"With these puppies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You`re a Devil Fruit user!\" Miss Valentine realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Captain Obvious,\" you said as your grip tightened on the triggers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I FOUND YOU!\" came a loud shout. We all turned to see Luffy in his straw hat and with a very plump, ball-like torso. Zoro grinned at the sight of his captain. \"ZOOOROOO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it now?\" Ms. Valentine wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luffy!\" Zoro called out. \"Thanks for coming, but I've got this one. Or did those greedy jerks drag you into this too?\" Zoro got a better look at Luffy and realized that he was seething with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU ARE GONNA PAY FOR WHAT YOU DID!\" Luffy hollered at Zoro. \"I'LL KILL YOU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\" Zoro exclaimed, obviously clueless about what Luffy was angry about. \"WHAT KIND OF NONSENSE HAVE YOU GOTTEN INTO YOUR HEAD THIS TIME?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP AND GET READY!\" Luffy snapped. \"I'M GONNA KICK YOUR UNGRATEFUL LITTLE ASS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ungrateful?\" Zoro repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone here was nothing but nice to us!\" Luffy yelled. \"They welcomed us and threw us a party! THEY GAVE US FOOD! AND YOU REPAID THEM BY CUTTING THEM ALL UP WITH THOSE SWORDS OF YOURS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\u2026 yeah\u2026\" Zoro admitted. \"But\u2026 there's something you don't know\u2026\" Luffy obviously didn`t know about the bounty hunter scheme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JUST SHUT UP AND FIGHT ME!\" Luffy shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This guy's just a complete idiot\u2026\" Princess Vivi realized as she sat on her duck and stared in disbelief. Carue who was rather dim himself, nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don`t know the half of it,\" you said laughing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now they're fighting amongst themselves,\" Mr. 5 commented as he stood in between the bickering pirates. \"How pathetic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyahahaha!\" Ms. Valentine laughed. \"Maybe if we wait long enough they'll just kill each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh\u2026 hold on Luffy,\" Zoro called out as Luffy waddled closer, \"could you just listen to me for a second? They were actually\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy leapt up into the air and flew over the two Baroque Works Agents and launched himself at Zoro, \"NO EXCUSES!\" Vivi, Carue, and You just sat there as you all watched the two of them fight for a few minutes, until Zoro landed near the three of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I`ll guard Vivi and you take care of your friend, uh Zoro was it?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that`s fine,\" Zoro said resuming the fight. They continued on for w few more minutes, knocking out Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine in the process, before they were both quelled by an orange-haired girl punching them both out of anger. Enter Nami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ENOUGH!!\" she yelled. \"What the heck do you think you're doing?\" Nami demanded as she glared at Luffy and Zoro. \"It's lucky for you that that guy was there to keep the girl safe! You almost lost us a billion berries!\" Nami pulled the two of them up by their collars, \"YOU UNDERSTAND?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Princess Vivi asked. \"What berries? Why are you helping me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Igaram just hired you an impromptu guard force, and with her, I`d be scared of them,\" you said making a small joke to help ease the tension. The orange-haired girl just glared at you for a minute before she had a confused look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Nami asked. \"Aren`t you with those guys trying to kill her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I think a few introductions and confusion-clearing explanations are in order,\" you said calmly as you watched Zoro and Luffy acting like two fighting little kids. \"Starting with the guy in the Straw Hat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock it off!!' Nami yelled as she clubbed Zoro and Luffy over their heads.</span></div></div>",

Just imagine your name in place of [Hero].****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHISHISHISHI!\" Luffy laughed once the situation had been explained to him while Nami was explaining things to Vivi while you sat a short distance between the two conversations.\"Oh! Why didn't you just say so Zoro? I thought you got mad and beat everyone up because they didn't have a dish you wanted!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT'S SOMETHING YOU WOULD DO!\" Zoro snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shishishishi! What a funny mix up!\" Luffy exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, it kind of is,\" you said chuckling a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU GUYS, SHUT UP!\" Nami yelled. Then she turned back to Princess Vivi. \"There it is, in exchange for taking you home, I'd like one billion berries. You saw how strong these two guys are. I've got two more. If you ask me, it isn't a bad deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hold on a minute,\" you said gaining a bit of attention. \"I`m certain that right now, Vivi doesn`t have nearly that much money on her, nor does the royal treasury of Alabasta at the moment. Besides, I`m going to be protecting her for free, so don`t you think there`s strength in numbers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That aside, [Hero]-kun is right, I can't,\" Princess Vivi replied. \"Although I appreciate the help you've given me so far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" asked Nami. \"Aren't you a Princess? Aren't you rich?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know anything about Alabasta Kingdom?\" you inquired of Nami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never heard of it [Hero],\" Nami admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then Vivi can explain things to you while I go get my things and stock up for later,\" you said making your gun boots, causing Luffy to go starry-eyed and Nami to get shocked a bit. \"I`ll be back faster than you can say Alabasta!\" You bolted off back to the house you were staying at and made it back in a few minutes. There was a backpack lying on the floor, and it was fairly large in size and had several pockets. \"Perfect.\" You grabbed the bag and loaded it up with your original clothes as well as a few spare outfits from the dresser drawers. \"But if I`m going to be going with them, I`ll need more ammo and some more weapons to get creative with later. Might as well raid the Baroque Works storage.\" You then bolted off to what you thought was the weapons storage and you found a cannon or two, tons of ammo, and plenty of swords and a few other types of weapons as well. \"Man, how am I gonna carry this all? I guess I`ll take what I can hold.\" You managed to gather up a good deal of ammo and a few standard weapons, but the weight almost made it hard to walk. \"Let`s hope my Magnum Boots can take this.\" You bolted off and in your run, you managed to see Igaram, now dressed up like Vivi and carrying three dolls. \"Oi, Igaram!\" You jumped down to meet him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It`s you,\" Igaram replied. \"I see you`ve packed a lot for the journey ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" you replied. \"I`m going to need material for creativity if I`m going to protect Vivi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You`re going with her?\" Igaram asked. \"But I already...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" you replied. \"But I still want to protect her. I told you that already, and my name is  [Hero].\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I think I have my answer to your offer, [Hero]-kun,\" Igaram replied. \"Please, go with the pirates and protect Princess Vivi. I know they`re strong, but I`d feel much better knowing a man like you is along with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" you replied sheepishly. \"I think we`ll need all the help we can get if we`re gonna stop Crocodile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you know of Mr. 0`s identity?!\" Igaram said shocked. \"You must be well-informed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I`ve been told,\" you said as you held out your hand to Igaram. \"Let`s shake on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Igaram said setting down one of the dummies and taking your extended hand and shaking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear that I will protect Princess Vivi with my life,\" you said in confidence. \"Igaram, that promise will be kept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" he replied. \"I`m sorry I didn`t get a chance to mention this earlier, but it was Vivi who rescued you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then that`s all the more reason for me to protect her,\" you said calmly. \"Let`s get back to the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe made our way back near the others when we saw Nami storming back over to Luffy, Zoro, and Princess Vivi. \"NOW THERE'S NOWHERE LEFT TO RUN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry,\" Princess Vivi apologized again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll get over it,\" Luffy assured her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where was she planning on going anyway?\" Zoro wondered. \"Looks like the three of us are going to be sitting right at the top of Baroque Works' hit list.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shishishishi!\" Luffy laughed. \"That sounds awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um\u2026 I have five hundred thousand berries saved up\u2026\" Princess Vivi offered Nami who was sitting in the corner being emo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don`t worry about it Vivi,\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have nothing to fear!\" Igaram said, finally drawing their attention to the two of you, Nami, Zoro, and Vivi being a bit shocked at your backpack, but more shocked at Igaram in drag. \"Ma~ Ma~ Ma~! It's going to be alright Princess,\" Igaram told Princess Vivi. \"I've come up with a plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Igaram, why are you dressed like that?\" asked Princess Vivi as she and Luffy got up and approached him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow us to introduce you to your decoys,\" you continued as Igaram held up three simple dolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! That's a funny outfit, mister!\" Luffy commented as he poked one of the dummies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're all insane,\" Nami muttered, who was still being emo in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess Vivi, please listen to me carefully,\" Igaram requested. \"Once Baroque Works' intelligence network learns what happened here, agents will be sent after you immediately. They're aware that you know the Boss' identity\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and knowing them, they'll send a thousand of them,\" Princess Vivi reasoned, causing Nami to flinch in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now here's my plan,\" Igaram continued, \"Disguised like this I will pretend to be you. I'll take the three dummies on board with me and I will sail a straight course to Alabasta.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So these things are us?\" questioned Luffy as he stared at the dummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While Baroque Works is busy chasing after me, the rest of you will take Princess Vivi and head to Alabasta Kingdom following a less direct route,\" Igaram told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on!\" Nami objected, she finally stopped being emo and rejoined the conversation. \"Who said we were gonna take her with us? We still haven't discussed the matter of payment.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An entire kingdom is in turmoil and ready to tear itself apart in civil war, and you`re worrying about MONEY?!!\" you yelled at Nami. \"That makes you sound heartless!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Payment for what? Take her where?\" questioned Luffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promised Igaram that I`d protect Vivi, and since she`s going with you guys, I`m going too,\" you explained to Luffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on! We never said anything about taking you along!\" Nami said yelling back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is that what all this yelling's about?\" asked Luffy. \"Sure, we'll take her, and the cool gun guy too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CROCODILE MAY ALREADY BE AFTER US!\" Nami yelled. \"AND WE DON`T NEED ANY FREELOADERS!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this Crocodile really that dangerous?\" Luffy inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea,\" you explained. \"That makes him a legally recognized pirate\u2026 I've heard that he's been based in Alabasta for the last three years and is seen as some kind of hero. When he was a pirate he had a bounty of eighty one million berries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EIGHTY-ONE MILLION!\" Nami screamed, \"THAT'S OVER FOUR TIMES WHAT ARLONG'S BOUNTY WAS! TURN IT DOWN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you do this for us?\" Igaram requested of Luffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Luffy agreed. \"It sounds like it'll be fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami palmed her face and looked depressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He`s always like this, isn`t he?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea, [Hero]...\" Nami replied a bit disheartened.</span></div></div>",

Okay!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the story<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look up at this school...Yokai Gakuen, a school for monsters. I'm here, not for learning, but I have heard a rumor that a human is here and I want to find out myself. \" Well time to start looking, ooo a ramen stand!\" I get sidetracked and run over to the stand to get some ramen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n30 minutes later.<br>\r\nI pat my stomach. \" Ah, that was good,\" I say and look up at the huge stack of bowls, there's about 25 bowls. I grab my wallet out of my pocket to get money, but I notice I don't have any. \" Shit,\" I mumble to myself. \" I need to get out of here quick,\" I whisper to myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look up and see that the waitress has her back turn so I run out of there as fast as I can without her noticing. I remember what I was doing before I saw the ramen stand and run into the school. After sneaking past teachers, I find the room that the human is in. I open the door and look around until I see his desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hello, who might you be?\" I hear to my right. 'Shit I forgot there's a teacher in here,' I think to myself. I think, slightly smirk, and turn in her direction. \" Hello my name is Suna and I'm a new student. They told me that this is my homeroom,\" I tell the teacher. I look up and see her look at him confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Weird I didn't hear anything about getting a new student, but oh well. Hm your seat will be next to Tsukune-kun,\" she told me and I smirk realizing that that is the rumored human. I walk over to the desk and sit down. As the teacher started talking, I leaned over to Tsukune. \" Hello, I know you are a human,\" that was a slight lie because I wasn't positive if he really was one, but I saw his eyes widen. ' So it is true, I'm going to have a fun time here,' I think.</span></div></div>",

You could tell anyone what level a Dragonite learns dragon rage as well as the fact that Doduo and Dodrio can fly by rapidly moving their legs in a circular motion. One could say your a pokemon master! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept your not. Your living your life as you are happy or sad your living it in the world with the rest of us. However whatever you feel about your life in this world was soon going to not matter. For one winter morning when you were just walking heading to wherever you were going. A car loses control on the road and even before you have a chance to see the car, it hits you from behind sending you across it's bonnet like a rag doll.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know what happened next because all you could see was darkness. Were you dead? You hoped not. Maybe you had be thrown into a dark ditch by the force of the car? Hmm....The questions kept coming however deep down you felt perhaps you had died. You didn't know if you were ready to accept this fact when suddenly a glimmer of light shined in the darkness you saw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt warm and then you began to feel something soft under you hands. You didn't know what it was but you found the strength to open your eyes to see a bright blue cloud free sky with a gentle warm yellow sun above you. It made you feel warm and relaxed and this in return, gave you the strength to move your head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around you to see you were laying in a patch of tall thick bladed green grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where, where am I?\" You thought still laying there. You had no idea but it did past you mind that maybe this was. No that's silly after all this place seemed almost to real like it was another world. Wanting to know more you managed to get to you feet. You wobble a bit as you stand but soon recover to see a very f familiar location to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it can't be?\" You say amazed. From where you stood you could see a dirt road, a small building and another large building with a metal ramp you couldn't believe it but you were on Route 7 from the Pok\u00e9mon games! This route was the route that lead to Celadon City as well as Saffron City. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow!\" you couldn't believe where you were, but then it struck you. Knowing some much about Pok\u00e9mon you knew that this tall grass was not just simple just  a patch of grass, no this was home to..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wild Pok\u00e9mon\" you screamed as from it came a wild Growlithe growling. Whether  you were a fan of this Pok\u00e9mon or not, you knew that it was classed as a Puppy Pok\u00e9mon measuring about 2'04 in height and 41.9lbs you didn't forget that this Pok\u00e9mon was also a fire type meaning it could spit fire at you as well as give you a nasty bite with its sharp teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nice puppy, nice Growlithe.\" you say trying to calm it. You knew you had no way to fight this Pok\u00e9mon without Pok\u00e9mon of your own so you decide to try and back away. However the Grothlithe wouldn't calm and lunged at you with its mouth open. Your only choice is to drive away to avoid being bitten but where? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould you jump further into the tall grass Or do you dive onto the dirt path of Route 7? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

But if you were a trainer, you would hope people would be kind enough to pick up your lost pokeball and return it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite the choice for you to make.

It seemed strange that a Pok\u00e9mon knew what you were going to do but then with some many Pok\u00e9mon trainers perhaps this Growlithe had gotten used to battling. Either way with the pokeball in your dominate hand you threw it out. The ball hit the ground and suddenly It opened. A bright white light emitted from the ball and finally emerging form the light came rather sad looking gloom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy\" you muttered. If there was any Pok\u00e9mon it could have been. Gloom was a nice Pok\u00e9mon and all but against a fire type Pok\u00e9mon it was going to be rough. Still what choice did you have? You needed to fight and so with that you shouted \"Gloom use.....\" It the hit you had no idea what this gloom knew as moves.

It was then the plant Pok\u00e9mon looked at you with its big sad eyes. Perhaps it sensed how you felt or maybe it heard how desperate you were but for whatever reason Gloom then turn away from you to face Growlithe before releasing  it sleeping spores all over the Growlithe with a call of \"Gloooomm. The dog Pok\u00e9mon began to wobble as the attack hit, you first went left ten right then with a final yawn it feel to sleep.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes\" you cheered happy, you couldn't believe it but you had managed to save yourself from what looked to be your end. Of-course you had Gloom to thank as well. You knelt down to it and with a smile you thanked the Pok\u00e9mon to which the gloom replied with a sad Gloom. You guessed it was still sad because it was lost after all you did find its pokeball in the grass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Gloom\" you say with a smile as to reassure the Pok\u00e9mon. \"I'll try to find your trainer though it might be a challenge.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA challenge it would be indeed for this Gloom didn't have anything on it that you could trace their trainer back too. Yet perhaps lady luck was on your side. For as you begin to think about which way  the gloom trainer might have gone. A young women with long brown hair, blue eyes, pink skin and wearing what looked to be gardening gear came running out onto the route from the entrance to celadon city saying \"Oh my, oh my where could he be?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was she looked to see you and gloom standing  together near the sleeping Growlithe. She instantly rushed over and began to accuse you of stealing her Gloom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no please I didn't steal your Gloom I found it's pokeball in the tall grass and well we got into a fight and..\" you were stopped when gloom stood in front of you. It started to speaking in it Pok\u00e9mon way  almost as if it was trying to tell the young women something.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gloom are you saying he didn't steal you?\" the young women asked her gloom, who nodded. Realising her mistake the young women apologies for the her presumption and thanks you for find her gloom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If there's anything way I can repay you please don't hesitate to say\" she said. Now you knew you should say you don't need anything but being stuck in the Pok\u00e9mon world with nothing but yourself you ask the women if perhaps she could help you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to explain what happened to you and you swear she thought your were crazy but when you had finished she was quite happy to help.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well after you help Gloom I can't say no. But I think you may want to speak to the gym leader of this city Erika, She very kind and might have a place at her gym for you to stay until you can figure out you problem.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were grateful and what came more as a surprise was when the women offered you a pokeball. She wanted to know if you wanted to capture the Growlithe you had just battle after all you and gloom had worked so hard to battle it plus having a Pok\u00e9mon might help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold the pokeball in you dominant hand and look back at the  sleeping Growlithe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you capture it or do you leave it alone?</span></div></div>",

However as you held the fist size pokeball in your dominant hand you suddenly felt a rush of excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew who you felt like and with that you pulled your arm back and with some force, you threw the ball at the sleeping Growlithe. The ball bump the pokemon on the head causing it to wake before opening. You watched in amazement as a white light from the pokeball made Growlithe disappeared into the ball before it closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pokeball then fell to the floor before starting to shake. It shook once, twice and then finally after a third time, it stopped still like a statue. At this you cheered and ran over to the pokeball. You couldn't believe it you had caught a pokemon for real. Picking up the ball you the face the women and her gloom, both looked very happy for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now that's over. How about we head to the pokemon centre.\" the women said to you kindly. \"I'm sure Growlithe could do with a check up from Nurse Joy and I think we both could do with a sit down.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou agree and with that she leads you into celadon city. It was just like in the game as soon as you entered the pokemon centre was on your left while in front of you a huge path with buildings across the sides. You felt almost like a doll in the playhouse with how tall the building were it was quite the sight. Still with a gentle nudge form the women who's gloom you saved you came to your senses.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This way\" she said entering the  open pokemon centre door. You follow inside to find that the pokemon centre too shared it looks with the game. However unlike the game there were lots of trainer resting with their pokemon. You follow behind the women until she stops at the front desk where not to your surpise stands Nurse joy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Lisa I see you found your Gloom.\" Nurse joy said with a smile. It turned out this was the women's name who's Gloom your rescued. Lisa nod before explain to Nurse joy that you were the one who found Gloom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's nice to see trainers helping each other, now what I can do for you both today?\" Nurse joy asked polity.

If you just give me their pokeballs I will examine them while you wait. You and Lisa thanked Nurse Joy before finding a spot to wait on one of the centres cream sofas. You sat next to Lisa and at once she began to ask you question about where you came from and what was it like. You felt this was quite sudden but then you thought that if someone dropped into your world from another you'd want to know too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end however you tell her....  </span></div></div>",

A car loses control on the road and even before you have a chance to see the car, it hits you from behind sending you across it's bonnet like a rag doll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You don't know what happened next because all you could see was darkness. Were you dead? You hoped not. Maybe you had be thrown into a dark ditch by the force of the car? Hmm....The questions kept coming however deep down you felt perhaps you had died. You didn't know if you were ready to accept this fact when suddenly a glimmer of light shined in the darkness you saw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n It felt warm and then you began to feel something soft under you hands. You didn't know what it was but you found the strength to open your eyes to see a bright blue cloud free sky with a gentle warm yellow sun above you. It made you feel warm and relaxed and this in return, gave you the strength to move your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You look around you to see you were laying in a patch of tall thick bladed green grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Where, where am I?\" You thought still laying there.

Whether you were a fan of this Pok\u00e9mon or not, you knew this Pok\u00e9mon was a fire type meaning it could spit fire at you as well as give you a nasty bite with its sharp teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh nice puppy, nice Growlithe.\" you say trying to calm it. You knew you had no way to fight this Pok\u00e9mon without Pok\u00e9mon of your own so you decide to try and back away. However the Grothlithe wouldn't calm and lunged at you with its mouth open. Your only choice is to drive away to avoid being bitten but where? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Should you jump further into the tall grass Or do you dive onto the dirt path of Route 7? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It looked like real trouble for you with no way out, you were stuck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't make a dash for it because one of these Pok\u00e9mon would catch you and you really didn't want to have to deal with the jaws of either Growlithe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, oh.\" You were trying to think a way out of this situation but nothing was coming to mind.

They both noticed you and with that the young man order his Gliscor to attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flying scorpion type Pok\u00e9mon nodded and pushing off  the ground with it's tail it took flight before coming in. You were impressed but a little more concerted about the Growlithie's now closing in on you. But your savours had it covered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now screech\"  the young man calls to his Gliscor. The flying scorpion Pok\u00e9mon with that lets out a terrible ear bending screech that cause you and your saviours to cover your ears. The noise was that loud and high pitched that the Growlithes could not stand the noise and quick fled to get away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been save and were quickly asked by the station master and young man if you were alright? You nod thanking them for their help before the master asks you why you were in tall grass if you didn't have a Pok\u00e9mon to defend yourself with?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you had two thoughts here, one you could tell them your not from this world that's why you have no Pok\u00e9mon?

Though you admit you didn't really want to take an attack just to make the Pok\u00e9mon happy. Still with that as a passing thought you notice the Growlithe begin to open it's mouths, you only had a second to react before small shots of fire came from the pokemon mouth causing you to dodge them. However your dodging looked more like dancing as you jumped and lifted your legs and arms as the shots came at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew you couldn't do this forever and it seemed the shots were getting less and less.

I got to land ashore somewhere!\", Karen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waves forced Karen to land to the nearby island of Shamouti where a trio of smaller islands around it was the epicenter of something you would take part in whether you realized it then or not. You safely landed ashore with minimal difficulty but you were stranded on an island you've never been to. You touched down on the sand and looked at the shore and landscape. \"Is this place deserted? There's nobody here.\", you said. You were about to eat those words when as soon as you took a double take a bunch of natives in ceremonial bird costumes surrounded you.

In your hands o chosen one.

So my little sister is playing for me now. Wonder where she is?\", Carol said looking for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm right here!\", her sister called out, \"The only one not wearing any stupid outfit.\" She wore a casual outfit sporting sunglasses and a bag around her shoulder. She cracked her neck coming off as tomboyish. Soon as you saw her it wasn't love at first sight, though she wasn't hard on the eyes in fact quite the opposite. But you thought of her as an average girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's our tradition you should be proud to be a part of it.\", Carol argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry I'll play my part in the big legend.

Melody eyed you for a moment and dropped down to see you first hand for a closer look. She inspected you and took off her shades revealing her beautiful eyes. \"So your the chosen one huh?

Though it was dark, Shamouti Island was alive with excitement. A band was playing tropical island music while dancers danced around tikis or taking part in the parade. Gyarados puppets were flying and fireworks lit up the sky. The tourists were loving it and everyone was having a splendid time. The banquet hall was large and spacious and very open. It had lots of tables and had an architectural design to it. There was also a buffet and a stage. As you ate your food, you couldn't help but wonder what your part in the ceremony would be.

You starred at her in awe of her beauty as she continued playing her song. Your smile grew the more you watched and you felt the feeling you had earlier on the beach when she kissed you.

The waves rocked the boat and no matter how hard she tried she couldn't steer the boat steadily. Then you were caught over a huge wave sending you flying over a rock formation. The ship's rudder broke off leaving you guys helpless at the oceans mercy. \"We lost the rudder!\", Karen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I now immediately regret leaving the party.\", you replied. You clung to the boat for dear life and prayed you would at least make it to shore, luckily the rapids were taking you right on to the island but the boat was right under a huge wave and threw the entire boat right on the rocky shore. The boat crashed leaving you both stranded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least we made it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess we wait until the storm clears. But while were here I'm going up to get that treasure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) wait the storm.\", she warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax I'll come right back as soon as soon as I have it. Safer here than a mountain top. I'll only be a few minutes, If I'm not back in a while...just wait longer.\", you shrugged. You saw a staircase leading up the mountain and figured that's where you needed to go in order to take the treasure. You quickly ran up it wanting to get back inside the boat where it would be safe until someone rescued you guys after the storm cleared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Melody rode through the storm in her sisters boat and was bypassing all the storm threw at her. Her skills with a speedboat were most impressive and she handled herself fine. Soon she made it on to fire island but her boat too crashed but she was fine despite the rough landing. Karen went to see what was up but saw Melody out by the bay. \"What are you doing here Melody?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming to check on you guys and bring you back, except now I think I'm along for the ride. Where's (Name)?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up there, he said he'd be back down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time for waiting I'm going up there.\", Melody said ditching her boat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait he said-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not waiting, the storm could kick up any minute and I won't leave him behind.\", said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached to the top of the mountain where there was this small shrine located in the center of the mountain. You quickly went inside and saw a red sphere lodged in a statue. You grabbed the treasure pulling it out with some effort. Just as it was released and you took time to fully look at it the treasure glowed for some strange reason. You just assumed that was what it does when anyone takes it and placed it in your pocket. You started heading back down but then just as you were about to, suddenly....</span></div></div>",

You didn't know who it was at first, but after waiting for the person to come closer you recognized her immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Melody?!? What are you doing here?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody: I came to get you stupid! Hope you're happy Mr. hero because if you had just stayed at the party like I told you, we wouldn't be stranded out here on this island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you had a chance to explain yourself, thunder roared and lightning flashed. Melody yelped in surprise and instinctively clung to you. You were surprised by Melody's sudden reaction and a little freaked about the thunder yourself, but you kept your cool. You two had to find shelter in case that you two would be struck by the lightning. It was too far to get to Karen's boat, so you had no chance, but to take shelter at the next best thing. The shrine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Come on Melody. This storm's getting more insane. We better take shelter in the shrine. And um.....by the way, you can let me go you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that she was clinging to you like a lover, Melody blushed bright pink and backed away hastily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody: Dah! Yeah....right....sorry.....let's get into the shrine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Um...yeah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you two made your way into the shrine It may have been small, but it was enough to protect you two in the rain. You both sat on the floor and listened to the thunder in silence. You're heart was beating from Melody clinging to you when she heard the thunder. Not to mention your face was also a little pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: What the heck was that about? My heart's still beating like a jackhammer. But why? It's not like I like her or anything. Do I?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Melody and coincidentally Melody looked at you. When you both saw each other you both looked away in embarrassment. Then you both ended up talking at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody and (name): S-sorry. No....wait....Let me.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I'm sorry you first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody: No you talked before I did. You go ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Man....this is getting nowhere fast. I gotta lift up the mood, but how do I do that? What do I say? Should I say something or let Melody says something first?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou.....</span></div></div>",

All the guys back home do it all the time and it's annoying. Matter of fact everything annoys me back home. The traditions, the scenery, and the old fashioned way of...everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't be all bad. You staying in one place all the time, having people you know there, and just relegated to having pokemon culture jammed in your face at least ounce a year.\", you commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got some sort of problem against them?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I don't hate them, it's just that everyone I know aspires to be a pokemon master or trainer and it's like that everywhere I turn. The cities, the small towns, even the quietest spots are all filled to the brink with them it's maddening. Short time I've been around here, not a single one. At least over by Shamouti.\", you admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm I can relate to not easily fitting in with the flow.\", she giggled a bit at how similar you were to her. It got more windy so she sat closer to you making you blush a bit more than previously. \"Tell me, how did you find your way here?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My home town was populated with pokemon. But one day I noticed something, I stopped and thought to myself is there anywhere that they don't have such a giant influence on people? So when I was old enough to travel, I left my home and just wandered around getting away from it all. Get out on my own find a secluded spot from them at least to a degree where not every single person's mission in life doesn't have anything to do with them. Never found it. But for the places I've been to, this has to be the closest thing to it. What's it like living there?\", you asked wondering why she doesn't appreciate the things you want more than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's boring out here. Mostly everyone works, and lives pretty mundane lives. You get to see so many new things I'm jealous to be honest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be, it may be new at first but it is stale and it will get old very fast. It's the simpler things in life I appreciate more. They seem small but they don't FEEL small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm hmm same code I live by. Only for different reasons. I just want to see everyone just get with the times. It's not all ancient fire circles that determine who you'll be or mystic writings that tell the future. Things are more complex and they're falling behind. Or...maybe I am. Maybe I'm moving too fast and can't slow down to understand why they appreciate such an old tradition?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, if it means anything your not wrong, things change and it will come to them sooner or later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know your a good friend.\", Melody said blushing as she finished her sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh thanks your a good friend too hehe.\", you blushed too. You two both seemed to read a certain vibe that you two liked one another. Melody herself began to notice she liked you a lot but was too prideful to admit it. You knew you liked her but her blushing gave you a hint she liked you back. And you were both awkward by your close proximity just a minute ago. It was becoming clear to you she liked you but now wasn't the time to discuss that. You felt the winds stopping and it looked better to make it to Karen's boat now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like the storms cleared a bit, let's get back to the boat.\", Melody said wanting to get warm and trying her best avoid you finding out about her growing crush on you.</span></div></div>",

Then a giant ferocious bird of yellow squawked through the air and flew across and perched on top of the shrine itself. Melody was shocked and confused as they were on fire island yet the bird of lightning was here right on the bird of fire's own territory. \"This isn't right.\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What's wrong?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bird of fire, Moltres is supposed to be here yet Zaptos is right in front of us.\", she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that means something must be disturbing the harmony. We couldn't have upset the balance the ceremony only just begun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zaptos shot out lightning from it's long and mighty wings intimidating you to leave or just show it's superior strength. As it shout a bolt you and Melody staggered back about to make your leave but then something attracted all of the electricity from Zaptos and from above the clouds came a sky fortress draining Zaptos' power. Zaptos flew up and attacked the vessel but then on the bottom hull it shot out rings the were meant to capture the beast. In the chaos and confusion Zaptos flew right over you two making one of the rings activate and capture you two, it took you to the hull of the fortress. Zaptos continued to fight but drained of it's power the trap worked and captured Zaptos bringing it along after you and Melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was just as simple as with Moltres. Now only the third one remains and then the real prize awaits.\", said the man piloting the fortress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alert: While capturing Zaptos we brought something more.\", said the computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in a cage with you and Melody trapped together seeing Moltres and Zaptos caged by those rings devices, Melody glanced over to a stone carving. \"Huh what's this? Disturb not the harmony of fire, ice, and lightning?\", before she could finish the center pillar of the room lowered revealing the pilot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is a pleasure though an unexpected one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\", you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Lawrence III, and I am a mere collector. As you can see my latest set is nearly complete, Articuno is but the last one.\", he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You kidnapped Moltres? Then the storm was a result of your doing wasn't it?\", Melody roared in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Legendary Pokemon have always been my passion. I began with a single Mew card and now, all of what you see here is mine. I don't mean to be rude but for now you should remain here. It is quite ghastly out there, so until I finish my work feel free to admire my collection. Though do not touch as some of these are one of a kind.\", he kindly asked. He pressed a button and her released the lock on the cage allowing you and Melody out.</span></div></div>",

They were surrounded by a force field and only a strong enough force or an explosion could have any chance at freeing either of them. You decided to try ramming into it but it knocked you back like a putz. You then tried looking for a weapon to maybe cause the field to glitch up but everything of any use was encased in glass or in a smaller field to be sure everything was in pristine condition. \"C'mon think there has to be a way to get out of here at least and call up the right people so that they can free these birds. Melody is there anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat on the floor knowing there was nothing they could use. She instead went to look at the stone carving again. It foretold of the world being destroyed by the forces of nature should the balance be disrupted. She saw outside and could see Artiicuno freezing the ocean with the others no longer around covering the area in ice and snow. \"(Name) look.\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez.\", you reacted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) I read this carving, 'Disturb not the harmony of fire, ice or lightning, lest these titans wreak destruction upon the world in which they clash. Though the water's great guardian shall arise to quell the fighting, alone its song will fail, and thus the earth shall turn to ash.' What if the ancient legend is coming true?\", she said with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if it is then we need to keep trying to break out of here. There should be a crowbar or something or maybe a weapon that he has on display or.....or....\", you kept looking around but there was nothing. You then got down on your knees and hit the floor in frustration. \"GAHHHH! This is hopeless! The heck can I do that a pokemon trainer can't? They have pokemon able to do the impossible and do extraordinary things. What can I do? Huh? What does a guy who has no pokemon under his belt have that can stop this catastrophe?!\", you yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bent backwards on one of the tables holding up some priceless artifacts and you felt like giving up. Melody sat beside you trying to comfort you. \"Hey, your a heck of a lot more unique than most other trainers. I bet they are no where near as cool as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never even met any. Have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how can you tell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well in the short time I've known you, you are just like me. Were the odd ones out from the herd. So don't let that bring you down. Heck if you do find a way out, it means you don't need a pokemon to do the impossible. That alone makes you better than them.\", she encouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at her words of kindness, \"Sigh....you know I could have brought one with me before I left home. But I said no. What an idiot I was, I'd have better odds if it was the most useless pokemon that ever lived. I honestly have no clue how to get us out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody thought for a second and looked around and had no idea on how to escape or set Moltres and Zaptos free. She figured you might since you don't rely on pokemon to solve your problems, but you were in the rut. Then she had an idea, \"Well maybe all you need is a better confidence booster.\", then like a birthday surprise you felt the unrivaled sensations of Melody's tender lips pressed against your cheek ounce more. Your body felt like it was fully charged and working faster than normal. You immediately got up and took another look around to see if anything would work but nothing would disrupt the field. Then you had one idea that might work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melody break everything you see. Even if you can't just try and break stuff.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled at how well her motivator helped you come up with a pan that seemed to serve a purpose. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were gonna get that guy mad. So mad he'll come right on down and stop us. He says this stuff is priceless, well let's see if he meant it. He won't want something that valuable meddled with.\", you said still on a rush from Melody's kiss. As you tried tearing down and ruining things Melody noticed how you responded to her little kiss. She seemed to be aware now you liked her, she felt flattered but she dared not dwindle on that for long as you and her needed to set things back in order.</span></div></div>",

Lawrence was quite a strategist having Articuno at his mercy right from the start. He fired his shots precisely and with excellent timing. However your ruckus down below had caught the attention of his computer. As Lawrence was doing battle with the bird of ice the computer voice alerted its master. \"Alert: Trophy room 1 is sustaining damage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? It can't have been from Articuno. It's barley grazed the ship.\", he said. Then he pulled up a live camera feed from the room showing you and Melody managing to knock down the collection from their resting places and breaking the glass containers. To his outrage he activated a security protocol, \"Have security protocol 3 deal with them. I can't remove myself from the battlefield now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen in the trophy room the floor sprouted out a pair of turrets set to stun you but incapacitate you and Melody for a while. You knew this wasn't good so you took cover near the bird cages. Melody ducked under the case with the prophecy tablet and managed to avoid being shot. The guns ceased firing but still patroled in a circular motion. You then had a crazy idea and hoped it would work. \"Yo hoo!\", you waved down the turrets. The shot back again but you went for cover behind Moltres. The shots fired right at the field bombarding it with gunfire. The rounds may be non-lethal but they still packed a punch. With both turrets firing the field began to fail giving Moltres the opening it need to free itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn just a few short moments the bird of fire let out a huge blast of fire upward breaking free of it's cage. It fired a few short blasts at the turrets destroying them. Then the titan of fire turned to the titan of lightning and freed Zaptos. However they did not show signs of peaceful intent. As Moltres fired another blast at Zaptos. The birds broke out of the room causing a large hole in the glass window. They wreaked their revenge by destroying and sabotaging the whole flying fortress. As they did the damage Lawrence saw them from his view in disbelief. With the fortress capability to fly now rendered useless it descended on the nearest island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mayday mayday: Prepare for crash landing on lightning island.\", the computer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole fortress began to fall apart at the seems. The trophy room itself was unstable, and you had nowhere to run. You and Melody held on to anything and prayed the debris would not fall on top of you. Then one of the wings towers collapsed on the center of the fortress giving you two a path to escape. You grabbed Melody by the hand and ran for it hoping it would be stable enough until you made it across safely on the island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you both ran across the steepness caused you both to lose your balance and topple all the way down. Miraculously you made it on the island ground without injury and ran to escape the fortress from toppling down. The bottom ring that kept the fortress flying crashed on to the shrine of the island. The shock wave of the impact was so great it made you and Melody fall to the ground now coated in snow with Articuno's influence affecting the storm now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you got up the shrine's treasure rolled up beside you conveniently intact. You put it in your pocket and picked Melody up and ran for the edge of the island. Above you however were the three titans of fire, ice, and lightning battling for supremacy. Their fighting caused the ice in the mountain to melt causing the water to flow down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be safer if you had a boat but the only one's were left back on fire island. You looked and knew that it wasn't safe and you had to do something. But then a boulder hit the ground and a rush of water washed you and Melody into the flow. You were washed away and were about to hit the icey floor but then out from under it was a whirlwind of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Melody were carried across the water and taken back to Shamouti island...</span></div></div>",

Melody are you okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody's eyes slowly opened and she woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody: I'm okay. Just a little shaken up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What the heck was that? Water spouts don't normally save us right out of the blue do they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody: Not usually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a look around at your surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Where are we?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody: I think that we're back at Shamouti Island. I recognize this shrine. I come here all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I see. So what do we do now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you both heard someone coming towards you. To your surprise it was a Slowking. Apparently it lived in the shrine. Then the Slowking spoke to you and Melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowking: So you're finally here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Y-you can talk? Melody are there usually talking Slowking on this island?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody: No. Not usually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Slowking pointed to the shrine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowking: Take the treasure and put it there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Huh? Oh right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled out the treasures from your pockets and went to a statue with a pedestal inside. At first you didn't know where to put the treasures, but then you saw three openings. When you looked through them they each pointed to a specific island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I get it. Fire Island and Lightning Island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the right you placed the fire treasure to the left for Fire Island and on the right you placed the lightning treasure for Lightning Island. There was only one more treasure missing and there was only one place to find it. Ice Island. Then Slowking came up to you and spoke to you which startled you a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowking: So you're (name) eh? You're one treasure short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hold on, how do you know my name?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Slowking could answer, there was a loud squawk. You looked in the distance and you saw Moltres, Zapdos, and Articuno fighting and using their abilities to take each other down. Not only that, they were heading towards your current location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody: Oh no!

It's wings expanded showing it's magnificence and with it's mighty pride hovered in place as thee birds gazed at it. Lugia then shouted a tune that oddly resembled something. The sound it made sounded a lot like the one Melody played from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile on Lightning island, Lawrence the III had just set his eyes on his prey. Using his old telescope, he saw in amazement as the legendary pokemon rose out from the sea and flew with it's mighty presence. \"Finally! My prize! The beast of the sea, will soon belong to me.\", he gloated. Despite Lugia trying to sway the titans of the elements to yield they attacked the guardian unleashing their fury. Lugia was outnumbered but held it's own against them, using it's shield and swift attacks things appeared to be falling back into balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut soon the titans grew wise to it's game and then started drawing the fight near the shrine where you were. In defense Lugia shielded you and Melody but the attacks overwhelmed and defeated the guardian. Lugia fell into the ice sinking below the ocean unable to fight. But soon as the dust settled as the titans continued their fighting the oceans frozen surface became crowded over the horizon. Thousands upon thousands of pokemon were walking to the sight of this historic battle and all of them simply watched. You saw the hundreds of pokemon and were wondering why they all came here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is bad. Only the chosen one can help the water's great guardian.\", Slowking said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the legends says it's song will fail...\", Melody replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And thus the earth shall turn to ash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how are we going to find the chosen one if we don't even know where to look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your already looking at him.\", Slowking pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?!\", you reacted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) is really the chosen one..for real?\", Melody responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second....I've literally got the weight of the world on my shoulders? Well why the heck is it me of all people?! Any trainer in the world can do this but no, it must be me?! You must be joking!\", you say in response to the realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is true. You were chosen to be the savior and now it rests on you to save the world now.\", Slowking answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was I chosen to begin with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She choose.\", when Melody knew that she put you into this position she immediately regretted placing you into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name)... I...I never should have dragged you into this.\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? I'm the one who went along with it to begin with. But jeez! I went into this without thinking, I wasn't realizing what the consequences were, except all that was on my mind was just impressing yo-\", you just realized you let your own emotions slips out and prayed she didn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait? You did everything up so far to try and impress me?\", Melody asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh....yes, yes I did.\", you confessed not even bothering to hide the fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....your......your just wonderful! Your so beautiful on the ocarina, your so full of energy, I like you a lot Melody! I did right from the moment you kissed me on the beach. I know it didn't mean anything to you, but I just began having this big crush on you right from the start. The only thing that got me to go along with this whole thing was you. But now! Now I don't know what I'm doing. I'm crazy for even getting this far. I'm sorry but you have the wrong chosen one.\", you let it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down facing away from Melody not being able to face her after just confessing everything. You weren't the chosen one, just a boy with a petty crush that lead him on a quest to save the whole world. Then Melody hugged you from behind and said, \"(Name)...I know you are the chosen one. Trust me.\", she smiled giving off her confidence and never say die attitude. She picked you back up and the both of you blushed, \"You don't need to be the world's chosen one, but you can pull off having to be mine. Do it for me, ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because your just too wonderful yourself. Except I can't even describe how wonderful you even are. If anyone has a right to be worried about their role it's me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your the festival maiden that plays the song... the SONG! It's just like the sound Lugia made!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your right! Just like in the legend.\", Melody pulled out her ocarina and played the song. The song echoed across the islands and from within the depths of the sea, Lugia's strength returned to him. Out of the sea, Lugia arose again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The song, the song has restored my strength. But it alone cannot bring harmony to the three warring ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When the treasures of fire, ice and lightning are aligned my song shall harmonize with their powers and tame the beasts both below and above the sea. But it can only come to pass with the help of the chosen one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I do that someone else can't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. The chosen one is someone who willingly takes the responsibility to harmonize the world. The choice is always within those who fate thrusts it's sword upon. If you believe you are not worthy then you may choose to stop here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name).\", Melody turned to you knowing you could do it. You looked at her and knew with her motivating you, you could bring one measly treasure back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M NOT STOPPING!\"</span></div></div>",

The three titans in the far distance continued their fighting with none of them gaining an advantage. You could see from all the other pokemon watching how much it upset them. \"Lugia, why are all of those pokemon there standing around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because they feel they must be here in case they are needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's good knowing they're standing by in case we run into any problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flew across making good time but soon as you were close to the island the three birds sensed your arrival and focused on preventing you from harmonizing the world. \"You must make it across on foot. I will keep them at bay while you grab the treasure.\", Lugia flew down and let you land safely. You had a bit of a climb but at least you were safe while Lugia bought you some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran up to the mountain and moved as fast as possible, the path lead to a long cave that lead right to the shrine but it grew tiring as it stretched for what felt like miles. Eventually you made it to the top where the shrine remained in tact but you were exhausted. You crawled up catching your breath and made it up the last flight of stairs. \"Whew....who invented that cave?! Could run a motorbike in that thing and it still be as long.\" You picked yourself up and just tugged the treasure right out. It glowed like the other two and now all  that was left was getting back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started jogging back to save some energy while still keeping a fast pace but then lightning came from nowhere and collapsed the way back. Zaptos and Articuno were squaring off in the middle of the top of the mountain. Moltres entered the fight but Articuno blasted it with it's ice breath and weakened the fire titan. But then Zaptos took the opportunity and attacked Articuno from behind. Moltres returned the favor and blasted the titan of ice with it's mortal weakness. With two titans attacking one, Articuno crashed on the shrine in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly climbed over the mountain and ran on the slope sprinting to get away from the battle. But then Lugia flew down and gave you a lift. \"I got the treasure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia flew as fast as possible back to Shamouti island and were nearly there but then from Lightning island, Lawrence had launched his trap. His capturing mechanism was subduing Lugia painfully electrocuting him and yourself. Lugia resisted capture and launched a beam of energy at the fortress destroying all that remained from it. Lawrence fled as he saw his legacy being destroyed but the trap was too great for Lugia to handle ebbing away the last of his strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia fell into the thawed water and sunk into the oceans depths. You swam up to the water but it was a long swim back and the water became rougher than ever before. The waves dunked you into the water over and over. You tried swimming back but to no avail....</span></div></div>",

You also saw that you were surrounded by water pokemon forming a block around you in case that the guardians attacked again. While the water pokemon were the water protecting you, the pokemon who were on the ice were clearing a path to back to Shamouti Island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Wow. Thanks a lot you guys! I owe you guys one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pokemon that heard cried and responded to your thanks as they dropped you off at the shore. As you waved the pokemon goodbye, the storm weather grew worse. Tornadoes grew bigger and thunder roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh man. I gotta hurry. There's not much time left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dug in your pocket to check if the treasure was still there. Thankfully it was. You gripped it tightly with determination and looked up to the stairs leading to the shrine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I gotta do this. For the world and for Melody. Don't worry Melody. I won't let you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you made your way up to the stairs. It was a long a slow walk, but you made it back to the shrine. Melody and Slowking were waiting for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody: (name)! You made it back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowking: Very good (name).

Now place the final treasure with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked back to the shrine where you placed the other two treasures. Then you placed the final treasure in between them and stepped back. All three treasures began to glow and the lights grew brighter and brighter until they changed into a green color. Then the light blasted all the snow away and green water began to flow through the ruins. When the ruins touched the poles they turned to ice and orchids began to bloom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Wow....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody: Amazing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around wondering what should happen next.

I know you can.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and took a solid breath, she then began playing the song. The titans of fire, ice, and lightning awoke from the battle and began flying back to Shamouti. As Melody played the song, the stones around the shrine glowed in tune with the song. Then the green water overflowed from the shrine and started pouring into the ocean. The ice and snow from the storm and the hurricane weather calmed and turned back to normal. The ice melted away and the tornadoes dissipated. With the three legendary birds now flying in harmony again, Lugia reemerged and the sun shined over him. Lugia landed on the island offering you a ride on. You were surprised at first but then got right on. Lugia flew you across the ocean and saw all the pokemon returning to their homes. Then from behind Lugia the ocean rose into a giant water rainbow signifying the beast below the sea had been tamed as well as the other titans. Lugia flew alongside Zaptos, Moltres, and Articuno and now balance had at long last been restored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everything now in balance and the waver of water splashing down on the ocean, and the titans of the elements returning to their respective islands the song was now over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody fell to her knees exhausted from the playing but regained her composure. She took in just what she did and saw how much the world had changed, she helped restore it to balance. She clasped her ocarina tightly now having a new found respect and admiration of her people's culture and tradition. Lugia set you down back to Shamouti where he gave his goodbye. \"The beast of the sea has been tamed. The world could have been in better hands.\", as he said his goodbye he dove back down into the depths of the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waved goodbye thanking him for the ride and for his help.</span></div></div>",

Slowking did not answer simply giving a chuckle and going into his cave. \"C'mon chosen one, lets go ahead and celebrate.\", Melody said dragging your love-struck body back to the mainland of the island. You both came back and found Carol thankful her sister was alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melody I'm so relived! What were you thinking going off into that storm?!\", she reacted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh relax I'm fine. Besides, I needed to make sure he came back in one piece.

Carol and Karen simply, \"oooooed and awwwwwed\", your display of affection. A few seconds passed before you returned her kiss. You knew how her kisses before left you motionless but this was something else. The taste of her lips, the warmth of her face, the feeling of being a couple.

He can be so adorable when he's like this. Ugh there I go sounding like a girl. Uhhh too much like a girl, yeah.\", she thought. She quietly got up and kissed your cheek. You couldn't feel it since you were so tired you were out of your body in a dreamless state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody got dressed and went into town to buy up some food for you. She went to her favorite stand and tried picking the best fruits that were in stock. \"Ah Melody, off doing errands for your sister again?\", said the shop-keep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's for my boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh and who's the lucky guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name), I'm buying some food for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The chosen one?! Why didn't you say so. Take them as a show of our appreciation. He's been a big help with the rebuilding on top of saving the world. Take as many as you want, free of charge.\", the shop-keep said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well then thank you. I'll tell him to say thank you when we go into town later.\", she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as he stays everything we have is his should he ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your kidding me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Community decided this about a week ago. Surprised you haven't heard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok that's all I need. Thank you sir.\", Melody waved goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while had passed and you finally woke up, the sun beam from your window hit your face, you felt refreshed and ready to finally wake up. You rubbed your eyes but you quickly noticed no sign of Melody. You quickly rushed outside to see where she was, you called out her name with concern. Luckily she was just outside playing with some of the children. She heard you calling out and smiled finally seeing you awake, she came up carrying a basket full of fruit. \"Good afternoon. It's no longer morning so my greeting is accurate.\", she joked. She gave you a mango and you took a bite out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm. How long was I asleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just told you it's past noon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean what hour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Around 2. Don't worry there tough guy I have enough planned to make it feel like you didn't miss a single hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon. We got a ton of things to do to make up for your lazy timing.\", she grabbed you by the arm and darted into town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZa1BBwK0uE&amp;list=PL0FFD0D122F88EAE2&amp;index=18\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZa1BBwK...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Melody went across town and saw a bunch of sights you haven't had time to enjoy. You and her got to participate in a bunch of games with some other people. You played soccer and some tag. You were excellent defense but offense you lacked in. Melody was very fast and nimble, which was why you never could catch her when you switched games. Eventually you took a boat ride around Shamouti and Melody rowed the boat herself refusing your help. You looked at the bottom of the ocean seeing some pokemon water life interacting with the ocean floor. Then a huge magickarp came out of nowhere and chased you capsizing the two of you out at sea. You swam back to shore soaking wet, but then you decided to have fun and splash Melody. You snickered seeing her face, but then she splashed you back right in the face. You two tussled for a bit before giving up and surrendering when she pinned you by backing you on the rocky shore and planting a kiss on your cheek. You couldn't resist when she used her feminine charms to subdue you. You went back home all wet but felt better when you two were wrapped beside in each others arms walking back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody and you made it back to your home upon which Meldoy knew she needed to go back home. \"Had a great time with you Mel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight.\", she said kissing you on the lips briefly before waving goodbye as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You smiled and stared awkwardly back at her after she pecked your lips. You knew for a fact you loved her and vice versa. You knew sooner or later things would take the next step.</span></div></div>",

For the next few years ounce the festival came you were personally honored as the Chosen one who brought harmony to the world. Other candidates for the festival came around but you were the star of the show even fulfilling your destiny. You made Shamouti island your new home and within the first couple years you started to become like family to everyone. You and Melody remained a strong couple, having normal bumps in the road here and there but you two loved each other very much without anything breaking you two up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody still fulfilled her role as the festival maiden and continued playing her ocarina. She still played it as beautifully as when you first saw her. But this year marked the end of an era. Melody was getting too old for the role and this year marked the last one for her. So tonight would be her last. You went to see her getting ready for the festival, she wore the white veil you loved seeing her in and felt excited but sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mel. Feeling sad about this being your last year?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh. It's ironic how I first hated this ritual yet now I want to keep playing the part until I become an old lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know the feeling about things coming to an end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody's eyes started tearing up, \"I don't want it to end! Ever since we met this was a part of our lives. When this is over, I feel like it won't be anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhhhh. It's ok. Nobody here is going to forget what we did and we won't forget how we've come since then. I love you Melody. Besides I get to have you all to myself now that you won't have that responsibility.\", you kissed her neck lightly making her giggle and moan a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe stop it. Ohhhh, gasp! Not now (Name) I have to do my part soon. Can't have signs of foul play on the festival maiden. Promise to come to your place when the party is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Mel. Love you so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I love you too. Promise to have a surprise later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What surprise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see.

Then the lights dimmed and it grew quiet. Melody looked around at the audience and saw you. You smiled and waved to her brimming with pride and confidence. Melody smiled back and gave you a wink. Then she closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and began to play on her ocarina. Her beautiful sound could be heard everywhere throughout the town. As you listened to Melody playing on the ocarina, you began to remember back to that faithful day. The day that you first came to Shamouti and when you first met Melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Wow. So many things have happened since I first came here. Here I was all by myself and now look. I crash landed on an island, met a whole bunch of people calling me the chosen one, and then I met a girl that completely teased me at first, but then she came to like me. Then we both got caught in come crazy stuff and had to save the world and got to see tons of pokemon. And now, I'm living here and I'm with the greatest girl I've ever met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you looked at the ocean and the stars and smiled to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I'm really glad I came to Shamouti. I'm really glad did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you saw something. Something was jumping out of the water and leaping into the air. At first you couldn't tell what it was, but then you recognized the silhouette. It was Lugia!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Wait a sec! What's Lugia doing here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia leaped about in the water gallantly like a dolphin as the moon reflected on it's splendor. You couldn't help, but be awed by this beautiful sight. Then it looked in your direction. From the look in it's eyes, it looked like it was saying hi. You couldn't help, but wave to it. Then you felt someone tap on your shoulder. You looked to see that it was Carol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol: Hey (name). Who were you waving to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh. I was.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you looked back, Lugia had disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: That's odd. Did I imagine it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol: (name)? Are you okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh. I'm fine. I was just admiring the sea and thinking about everything that's happened so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol: Hahaha. You're weird. But you're right. The years have gone by haven't they? It seemed like only yesterday when you first came here. You've really changed our lives you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I have?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol: Yes. Especially Melody's. To think that she thought the ceremony was silly. Now she loves taking part.It's such a shame that she won't be the festival maiden anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I know. I'm gonna miss her being the maiden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol: Hahaha. I bet you'd think she looks beautiful wearing that dress?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yup. I sure do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol: (name)? Promise me something. Promise me you'll take good care of my sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Um....sure. I promise. I'll take good care of her no matter what!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol: Hahaha. Thanks. I know you'll be a great guy for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Melody's song had ended and everyone applauded. You applauded the loudest of all as Melody's final ceremony appearance came to an end.</span></div></div>",

But now you had her all to yourself and soon as she was done you grabbed her hand and yanked her gently to the dance floor. The music was playing a soft beat and was calm and soothing which made Melody tremble a bit. You were sweeping her off her feat and she just let you take her away. \"Your being real suave this time. Any reason as to why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK58YvcCs-4\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK58YvcC...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhhh. Just follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK.\", she didn't know why you wanted her to stay quiet she just went with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe music just swept the two like a feather caught in a wind. Melody was blushing by how fluent you were. Soon the music began to reach the final notes, as they were you were leaning in closer to Melody's face until finally when the music broke to silence your lips met and the lights faded. Melody was just lost in the bliss of the moment, she had never felt so warm and content like this. The whole world was gone around her except you and she. When the light began returning to the party you pulled back to makes sure no one saw you two like that. But before you fully pulled away you whispered in her ear, \"My place after the party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did he mean by that?\", Melody thought. Alone with you has been common in the past but....then the thought hit her. Were you two going to go all the way now? She's old enough now to know what it is and how it goes as you did too. But your both so young and if things aren't- Melody froze in place while you still held her in your arms from the dancing. You smiled and hoped she got the message. You wanted to take it up a notch and thought now was a proper time. Melody grinned back and blushed, she nodded and felt scarred but excited to have her first time. She trusted you and she knew you loved her, nothing about the idea felt wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the party ended she snuck off with you back to your home. You two held hands as you got in and just stared at the bed.....</span></div></div>",

Both of you were feeling nervous and had no idea what to do. Then you finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Are you nervous?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody: Yes. Just a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): So......I guess we should get started then huh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody: Yeah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another awkward pause. Then Melody made the first move. She began getting undressed in front of your eyes. To her it was very embarrassing, but she was willing to do it for you. Soon she was standing in front of you naked and when you saw her, you couldn't help but stare in awe. You knew she was beautiful before, but seeing her without clothes on like this made her look like a goddess and all the past few years from growing up certainly did some good with her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Whoa. You're beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody said nothing, but she blushed bright pink from your compliment. Then you began to take off your clothes as well. After your clothes were off you sat down on the bed. Melody slowly  followed suit and sat next to you and dove into your arms. You could feel that she was trembling meaning that she was still feeling nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody: (name)? You better promise to be gentle with me. It's.....it's gonna hurt isn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yes....it might since it's your first time, but don't worry. I promise I'll be gentle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flipped Melody over so that you were on top of her. She looked at you with eyes shining from the moon's rays through the window and her eyes a little dewy from her tears. Seeing her like this you think that she was absolutely adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Melody.....you're so cute....I...can't control myself anymore. I'm gonna kiss you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody: Wait. Hold mmpphh!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Melody could say anything you sealed her lips with a kiss. Melody at first was surprised, but then she got into the kiss. You started with a normal kiss at first, but then you began licking your lips with her tongue begging for entrance. At first, Melody didn't know what you meant when you were licking her lips, but then you pinched her nipple making her yelp in surprise. You took that opportunity of inserting your tongue and the kiss turned to a french kiss. Your tongues danced in each other mouths. You didn't know how long you two were kissing, but you assumed it must have been a few minutes or so. Then you both took a break to catch your breath. When you looked at Melody, she noticed that she had a pouty look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Melody? What is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody: You didn't need to pinch my nipple to french kiss me you know!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): But you liked it when I did that didn't you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody blushed bright red and punched you lightly on the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody: Geez! You're so mean!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hahaha. You're so cute when you're pouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you moved your left hand and began massaging one of her breasts and began to suck on the other one. Melody gasped and moaned and she gently hugged your head while you were giving her pleasure. Slowly Melody's nipples became erect and hard and her special spot was starting to leak meaning that she was starting to feel good. Your hands groped all over her body until you touched her sensitive spot. Melody instinctively closed her legs to try and stop you, but you were faster and she ended up clamping your hand while you touched her spot directly. You rubbed on the lips being careful not to rub too hard. Melody moaned even louder and her flower got even wetter. Her breathing grew ragged and her body grew hotter. She instinctively reached out and grabbed your pole and squeezed lightly making you groan in pleasure. Melody smiled mischievously and rubbed it the tip with her thumb. She also moved her hand up and down making it twitch and leak fluids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody: Man. You're so big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hahaha. It's like this because you're so cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody: Hahaha. And I suppose I'm so wet is because you're treating me so nicely?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Perhaps. It's your body. Haha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you stopped rubbing Melody and positioned yourself on top of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK. You should be ready now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody: OK....but....before it happens......can you promise me something? I know this the part where it's gonna hurt, but.....when it starts hurting....can you kiss me to make it feel better?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Melody's face and saw how nervous she was. She was trembling a little more and her eyes were even more moist by her tears, but she was putting on brave face for your sake and that warmed your heart. You couldn't help, but smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I promise. You ready?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody nodded and wrapped her arms around your neck signaling at she gave her consent. You took your member and guided it inside her. Her flesh gave away a little and you could feel your member sliding inside her. Melody's grip tightened a little as she felt herself being filled up. You pushed in a little harder and Melody yelped in pain. She knew that she was hurting like crazy, but you pressed on trying not to hurt in the least way possible. Then you reached a narrow spot and you couldn't get past. You grabbed her legs for leverage and forced your member inside making you able to slide in completely. Melody groaned in pain as a red liquid oozed from your union. To minimize the pain, you kissed Melody tenderly as you promised. When you pulled away, you saw that tears of pain were now streaming down Melody's face, but her smile was one in pure joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Melody are you OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody: I'm fine. I'm just happy that's all. I'm....officially a woman now. Thank you....Thank you (name). You made the pain go away and it feels warm now. You can move now. Make it me feel good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK. But I'll do it slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to move as slow as you could trying not to hurt Melody. It felt really tight as you moved, so tight that you felt like you could come any minute. Melody's body jerked in response as you thrusted inside her. She breathing grew even more ragged and she began to moan erotically making you turned on. Gradually your thrusting began to get harder and faster and Melody's flower began squeezing you in the same rhythm. Your thrusting was also making Melody's breasts bounce. They swayed back and forth glistening with sweat. At this point Melody's moans have turned into passionate screams and she held you even tighter. The tightness from her arms and from inside her made the pleasure even more intense making you both reach your limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody: (name)....something's....happening....(moan)...I'm scared..(gasp)..I feel....like I\"m gonna explode!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Me too....It's OK.....don't fight the pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you felt a strong pulse of pleasure go through you and Melody let out the loudest scream you ever heard. You gritted your teeth and your member exploded inside her filling her all the way to the depths of her womb. Melody twitched every time you spurted inside her still basking in the afterglow of her orgasm. After getting your sense of reason back, you realized what you did and you almost panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh my gosh. Melody I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to come inside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody rubbed her tummy and to your surprise, she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody: It's OK. I've always wanted to have a baby. Now my wish has come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help, but blush at her comment. Melody then pulled your face into a kiss and looked at you with her eyes shining in the moonlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody: I love you (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Me too. My little maiden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you felt the yourselves getting drowsy and then you both fell asleep in each others arms.</span></div></div>",

Melody is pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up with that fact plastered on your head. You rose up from the bed to see Melody still asleep and still having that smile she had from last night. You got up and grabbed your swim trunks. You took a dive in the ocean water to try and almost wash away what just happened. You weren't mad, or at least didn't feel mad, but you didn't feel happy like Mel was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dove in the water swimming as deep below as you could then swimming back up and still you didn't feel happy. You got out of the water and went back to your house. You grabbed a towel and sat on your porch shaking. Not from the chill of the breeze but from the fact that Melody was pregnant. It then occurred to you, you were terrified. You didn't mean to do it. The heat of the moment made you forget to stop before it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact of you having one with Melody wasn't the issue. You and her have been lovers for years now, nothing is wrong with her having your child. But what about Carol? She said to take care of Melody but she couldn't possibly mean it to such a high level. Even if she did would Carol react happily or with concern, or worse yet would she be disgusted with what you had done. At least when your both still at a young age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat on the porch rattled like a music instrument, Melody was up and already dressed and saw you sitting and knew why you were so afraid. But a bit of worry pierced her thoughts thinking, \"Why is he so scared?\", she placed her hand on your shoulder and hugged you tightly while kissing your cheek gently. \"Hi.\", she started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-mmmm-Melody.\", your words were jittery and incoherent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhhhhhh. Calm down. Take it easy, tell me what your thinking.\", she moved your head to her chest and stroked your hair with tenderness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes begin to water in guilt, \"I'm sorry Mel.\", she quickly looked right at you with a mixture of anger, concern, and understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you apologizing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did....did you mean what you said last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please tell me, just please tell me the truth whether you meant it or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I meant it. I wanted a baby. With you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't rob you of your freedom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? NO! You didn't do anything to me like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought that when you were done with the festival. We'd go and travel together and then later on we would...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name). Of course we can still do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But your-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to me (Name). We still have plenty of time to see the world. We have all the time in the world even. We just are going to have an extra passenger on the trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. Ok. That's......that's all I needed to know.\", you cried again but out of sheer relief and newly discovered love for Melody. She still is willing to let your future remain the same but not let this new development hinder or alter it in the slightest. Melody felt better knowing you were in a better state of mind having expressed her thoughts on this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do about the baby then when it's time for-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When it get's around to a certain point we'll stop traveling and wait for it to happen. We'll call up Carol and my family and yours and tell them where we are, then we'll take it from there.\", Melody said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And after that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll decide then whether to keep traveling or just come back here and raise our baby. I don't know what we'll be thinking until then.\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Mel. I..I can work with that. I feel much better. And I'm sorry I just didn't know if we rushed it too fast. But now that it's happened I...I think we should tell someone the good news.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off we did rush into it too quickly. But I'm not going to let it stop me from living our dream before we go into being parents for the rest of our lives. We'll be ready when the baby comes. I know that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your right. I love you so much that I wanted you to still have a long time of freedom before we settled down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft, (Name) I went on an adventure with a crazy collector, three giant birds, and the world nearly going into a global catastrophe. That was worth a lifetime of freedom and adventure alone. It's how we got together so fast.\", she playfully kissed your cheek again laughing in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember when you held on to me back on fire island it went like this.\", you grabbed her wrists and pulled her into a hug. She tried to get out of it but you were persistent. You wrapped her in a hug and laughed with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, and that's why I stuck around this island for so long.\", you joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm hmm. Tease. Don't forget to call your folks and tell them your going to be a daddy. I'll tell Carol and spare you the danger of maybe being mauled by her after she reacts to the news. If she does freak out to it. Frankly I'd be more worried if she didn't go nuts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, Ok babe. Love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too. And so does our little one.\", you two both rubbed Melody's belly feeling it knowing that right now she was going to have your baby.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few minutes later, you went into the city in search of a phone to call your parents. At first you had a difficult time trying to find one, but eventually you found a videophone inside the pokemon center. At first you were a little nervous for calling your parents, but after you took a deep breath you felt a lot more calm. You dialed your parents' number and waited for your parents to pick up. After a couple of ring tones your mother's face popped up on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Mom: Hello?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey Mom. It's me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Mom: Oh my gosh! (name) it's you! Honey! Your son's on the phone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Dad: What?!? Seriously?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a scurrying of feet from the other side of the phone. Then you heard your dad zip by the screen and then you heard a loud crash. Obviously in his haste to see you on the phone, you dad had rushed too fast, lost control, and crashed into some furniture probably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Dad? Are you okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour father popped up from the screen and smiled and gave you a thumbs up as if nothing had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Dad: Don't worry son. Your old man is a-okay!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Mom: Oh honey. How many times have I told you not to run like that? You could get hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Dad: Ah you worry too much babe. Anyway, how's it going son? Where are you? We haven't seen you since you left the house a couple years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I know. I just...wanted to talk to you two about something. Something important<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Dad: Important?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Mom: Is everything okay sweetie? You look serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah. Everything's fine. It's just.... I.....kinda have some news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Dad: Good news or Bad news?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well....you see....that depends. You see... Okay. Let me start at the beginning. First of all, I'm at Shamouti Island. An island close to the Orange Islands. And while I was here...I kinda met this girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Mom and Dad: A girl?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instinctively flinched from the sudden change in your parents tones afraid that they were now angry, but to your surprise they had a different reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Mom: That's great honey!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Dad: Atta boy! I knew you'd get yourself a girl eventually! After all, you did get my good looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Mom: So what's her name and is she nice to you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Um..yeah. Her name is Melody and she's a very sweet girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Dad: Melody huh? That's definitely a cute name. So she's your girlfriend eh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah. Pretty much. You guys don't mind do you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Mom: Of course not son. You can date whoever you want. As long as you and the girl you chose love each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Dad: Yup! You'll get no complaints from me. Go for whatever girl you want son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Really? Thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Dad: Is that all what you wanted to talk about son? Because if you ask me, I don't think it's that big of a deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well....um...no. There's something else you needed to know. It's something...serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you said serious, your parents looks changed into looks of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Dad: Was is it son?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Mom: Yes. You can tell us anything sweetie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitated before you spoke. You couldn't back down after calling your parents. You took a deep breath and spoke choosing your words carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Look Mom. Look Dad. The real reason I needed to talk to you was that...... Melody's not only my girlfriend. She's.....gonna be a mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Mom: What? She's gonna be a mother? Who's the father?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well.....you're looking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother and your father blinked and they looked at each other. Then their eyes went as big as saucers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Dad: Wait. Hold on. Son. Are you...... are you telling us...that.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point you couldn't take it anyone. You immediately blurted out what your word not wanting to take the stress anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yes!!! I got Melody pregnant and I'm gonna be a father okay?!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long silence. You sighed expecting your parents to be upset and prepared to be yelled at. Then suddenly you father jumped up like a rocket and began hooting for joy with tears in his eyes. He wasn't the only one who was crying, your mother was too. At first you thought they were upset, but you were wrong. They weren't tears of sadness or anything like that. They were tears of joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Mom? Dad? Are you two okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Dad: Okay?!? We're great! In fact, we're couldn't be happier!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Happier?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Mom: Yes. You not only got yourself a girlfriend, but now you're gonna be a father!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Dad: That's my boy! To think that your old man's lived to see the day! His one and only son has got himself a girlfriend and finally became a man! (cries) And we're finally gonna have a grandbaby!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Wait....you guys....aren't mad at me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Mom: Why would we be mad sweetie? This is wonderful news!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): But...isn't this the part where you say, \"(name)! You got a girl pregnant without us knowing?!? You're in big trouble mister!\" or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Dad: Are you kidding? We've always wanted a granddaughter or grandson. And now thanks to you, we're gonna get one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Really? So you're both okay with this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Mom: Yes. We don't mind. Except for a few conditions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom's face was now stern so you paid close attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Conditions?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Mom: Yes. One, promise us that you'll be a good father to Melody and take good care of your son or daughter. Two, make sure to call us every now and again so that we know you're alright. And three....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held your breath awaiting your mother's last condition. Then your mother's stern look now changed to a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Mom: Please send us some pictures of the baby when it's born. I'd love to see what my grandbaby looks like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nearly fell over in surprise when your mom broke the tension like that, but you managed to regain your composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Sure thing Mom. I promise to be a good father and I'll call you and Dad whenever I have time. And yes I'll make sure to send you the photos too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Dad: And introduce us to this Melody girl sometime. We'd love to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yes Dad. I will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Mom: And one more thing son. You're eating right over there right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yes Mom. I'm eating right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou Mom: Okay son. We'll see you later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Dad: We love you son. And make your papa proud!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I will. Bye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that you hung up the phone and the monitor turned off. You let out a sigh of relief, happy that you got that off your chest. Your parents gave you their approval so it was official.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Geez. My parents can be so crazy sometimes. But still...they're great. I can't imagine where i would be if it wasn't for them. Thank you Mom. Thank you Dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou left the pokemon center and headed back home eager to tell Melody the good news. Then on the way back, you ran into....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later in the evening, you and Melody went to bed. Melody was fast asleep, but you were wide awake. You were still thinking about everything that happened. Good news was your parents approved of your relationship with Melody and they approved of you being a father. Bad news was that Carol wasn't happy and you had the red mark on your face to prove it. You rubbed your cheek tenderly remembering the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Ouch. Geez, Carol didn't have to slap me so hard. Then again I can't blame her. I'd be mad too. (sigh) I know that Melody said that she wanted the baby, but still.....I can't help but feel a little bad for getting Carol so mad. Not to mention that I have to tell her mother too. Man. And I thought saving the world was stressful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as plans go, you had to find a job to support you and Melody and the baby. That wasn't too hard. The problem was Carol and her and Melody's mom. You felt bad for making Carol angry so you wanted to try to make it up to her and show her that you can take care Melody and the baby, but you didn't know how. You stared at the ceiling trying to think. Soon you eyes began to get a little heavy and then you went to sleep. The very next morning you woke up, you head still filled with your thoughts. You let out a sigh and slowly got out of bed not wanting to wake up Melody. You needed to relax and there was only one thing that could help you do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I'm gonna go swimming. Maybe that will help me relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got donned your swimming trunks once more, grabbed a towel, and headed out. Unknown to you, Melody had noticed you leave. As soon as you left the bedroom she sat up and got out of bed. She felt bad for you feeling the way you were. She wanted to cheer you up somehow, but she had no idea how to.  Meanwhile you walked through town and headed for the pier. The sky was still a little dark and the ocean was as calm, but you were feeling too down to notice. You sat on the edge on the pier and dipped your feet in the water. It was a little cold at first, but you got used to it after a few minutes.You sat there staring at your reflection in the water trying to think of a way to make it up to Carol and trying to figure out what to do when it came to Carol and Melody's mom when the time came. You came up with nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Man. This stinks. Carol must still be very upset with me. I wish I could try to show her that I can step up, but...(sigh) what do I do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmile for Me - Sword Art Online<br>\r\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSbNV0GA2ss\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSbNV0GA...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you felt something touch your feet. You looked to down to find a Luvdisc nudging your feet. It looked as if the Luvdisc sensed that you were sad and it was trying to cheer you up. You smiled sadly and petted the Luvdisc on it's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Aw. Thanks little guy, but I need to be alone. Okay? I appreciate it though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Luvdisc didn't give up. It could see that you were feeling down and you needed some cheering up. It dove underwater and called out it's friends. A couple more Luvdisc showed up and other different water pokemon came as well. The Luvdisc told them what to do and the pokemon were happy to help. You were back on the pier still thinking about what to do, but still you came up with nothing. You decided it was time to head back to the house. Meldoy was gonna wake up soon and you didn't want her to worry. You had just got up and were about to head back, when a Dewgong leaped from the sea and landed right in front of you. You were so surprised that you reflexively took a step back. When you stepped back, you felt nothing but air which caused you to lose your balance and made you fall into the ocean. You came up to the surface and spit out some water that got into your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey! What's the big idea?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDewgong just clapped it's flippers and dove back into the water. Then you felt something lift you up from your feet. Next thing you knew, you were on top of a Wailmer's back and were being carried out to the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey! What the heck's going on?!? Where are you taking me?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wailmer responded with a big bellow and carried you out to the water until you were a few feet away from the pier. Then the Wailmer launched you into the air using a water spout from it's blowhole sending you into the water again with a mighty splash. You came up to the surface and spit out some water once again. You felt a little annoyed now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What the heck is going on?!? Geez. I don't have time for this. I gotta get back to the pier before Meldoy wakes up. Better get swimming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to start swimming, but then a Buizel popped up blocking your way. You tried swimming past it, but it kept blocking your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Okay Buizel. I need to get back to the pier so would you mind moving?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuizel shook it's head pointed into the water. It looked like it wanted to show you something. At first you didn't want to, but from the way Buizel was pointing it looked like it was important. Plus Buizel wasn't going to let you go until you listened to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Okay Buizel. You win. I'm assuming you want to show me something right? Lead the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held onto Buizel and took a deep breath. Then you and Buizel dove into the water. At first you couldn't see due to you being underwater, but your eyes adjusted in a few minutes. When your vision became sharper, you could not believe what you saw. Dozens of water pokemon were swimming under the water and there was a beautiful coral reef on the ocean floor. You went swimming many times before so you thought you knew these waters, but you had never seen a sight like this before. Suddenly Buizel began to speed up and you held on to it's float sack. You both swam through a school of Remoraid, some Mantine and Mantyke and many other pokemon. You also saw the beautiful coral reef which was filled beautiful colors and filled with other different types of pokemon you haven't seen before. Out of all the sights you've seen in your life, this by far was the most beautiful. Then some air bubbles came out of your mouth and your lungs felt a little tired. You tugged Buizel gently and pointed upwards signaling that you needed to come up for air. Buizel nodded and helped you to the surface. You let out a big gasp as you resurfaced above the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Wow! That...was incredible! I've never seen such a beautiful reef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly three Gorebyss sprang out of the water over your head and dove back into the water. Then they began leaping around you and Buizel wanting you to play with them. To be honest you kinda wanted to, but you didn't know if Buizel had the speed. You looked at Buizel and Buizel looked at you. Then Buizel smiled nodded signaling that he knew what you were thinking. You smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Let's go Buizel! See if you can match their speed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held on to Buizel for dear life as Buizel's tail spun like a powerful propeller and took off ahead of the Gorebyss in an incredible speed. The Gorebyss followed suit, leaping about in the water. Buizel dove into the water with you barely being able to catch your breath and then Buizel shot out of the water and leaped into the air like the Gorebyss. You were a little surprised at being launched like that, but at the same time it was a lot of fun. You and Buizel raced the Gorebyss and played with other pokemon all morning until the sun was coming over the horizon meaning that it was morning and Melody was gonna wake up soon. So you headed back to the pier with Buizel giving you a ride. Soon you made it back to the pier feeling a lot better. You climbed onto the pier, got out of the water, and dried yourself off with a towel. As you dried yourself off, you saw Buizel heading back into the ocean. Buizel looked back and waved. You waved back and watched as Buizel swam out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Wow. I never had that much fun before. It was almost like a dream. But I wonder. Why did those pokemon send me to that reef anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the very same Luvdisc jumped in front of you getting your attention. When you saw it, you could only smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I bet you were the reason for all that huh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Luvdisc jumped about as if it was saying yes.

I feel a lot better now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuvdisc jumped out of the water and gave you a smooch on the cheek as a way of saying \"you're welcome\" and disappeared into the water. You feeling a lot better about things decided to head back home before Melody woke up.

Melody was giggling a bit seeing you interact with a pokemon after saying long ago how you were so tired of seeing them everywhere. Carol was behind Melody looking at you, still her face was filled with anger, but this time it wasn't as bad as before. This time she cooled down a little but still held resentment for the mess you two got yourselves into. Melody came down toward you her eyes sparkled with her smile radiating. The look on her face showed her obvious affection but when she grasped your hands, her eyes looked deep into yours. She could feel your fear and worry, she knew you were thinking you wouldn't measure up to raising your child. However she knew more than anyone that you would do your best to be the best dad you could be. How you would sacrifice, protect, and devote your energy to one person. Her experience when the world nearly fell out of balance showed her you were capable. Saving her life, the world, and determination, that is why she trusted you. Yet as she smiled comforting you, you lowered your head in grief. You thought how can I be deserving of someone like her? Yet without a single word, she reassured you that all would be fine between you two. She raised your head and gave you a single look, it washed away the very last inch of doubt. You two were better now, you felt ready for the coming chapter in your lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two hugged tightly, embraced by the love you two had. Today was a long and bracing day, and it would only get more difficult from then on fro a long while. ''(Name) none of it was your fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I was only scared and I'm doing my best to adjust. But we'll get through this ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too.\", you both kissed lightly to avoid making Carol disgusted. Soon as you went down and started heading back home Carol stopped the both of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name), I'm sorry. I am legitimately happy for you and Melody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I appreciate it. Really.\", you replied. You went back home with Melody, heading to bed. However  you felt a little awkward after what happened. But Melody took your hand and gently pulled you in with her. You cuddled until you both rested peacefully this time. With a new life in the making you couldn't help but have your hand over your lover's belly. Feelings of happiness and joy overflowed in your body that you cried happily as you drifted off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Especially since how things were going nowadays. You finally landed a job in a restaurant off the coast from town. You were a little nervous because you weren't sure that you would get the job, but the owner of the restaurant was more than happy to hire you since you were the legendary hero after all. The staff members also welcomed you with open arms and treated you like they were a member of the family. Since you were hired, you worked hard all day taking orders, cleaning up, and even sometimes making the food. It was exhausting but the pay made it all worth it. When you first started working it was all overwhelming for you, but eventually you got the hang of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCook 1: Hey (name)! Another order for table three!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I'm on it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiter 1: (name)! Please escort these two to a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Sure thing. Right this way please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another day at the restaurant. You were helping the other waiters wait tables. You along with the other waiters went back and forth taking orders and serving orders. It was especially packed around the afternoon. You guessed it was because of the food being so great, but you eventually learned that it was for a different reason altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl: Excuse me. Can I have some more water please?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Coming right up! (pours water)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan: Waiter! Check please!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I'm on my way! (places check on table)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl: Excuse me. Where's my order sir?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Right here ma'am. (places order on the table) Please enjoy miss. Call if you need anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were taking care of the customers, your boss and a couple of other workers were watching you work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiter 2: Wow. Look at him go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCook 2: Yup. (name) has to be one of the biggest hard workers I've ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Boss: You better believe it. Not only does he work hard, but he's pretty popular with the customers. We've never have gotten so many before. I must say that (name) has changed our lives for the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, your shift was over and you were looking forward to going home and getting some time to yourself. Then your boss came up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Boss: Hey (name). Nice job to today. Same as always. You've attracted a lot of customers as usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Thanks boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Boss: Heading home right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yup. Looking forward to getting some rest after a hard days work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Boss: So how is everything back at home? And how's Melody getting along? Has the baby come yet? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): She's doing fine and not yet, but I can safely say that the baby's due any day now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Boss: I see. If I recall that's the reason why you asked for this job right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): That's right. Since Melody and I are gonna be parents, might as well earn my keep somehow. Plus I was planning to raise some money to go on a trip with Melody and our baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Boss: Sounds like fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah. By the way, I have forgotten to tell you this before, but......thank you. Thank you for this job. It really means a lot to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Boss: I'm the one who should be thanking you. You're really a good kid and you helped my business. Plus this place wouldn't be standing if you hadn't come to Shamouti.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Aw shucks. It was nothing. It was the least I could do. Well then. I better get going. Melodys waiting for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Boss: Oh (name)! Before you go, you forgot something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour boss handed you an envelope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Is this my paycheck? Don't get I get paid until Friday?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Boss: Yes indeed. I decided to give it to you a little early to show my gratitude. Make sure you use it wisely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Thank you boss! You're the best! See you later!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that you set off for home, eager to see a certain someone who was waiting for you at home.</span></div></div>",

Uuuuuugh. Remind me never to have another baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laid your head against Melody's now bulgy belly and you felt a strong tap coming from inside. You felt sorry for her having to endure this for a few weeks. But it was getting close to being over so Melody wouldn't have to suffer much longer. \"You think it'll be a girl or a boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy.\", she answered wincing in pain a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed her belly giving her some relief, \"Ahhhh. (Name) keep doing it, that is helping me feel sooo better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you grinned a little, and then sat next to her on the couch, \"I can think of some ways to help you feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe, I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.

Is she okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor: She does have a slight fever, but she'll be okay. All she needs is a little medicine, water, and lots of rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What the baby? Is the baby gonna be okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor: The baby will be just fine. Although I might say it's a feisty little one. Hahaha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Whew. Thank goodness. Oh! One more thing. Will the baby be due soon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor: Yes. Very soon. I'd say that it will be born by tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): That's good news. (sigh) What a relief. Um... May I go see her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor: Of course you can. You can even stay here overnight if you wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): You mean it?!? Seriously?! Thank you so much!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor: No problem. After all, you are the legendary hero who saved Shamouti. It's the least I can do. Now come with me. I'll take you to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the doctor took to a room where Melody was lying down on the bed.

You stopped them, but they all just run away from you. You feared that this power will hurt people like you're parents. So, you packed up and disappeared from your home. You didn't want to leave your parents, but it's for their own protection from what you could've done to them. Ever since that day, things had been rough on you. The only thing you've got left is your deck for it's like a part of you and it's the only thing left that kept you going. You soon discovered of a tournament that the winner will face the king, Jack Atlas. You heard of him, but never really know about his play style. So, you decided to participate in it to find out. You signed up and await further instructions. While waiting, you came across a sexy and good looking dark red haired girl who doesn't seem to be very pleasent with others. You tried to say hello, but she just walked away in a cold way. You wondered on why's she like that, but you can wait for that. For now, it's time to duel some opponents in this tournament. You faced about three opponents in the first three rounds and best them and you go to take a break. On the way to a good spot to rest, you turned to see</span></div></div>",

You turned back to Akiza and you somehow see a reflection of yourself in her image. It means that she's an outsider, just like you. You also seen many other psychic duelists that suffered the same fate. You always asked yourself why do people with this sort of ability must be treated badly with such hatred. Then you begin to realize that they don't hate them, they're just scared of what you have. It's okay to be scared, but it's still no excuse to treat people this way. Especially with Akiza's actions towrds them, she has to know that two wrongs don't make a right and you'll have to prove it in this duel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, it's you again. I thought you wouldn't face me again after our last battle.\" Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you think. I'm gonna stop you from hurting these people.\" You said with bravery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why bother? These people only sees me as a monster and nothing more. Why would you protect these people?\" Akiza asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because two wrongs don't make a right. It's still no excuse to hurt them like this. It's taking it too far.\" You said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try saying that if you're in my shoes! Oh wait. You are because your just like me, a psychic duelist. Still think these people want your protection or even as their hero?\" Akiza wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's up to them, not me. I'm willing to help them regardless of what they think. Now, let's duel.\" You said as you activate your duel disk and Akiza activated hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza: 4000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou: 4000</span></div></div>",

Looks like this maybe the end for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna regret getting in my way, *your name*! Black Rose Dragon, finish him off with a direct attack!\" Akiza commanded her dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flower dragon launched purple flames with petals coming out of it's mouth at you and everyone thought it was over until.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I play the trap, Draining Shield! This negates your dragon's attack I gain life points equal it's attack points.\" You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to stop her attack and you life points went up fast as you absorbed it's power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou: 3800<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incredible! Just as we thought it was the end of *your name*, he manages to stay in the game and got a big boost to boot!\" The announcer said with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd went wild as this duel continues. Up in a high building by the stadium, there's two men watching how you're doing. One man is a grey haired one with a grey suit and has a picture of an hawk on it. The othe man is a blond one with purple eyes and wearing a white outfit. They seemed to be intrigued by this whole duel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a skilled one, I'll give him that. But, he still needs to turn this duel around or else he's gonna be in a world of pain.\" The blond guy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed, Jack. Let's hope his luck dosen't run out on his next turn.\" The grey guy said as he looks on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took deep breaths as even you was surprised that you survived the attack. Still, it's not over yet. You need to get a good card that can help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky defense. I place two cards face down and end my turn. Tell me something *your nane*, is it really worth it to throw your life away for people that doesn't want anything to do with you?\" Akiza wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were confused by that question, but you got an answer from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about it. All the so called good deeds that you have done for them will be for nothing as they'll betray you like i had to experience. Get it now? Our fate is to be outsiders and alone forever.\" Akiza said a little mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kinda get the memo on that talk. It's true, you thought that you'll be alone for good. And each day, it hurts worse with every day passing by. Still, if you decided to go what Akiza does for so long, you're only proving them right and that's not good for anyone. So, you can't do what she does and hope to bring her out of all of that sadness and rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true. People can sometimes don't understand what I have to go through. And they can be pretty cruel.\" You said with your head hanged down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why fight for something that's not worth fighting?\" Akiza wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a few seconds of silence and you still have your head down. You then picked your head up and give her your answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because there's still hope for peaceful connection between regular people and psychic duelists. I'll make sure it becomes a reality.\" You said with defiance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when your eyes starts glowing red and the winds for strong. Akiza was in shock by what she's seeing and she was in more shock when she saw you covered in flames. Then there were red markings in the arms of some people, Aliza included.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?!\" Akiza gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in blazes is going on?!\" Jack asked as his mark glowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the world?!\" Yusei gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza looked back at you as the flames around you got stronger and you draw your card and looked at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since Valhalla is still out, I can special summon the agent of miracles Jupiter.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when a red skinned man with wings coming down and gets ready to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJupiter: 1800 attack<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next. By sending a fairy monster from hand to the graveyard, since my feild spell is out, I can special summon one of my light fairy monsters. Return, Creation Venus!\" You commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour banished monster returned to the field and joins the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVenus: 1600 attack<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll play the trap Miraculous Decent. This allows me to bring back another fairy monster that's banished. Come on back, Wisdom Mercury!\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, another fairy joins the duel. This time, it's a blue one with it holding books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercury: 0 attack<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll play the spell, Mystic Wok. By sacrificing one if my monster, I gain life points equal to it's attack or defense. I'll sacrifice my Jupiter to gain 1800 life points.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJupiter was sacrificed and your life points as you feel power flowing three you. In the background, a man with red hair and a brown jacket was watching the duel and he too was shocked by your sudden transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incredible. I never knes that someone like him would possess such power. Heh heh. He could be perfect as my ultimate weapon.\" The man thought evilly of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou: 5600<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roared as power keeps coming out stronger. Akiza is trying to wonder on what sort of duelist are you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What are you?!\" Akiza asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm someone that understands you and want to be with you!\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza once again gasped at you for the words she thought she would never say about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I don't want you to keep on hurting others. If I had to beat you to do so, then so be it. Now, I banished Jupiter from the graveyard to summon Master Hyperion!\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJupiter was banished and out comes the same monster that Akiza fought with last night. Everyone else in the crowed was in disbelief by what's happening, including Yusei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activated Madter Hyperion's effect. By banishing a light fairy monster from the deck, I can destroy a card on the feild  so, he'll take out the one on my left.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyperion lights up some flames and her card was destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And since my field spell is out, I can use it's effect again.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyperion destroyed the last card on the field and now Akiza's got no back row left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid this is all but over. Now, I sacrificed Master Hyperion, Venus and Mercury in order to summon THE WINGED DRAGON OF RA!!\" You yelled out in a godlike voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow everyone's on total shock as they think that you're bluffing to have an Egyptian God Card. They were wrong as the sky got brighter and and you roared as the flames formed into the shape of the golden dragon. Akiza now feels like she's in a huge amount of trouble as she looks at the sun god itself. You go to finish the job, but not before giving her your apologie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me for this. Now, when Ra's summoned, I can give him all but 100 of my life points.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou: 100<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRa: 5500 attack<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now destroy Black Rose Dragon with Blaze Cannon!\" You commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRa launched a huge fireball at Black Rose Dragon and it roared before the flames obliterate it. Akiza was feeling the force and she was knocked down before her life points were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza: 0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh. The winner is *your name*.\" The announcer studdered by what just transpired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flames were gone and you passed out on the ground. Akiza sits back up to see you lying unconcious on the ground. She slowly gets up and looks back at the red haired man who ordered her to come to him. She looks back at you before leaving. She then remembered what you said before you won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(\"I'm someone who understands you and wants to be with you\")<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza gives you one final look before dissappearing. She also had a thought about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe that's what I want. I don't know.\" Akiza thought.</span></div></div>",

But it's not so that the author does nothing. Then when the the rays hit the right person its forms a connection between the Anime universe and the author which has effect that's he or she also sents rays back to the Anime universe which affect what's happens in it.But that isn't much influence just somethings like the weather,whispering a idear in the head of a person or a warning sometimes it works and it changes something or not. Then I happy to say to you that the people who live in the Anime universe decide in the end if they do what the author says or something else.So to make it short yes the people in Anime universe have their own free will, they make their own decisions and feel what they feel just their true emotions and feelings not any fake stuff.And last but not least when a certain time is over the Anime universe sents again information to the author of what then really happened in this time so author can write it and sents again idears for the future back to the Anime universe. This process repeats again and again until the series is  finished after that it stops  and the people in the Anime universe live happy on their own.

For the past few weeks, you have been plagued by several dreams that seem real. You find yourself in a kingdom that looks to be on the moon. You\u2019re a foot soldier in an army, one of the stronger ones though not as strong as what you deem the 'knights' of the kingdom. It's a figure of speech, as the knights are actually young women in sailor fukus. The last dream was the strongest, you found yourself fighting against an army of humanoid monsters. You held your own until you fought what looked to be a general. Involuntarily, you shudder as you remember being killed after a brief fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It felt so real though, like a past life</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug the thought off; you were never one for believing in reincarnation. You cut across a busy intersection at the green walking light. Your steps are faster than anyone around you. Without sounding smug, you are in better shape than most of your peers. You are coming back from a karate lesson. One of the top students, your stamina outweighs even some of the instructors. At this point, you\u2019re at one of the higher levels in the dojo, when you should be at the beginner stage. You\u2019ve even picked up some Jiu Jutsu as well. You've chalked it up to your unusual ability to process lessons faster, almost like your mind is a sponge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour inner rambling is brought to a halt by a little girl screaming. You notice her running into a abandoned house. It's almost as if she is being chased. \"What the hell?\" You start running towards the house; if the girl is in trouble you want to help. You think you see a flash of purple out of the corner of your eye, but when you turn it's gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the house at a brisk pace. You see the girl slump against a wall, terrified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" You call out; the girl turns to see you. She's crying, obviously scared. Closing the distance, you jump as the girl wraps you in a hug. You feel a little weird, being a stranger, but allow her to embrace you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! Help me...I'm being chased by a monster!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, you open your mouth when the ringing of bells and a feline meow catches your ears. Both of you watch as a figure appears in front of a window. Your mind can\u2019t process what your eyes are telling you. The figure had a feminine figure, wore a white dress, with her skin a shade of purple. Feline ears and tail gave her the look of a catgirl. A small part in the back of your mind finds her pretty, but you quash that thought from taking over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d You\u2019re in disbelief. A catgirl only exists in anime, and yet here was one standing in front of you. Landing gracefully on the floor, she stands upright and addresses you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m here for the girl\u2019s crystal that lies in her pure heart. Step aside.\u201d The voice carries an underlying threat; you know a fight will happen if you don\u2019t leave. Swallowing, you stand firm in front of the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d You adopt a defensive stance, one that would be quick to react to any movements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe catgirl looks at you, before grinning. \u201cFine by me. Time to sharpen my claws!\u201d She then launches herself at you. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Run!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warning barely leaves your lips before you dodge a set of claws. Your arm snaps up to parry a blow from the monsters other arm. You hear the girl run off to another part of the house. The cat monster tries to follow but you shift in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but you need to get through me first!\" She growls and swings her tail at you. Moving quickly, you jerk your head to side as the appendage almost takes it off. Adrenaline floods your body as you move on autopilot. Muscle reflex takes over as you dodge several strikes, and launch a few of your own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the Nell!\u201d The cat lady shouts as she jumps back from a punch. She launches another clawed hand at you. Quickly, you sidestep allowing her hand to get stuck in the wall. As she struggles to free it you quickly land a solid hit on her side. A second strike is thwarted as her tail wraps around your ankle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go flying as she flicks her tail.  A second later, you land flat on your back. Grunting in pain, you see the monster come towards you. You kick your legs up, hitting her in the stomach before catching her on the chin. To your surprise, you find your strength is enough to flip the monster over. She lands on her stomach, grunting as she pulls herself off the floor. Back on your feet, you assume a defensive stance as a voice rings out from the shadows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly a black hearted monster\u2019s targets a young girl!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and monster turn your attention to the voice. There is a group of young women wearing sailor-like outfits. Amazingly, they look exactly the same as the ones in your dreams. As one, the girls shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Sailor Senshi are here!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Really?</i>  You can\u2019t help but wonder why they\u2019re wasting time announcing their presence.  One of the scouts, in a red colored fuku, calls out to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing here? Get back!\u201d As she speaks, both she and another \u2018senshi\u2019 in a green colored fuku are surrounded by energy. You don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing, but you distance yourself from the catgirl just in case. The monster turns her attention to the newcomers, though she glances at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMars Burning Mandala!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSparkling Wand Pressure!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two attacking girls send their fire/lightning combo at the monster. Your eyes widen in amazement. The catgirl doesn\u2019t seem too disturbed. In fact, she\u2019s smirking; you don\u2019t know why until her tail flicks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch out!\u201d Your warning comes in time for the lightening based senshi to dodge as both attacks are reflected back. The fire senshi wasn\u2019t so lucky; she cried in pain while being slammed into a wall. The other two girls are able to get out of the blast zone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMars!\u201d You now know out the downed girl\u2019s name. You quickly counterattack while the catgirl is admiring her work. A fast kick catches her between the shoulder blades. You dart right as the tail comes up. As you fight, you call out to the other senshi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the little girl?!\u201d You parry an incoming claw as a blue haired girl calls out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s ok. Sailor Moon is taking her to safety.\u201d You give a quick nod, hoping this \u2018Sailor Moon\u2019 knows what she\u2019s doing. The monster changes tactics and aims a kick to your chest. You catch her foot with both hands. At the same time, you sweep a foot out and knock her off balance. The tail shoots out, forcing you back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on Nell!\u201d The catgirl shouts in frustration. Taking a stance, you can\u2019t help but wonder where the monster came from, and why she was after the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you?!\u201d Picking herself off the floor, she looks at you quizzically. The other senshi look confused as well. You pay them no attention; you stay alert in case the monster attacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to know who\u2019s giving me the fight of my life.\u201d Despite the danger, you never felt more alive! The catgirl tilts her head to the side, wondering if you lost her mind. The senshi have the same look, but say nothing. The catgirl takes a moment to respond. \u201cI\u2019m a Daimon.\u201d That answers nothing, but you continue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you attacking that poor girl?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m to take the crystal that\u2019s inside her pure heart. That why I was made.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMade? Who made you?\u201d You notice the senshi are now listening in, protecting the wounded Mars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy mistress is Kaolinite. I answer to her. That\u2019s all I know.\u201d Still not breaking your stance, you ask one final question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy answer your mistress? She\u2019s not helping you now.\u201d The monster\u2019s face goes blank, deep in thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2026that doesn\u2019t matter. My purpose is to get the crystal, at all costs.\u201d Flexing her claws, she looks ready to attack again. A small part of you is sad; you don\u2019t feel right fighting someone (or something depending on point of view) who can\u2019t choose for herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, but I won\u2019t let you hurt that girl.\u201d The senshi get ready to fight as well before voices ring out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWorld Shaking!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeep Submerge!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your horror, you realize that the new attacks are coming at you and the catgirl. Quickly, you flip to the side, avoiding the planet shaped orb. The monster was not so lucky, and took it full force. A feline screech hits your ears as she explodes into millions of pieces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s all you can say as the shockwave blows you off your feet. You land in a heap in front of the senshi. Picking yourself up, you glare at the two newcomers. The girl\u2019s seem just as shocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe girl\u2019s pure heart wasn\u2019t taken. We don\u2019t know if it had the talismans.\u201d The taller, blonde woman mutters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to wait and keep an eye out.\u201d Her compatriot, a senshi with long-blue hair replied. Looking disinterested, they started to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell was that all about?!\u201d You\u2019re mad at almost being killed. The blonde woman glares at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake no mistake; we\u2019re not allies with that group.\u201d She turns to leave, then makes one final statement. \u201cYou should spend more time fighting monsters than talking.\u201d With that, they disappeared. Still angry, your mood changes as you notice the pieces that were once the catgirl start to come together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as she puts herself back together. Stumbling, she holds her head in pain. \u201cI can\u2019t take that again.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words are picked up by the senshi, who quickly launch their attack. To their credit, they move in front of you to avoid hitting you. The monster reflects the blue haired girls attack, but gets hit with the other two. She screams again, but you can\u2019t see anything as the reflected attack fills the room with mist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpread out!\u201d The blonde senshi shouts as the unwounded trio moves out. By yourself, you wonder what to do next. Noticing the mist does not go all the way down on the floor, you lay flat on your belly and peer at where the monster was. The puzzle pieces are moving at a much slower pace. She forms up again, but it\u2019s clear to you the monster is in no shape for another round. Her cat ears perk up, as if someone is calling her. With catlike grace, she slinks out of an open window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Where\u2019s she going? </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, you slip away from the senshi and follow the monster. As she jumps up onto the roof of a nearby building, you climb up a ladder. On the roof, you call out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey stop!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She starts running and you give chase. You follow her as she jumps from one building to another. Crying out, you make the jump roughly before resuming the chase. The next jump makes you blanch as the monster jumps across the street. You stop before you become road pizza. Across the street, she smirks at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s not fair!\u201d She appears to laugh at your misfortune. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy mistress calls for me. Sayonara!\u201d With that, she waves at you before disappearing. The chase now done, you turn back to the old house, only to see the rest of the senshi standing in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have some explaining to do don\u2019t I?\u201d The long blonde haired senshi just nods. You groan; it\u2019s going to be a long day. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She winced slightly; the pain was lessening but still present. The Daimon frowned as she recalled what just happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I didn\u2019t think it was gonna be this hard! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a grunt as her feline figure straightened out. So far, her mission had been a disaster. It should have been a simple snatch and grab for her mistress. Instead, the purple skinned Daimon had tangled with the Sailor Senshi\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And that human.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her appearance and speech pattern, Nekonelle was not what a person would call stupid. All Daimons had an average amount of intelligence incubated in their egg form. Dr. Tomoe was not one to make his monsters brainless. She knew that an average human was no match for a Daimon in terms of strength or speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So how the Nell did he fight me?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feline monster contemplated how the human was able to keep her from taking the girls pure heart. As she jumped from rooftop to rooftop, Nekonelle could not help but keep thinking about the male. Like the animal she took traits from, she was curious. While her mission was still to find a pure heart crystal for her master, she wanted to learn more about the human who gave her one hell of a fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNekonelle!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sharp cry brought the Daimon to a halt. Startled, she looked up to see her mistress. Kaolinite stared down at her with cold eyes. Inwardly, Nekonelle gulped. She knew that a disappointed mistress was a dangerous one. Standing up straight, she addressed the witch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMistress!\u201d She bowed at the end of her statement; it was an involuntarily gesture, meant to placate the woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou failed to bring me the pure heart.\u201d The woman\u2019s words stung Nekonelle; she knew how dangerous the situation was. The Daimon stumbled for words, trying to explain herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was attacked by the Sailor Senshi, and a human male got between me and the targ-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cTHAT\u2019S IT!?\u201d</b> <br>\r\nKaolinite stopped Nekonelle from her defense. The feline Daimon shuddered at the harsh words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were designed to kill the senshi if needed, and a human?! They are weak and should not be a problem. You failed against an inferior enemy!\u201d The witch was furious, and looked down at Nekonelle like she was nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I\u2019m sorry mistress.\u201d The Daimon was truly afraid; she knew that the witch had to power to kill her. \u201cIt\u2026it won\u2019t happen again. I will find the pure heart.\u201d Nekonelle finished the sentence with determination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho said you\u2019re getting a second chance?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Daimon looked at her mistress with fear as Kaolinite raised her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe do not tolerate failures, die!\u201d The blast hit Nekonelle before she could dodge. The energy blasted her into a set of power lines. She let out a feline screech as the energy and electricity mixed. The red witch watched as the Daimon fell into an alleyway below. She scoffed at having the deal with trash, before disappearing. <br>\r\nUnknown to her, the blast had not killed Nekonelle. The Daimon was, for all intents and purposes, unconsciousness. She lay there unmoving for hours, unknown to the passersby\u2019s of the city. Soon, the sun dipped below the horizon, angry clouds blocking the moon. Thunder soon followed. <br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________<br>\r\nRaindrops woke Nekonelle up. Her attempts to move brought waves of pain. Moaning, the monster curled into a ball. The rain came down heavier, soaking her dress and hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster cried softly, shocked and hurt by the betrayal. Now, the Daimon didn\u2019t know what to do. Defeated, she lay there, whimpering as pain kept wracking her body. Slowly, she brought her fingers to her mouth. Pulling them away, she saw\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Blood? </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t make sense for Nekonelle to have blood. She ignored this as she struggled to bring herself upright. The night had become chilly, and a small part told her that she had to find shelter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cBut where do I go?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n She spoke to herself. Wincing, she stood up shakily as the pain was becoming bearable. She started walking, trying to find a sense of where to go. The streets were deserted; everyone was keeping out of the downpour. After what seemed like hours, she was ready to give up and brave the rain when she saw him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The human from before? </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was carrying a bag of groceries, and quickly ducked into a building. Looking, Nekonelle realized it was a house. It was a simple two story house with a small balcony. Biting her lip, the Daimon contemplated her next action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe if I ask nicely?\u201d It was a long shot, but Nekonelle had no other options. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were born a Britannian and you are nobility within the social class. Your parents aren't royals but a respected friend of one of the heirs to the throne. You were close to one of the royal families, mainly Lelouch and Nunnally vi Britannia. You didn't know them well but you spent some time together, and they always liked you. However when news struck that they were exiled and their mother dead, then later presumed the siblings perished during the invasion of Japan you took the news quite hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears later, now a respected young man having his whole life ahead of him, you were at Ashford Academy to study abroad while you were preparing to finish your last couple years in highschool. Normally this would be saved for college, but your plans involved getting a job close to home, so this would be a good chance to have a taste of freedom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad was supportive but disagreed very much with your choice of setting. Seeing how many attacks occurred through the continent, he was concerned for your safety, however you managed to get into the school and thus far have had no incidents. You arrived at the gate and walked on campus just carrying your things. You headed to your dorm room, from there you unpacked and walked around the campus hoping to see new faces. However things took a dramatic turn when you were greeted by the student council, and among them was someone you believed to be dead, Lelouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDD HIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!\", the tall blonde one cried out. \"Welcome to Ashford Academy, here our policy is have fun, or have a nice life because you're never going to have it be this exciting again. Now normally we'd be doing this event on the holiday but here we do things out of order.\", the same girl handed you a note with a heart shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were far too shocked to see Lelouch alive and well, with him feeling just as in shock as you were. \"Allow me to introduce myself and our council, I'm Milly Ashford, this is Lelouch Lamperouge , Shirley Fenette, Rivalz Cardemonde, Nina Einstein, and our unofficial member is right behind us Nunnally.\", Milly introduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust seeing Lelouch was enough to make you stand still in disbelief but Nunnally caused you to flat out freeze like a statue. \"Big brother, is there someone new were meeting?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered when she still had her sight, and ran around the gardens when you were children. Now she is blind and in a wheelchair. She may have been disabled, but her lovely smile still managed to form one even in her present condition, enough that it warmed your heart and mind enough to break you out of your shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madame president do you mind me and ths student talked in privet for a bit with my sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Lulu what do you mean?\", Shirley reacted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just happened to realize he's an old friend of ours. It's been years do you think we can steal him for just a while?\", Lelouch insisted. You guessed it was due to his nobility stance he wanted to make sure you wouldn't speak of it accidentally to the wrong people. So you played along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll happily introduce myself until I catch up Miss Ashford.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure sure, go on.\", she allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou Lelouch and Nunnally entered your room and locked it. For a moment you both stood in silence, then you broke it by hugging Lelouch and gently getting Nunnally in it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So bloody happy to see you two!\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNunnally for a moment couldn't recognize who you were, she never met you again when she was disabled, but she took a minute to recognize  you when she heard your voice. \"Is it you? (Name)?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Nunnally! Oh my goodness, you look beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I must admit you surprised me.\", Lelouch replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're both alive? Why didn't you say something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our father exiled us here, the girl, Milly, her family is keeping us hidden here while we keep our names hidden. We've been here for a while now, but so far things have been good.\", Lelouch explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I heard about being exiled. Listen I'm amazed your here and alive, I missed you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did we (Name), I remember how we used to play together.\", Nunnally recalled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Those were good times. Did you know we were here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. No idea. I'm here to complete my final two years, nothing more. Don't worry, I won't tell anyone about you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. You were one of the few people back home we missed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I missed you guys too.\", you replied feeling very glad to have managed to be talking to them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) today is our school heart event, were supposed to give a special card to someone we like and then on Valentines day we get them back and write our feelings of that person on the back. I wasn't planning on giving any, but I made one in case, take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed you a heart shaped letter like Milly's only Nunnally's had words in them, Milly's only had just the who sent it stuff.  You gave Nunnally that card as a way of returning the favor. \"Here since I feel the need to give you something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll talk later, right now you should be acquainted with the others.\", Lelouch insisted.</span></div></div>",

His throat was tight with thirst, body quivering in fear. Finally, the chamber was cleared. He pulled another cartridge from his belt, thumbing it into the breech. He just started to rise to fire at a charging Indian when... </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're not too busy Thompson-san, we have a disturbance at the front gate.\" You hastily put the pad of paper out of the speakers line of sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...Ms. Haya- I mean Hayashi-sensei. Sure, no problem.\" You stammer, quickly replacing the western honorific for a Japanese one. It's a relief that Kyoko has her back turned, so she won't see the blush on your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you an inspiring writer Thompson-san?\" She turns to give you a quizzical look. You feel your whole face heat up in embarrassment. You try to keep your writing secretive, feeling that it's no good for public consumption. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing to be ashamed about. I would like to read your work sometime.\" She gives a disarming smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rea-really?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I don't know much on American culture than what's on television. I'm hoping to broaden my horizons.\" Turning back, she continues her stride towards the gate. You shrug in indifference. Secretly, you were hoping that her reading your work would signify liking you, but oh well. Besides, she seemed pretty happy with Teshima last time you checked, and your not the man to wreck a relationship for your own sake. Inwardly, you sigh. It's been over a year, as you still have little friends. It may have something to do with the fact that your the only American in the Academy, having been accepted into an exchange program just shortly after earning your Masters. You've been teaching the student world history while writing on the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here. What's that man doing?\" Kyoko's voice snaps you to attention. You see a strange man banging himself against the main gate. Off to your left, you see a group of P.E. teachers coming to meet him, Teshima included in their ranks. As the two groups merge to confront the threat, you can't help but feel uneasy toward the stranger. He seems...off. </span></div></div>",

You see the redheads face flush with anger at the mans insolence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't leave right now, we'll call the po-.\" She stops as Teshima lays a hand on her shoulder. You tense up slightly, deriding yourself for feeling jealous when the two of you are only co-workers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Hayashi-sensei. We don't have to call the police yet.\" He rolls up his sleeve and gives her a wink. \"We just have to show this guy who's boss.\" Inwardly, you groan. While you don't personally have a problem with Teshima, his mannerisms do rub you the wrong way. Still, you feel that it's a bad idea for the P.E. teacher to get physical with the vagrant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Teshima, careful. Something about that guy is not right.\" At this, he laughed and shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I thought Americans solved their problems this way.\" He turned his back to you, missing the look of fury on your face from the ignorant remark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look here you son of a bitch!\" Teshima grabs the man by the collar and slams him against the gate. You curse at the show of brutality. You move to stop Teshima when his face changes to one of worry. The next few seconds seem a blur, and you barely register that Teshima is on the ground, clutching his bloodied arm and screaming. Looking up, you see the man continue to flail at the gate, bits of blood and flesh dangling from his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jesus Christ!</i> Excited, you slip into your native English tongue. Teshima thrashes around for a seconds, before he stops moving all together. The rest of the group is silent, Kyoko is close to crying. She notices Teshima stirring again, and appears relieved. You, however, notice that he now has the same look as the vagrant. The redhead fails to notice this as she leans closer. He grabs her by the arm, intent on sinking his teeth into her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get back!\" You grab the back of her blouse and roughly throw her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you doing!\" Kyoko sounds furious at your action. Another assistant, who's name you can not remember, starts to reprimand you. He barely gets two words out before Teshima grabs him and bites his throat. You back up in horror along with Kyoko. Her face is pale, full of fear and revulsion. Teshima drops his victim, and starts to shamble towards the two of you. Out the corner of your eye, you see the last teacher run for the main entrance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrenaline is pumping through your body. You have to act fast.</span></div></div>",

She starts to hurry down the stairs, umbrella clutched tightly in her left hand. Though she is not in your class, you can't help but be concerned at her appearance. You start to move up the stairs to greet her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, ar-\" Whatever else you have to say is lost as you see Yukari slip on a step. Her umbrella goes flying as she tumbles down the stairs. It seems as if time stands still as the umbrella sails besides your head. Out of the corner of your eye, you see the umbrella unfurl, as if possessed, and arrayed straight up with the metallic end pointed out. Your mind barely recognizes that the point is aimed at Yukari's neck before you spring into action. Your eyes briefly met with hers as you attempt to catch the class rep. There's a crash, and you hear a feminine scream as you hit the floor. There's a mass pinning your left arm to the floor. You struggle to get up and reorient yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakuragi-san, are you alright?\" Your head is swimming, so you don't hear the whimpering for a few seconds. As soon as you do though, your gape at what happened. Your actions saved Yukari from certain death, but the umbrella is embedded in her right arm. Her eyes are welling with tears as pain wracks her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god!\" Your at her side in an instant. Yukari shifts in discomfort, causing the point to loosen. Blood starts pouring freely out, soaking her uniform. Her eyes widen in panic as the sight. Stopping, you ripe a sleeve off to form a crude bandage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I'm right here.\" You place the bandage against the wound, restricting the flow of blood. Yukari is still in a lot of pain, but is becoming more coherent. You feel her squeeze your free hand as she speaks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ple...please don't leave.\" She's still freaked out over the ordeal. You give her a reassuring smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, I'm not going anywhere.\" Your words soothe her. Whatever else there is to say is lost as paramedics arrive. You look up the stairs to see a teacher and student, one of them must have called the hospital. You stay with Yukari until she's wheeled into the ambulance. You want to go with her, but the paramedics refuse. Your not a relative. You watch the ambulance take off into the rain, hoping...praying that she will be alright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mikawa, are you hurt?\" You turn your head, puzzled by the teachers question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine sensei, why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your shirt.\" Looking down, you see your uniform shirt covered in blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...sorry sensei.\" He pats your shoulder in sympathy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did the right thing Mikawa. I'll let you out early today. Go home and get changed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend only a few minutes to collect your belongings before heading home. You can't stop thinking about Yukari, and whether or not you should visit her. </span></div></div>",

You thought. \"Cool!\" :D<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay on your bed wondering how to not make your week dull, until you felt like rewatching one of your favorite animes. Particularly you feel like starting off with Puella Magi Madoka Magica. You don't know why, but you were always into that anime as the characters are loveable, story is deep and everything was just plain awesome. You turn on your TV and start up your video streaming service. You smile as you selected the anime and let the 1st episode roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man I love this show.\" You said when you got to the point where Madoka and Sayaka meet up with Mami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou always like the girls of the anime. You closed your eyes and thought about what it would be like to meet them in real life. After Mami saved the day and all that jazz. You got to the final scene of the 1st episode where Kyubey gets up and said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you make a contract with me, and date a magical girl!\" Kyubey said as you were still deep in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could met the girls in person.\" You smiled when Kyu... wait a second, what did that fur ball just said? \"I-I don't remember Kyubey saying...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to grab the remote until the power suddenly went out. You got up from your spot, only to felt the intense pain at your chest. You fell on the floor trying to endure the pain, wondering what's going to happen to you. You lie on the floor as the room grew dark and your body going numb. The last thing you saw was a close up face of Kyubey on the television screen before finally falling into your blissful sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up from what felt like days of sleep, and you were...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One was wearing a blue and white dress with short light blue hair and a cutlass in her hand, while the other one was wearing a red and black dress with long red hair and a big spear in her hand. The blue one enter your room with a curious look as the red one enter with a big grin on her face... oh and she had a pocky in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, who are you and what are you doing?\" Ask the girl in blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fixing this like it really matters.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly realize that two people barged in your own home.

Geez.\" The girl in blue sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You're saying I can't have fun when we're witch hunting? You need to lighten up Sayaka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm the one who needs to lighten up?

I guess we're awesome if you heard of us from somewhere. Though just for the record I'm more awesome then this newbie here.\" Kyoko smiled as Sayaka glance at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting a second for your brain to catch up, you immediately realize the situation you're in. Magical girls. Witch labyrinth. Somehow, you are in what you thought was a anime. Your whole body started to tremor with excitement because of this. Sayaka notice this and said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey are you alright?\" Sayaka walk over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I must... I must be in...\" You said calmly before yelling. <font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\"MITAKIHARA!!!\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yelled out so loud the entire labyrinth heard your voice. The two magical girls had to cover their ears from this, but who could blame you? Anyone could react like that if they fell into a world of anime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! There's no need yell that loud!\" Kyoko said in a annoyed voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I kinda felt like it.\" You smiled as you rub the back of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...

Now let the story commence!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see that the whole crowd has gone into a total frenzy and you heard screaming all over. You look around trying to break free of all the people going into mass hysteria. Then you see your two best friends gunning for the edge of the world as it were now. \"Guys hey!\", you call out. They don't hear you as they are in a total panic. \"Stop! NO! HEY! Get out of my way!\", you push and shove everyone trying to commit suicide seeing how they believe there is no escape but death. You see others going in another direction with your buddies following them. They are already in line to execute themselves by falling out of the floating castle. But you grab the both of them and try to talk sense into them. \"Guys! What the hell has gotten into you two?! Pulsar, Dodger?!\", you yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no way out but there. What if he's lying?\", Pulsar said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't stand the idea of living out this nightmare man. If we die here then were dead for real! We suck at MMO's remember! Were going to die!\", Dodger furthered their argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up the both of you guys! Listen to me ok! Were not going to die! Listen to me, we can survive. I'm no beta tester and no wizard at VMMO's but I can promise you guys are going to live to see the real world again!\", you stood up. \"I can promise you that by letting you do two things. You can either stay and wait for it to happen or help me make a guild and we help clear this thing! I won't force you into it but I will not let my best buds kill themselves. Alright?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I appreciate that man. I...I'll help you!\", Dodger said with confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you Pulsar? You in?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I can't. I'm a lousy MMO player and I'll only slow you two down. I'll just play it safe until it's over.\", he said trying to act strong in his descion when he was too afraid to venture and fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be stupid man! We can't split up. C'mon were all like brothers together.\", Dodger said trying to convince him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puls, if you want to wait for this to be cleared then wait.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! C'mon!\", Dodger resented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dodge I don't want to see him get killed because we forced him into it.\", you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey if it means anything I'll try and hold the fort down here. I won't sit by and do nothing.\", Pulsar stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK buddy. Save as many lives as you can and help others who can't go and fight the bosses.\", you said patting him on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be in touch guys.\", Pulsar left to go and try to help some of the younger players.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK Dodge c'mon we have to go and start finding spots to rack up exp.!\", you said. You ran out into the wild fields and went hunting for things to fight. \"OK first we build up our exp., then we start finding some people to recruit to our guild.\", you planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Pulsar?! He's just going to stay and wait for it to end?\", Dodger asked confused on what he'd be doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry he'll do more than that trust me. He may not be strong but he has skills in other areas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so your quest for survival began.....</span></div></div>",

With how slow things have been moving it's amazing how long me and Dodger survived. Our levels are low unlike the people who are tackling the front lines. Dodger's level is above mine marginally but were both not cut for this sort of thing. I've argued with Dodger over whether we should be in the front lines and sticking in the rear positions. We get decent item drops more frequently and we have a high chance of survival. I dismissed the idea since even with that plan in mind we'd still get cut to ribbons. I try to play as the altruistic hero but this isn't a game. This is life as we know it, and that means I'll some day make the 'tough' choices. The kind Dodger is more than aware of from his experiences. Pulsar is at least doing well but none of us will if we can't clear the first floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Dodger sat down for the meeting to see the high level players sit down. Most were anxious to know what they were going to do, you were just hoping this was going to mark the day when the 1st floor was cleared and not some poor strategy that would fail. A player in blue came down in center and told the crowd his plan, it was basic moral raising at first but soon he explained where the dungeon was located and how the force would work together. All item drops are shared among everyone. Dodger wanted to protest but you stopped him not wishing to make things harder. The meeting was adjourned and everyone left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you do that! That's bull and you know it!\", Dodger protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dodge we need to do this if were going to work together, besides it's only until we clear the boss. After that it's back to normal.\", you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen I know we share our item drops but you got all these dudes who are going to try and hog all the good ones. And we don't have a say in who gets what Kestrel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tough shit, don't want to share then don't show up tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't give me that Kestrel, I always had your back since day 1.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you'll have my back tomorrow. See you around buddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK fine goddammit. I'll show up, but I won't like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you left to go alone for a while to head into town to stock up on some gear. As you passed an ally-way you noticed a hooded figure sitting with a girl in brown hair shivering in fear. You eavesdropped wondering what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise you OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asuna I'm afraid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am too. But we need to hang on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I'll try.\", the brown haired girl calmed down and wiped her tears away. 'Asuna' hugged her and ran off somewhere. You stepped in the ally and decided to offer help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\", you said with friendliness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH! You spooked me! Uhh No! I'm fine in case you were about to ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK then, sorry but it's depressing seeing people well......depressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that an attempt at a joke? Cuz' it stunk.\", she jabbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you have poor taste in words, or have a limited vocabulary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind I'll just go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey whats the hurry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big day tomorrow, large groups going to clear floor 1.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh your part of the front-lines? I know one of them, she'll be there tomorrow. In that case I'll let you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok thanks, um?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisbeth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kestrel.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The very next day it was time. The time had come to take on the first boss. It was a long walk, but the boss room was right in front of you and you were ready to fight. You were on another team while Dodger was on another. At first you felt a little uneasy for not being with Dodger, but you knew that he would be fine. After all you and he leveled up so you two could handle yourselves. You looked around at all the people in your group. There was no one that you recognized except for Asuna. She was standing close to the side standing next to a young man in a blue with black hair. He was of course Kirito, but you didn't know this yet. You didn't know why but when you saw him, you could tell that he was unlike the other players. Something about him made you curious about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKestrel thinking: I wonder who that guy is? He looks like he's got some experience on this. Could he be one of those beta testers I heard about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a beta tester who was leading the battle named Diavel stepped in front of the door and turned to his comrades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiavel: Listen up everyone. I only have one thing to say to you. Let's win this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Diavel symbolically opened the door and you all entered the boss room. It was very dark and quiet. Suddenly the room lit up and a giant creature jumped out and landed right in front you. The creature was two meters tall, muscular, had bloodthirsty copper eyes and he wielded a giant bone ax and a leather shield. It was the first boss, Illfang the Kobold Lord. Just after it appeared a couple of smaller creatures called the Ruin Kobold Sentinels appeared next to him. Then all of the creatures charged at you at once. Diavel gave the command and everyone charged as well. Both sides grew closer and closer until both sides clashed and the battle began. The group was split into seven parties in groups of six named by the letters A through G. Groups A through C focused on fighting the boss while Groups D through F attacked the sentinels. Diavel stayed in the back giving out the orders of when which team was to switch and which team was to fall back. You were in group D so your group was fighting a sentinel. Dodger was in group E along with Asuna and Kirito. The sentinels were quick, but you and your groups were slowly getting the advantage. At the moment, you were fighting one of the sentinels. Your swords clashed again and again, but the sentinel was starting to overwhelm you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKestrel: Damn it! This guy is starting to get annoying!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the sentinel charged at you with incredible speed. It was so fast that you didn't react in time and you were about to get slashed, but then you were saved. Kirito got in front of you and defended you with his sword and Asuna charged in at the sentinel and killed it with excellent swordsmanship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKestrel: Whoa! Thanks! You saved me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito: Don't stop now! Keep on the pressure!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKestrel: Right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKestrel thinking: Man! Those two are amazing! That guy saved me and had a good reflexes. And Asuna.....she's on a whole new level. I didn't even see her sword move! Awesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Dodger who was fighting another Sentinel snapped you out of your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDodger: Hey! Kestrel! Get the lead out! We still got a boss to beat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKestrel: Oh! R-right! Got it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Illfang let out a roar which caused you to look back. From the looks of it, it was on the ropes and it's health bar which originally had four was know on his last bar and it was in the red. It threw aside his axe and shield and roared again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDodger: Hey! That boss is in the red! Alright! A few more hits and this'll be all over!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKestrel: Be careful Dodger! We may be winning, but don't get cocky! The real fight is about to get started! Stick to the plan! We gotta get ready to surround it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiavel: No! Stand back! Leave this to me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKestrel: What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you had a chance to react, Diavel had ran right passed you and charged straight at Illfang activating a sword skill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDodger: What the heck is he doing?!? Is he nuts?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't say anything. All you could do was look on with worry. Then Illfang grabbed something from behind his back. You expected to be a Talwar, but you would soon learn that you were wrong. Then Kirito shouted trying to warn him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito: Stop! Get out of there! You're going to die!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Diavel kept charging. Then Illfang jumped from pillar to pillar in blinding speed. Then before Diavel knew what had happened Illfang gave a mighty swing and hit Diavel. Then it appeared behind Diavel and slashed him again. Diavel was sent flying and sprawling to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDodger: Oh no! It got Diavel!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKestral: The fool! Why the heck did he charge in like that?!? We must help him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Illfang landed right in front of you and let out a ferocious roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKestral: Damn it! There's no time for this1 Diavel needs help! I gotta get over there and give him a potion!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDodger: No way! Are you nuts?!? Like you said we need to stick to the plan! We have to fight without him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKestral racked his brains trying to figure out what he should do. Without Diavel leading them, they might lose. Or worse. Then.....</span></div></div>",

Prepare for attack! 1st squads - 4 defensive positions and wait to evade on my mark!\", Dodger yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell are you doing?!\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting ready for that thing to attack and making sure our main force doesn't get wiped out! Honestly that's all I got! Welcome to throw me ideas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought what to do when Illfang finished its attack but then it swung its sword and hit the ground causing a big shock wave in front of the attack force. The center units got wiped out with most of them being killed from the damage output. You and Dodger were lucky having been far enough to evade and not get too hurt from it. Then you saw Illfang roar again and snarl. \"Everyone! I want all remaining to head straight for it in wedge formation! When it attacks we split up in the middle and go right for the bastard!\", you called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everyone just accepting any plan as a good one they just went along and followed your orders. You then all charged straight for the boss and waited to split up. \"Wait for it!\", you yelled. Splitting up too soon would result in it swiping all of you in half. Needed to move when he tries to squash all of you at ounce. Illfang held up the sword again and was going to attack. You weren't sure when, you couldn't predict it in time you worried. Then you heard Dodger yell, \"NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone split up and most managed to evade in time with a few getting caught in the attack. The players all ganged up and attacked the boss causing its health to lower. But not fast enough, then out of nowhere you saw Asuna and Kirito go right for Illfang super quickly. Their speed was incredible. In just mere moments they both dispelled the 1st boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the boss destroyed the same way players die in-game, a screen appeared saying the 1st boss is cleared. After an entire month the first boss was beaten. You and Dodger were still alive. You looked around, players cheering and mourning the loss of their friends and comrades. You saw Kirito checking his inventory like he received something special. Everyone gravitated towards him for dealing the final blow, but then you and Dodger both got some pats on the back for leading the group. It all seemed like a victory until...someone yelled out, \"Why did you let Diavel die?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\", you said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He knew the bosses pattern! If he told us he wouldn't have died! Your a beta tester aren't you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it! We beat the boss! So what if he knew, he warned him the moment he saw that thing attack. Get a grip guys!\", Dodger said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehehehehahhahahahahahahhahahaaaa! Don't compare me to those scrubs!\", Kirito laughed. \"Out of the thousand testers they had no idea how to level up! I made it higher than any of them and I know things no informant or broker knows. I faced bosses much higher than this one. I know more than that too.\", he boasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell Kirito?\", you thought. Was he telling the truth?! Was he that good?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your a cheater!\" \"No worse than a beta tester!\" \"Your a beater! \"YEAH A BEATER!\", random people said. Soon as the term beater seemed to be his main title, he seemed to relish in his new found infamy. He selected an item from his menu and out came a black cloak giving him a prominent look. \"I like it. I am a beater then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon as he said that he left to explore the 2nd floor. Asuna followed him but your attention was drawn away when Dodger came by. \"If we ever see that guy again we have got to find out what he knows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dodger, there is little chance he meant it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe he knows enough to get us ahead of the game! You gotta back me up on this dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll deal with it later. For now lets see what we got from the boss and start building a guild.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great idea, we got the crowd on our side with how directed the assault. We got this game in the bag.\", Dodger said confidently.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the first boss was defeated you and Dodger formed a small group named the Marauders. A group tasked with hitting the richest spots in the games with the best loot and experience. However while ambitions were high your results were a lot to be desired. While everyone kept leveling and sharing equally the group was mostly comprised of inexperienced and naive players. They lacked what brought the term high risk high reward to definition. For at least a two solid months your group held out on their own fine. But with each floor you all moved up to along with the people charging the front lines, it all began to strain. Dodger was under the belief that by aiding the front line guilds they would be strong enough to last through the game. As extra muscle it would be easier to find work for jobs and such. Being mercenaries for various jobs were consistent with simply body guarding, assistance in battle for high difficulty side quests, or bringing in wanted players. But it was clear that the guild was simply not strong enough to make it if they kept at the pace of the front-line guilds. A discussion was what brought you and Dodger to converse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to keep up with the Kestrel. We can do what they're doing just fine. They're just scared they'll die, which I don't blame them for. But they need to toughen up, if they want to go home then they gotta be willing to die trying. You know this better than most.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but there should come a time to slow the momentum. I think, instead we should spend the next couple weeks staying in this floor and leveling up everyone. Also I think we need to begin refurbishing our equipment. Were out of extra weapons for the others, and we need to start getting some high quality weapons. Ones that will last, were spending too much on new ones that last about a few weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your absolutely right. They're not going to survive if we keep this up, so we'll stay behind for a while. But when the next floor opens then we go back to helping the front.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I think we should keep leveling until we go at least a 5 extra levels before we go to to aid the front line guilds. If we do that then were more liekley to stand together with them for the other bosses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but can I say something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm thinking of leaving the Marauders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and me, leave them. I've been working with these guys for a while now and I think they can survive without us now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dodger you can't be serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just so tired of those guys weighing me down. It's easier when it was just you and me, in other games we knew what we needed to do to look out for each other. So why have them holding us back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh....listen dodger there is nothing more than I'd love than to go back to that. But we have a responsibility to them. And were what's keeping them alive. Look, were both at close to 27 lvl, and the others are behind by about one or two lvls. That doesn't mean they have the skills and experience to survive like us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be perfectly honest they annoy the shit put of me. And that one girl is barley up to snuff, she'll never make it. Besides I overheard about them changing our names from the Marauders to the Black Cats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're trying to match pace with us Dodge. But maybe we should start going at theirs for a little while. We need to be a team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kestrel I love your optimism and your a goody two-shoes. But your also my bestest bud in the world, or game whatever you call it. They are not. And besides it's not uncommon for people to bail out after a while. Just you and me. And we'll get more loot, exp., and best of all we worry only about ourselves and our troubles are only our troubles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Dodger were friends way back IRL and it still carried over in game since the day it all changed when SAO was a death game. You saved him from ending it all right at the start. You knew that he made some sense and you felt bad about leaving, but ultimately Dodger's argument to leave proved to be too convincing and you agreed. Before however leaving the group in charge to the second in command, you all had a heartfelt goodbye and no hard feelings. They appreciated the techniques and safety strategies you helped them learn which they planned to use to keep each other alive. And as you left them, there was a matter of looking to get your own equipment refurbished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Dodger asked around looking for a decent smith to revitalize your weapons and armor, but they all pointed to NPC shops. \"Thank you. Gah 8th person that pointed us to the same place. NPC's are good for the cheap stuff but we need someone who KNOWS how to make great stuff.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A player smith? Wait a second, I remember on that one assignment while we hunted a player.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it the one who stole all those fat loots or the one who swindled five guilds who ended up being a hot woman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That still shocked me why was it that person was like a playboy model in a VRMMO? Never knew why, but yeah that one. See when we asked around I talked to this one person who said they had some mace wielder in his group that was leveling to be a smith. At least that's what I got from what he said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know how we can reach him then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what to do. Hang around town for a while I retrieve that number of our new smith friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright good-luck Dodger.\"</span></div></div>",

Soon as you made it to the floor you were immediately greeted by Dodger who acted like all your problems were solved. \"Kestrel my man we are getting the greatest deal since we bagged that bounty alive for twice the profit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Explain quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found that guy I told you about, I tracked him down and we got to talking, and he hooked us up with a sweet deal. And it all hinges on you dude. You play along we get an enormous discount on what we get there. Top grade equipment at a low price with the best smith in all of SAO. We are freaking set.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, what do I need to do exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just say you heard she's the best smith in SAO and she'll cut us a deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, since you told me exactly that, I don't feel the need to con my way into this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAAAA! Oh jeez you are funny bro, that's why I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you made it to the smith shop, the sign said Lisbeth's blacksmith shop. \"Hope she's hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dodger could you maybe keep that to yourself and not speak it out loud.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just saying so were on the same page. Your thinking the same thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon you ever think about women like they're attractive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but I'm subtle with my thoughts on that. A word you are scarcely aware of.\", the moment Dodger opened the door you were greeted by a pretty cute girl with pink hair, a pin in her hair with freckles and welcomed you with a pleasant greeting. \"Welcome to Lisbeth's blacksmith shop how may I help you today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So lovely...\", you said dazzed. Dodger was trying his best not to burst into laughter but tried to remain composed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi my friend and I are hehe looking to get our stuff improved. Pfffffft, sorry I need a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisbeth turned to you wondering what was the deal. You looked like you had seen a miracle but you came back to life when she waved her hand near your face. \"Hey, hello? Anyone alive in there?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely that weapon right there is the most lovely craftsmanship I have seen in game.\", you tried saving yourself from embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow I guess you have a great eye. I call this little sword my masterpiece.\", she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your head you couldn't believe that worked but kept it going trying not to look awkward. \"I heard your the best smith in the game so we went here to get the best.\", you said going off of what Dodger said to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He, I'll bet someone told you to say that thinking you could get a bargain. Well nice try.\", she said with snark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I specifically was told that you were the best smith in this game. I'm no genius at this but the finest weapons I have seen which are ranging from one decent axe to a moderately feasible sword pale in comparison to the common expert level quality made weapons I'm looking at right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehe. Ok that deserves a shave off the price. So what do you looking to get fixed up?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you answered you noticed a staff on display which caught your attention. \"Hey...what's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of that's just a cheap wooden staff. It's useless but looks nice so I hang it like a decoration. I was experimenting with different types of swords.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you making with his one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A regular bow staff but it's not very effective.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever think about housing blades on the ends of it, like a double balded staff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gasp! Why didn't I think of that? Gah that's what I was missing! What are you interested in one. Cuz I'll make it for you, but it won't cost cheap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me we got enough for this. Also there is something I'd want that would be very useful if possible to install.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well give me the details later right now how about I fine tune your default weapon you got right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\", you took out your sword and handed it to her, she went to the back and began working on it.</span></div></div>",

She's a looker man, she's cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dodger I will bury you if you don't shut your trap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are just so easy to tease my friend. I mean it takes great skill to poke fun of how you act all responsible and adult like, yet when your out of your element your a deer in headlights. Women is not your element, neither is doing 'adult things' which is ironic since you seem to be so mature and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look I may not jump at the chance at having my first beer like you did when were not even legally allowed, but I defended your secret because your like a brother to me man. So one of us has to be responsible on some degree so we don't get ourselves killed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh no worries. I've always hated but respected that about you. Now what weapon should I start getting proficient with? Axe! No. Lance! Nawwww, to many compensating assumptions. AH! There it is, the jousting one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would associate that with somebody who has class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. Look at me ladies I'm the classiest man in the online world. Just look at these muscles and my 4-pack.\", Dodger kept showing off but you were smiling and trying to hold back your laughter. But not because his showing off was ridiculous when it was, but because Lisbeth came back from her backroom with an awkward expression. Dodger turned to see why you were laughing and was completely embarrassed by having done that while she was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh.....\", Lisbeth answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'll just take my weapon and go now.\", Dodger said sheepishly walking out of the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That guy is just all sorts of weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you've known him as long as I have, you tend to see MUCH weirder. Worse thing is he's a lot saner than you'd imagine so that means were surrounded by wackos more nuttier than him.\", you joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehe. Well anyway I'll take your sword now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wait a sec. I have had an idea of what I need, I need it so.....whisper whisper..........possible to manage that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh I don't know. Frankly I doubt I could craft something like that to a double bladed sword.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I am willing to go fight tooth and nail for that thing because single swords aren't my thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you'd be willing to help me make it then I suppose I could try. But you help me EVERY step of the way, I won't bust my butt alone on this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then, knew it was a good thing to come to you for this. But I'm more interested in seeing how good you really are Lisbeth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you better be something spectacular if your planning to use something as heavy and complicated as a double edged sword, Kestrel was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's my name Kestrel.

Dodger using his wrist swords knocked away a lackey before it had a chance to hit him. Then he parried another attack from an incoming lackey and slashed him in the stomach knocking him back. You stood next to Lisbeth protecting her. Lisabeth wielded her spike mace and bashed a lackey with it. Another lackey came at her from behind and attempted to hit her with his ax, but you blocked it using your sword and then attacked with by slashing him in the shoulder. You made quick work of him, but then two more lackeys came. You just knocked back the first lackey when the second came at you wielding an ax. You dodged the ax narrowly missing your shoulder and then you slashed the second lackey on the torso with your sword. The third lackey took advantage of the opening and went on the attack and went straight for Lisbeth with it's sword raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKestrel: Lisbeth! Look out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lisbeth could react, Dodger came from out of nowhere and saved her by knocking back the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisbeth: Thanks! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDodger: Damn it!

I say let's do it! You guys focus on these bozos. I'll take out the leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKestrel: Dodger, wait a second!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could try and stop him, Dodger had already slashed his way past two the lackys and had gone ahead to search for the Laughing Coffin leader, leaving you and Lisbeth by yourselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKestrel: Damn that idiot!

The mountains still felt cold, even in the virtual world the sense of chill and shivering could be felt inside the game. Dodger gripped his arm blades tightly cautiously scouting ahead. He soon ran into a pair of Laughing Coffin players, they were caught off guard but Dodger didn't hesitate and stuck first. He sliced through them but not enough to kill them. However when they both recovered they lunged at Dodger, Dodger bolcked both of their strikes and their weapons clashed in a small stalemate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make me kill you guys! If you force me to attack I'll do it!\", Dodger warned. They didn't let up, Dodger couldn't prolong it any more.  He swiped his arms in opposing directions and cut straight through the players' sides. They vanished as a result, they were now further casualties among the many who died in this death game. Dodger while conflicted, didn't feel much remorse over his action. In fact he felt nothing, not justifying it to himself, no guilt, he killed two players who would have killed him. He knew he must be close if he ran into some players, therefore he pressed onward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued trekking through the snow, he saw a small cluster of Laughing Coffin players whom were huddled around one player, he was a skinny guy but carrying a big ax. Clearly physical prowess was a bit toned down to accommodate with whatever class you were inside the game. One of the players spotted Dodger and quickly ran right for him. Dodger blocked the attack in time and impaled the player and ripped him in two killing him. \"Who ever you are get out, you have no business here!\", said the ax wielder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call of your goons, your attacking my best friend a ways back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't leave any witnesses, kill him.\", the ax wielder ordered his group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDodger was running low on energy, his health was a little lower than preferred and the other couple of players were not the type to go after with a class like his without back-up. A swordsman and spear man were out of his element. They PKs ganged up on Dodger, however while they landed some damaging hits on him as they assaulted him, Dodger was too fast and chipped at their health little by little until he could land decisive blows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spear player stabbed at Dodger but missed by a milometer. Dodger counter attacked and stuck his arm blade into the players own neck. The shock of Dodger murdering the other player caused the swordsman to fall back to his leader. \"You aren't one of us are you?\", asked the ax wielder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call off your boys! Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't thinks so. See you killed on of my guys, and that means I should take your life to make the difference. But tell me, you don't have any problem killing other players.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm NOTHING like you freaks. Killing random innocent people, you know damn well that we die for real if we die here! Except when you guys try to kill me I don't have any issue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! You know what, lets just kill this ass-hole and get this over with. Your out matched!\"</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, another soldier sprung up fro behind the soldier you took out and before you could react, he clashed with your sword and knocked it out of your hand. Then he gave you a strong kick in the gut, knocking the wind out of you.

We're gonna have some fun with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisbeth: St-stay back! Get away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisbeth nervously stepped back, now feeling scared. You tried to get up and her, but then you saw the end of your sword being pressed by your cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLackey: I don't think so. You're not going anywhere. You make one false move, I'll lop you head off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKestrel: Damn you! Leave her alone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLackey: Shut up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier gave you a sharp kick to your side making you let out a yelp of pain once again knocking the wind out of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisbeth: Kestrel no! Leave him alone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly two soldiers grabbed Lisbeth on the arms and pinned her to a wall. Lisbeth tried to get free, but she couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisbeth: No! Stop it! Let go of me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLackey: Sorry, but we don't want you getting away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLackey: Besides, once we're done with your friend, we'll have some fun with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisbeth's eyes went wide with horror. You still on the ground, managed to look up and saw that Lisbeth was in trouble. Seeing her like made you get the strength to get up. You struggled, but you managed to get on your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLackey: Well, well. It seems you got some fight left in you, but it's pointless. Your hit points are in the red zone. One more move and you'll die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the lackey with your eyes glaring daggers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKestrel: Let...her...go... If you....do anything to...hurt her... you'll regret it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisbeth looked at you in surprise and that the same time with worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisbeth: No Kestrel! Run away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKestrel: No way... I won't run... I won't....leave you behind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisbeth could feel tears gathering in her eyes seeing your courage. The lackeys however were not amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLackey: Trying to be the big hero huh? Well I think it's time for the hero to meet his end. Kill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lackeys went straight for you ready to kill you and finish you off. Lisbeth looked away, not wanting to see what was coming next. Then suddenly....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the two lackeys aiming to kill you, you waited for them to make the first move. They lunged at you thinking that they could one hit kill you if they all attacked at ounce. But while the combined attack power was useful it was predictable. You parried the one on your right while dogging the left's attack. You impaled the parried lacky but pulled out your sword before you killed him, you shoved him into the snow knocking over the other attacker leaving the one holding Lisbeth to the wall. You threw your sword into the guys leg forcing him to wince in pain forcing him to let go of Lisbeth. Freed, Liz swung her mace and knocked out her attacker. You got back your sword and grabbed Lisbeth's hand trying to find Dodger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDodger was still facing against the one calling the shots and while Dodger was hard to hit, he wasn't doing enough damage to his opponents to make a significant difference. Their larger health bars, and defense made the too strong for hi alone. Dodger was running on fumes and they knew it, all they were waiting was for him to make a mistake before they could do him in with one attack from their weapons. Dodger kept on the defensive falling back farther away more and more. \"Stop prolonging this! C'mon and fight!\", the leader said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the wind grew more intense, Dodger smiled and made a run for it. The Laughing Coffin members chased after him but the wind was blinding until finally the snow and wind ceased its bombardment. Dodger lured them over to where the Dragon was and it saw them. The guild made a run for it knowing they were ill equipped and weak to face the beast. The dragon blew its fire setting the guild party ablaze. From the ashes only a couple managed to survive it's first attack. The dragon flew away soon to make another pass. The leader holding the ax opened his inventory and drank his health potions. His other party member said, \"What are you doing lets get out of here. We won't last with that thing after us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to kill that son of a bitch!\", he yelled in response. Dodger hid behind the fields of crystals laying around in the snow. He hid from the ax wielder trying to scroll through his inventory for health potions. He managed to access them but they were too small in regenerating his health. Soon you and Lisbeth saw the dragon spewing fire around the crystals. Suspecting Dodger was there you called out to him as loud as possible, \"DODGER! DODGE WHERE ARE YOU?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader however heard your calling and figured he would take his frustrations on you instead. Dodger looked cautiously over his cover to see the leader running towards your voice. He got up and lunged at him from behind stabbing him with both of his arm blades. The leader shook him off and swung his ax at the ground. From all the fire and steam coming from the snow it was difficult to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Lisbeth stuck together while searching and calling to Dodger. As he fought the LC leader Dodger heard one of your calls and yelled out where he was. Finally having an idea where your friend was you ran over to his voice as fast as you could. You could hear the sounds of weapons clashing and swinging around. At last you finally found Dodger but everything stopped when a loud noise echoed. The dragon was close by and was looking through the steam, everyone stood still hoping it would go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the LC leader noticed with Dodger's attention aimed right at the beast he readied to swing his ax but the sound of the weapon was loud enough to make it aware of their location. The dragon blew fire at the sound forcing Dodger to move out of the way but incinerating the Laughing Coffin leader in the process. Just as Dodger managed to land, the snow beneath him sunk in just the span of a moment. You saw Dodger sinking and in reaction leaped to his side and grabbed his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snow collapsing revealed a large and wide hole in the ground, a trap for the prey of the Ice Dragon. You held on to Dodger and pulled him up but as the Dragon ascended his wings caused the heavy winds to make it harder for you to hold on. The snow and sweat from your hand made hanging on to your best friend all the more harder. Lisbeth reached out to which Dodger grabbed, but he saw the Dragon fly and knew it was coming for another pass. \"Hurry up gggggrrrrhhhh!\", he panicked as he feared for his life. They were almost there but the last laughing coffin guild took advantage and tried stabbing Lisbeth. He succeeded and got Lisbeth to have a knife sticking out her shoulder. But ounce she reflexively let go of Dodger's hand in trying to remove the knife, the attacker tried finishing the job but ended up causing both of them to slip and fall down into the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOO!\", you reached out with one of your arms and barley managed to catch her. but you couldn't hold the weight of two people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kestrel! Pull me up I can't hold on any longer!\", Dodger cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me Kestrel! Help!\", Lisbeth yelled in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt anchored to the edge as their pleas held you down as did their weight. You couldn't lift either of them up now even if you chose. But with the dragon about to breath its fiery breath it made you forcefully make a choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment you couldn't remember what you felt from the stress on your arms and hands, but somehow you felt in one second the removal of the life your right hand, the life of your best friend Dodger. You watched as he screamed and flailed his arms and legs while descending into the darkness. \"DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDDDDDGGGGGGGGGGGGGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRR RRR!\", you screamed. Lisbeth pulled herself up and tried to make it up, which now having lost one you used all your might to save the one you kept hold of. You yannked her up and used your teleport crystal to escape leaving behind Dodger.</span></div></div>",

You waited in the alleys of the 48th floor to hear from the tracker and as you waited your arm shook uncontrollably. The same arm that gave out when Dodger fell into the pit. Finally it stopped when the tracker finally came back, but the brief moment of joy turned back into horror as he returned empty handed. \"Did you find him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing could be found, the pit was empty and I searched around the 55th floor for days. I'm sorry but your friend isn't alive.\", the tracker left having been already paid for her services. With no hope left to the chance Dodger escaped or survived it left you all but destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in Lisbeth's shop her friend Asuna came by to purchase some upgrades for her weapon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Lisbeth!\", Asuna came in a bright and cheerful fashion. Lisbeth may have been feeling upset about the incident last week but her normal demure around her friends and fellow customers didn't dent her personality. But seeing her best friend in the game brightened her up more than usual today maintaining her composure of recent of events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asuna! Welcome, what can I do you for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been saving up and thought you could forge my sword with a thicker metal. Also line it with some materials to make it lighter and faster for me to stab while I'm fighting.\", she requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well frankly my skills with forging preexisting materials are a little low right now. However if you give me some time to level that skill up I will message you I'm on the job. However that's if what your willing to pay is worth retaining my services hehe.\", she snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna smirked, \"Is this enough?\", she showed Lisbeth the amount she was willing to shelve on her menu and it was a heft sum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisbeth's jaw nearly dropped. Yeah that would do it. Holy smokes you find a rare money chest or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you all about it after you level out that skill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHH! Asuna you meanie! C'mon I need the small talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give it to you but only whats been happening to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis resurfaced her downer mood changing her attitude and tone, \"Well something did happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\", Asuna inquired. Lisbeth explained to Asuna the story about her, you and Dodger on the 55th floor. To Asuna's horror and shock it fueled her to take serious action against this PK guild. For a long time the Laughing coffin has been murdering players like death was an illusion here when in all seriousness every bar they emptied was another murder in this long torturous game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where was this Kestrel when you last saw him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Said he hired a tracker and was waiting in town on this floor.\", Lisbeth answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to me Lisbeth, stay in your shop for the next few days, they might come after you until this dies down. Meantime I'll go talk to your friend and try to help him. Asuna took off and searched across the floor's town where after a while she found you crying in an ally. \"Pardon, but are you Kestrel?\", she gently walked toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get the f#$% out of here!\", you yelled wanting to be left alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a friend of Lisbeth's.\", Asuna exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz? I'm sorry, I.....I'm....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard about the Laughing Coffin and your friend. I'm sorry you lost a friend to this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the games fault. I let him go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisbeth told me how you carried her and your friend. You just lost your grip, you didn't let him go. She told me exactly what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words may have helped dealing with your survivors guilt but you still couldn't find the strength to go on. \"Listen to me, I am a leader of the Knight of the Blood Oath. If you were to bring your case to the other members, we would have enough cause to make sure the guild that attacked you never does this to another player in here ever again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted revenge on them for causing the whole thing to spiral out of control, and this could allow you a chance at it. \"One condition, if your planning to raid them. I participate in every raid, lead, anything until they are dealt with.\", you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not saying we commit genocide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never said I meant that either, I want pay back for Dodger but I want the whole Guild destroyed in whatever way makes it happen faster. Be it every last one of them dies or they all are locked up until this game ends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it mean if I accept your condition, you won't be inclined to stoop to their level unless we tell you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you will get your chance.\"</span></div></div>",

The cold of the snow and weather didn't seem too painful now. But the chills still wormed their way into your coat, and for the last month and a half the anger never left. Asuna and the other members had been keeping track of Laughing Coffins activities with you leading the charge at every possible crime. But it wasn't enough the PK guild still murdered and tortured people as if it was nothing but sick fun. Ever day you wondered why they do it when it is clear they are murdering innocent people, the answer was obvious, when you sign up to join them you aren't a human being but a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting late, it was 7:30 at night and your patrol was over for the night. You reported back to your post and was free to spend your evening however you pleased. You went to the 1st floor, in the area where Kayaba had announced your fate. You starred up to the sky pondering if you were ever going to make it out alive, when suddenly you heard someone. \"You came here too?\", it was Asuna, \"You think that maybe he will ever show up again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any plans for Christmas Eve?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well do you want to come with me to the 37th floor? They're having a choir from the youth center sing carols for everyone. I think it would be good to see something lift everyone's spirits while were trapped in this death game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought maybe it would be a good idea and agreed, upon arriving at the floor you saw Pulsar with the children preparing for their performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kestrel.\", you both hugged, \"Glad to see you here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah me too. How's your center?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...getting dicy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly there just comes a point where you keep doing what your doing but then somewhere down the line you ask yourself why do I keep doing it. I've been asking that ever since Dodger died. And the center has been harassed by some other guilds for supplies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll talk to the Knights and pull some strings to give you some protection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, oh who's this?\", Pulsar noticed Asuna yanking you to the seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asuna, this is Pulsar my best friend. He's the one responsible for tonight's entertainment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really happy to see what your doing. In all the sadness it is really inspiring to see such optimism.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two here as a date?\", Pulsar asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no no no! We just work together.\", Asuna explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulsar smiled, \"Ok I gotta set things up enjoy the show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Asuna brought you to a nice bench where you could watch the choir she sat on your left and grabbed your face for some odd reason. You blushed wondering why she was doing this and after she clarified you two were only friends. \"Kestrel look behind you and promise you won't get mad or depressed.\", she said with a stern but snarky smile. Confused you nodded and then she immediately released her grip. You turned to see...Lisbeth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz?!\", you said more shocked than what Asuna expected you react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.\", she seemed a bit shy given how things ended off last you two spoke. \"I was in around here and saw Asuna and now your here. I wasn't expecting this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh if it makes this better I'm happy to see you.\", you spoke in earnest and actual joy. Having her here made this trip a much needed distraction from all the hunting down of Laughing Coffin. Having Lisbeth around with Asuna all about to enjoy a pleasant performance was the best thing to happen all year since the game began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? I...I guess the feeling is mutual then.\", feeling surpised by your reply she smiled and sat a bit closer to you. It felt warm. And finally the choir sang...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ro-vL4KLDY\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ro-vL4K...</a></span></div></div>",

That's because I'm undercover,\" you said quickly coming up with an excuse. \"Can't just go all willy nilly flashing around that I'm a part of laughing coffin or whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male player glared at suspiciously as if he was searching me to see if I was telling the truth, but then he eased up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I guess that makes sense,\" said the player. \"So anyway, how do I get in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pretty simple really,\" you said. \"Word on the street is that there's a place where red players go to hang out in peace. A place called... The Black Market.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Black Market?!\" the player said paling a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around nervously and then whispered furiously to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?! Why the hell do you need to go there of all places?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't really say,\" you said quickly coming up with another lie. \"My superiors told me to locate The Black Market, so I can locate some red players and have them join up with us. Which is why I need your help. The problem I have is that I need a password to get in. If you can tell me the location and a password to get in, I'll personally see to it that my superiors can make you into a high ranking general.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment he heard what you said, the player smiled. You smiled in your head internally happy that the fish had taken the bait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" said the player. \"I'll tell you the location and the password, but you didn't hear this from me got it? The last thing I need is a guild breathing down my neck. Plus if anyone else found out about me, I'm a dead man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. You have my word,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" said the player. \"I know about the location because I happened to see one player head towards it. It close to a bar a dark part of town. Just go down the alley and make a right and you'll see the door to the place in the corner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" I said. \"Now what about the password?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. Listen closely. This is the password,\" said the player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the player whispered in my ear the password. When I heard it, my eyes widened a little in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious?\" I asked. \"That's the password?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe player nodded. \"Yeah. It sounds weird I know, but trust me I got the password for a reliable source. It's guaranteed to get you in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... see,\" you said. \"In any case, thank you kindly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... am I in?\" the player asked. \"Am I in Laughing Coffin now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just yet,\" I said. \"First I have to confirm if what you told me is true. If it is, I will come and introduce you to my superiors. Until then, pretend you never saw me. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... yes sir,\" said the player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, I turned around and walked away. As soon as I was far enough away from the player, I set out a shaky breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit... I can't believe I managed to pull it off. I didn't think I would be able to get the info,\" you said to yourself. \"In any case, I gotta go and find Asuna and relay the information I obtained. She's gonna have a field day with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you raced off to find her.</span></div></div>",

You dozed off a little, as you did you thought back to when you lost Dodger in the dragons nest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashes of every second he fell into the darkness and being burned by the fire filled your vision forcibly waking you up.

Apparently he recognized my skills as a player and so here I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" said the player who sat down next to you. \"How do I know that you ain't some good to shoes player? Need I remind you that you have a green marker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be deceived by appearances,\" you said. \"My marker may be green, but I'm a lot more evil than you think. Why do you think I'm here in the first place? I'm here because a player ripped me off the other day by stealing some of my gear. Boy did that make me mad. So I got even by setting him up in a trap. I lured him to a dragon's cave and left him there for dead. Little bastard got what he deserved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe player stared at me. Then he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? I like you kid,\" he said. \"You take no crap for no one and have even mastered the undercover business. Welcome to the club kid. Hey come on over and meet the new guy boys\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe player beckoned a couple players over and three more showed up much to your dismay. You wanted to tear these guys apart, but you kept your cool and stayed silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he's the newbie eh?\" asked one. \"Doesn't look much to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast,\" said the leader. \"This guy lured a player to his death and he didn't even have to do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah. Come on. This kid don't look like he could hurt a fly,\" sneered the first. \"I can top that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the player began telling the story about how his crime was worse than yours was. You rolled your eyes underneath the cloak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please,\" you thought. \"Just what I needed. Story time in the killer bar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute... maybe I can find some information on these guys... if I can find the one who attacked me and the others...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you listened in on their stories. The first one told me how he killed a couple of players just for the hell of it. Another player told me the story of how a player stole a girl he liked and then killed the player she loved without her knowing. You squeezed your hands really trying hard not to kick their asses for their crimes. You wanted more than anything to make these players pay for their crimes, but you stood still listening to everything they told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so I... kill him and took it back!\" finished another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finished telling the story, all the players oooed in admiration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was just evil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heartless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen another voiced chimed in. This voice sounded gruff and sinister in some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please. I can top that story. Let me tell you boys a real story,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh brother...\" you thought. \"I'm not getting anywhere listening to these stories. I better get out of here before I get sick to my stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were just about to get up when you heard the player speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This happened to me back at the 55th floor in Western Mountains...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened and you felt your heart jump as the player continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and a group of players were assigned to take out this guild called the Marauders. Reason being was because two players are considered to be in leagues with the beater Kirito maybe even beaters themselves. These players that were supposed to take out were named Dodger and Kestrel. We found them along with some girl. She was a nice piece of work if you get my drift. So we tried to have some fun, but that Kestral guy was tough. He got back up and tried to get away, but then... all of a sudden a dragon attacked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone who was listening to story was quiet taking in everything what the player was saying. You on the other hand stayed silent your fist shaking from anger as the memories of what happened before resurfaced in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then that's when things went to hell,\" the player continued. \"The dragon incinerated everything in it's path. All of us fell one after the other including out leader. Everyone was gone either from running away or dead. Everyone except for those bastards Kestrel, Dodger and that little bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes glinted and flinched a little from the player calling Liz that name. You kept silent telling yourself to keep calm, but you were very close to snapping any minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those guys in a trap laid by the dragon and were desperately trying to pull up their friend. That's when I took advantage and got my revenge on the bastard,\" said the player with a twisted grin on his face. \"So I attacked the girl. I stabbed her and tried to push her off, but I ended up falling in the process. Luckily I fell in the snow so I was lucky to survive. After that I teleported out using a crystal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to that Dodger guy? He die?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell cares?\" said the player. \"For all I know that bastard got impaled by a crystal and died for all I care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What really was a shame was that you let that girl go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I should've taken her with me. Then she and I could've done lots of stuff together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone laughed except for you. At this point your anger reached a boiling point.

So far there was next to nothing as far as information goes. However it wasn't a total loss. You got some half-way decent gear as well some good money. Eventually you decided to take a break and try and rest. You were in a tavern in town on the 47th floor drinking your worries away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haaah!\" you sighed. \"Even though this is only a game, this drink's quite refreshing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continued to drink, a certain player came inside and saw you drinking. He sighed and then came to your table sitting by you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be enjoying yourself,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Kirito,\" you replied setting your cup down. \"Don't worry. It's non-alcoholic. Then again in this game, everything's not really real anyway. So. You got any news for me or did you jut come here to check up on me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little bit of both I guess,\" said Kirito. \"Asuna wanted to know how you were doing considering the fact that you've been working your tail off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm fine,\" you said. \"No need to worry about me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" said Kirito. \"By the way, have you gotten any good gear lately from your raids?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" you said. \"All I got was some of the lousy stuff. If anything the only thing I got that was actually worth anything was the cloak I'm wearing. I was actually hoping I'd get a decent weapon, but I have rotten luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're looking for a good weapon then why don't you get one?\" asked Kirito. \"I mean you instead of waiting for a drop in a raid, you could just get materials to make gear yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's not bad idea,\" you said. \"But where am I gonna find some good material for a weapon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sipped into your cup thoughtfully trying to come up with some ideas. Then you got an idea. You got up and left the money you owed on the table and left the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where you going?\" asked Kirito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To get a new weapon,\" you said. \"And to do that, I'm gonna need help and I know who to ask..\"</span></div></div>",

When she finished, she stood back and admired her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Job well done Lisbeth,\" she said to herself. \"Now your store's looking nice and clean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she heard the door open and the bell chiming after and you entered. Thinking that you was a customer, she immediately bowed politely smiling showing good customer service.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello and welcome to Lisbeth's Blacksmiths Shop,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Lisbeth,\" you said. \"Nice to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Kestrel! It's so good to see you!\" said Lisbeth. \"It's been a couple of days since I saw you. How have you been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty fine,\" you said. \"More or less. Lisbeth I have a favor I need to ask you. You mind helping me out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need a weapon. Well a stronger weapon then what I already got,\" you explained. \"I was wondering if you did custom orders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I can,\" said Lisbeth thoughtfully. \"But the metal prices are kinda expensive these days and you don't look like you have much money Kestrel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care about the price. I just need a good weapon made as soon as you can if possible,\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisbeth hummed putting a finger to her chin in thought. Then she had an idea. \"Well I think I... no wait. Never mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" you asked. \"I'm willing to try anything. Please tell me Lisbeth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisbeth hesitated then she looked at you with a serious expression. \"I can get you the material needed to make a high caliber sword, but... we have to go back to a certain location and I think you're not gonna like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long silence. You knew exactly where Lisbeth meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm aware of where we have to go. Which was why I was thinking of sending you with an escort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why?\" asked Lisbeth. \"Why can't you come with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know why Lisbeth,\" you said looking away from her. \"I... can't go back to that place. Not after what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... I don't want an escort to go with me,\" said Lisbeth. \"I can understand why you wouldn't want to go, but I'd much rather go with you. Besides it's not really your sword if you don't work hard to get it don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... guess so, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look. I get it. You don't wanna go because of what happened to Dodger, but... I think it's better that you come with me. It's your sword and it wouldn't feel right if I went with someone else and... it's pretty much my fault as it is yours that Dodger's gone. So I think we both should go. For Dodger's sake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Lisbeth a little surprised at her words. Everything that she had said was true except for the part of her sharing the blame. It wouldn't be right sending someone else to do your request for your sword. You looked at her placing your hands on her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, it wasn't your fault,\" you said. \"Secondly, you're right. It wouldn't be right of me to send an escort to do my job for me. I'll go, but... don't expect me to like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisbeth nodded. \"Alright. This time I'll do my best not to slow you down. We will get that metal no matter what!\"</span></div></div>",

Lisabeth looked at you in a blank stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously? How could you feel so cold?\" she deadpanned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak for yourself!\" you snapped. \"How are you not cold?! You're practically wearing nothing, but a skirt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just used to it is all,\" said Lisabeth. \"Now come on. We got a dragon to find so try to keep up OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right I'm coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of you walked along the path, you couldn't help but remember the bad memories you made here. Especially the part where you let Dodger fall to his doom. This made you clench your hands tentatively. You didn't want to be here more than anything, but you kept on walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough you both came to a field of crystals. Lisbeth couldn't help, but admire them as she looked at her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... this place is beautiful!\" she said as she ran forward spinning around looking like child finding a brand new place to explore which also caused her skirt to flutter. You didn't pay attention to Lisbeth. You were busy staying on guard in case the dragon came attacking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Kestral. You could lighten up a little,\" said Lisbeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Lisbeth,\" you said. \"I know I said that you could come with me, but if that dragon happens to show up, I want you to have your teleportation crystal ready OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why?! Don't tell me you're planning to send me back cuz it's a little late for that,\" said Lisbeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't plan to. I just want you to stay out of the way. I'll deal with the dragon by myself,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisbeth's eyes widened. \"You can't be serious! I'm not a baby or some kind of newb!\" she said indignantly. \"If I want to help you then I'm gonna-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just do as I said alright?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisbeth jumped with surprise from you raising your voice at her. Feeling a little bad for yelling you then explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look. The last thing I wanna do is put you in danger,\" you said quietly. \"So many people have already lost their lives in this game. I already lost Dodger in this place. I don't want to lose you either. So please do as I say and stay hidden. And if things get too crazy I want you to teleport out of here and leave me behind, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisbeth stared at you. Then...</span></div></div>",

Honestly the fact that I needed to carry you myself without anyone lending a finger was outright insulting. Just who are you and where exactly do you hail from?\", neither of you could understand the other still as it grew irritating to the both of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I want to understand is WHERE AM I? And what was with the first base treatment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh you can't seem to pick up our language. Must have learned to speak through grunts and moans. Oh well maybe this spell will fix that.\", in a jiff she flicked her wand and finally both could speak the same tongue. \"There, casting that language spell was all that I had to do in order to get you to understand me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!

Now I know I may look irresistible to you but I am reserved by a lot of suitors whom I have plans to meet with around the afternoon. So I am pretty much taken, and don't worry I will be sure to lock the room whenever I have company. But of course you may be a familiar but still a peasant none the less.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mentioned that peasant nobility system you live with. So basically I have about as much rights as a slave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well not to that extreme. I mean most masters treat their familiars with affection and respect. But a peasant won't be given that treatment since after all peasantry still applies even to familiars I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that is not something I will not stand.\", you replied with heavy snark and sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't act like that. I mean I won't treat you like a pet it's just hard to deal with taking care of a human who happens to be a peasant who turns out to be a familiar. Huh?

But as you were running down the staircase leading to the grounds, in your haste you crashed into someone else. You both fell and collapsed on the ground like you tackled each other in a football game. A little wind knocked out but fine regardless you noticed you ran over a small pink haired girl wearing another black robe. She was in much worse shape than you were, out of compassion you asked if she was ok but she couldn't speak or breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as it hit you that you needed to keep moving you found yourself frozen in place. You wanted to move your body but it remained still as a statue. \"Hey!\", you gritted your teeth as even your mouth was immobile.

What are you doing?\", Kirche said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally coming to she angrily replied to you, \"YOU UNCIVILIZED DOG! HOW DARE YOU ATTACK A NOBLEMAN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, ie ault.\", you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zerbst did you try and send your familiar to attack me!

It's not my fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which I wasn't able to summon any familiar at all after you had summoned yours! Yet here you have this peasant instead of something more in line with your distastful personality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't blame me for your failings as a mage. You didn't summon a familiar plain and simple, which means you are never going to be full fledged one in your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT IS UNCALLED FOR! I know you have something to do with it I know you do and I am going to get to the bottom of it! Unless you admit you stole my familiar!\", Louise threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead I have nothing to hide. You are just grasping at straws in order to justify your pathetic magic skills. And as for you, you are coming with me and staying put.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I not a statue! Get e outta hereeeeeeee!\", you screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche placed you back in here room where you still remained in that running pose. \"Hehe, you know I think you would make a decent decoration.\", she joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ery hunny now quit with the sell!\", you demanded. Kirche waved her wand and you were back to normal. \"Whew. Ok I want to go home! I don't know what you did to make me stiff or where on earth I am but I know you can take me home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earth? What's that a peasant fictional world? Look like it or not you belong to me now. If you behave I can allow you to see your family but not if you run off again. And for the record I find running away from your master to be a serious offense. So I will punish you later when I think of a good thing to balance the scale. For now I have a date by the indoor fountain and am already running late because of you.\", she left frustrated but you were just as agitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened the door ounce she left but somehow the door knob couldn't twist, probably a 'magic' trick to keep you from leaving again. You though tmaybe out the window would do the trick but as soon as you saw the sky you knew escape was impossible. TWO MOONS! One red and one blue one clearly larger in size and one significantly smaller. Tatooine this wasn't, but just as hopeless to escape from in your current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around to find a blanket and pillow on the floor, your sleeping arrangements you assumed. The blanket was big enough to wrap around to make the floor a softer place to lay so it wasn't too bad. But in all seriousness, this place and these people were from a whole other world.</span></div></div>",

You weren't very pleased with your current circumstances as you were literally stuck in a whole new world you had no idea existed and you were being treated like a second class citizen. Finally when dawn wrapped over the school, you had finished. You brought it back up to the right floor but you forgot exactly which room was hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laid down Kirche's laundry and tried remembering which one was it. They had no number system so it made it a little harder to find. You tried knocking on one but you were met with some hostile greetings. The one you knocked on was the wrong one, \"Oh! You. Your Kirche's weird familiar, sorry but Kirche's room isn't this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind pointing where-\", the girl slammed the door right in your face. \"Ok then, still lost and apparently people here are ALL jerks.\", soon as you said that Kirche peeked out her door seeing you trying to get in the wrong room.

You did a fair job, you can assort them in my drawers when we return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks, I'm done looking through your wardrobe thank you very much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. I suppose you washing and folding was enough. Now come, were having our morning meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank goodness I am starving!\", later you made your way into the cafeteria where a bountiful feast was awaiting at very long lunch tables. You were dying to eat what was on the plate when Kirche finally sat down, however she halted you from sinking your teeth into anything. \"Hey, I'm hungry what's the idea?!\", Kirche pointed down with the same annoyed look. You saw a broken plate covered in dirt, the other students who were watching this laughed at your position. However you drew the line there and then, \"Ha ha! Not happening, I'm sitting and eating like the rest of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrrr! You ARE aware you are a peasant! A familiar does not have the same perks as a noble.\", Kirche explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou postured and sat on the chair next to her leaning back, \"If I'm stuck here I will sit and eat where I please! Hear that! No one tells me what to do!\", you said acting large and in charge enjoying the role reversal however you found yourself incapable of moving once again. \"Mmmph mmph MMMMMPH!\", you fell back landing flat on the ground.

Personally you were sick of how you were being treated and grew to really hate Kirche. She showed no respect and used her magic to enforce her will twice, it was by this point you hoped that you could get a chance to give a piece of your mind against some noble to let a little bit of anger out of your system. But then again, not every person there probably deserved to be randomly told off to so you decided to walk around the grounds and vent your anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh waiter!\", said a student dining outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a waiter moron.\", you replied griting your teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Well clearly, huh? Oh wait your that peasant familiar Kirche summoned. Nevermind, my honest mistake. I mean clearly a mere peasant like you must be less refined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wait I mistook you for a moron, uhh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Guchie to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riiiiiiiight, sorry for mistaking you for a moron when you were Noblemen of pristine, snooty, and prikish stature.\", you snarkly remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Now hold on you! You dare insult a Noble? If you have any manners I'd suggest you apologize or suffer the consequences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to. I only give what I am delivered by others, so if you act like a jerk then I'll return the favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apologizing to a peasant is beneath me. You without kindness deserve none from a respected Noble like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guiche was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm? OOOFFF!\", you hurled a chair right at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, I treat people how they treat me.\", you smugly smiled crossing your arms. Guiche got up and pointed a rose at you in defense like you were threatening his life. Being a real mage meant he might be prepared to fight to the death if you meant to seriously harm him but a flower didn't look that harmful as a means to retaliate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cad! How dare you strike a Noble! If you intend to fight then how about we settle this for real instead of cheaply taking shots when the others back is turned!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooo! I'm shaking in fear.\", you mockingly gloated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrrr! Do you accept a duel sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm going to show you and everyone else that I am not some pesky familiar who can be ordered around like a lap dog. I accept!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then.\", a crowd of students all huddled around you and Guiche. Guiche waved his flower and a petal came out and touched the ground. It then glowed and suddenly an armor plated knight came from the ground. Apparently that rose was his wand. \"I am Guiche the brass so the brass knight shall be your opponent. I have no intention of letting you back out after you assaulted me with a chair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on!\", Kirche said nonchalantly stepping in. \"Guiche my familiar is a little hot headed but he meant no disrespect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is just getting accustomed to how things work around here being a familiar and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a chance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I swear he will apologize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negative!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me Kirche but he attacked me, and therefore he finishes what he started.\", Guiche formally explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring it you mook!\", you egged him on to start the duel but then that brass knight knocked the wind right out of you shutting you up. \"&gt;Gasp&lt; Hookay now were even.\", you gasped. Then it kept whaling on you hitting and kicking you all over. It stomped you and you had nothing to fend it off with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that equals the pain you inflicted on me, therefore I shall be more fair now.\", Guiche waved his wand again this time he created a sword. \"If you wish to continue fighting pick it up. Or say your sorry and then I shall be merciful.\", he offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guiche as interesting as this may be, he is still my familiar so I would prefer you not kill him even though he offended you.\", Kirche said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is up to him. Even if he refuses to yield I won't kill him, just teach him a fair lesson.\", Guiche boasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your arms and face sore and bruised. You had a hard time standing and moving but you were determined to prove yourself. You weren't a slave! You stood up, picked up the sword and yelled, \"Shut up and fight!\" Kirche was shocked as soon as you said that knowing Guiche wouldn't let his minion pull any punches. But to everyone's surprise when you slashed your sword it cut right through the knight! Suddenly now, you felt the pain go away, you felt nimbler, more adept with the weapon. Guiche and Kirche were utterly amazed as were you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuiche then summoned a half dozen more knights to stop you but you carved right passed all of them and held your sword over at Guiche! \"GAH! No! Please! Don't kill me! Ahhhh!\", he cowered and fell on his bum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not going to do that! Just proving a point, so don't go below the belt like that again. And hey,\" you extended your hand, \"I got too hostile with throwing a chair at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuiche was unsure of what to do or say. First you insult him, fight him, now wanting to make peace? Frankly he was too afraid to do anything. The crowd cheered at the fact a peasant beat a Noble. Kirche looked at you with much more interest now, perhaps she pegged a better familiar then she had thought.</span></div></div>",

Doing it all by hand is a pain.\", you said after delivering her laundry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you (Name), you are such a great familiar.\", Kirche replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually your not going to sit around all day until I ask you for something. From now on you will accompany me to my classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we see each other around when I'm attending to my studies and only interact every so often while were working. I feel we should interact whenever we can. Being your master I feel the need to get to know you (Name). After that duel with Guiche, you had me so...interested in you.\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh....well fine I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attended her class with you sitting in an extra seat next to Kirche while the teacher lectured about how many elements a mage can use at a time. it meant nothing to you but it was interesting to know how mages operated. The teacher then said that most of the students could actually use at least two, but then Kirche rose up and said, \"Excuse me but that isn't entirely true since one student here actually can't handle any element.\" The whole class starred at Louise who sat alone. Given the context it seemed that her attitude from before manifested from her lack of popularity or infamy as the underdog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon as class ended you walked to the grounds with Kirche but you noticed Louise wandering off by herself. \"Kirche may I be excused?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh not now when we finally can get to know one another my dear familiar. Are you sure you have to leave now?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't be long.\", you headed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry on back!\", she waved however her smile turned to anger when she noticed you went to see Louise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Louise!\", you called to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh what do you want familiar of Zerbst!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to say that I'm not a fan of what Kirche did in class earlier. I just figured out that your not the most liked girl in school because you don't have a strong affinity to magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouise was taken aback by reaching out with your sincere kindness which she hadn't expected. \"Uh thank you, but I still stand by with that you were meant to be my familiar. Kirche somehow stole you from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did you summon your familiar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exact time Zerbst decided to summon hers they said. I only tried to summon mine in front of her to shove it in her face that I could. I know you had to be mine because I asked for a familiar unlike any other with a strong and noble heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did Kirche want in hers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably something that could stand her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case she didn't get that from me. Hehe.\", you shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well as much as I'd like to figure out why I have no familiar I should go now and you should return to your 'master'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two left on friendlier terms this time which made you happy that someone other than Kirche you could on some level casually speak to. You went back to Kirche who was sitting down with her two other friends Tabitha and Montmorency. Kirche invited you to sit with them and join in on their conversation, \"It's fascinating to officially meet you (Name), I'm Montmorency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Tabitha.\", she introduced herself without making eye contact and starring at her book. Behind her was a big blue dragon perfectly sitting without making much movement. Montmorency's familiar was a total contrast in size with it being a little toad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are my friends (Name).\", Kirche introduced them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasure.\", you simply replied not sure what to say. You weren't sure how mages talked casually, seriously, or sensitively. It felt best to just let them continue and be in the background but it didn't help your case since you were the main topic and Tabitha was doing the same thing. So you answered any questions as detailed as possible to try and get a fix on what you could start leading in with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt finally became comfortable when Kirche began asking, \"What do like about being my familiar?\", it seemed very odd given the master was asking the sort of slave if he liked his job. Things may have improved but it still was a job you got forced into without knowing anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How often do you see her in her best outfits?\", Montmorency teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not often since I walk out of the room until she's dressed and in bed. And no I don't care how nice looking she is that still won't shake my opinion on being your familiar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you think she's nice looking? Most of the men would say that is a total understatement.\", she teased again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Don't drive this where I think you're driving this!\", you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh now I must say I'm shocked and hurt. I'm only nice looking to you?\", Kirche started getting in on the teasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! You look much better than nice! Wait! What am I saying?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The truth.\", Tabitha interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not you too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh now I must say I'm starting to be a little flattered now (Name). Tell me more.\", Kirche inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah tell us.\", Montmorency said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen! Kirche doesn't work me to death and at least is letting me be part of her group of friends which I appreciate. But at the start she was rude, snobby, and used magic on me which I was seriously mad about both times!\", you softly but directly spoke with a raised volume. Kirche reflected on her treatment and knew she had indeed treated you poorly at the start. Montmorency was fascinated by your experiences and and enjoyed your company. Finally the time slowly came to return to the room for the night, but Kirche asked you to wait 10 extra minutes before coming back. Montmorency asked if you could walk with her to her dorm room and then going back to Kirche's after. You agreed thinking it would kill time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where do you hail from?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kingdom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm from earth.\", you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earth Kingdom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no a planet called earth. I didn't come from this world at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, you don't say. Who ever heard of a peasant from a whole different world coming to ours and being a familiar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess not many?\", you joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None. If anything you must come from a nation enemy to Tristain if you are so secretive.\", she deduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not from another nation I'm telling the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I have studied much of our worlds legends and history and I can tell you there is nothing relating to that crazy theory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then your talking to a major discovery. Eh anyway what type of mage are you?\", you asked trying to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Water, which makes sense given my familiar. Isn't that right Robin?\". she stroked her little toad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cute guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep and the only guy who doesn't bug me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's the guy that does get on your nerves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You met him already, Lord Guiche. He and I kind of dated but after your duel I learned he was two timing me with a first year. That jerk! I was so happy how you humiliated him after I pieced it together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That guy was a jerk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Montmorency was at her room she said goodbye and that it was nice meeting you and you went back to your room with Kirche.</span></div></div>",

You thought you walked in on her by accident but she waved her wand and shut the door. \"Uhh Kirche did I come at a bad time because I should have knocked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly (Name) I want you be here with me right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Gah!\", she walked toward you slowly, which suddenly in all the days you spent together never made you feel nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) when I said I was interested in you, I meant that in a far more deeper way. I want to know everything about you (Name). And when I saw defend against Guiche and stood your ground against not only him but me as well...I found it so...attractive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be joking. Hey Kirche I know for sure that how you feel about me is one-sided so maybe you should hit the brakes on whatever it is your doing.\", you said getting scared about where she was taking this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't try and deny it. You said so before I was more than nice looking. You may not know it or admit it but you feel as passionate as me. I went from Kirche the fever to Kirche the passion is just a small amount of time. But they say love comes so suddenly and (Name)....I am in love with you.\", she said. Finally she pinned you to the wall with her arms leaned against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No really don't feel that way about you Kirche. Besides master and servant relationships I hear never work out. So maybe your confusing compassion with admiration. Besides I can't like someone like you.\", you said nervously but hastily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche stopped but reacted in a 180 fashion, \"Can't love someone like me what is that supposed to mean?! Oh you can't tell me you prefer small ones to big! Is that why you met with Louise the Zero?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There! That's why!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so it's true! Well if your going after smaller breasts at least try and get with Tabitha. Vallier and my family are rivals so you being with them would be an embarrassment on my reputation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I mean that rude attitude toward Louise. She made a lousy first impression but I know what it feels to be ganged on by others, especially snotty people like you.\", you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now just hold on! I've given you more privileges than any familiar here! Yet you dare call me snotty?! Is that how you intend to speak to me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said so before, I give what I am dealt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGet out then sleep outside for all I care. A woman goes through all this work to make this night special and this is how you treat her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said you slept outside, which was a lousy night as a result. It was cold and you were angry at how she was convinced what she said and did to Louise wasn't hurtful for her. It made you sick to think she was your master, but even more so she claimed to love you. You had no clue what to do now.</span></div></div>",

She had never been so insulted or humiliated before that the fact that it occurred still seemed unbelievable. She paced around her room venting her fury trying to comprehend why you acted the way you did. \"Grrrr! That ill-bred, uncultured, unclean, shabby looking familiar! No one in the history of my life has made me this irksome! Sigh....although he still is making it a challenge I find fetching.\", she was mad but still attracted to how hard you were making it for her. (No pun intended)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche was in a rare situation where she needed advice and she knew only one person whom she trusted most of all. She got dressed into her uniform and flew out her window thanks to her magic. She levitated herself to her friend Tabitha's room and gently knocked on her window. Luckily she was still awake so Tabitha let her in soon as Kirche knocked. \"Tabitha, I need your help.\", Kirche said with a mixture of excitement and plea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name). I told him how I felt and now he won't talk to me. He thinks I am rude and snotty at Louise the Zero. And said he can never love anyone like that. What do you think he wants?\", she asked genuinely wanting an answer to figure out your resentment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mean to Louise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she's the worst mage in the academy. I only call it whenever anyone forgets this.\", Tabitha stayed quiet, \"Oh what? You think he would like it if I stopped advertising it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe isn't good enough.\", Kirche replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You think he wants me to be all buddy buddy with Louise the Zero?! I would rather befriend a dead cat! Yet he tries to make friends with her of all girls!\", Tabitha remained quiet. \"What is it? C'mon Tabitha don't make me guess what your thinking.\", Tabitha remained silent. \"Ugh! Do you really expect him to make me make peace with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Louise is (Name's) friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what I gather, yes I believe so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Oh Tabitha darling of course he is your friend. He said nothing bad about you, and after all if anyone disapproved of you-\", soon as Kirche heard what she spoke it hit her what you probably meant. To Kirche, Tabitha was her best friend and she would never leave her side for anything. Upon considering your connection to Louise may be similar or at least relatable Kirche learned she made a mistake. Kirche hugged Tabitha goodnight and went back to her own room. Kirche opened her dorm room door to see yo sleeping in a stack of hay beside the door. She waved her wand where you floated upward and gently landed in Kirche's bed. You were fast asleep so you didn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My darling (Name) I think I see why you defended Louise. So now I will try to understand why, so that you will love me back. My darling.\", Kirche whispered to you.</span></div></div>",

You rolled your eyes with the knowledge you would be carrying a lot of stuff. When you got in she saw so many gowns and dresses that thinking about her wearing them would admittedly make look quite dashing. She picked out 3 that were her favorite and went to change. You sat around waiting for her to change and she came out finally. The first one was all black with the chest area covering her entire bust. \"Hmmm I don't like this one now that I'm wearing it. Maybe if I cut part of it I'd be able to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused interested in your input. \"Go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I wouldn't mind you wearing something that wasn't too...revealing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like wearing cloths like that. But maybe I should stock on a few if it would make you feel better. Were stuck together after all so no need to make it unbearable.\", she closed the door and put on the next one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about this?\", this one was an all blue dress that most women would be seen in. It wasn't fully clothing her but it didn't feel like it was being teasing as she wore it. you gave that description to her and she enjoyed hearing your opinions. Last one took a bit longer to put on and at last, she....was.....near indecent. The dress was an all white gown but the lighting made it appear as if she was naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh this is a charmed dress. I would have killed for one. They call this collection, The Censors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but isn't it....ummm...distracting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please (Name). Don't tell me I look bad in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that at all! Just I don't feel comfortable with you wearing that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh. Well I suppose I can be flexible.\", you were taken aback by her accommodating your needs you felt her being hurt by your opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! I don't...mind if you get it. Save it for...something. I don't know but don't leave it because of me.\", you pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche exploded in joy and slammed the door. She got back on her school uniform ran to the clerk and paid for all 3. She took the bag and felt incredibly happy, you were about to take the bag, but she stopped you. \"Uh uh (Name). You may be expected to carry my things, but these dresses I'm carrying myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou left the store but couldn\u2019t find Tabitha seeing you ditched her. Of course you tried searching all over the place but she wasn't around wherever you looked. Kirche then decided to do one last thing before calling a cab back to the academy in case you couldn't find Tabitha. \"(Name), have you ever seen a magic show?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that redundant here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\", she responded. You realized back in your world magic was all parlor tricks. Here it was the real thing. \"Its just local mages performing fancy techniques. The peasants often enjoy seeing these despite their envy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you found one by the fountain in the town square a water mage was manipulating the water in various forms. Then followed was a fire mage tranforming the fire into various forms that were opposite of the water. It was like a stage fight only with magic. You were finding it very entertaining and cheered on for the fire mage's creations. Kirche found that flattering. As the battle got more intense, you looked at Kirche getting just as invested. When you did you saw her, like she was a genuine friend. This whole day was you two and nothing was bothering you about her. You realized you were finally connecting. Though not romantically as she'd like. When it was over fire won the day and still no sign of Tabitha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you went to call a cab back to the academy shortly after that. It was a long but pleasant day. Kirche in an attempt to flirt with you, nudged herself closer to you in your seat. You knew what she was up to, but this time you didn't mind. In fact you nudged yourself to her in kind. Kirche blushed and wanted to show her affection but restrained herself. \"I had a very fun time today (Name).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\", you smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to either of you a blue dragon hovered over the caravan you were taking. With Tabitha still expressing nothing beyond her blank facial expression, but inward she was smiling at having let you two connect after ditching the two of you.</span></div></div>",

He is fond of her so whatever he is here for must be important. He was a serious rule-follower and very compassionate.

You were a little excited to see how he measured up to Kirche\u2019s expectations as she gave him a ton of praise in the past. You could see someone riding in the distance and sure enough Kirche spotted him on sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh my old friend Ren. Be sure to be on your best behavior darling, he may draw out some jealousy in you.\u201d, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to try.\u201d, you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friend made his way to the gate and got off his horse to greet the both of you. \u201cCount Renouf Dewitte at your service.\u201d, he introduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirche walked over and hugged him, \u201cOh Ren it is so good to see you again. But why did you need to come here in person? Am I needed back home to marry some old geezer like they planned?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, if only it was that mundane. No the situation I come to you with is very urgent. I must speak with a Louise Fran\u00e7oise Valli\u00e8re. She has been given a special request from her majesty the Princess of Tristain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLouise?\u201d, you were curious why she was being called upon from someone from another country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is best we find her and discuss matters in private.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that we rounded up Louise and met in her room where Dewitt started talking about this request the princess called on Louise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTristain is in a state of uneasy tension between the continent of Albion. There is a group of rebels trying to overthrow the government there and if they succeed, they will most likely declare war on the state.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is that?\u201d, Louise asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey seek to abolish corruption across the world and they view Tristain as one of their targets. Therefore the princess has decided to marry into a Germanian family to ensure an alliance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s the prissy aristocrat who gets that honor?\u201d, you asked poking fun of the nobility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would actually be me.\u201d, the count replied dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRen? You are marrying her? But I thought you were engaged, and the king would be the one for her to marry.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComplications between families made the engagement plans too little too late. The king gave me the  honor instead as a courtesy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRen are you going to be happy with her? I would be against the union if you were making a heavy sacrifice to ensure peace.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNon-sense Kirche, I hold high respect for lady Henrietta, it is nothing I am holding disdain for. My place is here making so that war does not come to Tristain\u2019s boarders.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen if Valli\u00e8re is needed, then so am I. Including my familiar and darling (Name).\u201d, Kirche announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t need her to speak on my behalf to say I wish to come with Louise on this as well.\u201d, you stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZerbst?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand, my darling would be sore if I didn\u2019t lend a hand to you. But I am doing this for a close friend of mine, something you are doing aren\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWithout question.\u201d, Louise answered with enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I wasn\u2019t expecting the extra company but this is fine by me. Ok, lady Henrietta needs you to deliver a message to the current prince of Albion so that the marriage can go ahead. We may be facing trouble so be prepared to face the worst.\u201d</span></div></div>",

The whole time they were reminiscing and catching up with how well they have fared in the last few years. You didn\u2019t have much to add, in fact Kirche didn\u2019t even bring you up once during their whole conversation, besides her introduction of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rode on your horse a little ways back from Kirche, feeling unsettled with things. Guiche rode next to you, noticing your discomfort. \u201cI do know how you feel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know squat Gucihe, shut up and back off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, I can see someone being jealous a mile away. I should know, I have seen it in ladies eyes many times over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen they learned of your two-timing antics?\u201d, you smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhehehehe! Rumors aside-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr written facts aside.\u201d, you teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMY POINT BEING! Ehem. It is understandable of your situation. I mean he\u2019s a young count from her own country. And she does seem to fancy him. When someone swoops in like that, you best assert yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that I do feel jealous, but how would you suggest I assert myself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReminding her of your finest qualities. Thus letting your dear love, know that you are seeking her affections. She will be forced to choose. And then she will test to see who is the most worthy of her grace, and take a long, methodical process of elimination. Taking years and years of processing until the choice is-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that what she is thinking or just you justifying your two-timing nature?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEheheheheheheheee!\u201d, he laughed nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Kirche looked back at you and Guiche. She noticed your displeased look, but she knew it wasn\u2019t from being around Guiche. She pulled back to talk with you. \u201cExcuse me Ren, I should give my familiar darling some much needed attention.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lit up a bit when she went to talk to you. Guiche had his horse gallop ahead to the young count to grant the two of you some privacy. \u201cHi darling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Kirche.\u201d, you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew you were not feeling to happy with her and Ren, \u201cListen to me darling, Ren is a very cherished friend of mine. But nobody can measure up to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh great. I\u2019m glad you understand.\u201d, she said cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do. Sorry I\u2019m bothering your time with him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need to apologize darling.\u201d, she said thinking that whatever was bothering you wasn\u2019t anything to do with what she believed. Guiche noticed the exchange and intercepted Kirche before she could talk to the count again. \u201cSomething wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would trod carefully with your interactions with the count. It is clear he takes your flirtatious manner with much sensitivity.\u201d, he warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut darling said he-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is quite heavy on sarcasm. So I would read deeper into everything he says.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not after my old friend. He\u2019s certainly grown up but-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs (Name) promptly reminded me earlier, reminding someone of your less desirable qualities, only will increase his anger. While were both Nobility of passion and love, it has been shown that our most desired prey prefer us most when were are seen as loyal to our future lovebirds. Even though refraining from the flaunt and flirt nature can be hard to dismiss.\u201d, Guiche wisely elaborated to Kirche.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. I\u2019m not certain I could give it up. It is still who I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what your saying. Montmorency won\u2019t even talk to me anymore. That\u2019s why us loyal believers of passionate love need to stick together. Although, I would be open to compare \u201cnotes\u201d for how to treat our lover.\u201d, Kirche smirked and waved her wand at Gucihe\u2019s horse, sending a little fireball. His horse reeled back and bolted across the path with Guiche straining to hold on to the saddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed her little stunt and let out a notable fit of laughter, much to Kirche\u2019s delight.</span></div></div>",

But my darling has preferences for a more, reserved kind of relationship. And needless to say I haven\u2019t had experience on that side of love. Frankly my parents aren\u2019t always the best at that either.\u201d, she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you need advice on how to show him you\u2019re serious about being with him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly Ren. But I don\u2019t just want to learn so to bag another boy. He\u2019s different, I want to be better for him. I want to be closer, I want to be just with him. It\u2019s that feeling that all hopeless romantics strive for. I want to earn that from him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy god, you are serious?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Real love. Not that infatuated love. Honest to god love.\u201d, Kirche said cupping her face to hide the very present blushing that had grown on her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what have you done so far?\u201d, Ren asked hoping to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve stopped seeing other men, devoted my free time to making him fall for me, and trying to do what he likes. But he hasn\u2019t taken the bait. And I\u2019ve left him some very tantalizing bait.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe you erm\u2026Well anyway, it\u2019s a start but far from close.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think I should try giving him some of my jewelry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Kirche, that\u2019s the problem. Your heart\u2019s in the right place but it can come off as\u2026 well you don\u2019t care. You don\u2019t bribe them into it, you have ease yourself in. You need common ground to start building a relationship from.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Alright. Well\u2026 I invited him to sit with my friends, and spent a day with him between the two of us.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOk, not bad. I think you got his attention, but I still don\u2019t think he sees that your serious. What you need to do is ease into his interests without looking like your trying. Be yourself, make sure he puts in the same effort your making. Next time, try to make him do something you like, and see if he will take the bait to show he may be interested. See how far you get without nudging him too much.\u201d, Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRen you have the emotional intelligence of a spirit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA natural gift I guess, one of the many reasons I\u2019ve come so far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really can\u2019t tell you how much I appreciate what you do for me, thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever you mind it Kirche.

Your former village was taken over by the Imperial army but was lucky enough not to be conquered by their general who was rumored to be unrelenting and sadistic. You have been living for the past 3 and a half years in the capital and it has been a struggle to have a decent life with the army's oppression over its own people. You were sick of their tyrannical leaders and how recently it has been unsafe with a rebellious group, Night Raid, attacking various parts of the capital against its political leaders. For a while you just went through the motions until one day....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a densely populated area Night Raid was facing an Imperial arms wielder holding an experimental tube of some kind. You tried escaping the fighting but the tube broke when the Night Raid assassin with long blonde hair knocked it out of the Imperial's hands killing the soldier. Unknown to you at the time the contents made it on to your clothing which meant you would become involved with the revolution in due time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tube contained a living Imperial arms that latched on to your jacket and had the power to increase your strength and agility and use its body to attack along with mimicking and or altering the host's appearance to a degree. Its trump card was the power to cause it to spread itself around an area and control all who were infected like a hive-mind. It would take the appearance of a symbiotic organism and be a dark reflection of the wearer. It has three main weaknesses. The first was it is weak against all elemental attacks. The second the longer the wearer uses it the organism will exert its own control over its host. And third it will be exhausted within 30 minutes and needs to rest for 3 hours before it can be used again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you accept this Imperial arms and this journey?</span></div></div>",

You noticed the next time you went to town some wanted posters of Night Raid. You recognized one of the sketches of one of them, the one who attacked the soldier. You looked at it with resentment but then a messenger came by and pasted a new poster on the wall. You inspected it closely wondering what it was about. A tournament coming to the coliseum tomorrow. You laughed knowing you would stand no chance at it but unknown to you, your chances were fairer than you realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked back home a small street gang ambushed you into an alley. 5 against 1, you panicked thinking they'd kill you and steal what you had. Then out from your shirt oozed out a black substance. You screamed thinking they had shot you with some kind of Imperial Arms so you tried shaking it off from your arm. It began forming around your entire body covering every inch of your skin almost like you were being suffocated. A couple of the thugs ran the others stood in horror watching what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you could breath as the substance formed around you like a suit of armor, only it felt like a literal second skin. It felt exhilarating, you could feel a surge of strength in your bones now like you had a rush of adrenaline. One thug tried stabbing you but you grabbed his arm reflexively with a quickness you didn't even react to. You crushed the thug's arm causing the last two to try and attack at once. You grabbed the both of them in the air, it was incredible! A euphoric rush filled you as you were effortlessly dominating these worthless hacks. You tossed them across the ally and stood to bask in suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This thing feel unreal! I feel stronger than I could have dreamed!\", you jumped in excitement but you leaped 5ft off the ground reach the top of the roof in the building across. You tumbled down when you just realized how high you jumped and took a deep breath trying to gather yourself. \"Wherever this came from I can think of something to use it for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day you entered the tournament...</span></div></div>",

You cannot escape me!\", it roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not feeling very friendly right this second so better worry about who smashes who.\", you threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe referee announced you, \"In the right corner (Name) the mysterious!\", a fitting title given the costume but now the gloves were off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any further delay, you ran towards the bull and started attacking with a flurry of fists. Punch after punch, kick after kick, you didn't even give him a moment to retaliate. Even though you were wailing on him, he began shrugging it off by the time it was all you were doing. As you continued going, everyone in the stadium began to scream out wanting for more, so the beast began fighting back mercilessly. It took you aback and forced you on the defensive. For some reason the suit at various points made the moves for you like you were on auto-pilot but most of your skill was shown as the fight persisted. After dodging an incoming punch, you knee kicked him in the leg and uppercut him with both hands, causing him fall off the ground and land flat on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wiped your hands thinking that was all but he got back up and roared aloud. He was hoping to get tackle you, but failed when you slammed your right fist into his jaw and it connected so well he flipped in mid-air. Afterwards it made contact with the ground, causing an imprint on the floor. Finally with the battle won you felt the suit coming off your body. It occurred to you it was not permanent but you somehow knew a few basics about it like how long it could be used in battle and various other bits of info that it somehow embedded in your head. It felt strange yet seeing how many Imperial arms has special properties it didn't seem much to dwell concern on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever when the ref stated your victory you smiled and cried out, \"I'm a natural!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the spectator booth you saw that the famous General Esdeath was coming down. You heard of her insidious reputation and felt chilled to see her in person. Truth be told you felt a bit reluctant to act nicely around her, but you were willing to keep up appearances for the reward money. \"(Name) was it. It's a nice name.\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say to you first off...\", she said before taking any further action....</span></div></div>",

Survive and win, then you won't be charged for harboring an imperial arms.\", she stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine then.\", you spoke. Your suit was unable to be used seeing you used up your time with it but all the same you had an idea or two. The beast roared and raised its massive arms and chucked a boulder at you. You threw yourself out of its way but the shock-wave still sent you back a little. It threw another big one at you, this time you couldn't completely get out of its way but you could dodge it enough to not have it land a hit. The shock-wave from the impact this time threw you closer to the giant. Instead of throwing rocks it was going to smash you into paste! You ran underneath it and punched its ankles. The giant felt none of them and tried grabbing you. You rolled away by his side and went for the kneecap. Still it felt like air was breezing through his body but no pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt smacked you sending you out of bounds of the arena. You got back up feeling your arm and ribs sore from that blow. The giant was about to start throwing again, it reeled its arms and took a step to gain power in the throw, then something incredible happened. The giant's ankle broke from pressing it on its side then the giant fell down and hit its head on its knee as it couldn't move it. The blow and pain from the knee and ankle forced its grip to release and the boulder dropped on its head. With that the danger beast fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy hell that worked?\", soon as you said that the whole crowd cheered in total disbelief and excitement. \"TOTAL WIN!\", you yelled out raising your arms high and smiling the biggest smile. You never felt so prideful in a one on one fight like this. This one was earned and with no help from that imperial arms. Esdeath came down and had a lighter smile on her face. She seemed impressed it felt like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) was it? You impressed me. I would say you earned your pardon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad I made an impression with just my bare skill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I WOULD say but you were out of bounds in the arena and therefore lost. However you survived and in the end it was bested by you. So I will make this technicality work for both of us.\", she then placed a collar on your neck with a chain leash attached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From now on you belong to me (Name).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey this is ridiculous! Ack- what kind of cra-ugh!\", you felt her hit your neck causing you to slowly pass out.

Now I'd like you all to introduce yourselves to our newest member.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy in the jacket spoke first, \"I'm Wave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big guy in a creepy white mask came next, \"I'm Bols.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA girl in a dark dress with short hair then spoke, \"Kurome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the doors busted open revealing two more individuals, \"No need to tell me I already know the situation, and the name IS DR. STYLISH! With my other test subject is Seryu Ubiquitous.\" The doc had dark hair with a streak of white and wore a typical lab coat and the girl had brown hair and had both of her arms as metal prosthetics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And lastly I am Run. Pleasure is all ours (Name).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd feel a lot more welcome if I wasn't still tied up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want you to escape so that is why your restrained.\", Esdeath answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would I escape?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your imperial arms for one and you would slip out in the middle of the night. Frankly I see plenty of reasons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe already knew both of your ideas for escaping due to not wanting to be here and your disdain for the empire. However you needed to convince her to let you out of the chains she had you bound in. \"If you want for someone to fall in love with you, binding them up to a chair isn't the way to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm do any of you agree with his statement?\", Wave and Bols both raised their hands while the others had theirs down in indifference. \"Very well but don't run off because I'll punish you if you do.\", she warned almost like a mother would her child. \"Everyone we will pull an eight hour training session tomorrow to get oour new recruit up to fighting condition. Get some sleep for we'll have a long day ahead.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou left the room with the others but Esdeath grabbed your hand stopping you, \"You don't have your own room, your quarters are my quarters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt incredibly uncomfortable with this but you let her take you to her room. She let you sit on her bed and sat beside you, \"Wait here for a bit I should freshen up myself before we sleep.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went in her bathroom and from the sounds she was taking a shower. You wanted to leave but judging from her seriousness you felt the best place to be was here until a better chance came up. With you in the middle of the capital, even with an imperial arms escape was impossible. You were wondering if you could try to find some way to escape during a mission far from the capital, maybe then you could leave. You heard the door open from the bathroom you turned around only to see Esdeath with only her shirt on and everything else uncensored by anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to keep you waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stayed silent not having any idea how to answer with her being very exposed. \"You seem so nervous, how just adorable you are. Don't worry I feel just as much new to this as you are. Experiencing these feelings is so confusing but if we let ourselves just follow our instincts then we should have no problem. But first I must ask you what do you think of my team? They will be like family now after all and I want to accommodate them as best I can for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they all appear friendly so I guess there's nothing to change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear, your optimism makes me excited to see you work together with us.\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But uhhh.\", you wanted to express your thoughts on being with the Jeagers but you hesitated fearing her response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm what?\", she said with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just I really don't want to be here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that?\", she said not out of anger but interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your army conquered my home and I lived here for years and it is terrible! You fight for an empire that nobody would mourn for if it fell tomorrow. In fact they'd cheer if that were the case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm hmm. I can understand your resentment, it must not have been easy for you but no ordinary person could survive being conquered by our forces, live within our streets and find our way to the ranks of their elite squadron. It takes strength and that is what it takes to survive. I can't change the empire now but I could give your family an easier life here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have one anymore.\", you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. I'm sorry.\", she placed her hand on yours. You realized that she must be serious about her feelings about being in love with you but you asked her directly to see if she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Esdeath do you really...like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took you toward her bed and was on top of you keeping you down with one hand. \"If I didn't you wouldn't be here with me all alone like this.\", you get scared wondering if she was going to have her way with you. \"I don't think I want this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry I won't force myself on you. In fact I shall be faithful, you are the only one for me and no one else will have the pleasure on my love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't care about this empire Esdeath, so why should I fight with people who do care?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are so naive. I don't pretend to see where your coming from but the fact is this is where you are. But\", she grabbed you in a tender hug and spoke softly, \"If you can't find any reason to fight beside us then please let that reason be that you have found someone in this empire who has feelings for you and does genuinely care about you. For now lets get some rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but be touched by her pleas to make you stay. You laid down on the bed facing away from her. But she wrapped her arms around you and laid right behind you spooning with you. \"You said you wouldn't force yourself on me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't so bad now is it? Its as far as I'll go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt uncomfortable but when you stopped shaking it felt nice. Warm. Peaceful. Esdeath's heart beated fast until she drifted to sleep. You were so confused by her advances but still they had an effect on you that you were oddly touched by. You were too exhausted to break free so you fell asleep in her arms.</span></div></div>",

You may have beaten a danger beast with your bare hands but that wouldn't always what saves you in battle. So she had you train with a sword to feel similar to her own weapon outside of her power over ice. She kept you going for eight hours without any breaks. She had you spar against the entire team and herself all day and to your shock you didn't die yet. When training was over you collapsed where you stood the instant Esdeath announced that was all for the day. She couldn't help but laugh at how cute it made you look but at the same time hated seeing a sign of exaggerated weakness. She came to you and carried you to the conference room. By the time you woke up after Esdeath gave you a light slap to wake you she began explaining a new developing situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good your up. It's important you hear this (Name).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay awake or else I'll punish you tonight and make sure you lose even less sleep than you crave.\", she threatened almost as serious as she would threaten an enemy. \"Ok now we just got a report that a bandit outpost is just outside the capital. If we attack now we can end their annoying raids once and for all. I trust none of you are too tired to face this petty band of rabble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh think maybe I could sit this one out.\", asked Wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No all Jeagers must be present and deal swift justice.

He's seen how you are one on one but he must witness the when you all fight as one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuuuu why do I even bother negotiating?\", Wave complained internally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all found the bandit outpost with Esdeath and you sat back to see the show. You felt nervous being alone with Esdeath however this was business for her so to a degree she kept a serious focus on the mission. That didn't mean she would leave out a chance to show her affection by placing her hand on yours. \"Just watch, pretty soon they will storm that stronghold and wipe away the enemy in mere minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yayyy?\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does violence make you uncomfortable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No just...nevermind.\", you couldn't answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm I can tell you feel reluctant to fight with us even when you know it will be futile to resist. But really watch on how the win. I promise it will leave an impact.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Jeagers walked up the steps to the bandit's hideout until they stood right at the front door. They were immediately welcomed by a whole squad of bandits, each one with a gun, knife, or any other weapon pointed directly at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got some nerve walking up to the front gates like this!\" a bandit said. \"You guys must be stupid! Get them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a cry in unison, all the bandits charged at the Jeagers in overwhelming numbers. Seryu stepped forward along with her Imperial Arms Koro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Koro. Number 5,\" she commanded holding out her right arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoro acknowledged with a yip. He started out as some kind of cute dog like creature and then it grew in size having several rows of sharp and giant teeth. Koro then chomped on Seryu's arm causing a like blood to spew out, then he let go returning back to his usual small size. From where Seryu's arm was, a giant drill took it's place and Seryu wore a look that showed nothing, but complete blood lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judgement of the Ten Kings! Enma's Spear of Justice!\" Seryu shrieked as she drilled right through the enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood and body's fell everywhere. Koro chomped on Seryu's arm again engulfing even the drill and repeated the process. This time, a giant long ranged anti-tank rifle took the place of the drill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next Number 7! Taizan's Cannon of Justice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeryu fired her canon right at the front gate destroying it and anyone who happened to be standing by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think fellas? Those weapons were made by the Hands of God, Perfector. They increase my speed and precision a hundred times over. Truly the most stylish Imperial Arms you've ever laid eyes on!\" said Dr. Stylish proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the rest of the Jeagers joined the fray. Leaping past the smoke into the fortress, Kurome slashed and slaughtered any bandit she saw with her sword in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. After this is over, I'll put you all back together and we'll have some fun. Like cute little dolls,\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a bandit that was hiding in the corner, pulled out his gun and prepared to fire at Kurome, but luckily Wave saw him and knocked him out with a kick saving her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to thank me by the way,\" he said to Kurome. \"We're a team after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't going to,\" said Kurome. \"I already knew that he was there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell you did!\" snapped Wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile other bandits were battling another member of the Jeagers named Bols. His Imperial Arms was a flamethrower with jet engine that heated the air around it. Bols fired shooting flames all over any bandit that was got in flames. The bandits screamed in agony and the smell of burning flesh was in the air. Some of them tried to douse the flames, but no matter how much they tried the flames wouldn't go out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry fellas. Don't take it personally,\" said Bols. \"But my Imperial Arms, Purgatory's Invitation: Rubicante has flames that are so hot, they can't be doused even with water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bandits that still remained tried to run away with their lives intact, but then arrows shot out from above and went right through their heads. No doubt that they were as good as dead. Just before one of them died though, he happened to see where the attack came from. The arrows turned out to be feathers and came from the last of the Jeagers Run who up above them flapping his beautiful angelic like wings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An...angel?\" he gasped just before he fell to the ground dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a man with a winged Imperial Arms,\" Run said. \"The Thousand-Mile Flight Mastema. Sorry, but I'm not letting any of you leave alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon it was all over as everyone of the Jeagers stepped from the flames not a single scratch on any of them. You awed and at the same time horrified at the Jeagers destructive power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Un... Unbelievable.\" you breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name). You'll be able to do that too,\" said Esdeath. \"I'll personally train you myself and soon you'll be as strong as them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think so? That's kind of you to say.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're you expecting me to act different? To be honest with you, this is the first time I'm acting like this myself. My first taste of love. And it feels...wonderful,\" said Esdeath blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the Jeagers came back. Esdeath congratulated them on a job well done and then you all headed back to headquarters.</span></div></div>",

Your head was on the table, with you sleeping as if you were drugged, but you weren't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh (Name) you alive?\", Wave asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Lemme sleep.\", you answered with your face flat on the table. Though muffled you could still speak clear for the two to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we all managed to get back here at a decent hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Esdeath....body pillow.....death threats.....snm.......no rest......\", you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was the one before the no rest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing happened, which I spent alllllllll night making sure of.\", you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez (Name). What's the attraction? I mean she looks great, nobody is faulting you for that, but personality?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One-sided. I got dragged kicking and screaming Wave. I Never agreed to join the team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did steal an Imperial Arms.\", Kurome stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it count if the Imperial Arms stole me? Swear to god it has a mind of its own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If the doc found that out, he'd keep you as a lab rat waiting for a test result.\", Kurome thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'm SOL positive then. Wave just hit me over the head as hard as you can. Talking is making me more wide awake, I need to catch some Z's.\", you asked politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe drink some coffee.\", Wave suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Esdeath came in, \"Wave, Kurome, (Name) good morning. Get yourselves ready soon. We will be going to the countryside to hunt bandits as well as hunt danger beasts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmmmm!\", you screamed into the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you protest (Name)?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The part that includes me. Can I PLEASE get some sleep, too damn exhausted.\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't have that be a reason for sitting out a mission. If you intend to be mine, then you better give me your best even when you are still at your worst.\", she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes no sense.\", she yanked your collar and slapped you across the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are woken up enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were quite ticked at her and just wanted to get out of there.

You managed to get yourself awake enough to the point where you were ready for action. Something the wild was known for, was that you needed to be alert at all times for anything. So your survival instincts kept yourself alive and alert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey (Name), I'm glad were on the same team. Catches a break from having get stuck with the general for so long.\", Wave started talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do appreciate the space. Out of everyone I feel your the one sane man back home. Rest is run by crazies. Well, maybe Boles, counts too. He's freaky but polite when you aren't his enemy.\", you commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. And hey if you need time to vent, I'm all ears. Besides I feel like were both going through the same problems.\", Wave thanked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say not in a million years, but all the others combined would equal an Esdeath. And boy, if I wanted to vent, I would vent, so much I'd be able to generate a room full of air conditioning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe. Geez I have to ask though, what's it like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you enjoy pain, sadism, believe in Darwin, and have a powerful skillset on you, then she's no problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeez, that rough huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and wave continued to scout the area, but thus far hadn\u2019t come across anything yet. \u201cI don\u2019t see any bandits. Maybe we should double back.\u201d, you suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure if we should. General Esdeath might not like us ignoring her orders.\u201d, Wave replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. Very least in case we don\u2019t find anything here, we might need to hold position in case anything from her position comes to us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly you heard some movement behind you and Wave. It sounded like rocks moving, but it sounded like it was coming closer. You turned around and saw some sort of hand reach out to Wave. You activated your suit and used your tendrils to slice in half whatever it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDanger beasts! Pull out your imperial arms!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn it!\u201d, soon a herd of danger beasts rose out of the ground. They appeared like dead trees with hideous faces engraved on the bark. \u201cBack to back!\u201d, Wave called out. You and him did just that and stood in your fighting stances preparing to attack. \u201cYou take your side I\u2019ll take this one!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotchya!\u201d, you both waited for the right opportunity to strike. Then when one of the beasts lunged in, you and Wave retaliated in force. In just no time you and Wave destroyed them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhew, that wasn\u2019t too bad. You handled yourself well-\u201c, soon as Wave turned around you were gone. \u201cUh\u2026.(Name)?\u201d, it occurred to him you took off and ran. \u201cNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!! I\u2019m too young to die! I GET WHY BUT PLEASE DON\u2019T MAKE ME COME BACK WITHOUT YOU!!!!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren\u2019t having any of that, you had a chance to get out of the capital and away from Esdeath. You just wanted to be left alone, so you took your chances and got the hell out of dodge. But things only got worse when before you could get a good enough distance you were confronted by someone in armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo away! I just want to be left alone! I\u2019m not taking part of this stupid war!\u201d, you yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait? Who are you?\u201d, the man in armor replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWave?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. Wait? I recognize you, from the arena!\u201d, the man in armor realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not him. Just let me go, I want no part of whatever it is you came here to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, but you are the reason why I\u2019m here. The suit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, but even though this thing has been causing me trouble, I sure as hell ain\u2019t giving it up!\u201d, you attacked the guy in armor with a swipe of the suit\u2019s tendrils. The guy in armor dodged the attack and flew up in the air. By the time you started fighting, Wave, in a similar but darker colored armor, came to the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c(Name)?! Oh thank god I\u2019m saved! Huh? Is that Night Raid? Of course, that\u2019s why he left me hanging. He went to take him on by himself.\u201d, Wave thought to himself. \u201cHold on (Name)!\u201d, he called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO! This other guy flagged down Wave and now I won\u2019t be able to escape!\u201d, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A member of Night Raid, don't know what your doing out here but that's just too bad. You're out numbered.\", Wave said to the the other guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap, I didn't expect there to be two. That guy who Leone said got hold of the suit said wasn't well trained. But after a few days and another guy from the capital, probably should make a run for it.\", the guy in the white armor thought. He lept up and tried to escape for you and Wave. You didn't try and go after him since you didn't want anything to do with this. But Wave went straight after him. The two armored combatants fought fircely in combat, Wave wasn't going all out since he expected you to come in and help but you had already abandoned him. You ran deeper into the forest trying to use the trees to cover your escape. With nay luck, you hoped they would fight long enough for you to get a fair distance away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew. Finally. I might be branded a traitor now, but screw it. Whatever life I had back there didn't matter to me. I'm better off finding somewhere else to settle in.\", you said out loud. Suddenly you felt yourself move in a dodging motion, for a split-second your suit went on auto pilot and saved your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw a young girl with black hair and a long sword, with a guy with green hair and a long jacket. \"Night Raid?! Gah! Just go away all of you! I'm sick of people trying to come after me for one reason or another!\", you stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lub can you deal with him?\", the girl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leone gave this to me, so I'll handle him fine.\", he held out some sort of capsule with a blueish color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl ran past you at top speed. She didn't seem interested in you apparently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou formed your suit into extending out spikes across your body, in an attempt to intimidate him. \"Heh! News flash assassin, you've never dealt with someone like me before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the guy threw the capsule right onto your suit. \"HA! Sorry I don't need a breath mint.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll chill out your breath, buuuut maybe beyond that too.\", he smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were confused but suddenly you felt ice forming around your body. It came from the capsule and a body cast of ice formed around you now. You were totally incapable of movement and couldn't say or breath. You blacked out from the shock.</span></div></div>",

But we just want the suit.\u201d, Najenda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t get it off of me. Somehow it stays inside of me when it\u2019s not covering my whole body.

I really did not like that guy. He had that vibe that just read, douche.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen the Jeagers?\u201d, Akame reacted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeen them? I\u2019ve been living with them. I know what they can do, to a small extent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guy,\u201d, Leone tried to stop you from walking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c(Name), please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe really could use your help. Why not become a member of Night Raid and help us. If not for us, at least so that no other village goes through what you went through.\u201d, Leone pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI disagree, if you were to go back among their ranks and be a double agent, you could be able to provide us intel and we\u2019d pick off the Jeagers one by one.\u201d, Akame suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAkame, that\u2019s far too dangerous. Esdeath would get wise to that the second one of her own was somehow killed unexpectedly.\u201d, Najenda objected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, not that I\u2019m willing to go through with that plan, cuz I won\u2019t do it, but Esdeath is head over heels for me. And I\u2019m not bullshiting. Why I\u2019m trying to flee from the capital is so that I can escape from her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know how to respond to that.\u201d, Najenda replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood luck guys I\u2019m gone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the walls bursted inward as someone broke in with a cannon.

(Name), so it is what I thought all along. You were a spy for Night Raid, and stole my precious experiment.\u201d, Stylish declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not with them you idiot! They captured me! \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot what the general will hear, when I deliver her your lifeless body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Wait! You want your suit back? How about you have it, I walk out of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hehehe. Failed to mention this, but that suit was never meant to be removed. Not unless the host is dead. And unfortunately that is what I already intended to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou son of a!\u201d, you managed to have the suit form around you and lunged at the doctor.</span></div></div>",

When you hit the ground, you were sure a fall like that would kill any simple man. Then the rumbling from the epicenter of the impact reminded you, \"Oh right, Esdeath recruited these guys herself. Why did I think it would be easy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the rubble arose the doctor had transformed into a mutated version of himself. His mutated form was the size of the whole base they fell from. The doctor's real body was fused on the forehead of the mutated one. In one strike, the doctor smashed a chunk of the base collapsing the structure, intent with burying any and all Night Raid inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How marvelous! I not only crush this bothersome rebellion but have left the one true enemy of my work the last one standing! You who stole my work from under me, after I poured everything into the best weapon the world will ever know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't steal it!\", you yelled out. You latched a few tendrils onto the forearms of the mutated body and launched yourself up to the doctor. \"It found me!\", you hit the doctor in the face with your knee and threw in two punches before the giant body staggered back hitting the rock behind him. \"I AM SICK OF PEOPLE-\", you grabbed the doctor by the throat and started wailing on him, \"Assuming I GIVE A DAMN-\", then you started crushing his wind pipe, \"ABOUT THIS FUCKING EMPIRE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor's experiments suddenly broke out of the debris the doctor created earlier and dog piled you off of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such ferocity. You know the longer you use it, the more it will modify your behavior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cutting down the annoying pests you took a second to interpret his words. \"You mean it will control me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I designed it purely to enhance the most potent aspects of a warrior. Aggression, anger, brutality, all of them are fueled every minute you have it engulf your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THEN FIX IT! OR GET IT OFF ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe. Nonsense, this thrilling drama of my work is a work of art that can't end so abruptly. Either you die by removing it, or you lose yourself. I never planned on the user being so inadequate, like you. I had so many other people who would make excellent actors for this role, but you came and swiped it from under everyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrrrrr SHUT UP YOU RAMBLING LUNATIC!\"</span></div></div>",

You alone were the last of your family to the Karasu family, who specialized in sword combat. Your agility and skills as a warrior were well taught to you by the age of 15, but tragedy stuck by the time you were proficient in your swordsmanship. One day your family died in a house fire, and due to traumatic stress you had forgotten much of the events that happened. But the stress didn't affect just your memory on only that day but a fraction of your life as well. All you had was your Uncle Ezon, who never spoke a word to you, but you were never sure if it was by choice or out of disappointment of some kind. Ezon took you in his home and you attended at the local highschool where you had been handling fine at. However you found joy mostly in helping your uncle teach at his Kendo dojo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut today was a special day for it was your birthday and the cogs began turning in motion for the events that would lead you down to your destiny. Suddenly in a hotel room, a young woman was reading in her room when she felt a surge of magic pulse from across the area. \"It is time now. He is ready.\" In Japan where you lived now you walked across town picking up some new practice swords for the students. Unknown to you, you were being watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou met up with your friend Ono who you could casually talk about anything to. \"Hey Ono!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey (Name)! Didn't notice you! What has you lugging the sticks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Training swords needed restocking, Uncle needed me to fetch them. What is up with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) word on the street is that there is a party in the park over by the river trail. It's going to be loaded with our pals from all of our classes and clubs. Including ahem...the girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha! Well who am I to decline an friendly invitation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet! It starts actually in a couple of hours. If you hurry I can let you tag along with me and we'll get there in about 10.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK I'll hurry up!\", you ran back to the dojo where your uncle was in a meditative state. You quietly placed the training swords in their proper place and left a note stating where you would be until he woke. You met up with Ono and made it to the park. From the lights illuminating the dark and the sound echoing across the park, it was clear that this was the spot. Thankfully though some adults were chaperoning so it meant no one would be getting too crazy. Unknown to you as you walked up toward the action, the steps you took were the first of your new chapter to your life.</span></div></div>",

Some were from your classes and others were people who trained at the dojo. Ono was right about the girls though since you never saw so many in one place socializing. \"What did I say? Am I right or am I right?\", Ono asked with a smug smile. You shook his hand thanking him for treating you to a soon to be fun night. While you and Ono went getting a feel for the corwd one of the guys in one of your class was talking to two girls about something. It didn't seem like much until he said, \"Hey (Name). There are these two ladies asking about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) beat me to the punch already smoooooth.\", Ono joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were they asking about?\", you inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They wanted me to tell you that they wanted to speak to you. In private.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh is this some sick prank that someone planned or are you being serious?\", you asked finding the situation to be far fetched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey if someone is planning anything I'm not in on it.\", the student said leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked to see the girls he was talking to, one was a long brown haired girl with red eyes and the other was another long haired girl with blue hair and matching ocean blue eyes. For some odd reason these two wanted to be alone with you? Was it one of them having a crush on you and the other is a friend who was going to tell for the other? From the body language they displayed the blue haired one was blushing and poorly hiding it, almost like she was advertising the fact. The other was more calm but had a confident grin on her face and waved you over to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are in for a treat tonight (Name) good luck.\", Ono said supporting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked over to them and they smiled excitedly. \"Hi my name is Brie.\", the brown haired girl introduced, \"This is Xyla.\", Brie walked behind you and nudged you closer to Xyla. Xyla was acting like a typical shy school girl with a crush the way she lowered her head slightly and figited with her hands. She raised it up and asked, \"Could you come walk with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\", you answered. You knew where this was going, she wanted to be away from the crowd and have it be just with her friend and her crush. Made perfect sense. You three walked by the river path where you were all alone with them. You looked over by the railing seeing the water reflect the night with Xyla and Brie conversing before finally Xyla spoke with a more relaxing tone and more confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So (Name) you train people at that sword fighting dojo?\", she asked. You replied casually with a yes. \"So tell me, do you have any special girls in mind or are with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one actually.\", you answered feeling a little nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes me happy to hear.\", Xyla let out a brilliant smile and started walking toward you. Brie crossed her arms looking away. For some reason Xyla became so much more beautiful than you initially took. The moonlight seemed to reflect on her in a way that made her look stunningly beautiful. Xyla\u2019s smile was so dazzling it distracted you. Her blue eyes were beautiful, and the way her hair swept over her shoulders was just graceful. You tried saying something really intelligent but all you spoke was, \u201cUhhh?\u201d, Xyla was getting closer. She held out her hands preparing to hold your face in her hands, but then something caught her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me but last time I checked there was a woman he's with. His fiance', me.\", said a girl with long silver hair and a crescent moon on her forehead. SHe was standing atop a lamppost with a book in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The slayer!\", Brie reacted in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name)! Get away from those two, they aren't normal girls!\", the woman yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice seemed to be coming from a long way away that it didn't feel important. The silver haired woman leaped down and from out of her book pages flew out blocking Brie from Xyla and you. It took all of your willpower to finally notice what was happening in front of you. The silver haired woman extended her arm saying, \"(Name) listen to me they want to kill you! You can trust me remember?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, come on,\u201d Xyla protested. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to come to her. How about I give you a kiss instead?\u201d Now with her being so close to you, you noticed that she smelled like roses and clean animal fur\u2014a weird but somehow intoxicating smell. You were so enraptured by her looks and offer that you felt compelled to allow her to indulge you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) get away from her now!\", the silver haired woman cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She\u2019s just jealous.\", Xyla said holding your face with her hands and just about to lock her lips, but the silver haired girl shot a colorful magical blast at Xyla and quickly summoned a barrier around herself and you. It all snapped you out of your beguiled state but you were afraid of who had just saved your life without you realizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were truly flirting with death just now. Have you gotten reckless?\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?! And how do you know my name?!\", you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time she held your face, \"My my it is unforgivable to forget the closest person in your life. Because of our love I can't believe you didn't come to me as I ordered you to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just who are you?\", you said trying to pry her hand away from your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your uncle and my family told me to look after you and that you would be by my side. But it appears you really don't remember anything, do you?\" She then began to pull your face closer to her own. \"The protective charm placed on you must have been extremely powerful.... But I'll make sure you remember.\" she said as she kissed you on the lips. You then had a little flash back about her as a young girl and how she kissed you before. The memory flashed and you noticed the young girl had the same mark as this one. Soon as she broke it off she teleported you and herself away. Leaving you inn confusion and bewilderment.</span></div></div>",

Finally as she said so, most of what was happening started making sense with the memories of your life resurfacing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kuesu?\", you spoke wondering if she was the same girl from the past you remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my darling.\", her face changed from stern and overconfident to pure joy. Her smile still stayed the same but now her eyes melted from the cold and callous attitude she had earlier. She hugged you forcefully as if she had just been reunited with a long lost friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kuesu it's been years. Your hair is different, you're suddenly in japan, and I forgot all about you. Exactly what happened?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) I promise you I will explain but now we must return to the nearest sanctuary from the demons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The dojo. Uncle might still be there.\", you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, not that far. C'mon we have to hurry before they find and come after you.\", Kuesu said taking your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean Brie and Xyla? Who or what were they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously they were much harder to detect for you given their nature. Those two were demon hybrids. A mesh of demon and monster designed to hunt demon slayers like us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Demon slayers? I remember now! I'm one of them and so are you. And they're basically literal demon slayers who hunt us specifically.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely. They blend in with humans because of their monster type nature on disguising themselves from hunters and humans alike. The ones you saw were empousa, creatures who prey on young men for their blood. They were going to kill you, they're great at seducing men which made me not very happy to see you for the first time after all these years flirting with other woman.\", she explained. She held your hand being whisked away across the town at an incredible speed with her casting non-verbal charms and spells hiding their trail from the general populous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both managed to make it to the front steps of the dojo where she explained the rest, \"OK listen to me (Name). That necklace your uncle placed on you after your parents death. That was meant to hide you from the demons while you lived the last few years in around here. We needed you to retain your skills as a swordsman so your uncle let you teach and train with him at his home. Do you remember what you are? Where you came from and what happened to your family exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all coming at once. I need to sit down and-\", suddenly Kuesu saw from afar Xyla and Brie. You turned to see them to but this time you reacted properly in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry so long as we remain around the dojo's perimeter their tricks are useless. They'll come back another day.\", Kuesu said confidently. You both went inside where the two creatures angrily curled up their fists and teeth knowing they missed their chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sister we failed, we almost had him.\", Brie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not fear. Even if he doesn't come out the girl will. And we will be ready next time.\", Xyla said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True but we must plan this delicately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the dojo...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down in your room where Kuesu helped you to bed. Your head was hurting like a migraine making it hard to fully digest everything right now. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it easy (Name). Everything will be clear in the morning. For now let your mind be rebuilt and allow you to process everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kuesu...\", you felt groggy and it was a chore to open your eyes anymore. You gently laid down and fell asleep. Kuesu left your room only once she reentered the training area she saw your uncle Ezon looking unpleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ezon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.\", he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't express how grateful I am by how you took care of (Name).

You got out of bed and into some new cloths and went to find Kuesu. Soon as you entered the training room she was kneeling down with a pot of tea and some breakfast laid out. \"Morning.\", she greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same to you. Ugh...head feels better but a little sensitive if that makes sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well can it take having some of the blanks filled?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First what do you remember?\", Kuesu asked first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the last of a demon slaying family, my parents died in a fire caused by the demons. You and I were friends before that happened, and you mentioned we were promised to each other last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, though you were never told that. I knew when we first met you were my fiance'. Yet still we ended up being great friends regardless. As for your uncle's necklace it blocked parts of your memory to hide yourself from the demons lurking across japan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you and my uncle erase my memory of you and my parents' death?\", you asked irritated by the explanation. You felt a bit betrayed by the outcome given your strong friendship you had with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear that I had no involvement other than I knew about it and that it was to protect you until the charm wore off. When I say 'we' I mean your uncle and the other families who still remain loyal to your own. We did it because you weren't ready to fend off against the demons or kill any. But now you have reached that point and now the time has arrived.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For me to carry on my families legacy of killing demons. Yeah...I remember why I was going to go ahead with it. But just one thing is still fuzzy to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our time together as friends. I remember about me but you...I can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From how you responded to seeing me I wasn't surprised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. But I think it will come back eventually. From now on you and I will be together fighting the demons and stopping whatever plans they are up to.\", Kuesu said explaining the full situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then.\", you said.</span></div></div>",

You quickly learned this was a test to brush up on your skill. \"Kuesu I assure you I'm just as sharp with a sword as you are with magic.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The skill is there, no denying, but you need experience against real foes. Your job for today is to get a hit on me by any means. Do this then we will head out.\", she instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to humor her, you took out a katana and readied yourself. She had a book of spells on hand ready to be cast. Both of you waited for the other to make the first move. Kuesu did having a fire ball summoned right at you, you dodged it easily and charged. She continued firing a few more and you evaded with ease, you were close to landing a blow but you pulled back. The sword was an inch from her, she smiled and then blasted you point blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah! What the hell?! I got you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said land a hit on me. You didn't. See what you just did, if it was against those two girls, you would be dead. Try again and this time swipe at me just don't decapitate my limbs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time you were going to do it however she fired a flurry of them making them impossible to evade. All you could do was block or slice the flames. You could feel the fire from the close proximity but no serious burns. You were close enough to her again but this time you lunged your katana and tore through her left sleeve without making contact with the skin. \"Good. Now when we head out to find those demons any sign of them, eyes on me. Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how am I going to be able to look for them if I can't see them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be a smart ass. Listen last time you weren't ready for them but now you are. You are a demon slayer and a bred warrior, so you can resist their good looks enough to maintain your wits. Besides I'm the only girl in your life worth eyeing at. Eventually we will be husband and wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kuesu I barley know you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will remember in time my love.

I was prepared for just her not both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then what can we do?

Which means either case he comes to us. But we need to separate the two in order for us to sway him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brie I have an idea...\", Xyla explained her plan which from the sound of it gave Brie an excited and sinister grin. \"Excellent. This time I will persuade the warm blooded male. You create the distraction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best of luck.\", Xyla jumped down from one of the buildings and blended in with the general populous.

There were various establishments they could be hiding in and any could be a bigger net to snare in yourself or or worse the both of you in. Kuesu was hoping that whatever trick they used would be something that was deliberately targeted towards your sex appeal or something glaring everyone's attention. Kuesu felt hopeful for those possibilities because she herself was immune to any type of mind charm they could dish out due to having the mental focus and the deep rooted feelings towards you. In fact she felt overconfident in that aspect though not without merit. As you and Kuesu passed by the flocks of civilians your ears suddenly caught wind of a sound coming from one of the buildings, a karaoke joint filled with a bunch of young men inside. You felt naturally drawn to listen closer but you were far from mindlessly compelled. You tugged Kuesu and explained to her what you felt and knew. \"They're in there. Singing a duet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go and follow. I'll ambush them around the back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a terrible idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They won't stay put if you don't take the bait. Besides I have faith in you this time, your not the willing victim you were last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuesu ran to the back of the building and you slowly headed inside. You focused your mind on the fact that these weren't normal girls, they want to kill you. You kept repeating that in your head. Soon the song became clearer, it was just them singing a's in a musical beat. You remained calm, you weren't helpless this time. You could still think about what was going in your head not what was around you. The crowds were cheering and whistling no doubt because to them they were hearing angelic vocal singing from a sexy duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuesu was behind the stage where she definitely heard them singing and ensnaring the audience. Kuesu had out her book reciting an illusion spell so to cover the inevitable fighting that would quickly break out. You stayed at a distance from the stage not willing to take the risk of testing your will. From there you saw Xyla on stage. But all by herself with no sign of her partner. You knew that Kuesu must be in trouble, the other one must be back stage performing her duet leaving Kuesu unprotected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled to pass through the crowd making your way toward the stage. Kuesu was about to attack and was ready to fight. However a strong voice compellingly whispered, \"Come with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as that sentence ended Xyla finished her song walked off into the crowd.</span></div></div>",

Your words of repetition still echoed in your mind, 'they're not human, they want to kill you', you looked away from Brie. Then she said, \"Come with me.\", very politely. She extended her hand out and gave such an adorable smile. It was so cute, so sincere, why not? \"No! Stop!\", you yelled. You wanted to run away, look away from her at least. Her hand touched yours and suddenly you didn't feel so scared anymore. Brie felt like she was ok to be around. She lead you away, wherever she took you didn't matter, she was a friend, or at least a very attractive ally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Xyla got off stage Kuesu fired a sphere of magical energy at her. It directly struck her and made her very angry. \"Slayer! You are a nuisance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuesu quickly realized only she was accounted which meant the other one may be alone with you which worried her greatly. \"Where is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name)? With my sister Brie. She has a lot of things to tell, and do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He isn't that weak minded to your tricks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not against my sister though. She will have him drooling over her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Demonic scum!\", Kuesu blasted a few more but Xyla staged dove into the crowd carrying her away. Kuesu couldn't openly attack her within a crowd of innocent lives, in fact firing while in a crowded area was dangerous on its own. She relented and tried following her but it was too late for she eluded Kuesu and you were Brie's slave for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Brie and Xyla took you to a place that was a hiding ground for demons. With no room for interruption Brie began to enact her game of manipulation. She flung her hair back giving you something to idolize before she started. \"(Name) do you remember me and my sister Xyla?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnnnnooo.\", you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We met you before, that night your parents died. We gave you something to remember each of us by. Do you remember what it was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't....think...\", you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll show you. Come here...and give me a kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly your thoughts formed of desire, the object of your affection requested you to provide a token of affection. Brie placed her hands under your chin, you quivered and felt scared, excited, confused, delighted. Then it all went blank except the feeling of her lips and tongue dancing and rubbing around your own. The scent you remembered from Xyla last night overwhelmed your sense of smell. The euphoric feeling felt unreal and yet so within reach of your body. Sure enough Brie pulled away and handed you off to Xyla. \"Good work sister, now with this last kiss he will be able to remember everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hazily opened your eyes as the kiss nearly conked you out of consciousness from being so intense to your senses. When Xyla had exchanged control she was somehow more beautiful than her sister, dare to admit even more than Kuesu. Comparing them to her seemed like an unwinnable debate but still. Her face seemed more attuned to your deep personal desire of beauty. Her smile stalled your heart beat. And time merely stopped the moment she spoke, \"Hi there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Brie who forced herself onto you Xyla knew from before you were attracted to her and now could see you were in awe of her. \"(Name) do you know why you can trust us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You love me?\", you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie laughed mockingly. \"No it's because we will make you remember what that slayer made you forget.\", Brie explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give me a kiss now (Name). One kiss, for love.\", Xyla encouraged. You leaned in, Xyla placed a hand over your cheek and placed a soft kiss on you rather than the more passionate and harder one Brie gave. Your vision became dark and suddenly true to their word, the gaps began filling in what was left blank in your memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out Kuesu's family did force you to forget, but worse her family could have saved your family that night but chose not to. This wasn't even a falsehood they made up, it was all fact. Now with the knowledge of betrayal from your so called fiancee' and your family the sisters were pleased having successfully accomplished their mission.</span></div></div>",

She at first saw nothing out of the ordinary of this part of the park where the empousa girls were hiding. But knew how she could draw them out. \"(Name)!\", she called out. In no time both girls revealed themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're too late slayer. Your boyfriend knows the truth about your families abandonment of his own. And with that in hand he'll be devoted to our cause.\", Brie stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuesu didn't let that knowledge surprise her. She simply held a blank cold stare at them and didn't lose her cool, \"It was an eventuality.\", she simply replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe empousa girls were confused by her statement, \"You would have told him yourself? How reckless.\", Brie responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is my fiancee', I would never hold any secrets from him. He needed time to piece together enough so that coming out with it would be smoother. But having you manage to skip that step for me only makes it easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! You planned on this?! Impossible!\", Xyla reacted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He wasn't strong enough to resist against the two of you in the state he is in now. Which was why it made it so easy for you to believe you won. But you underestimated my faith in him. I know regardless of his feelings he will have against me and my family, he won't join you.\", Kuesu smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us test that then.\", you said emerging from the trees. You had your sword out and got in the middle of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) I understand your resentment towards me right now and my family. But I had nothing to do with their decision to let your family die.\", Kuesu explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They died that night because your family abandoned mine! I was there, I remember seeing them! They stood and did nothing! Why?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They told me your family was brash and impulsive. You and your family was the very last of your line. It was considered a waste to give aid against such powerful demons. If you hadn't found them then those two would have drunk your blood dry and I would have been promised to another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't listen to her (Name) she doesn't care for you. We do. We showed you.\", Xyla used her charm on you influencing your choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lowered your sword in disgust and in anger. You looked at the demon girls again. Flawless, beautiful, truthful. You turned to Kuesu. Harsh, cold, liar. In the heat of the moment it seemed like switching sides was viable, until Kuesu triggered a memory when she said, \"Just know this, I will have your back (Name), always.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly remembered what that meant. It was the promise the two of you made together while her family sheltered you and took you in. You two were sitting on the edge of a hill and said the same thing to her. You saw flashes of the moments, the times you and Kuesu had that gave you a history that she faithfully believes in even though you didn't remember. At that exact moment there was no choice, only action. You lunged your sword at the empousa girls without mercy or hesitation.</span></div></div>",

As soon as you both settled and finally made yourselves comfortable Kuesu was ready to explain her family's motives. \"My family is the lowest slayer family among the 12. We have been gaining power by any means necessary. It's why we combine western magic with traditional. Because of your family's brashness when word got out they would be attacked they stood by knowing there was no hope for them. Until you survived their attack at which point they figured if someone with exceptional skills could be properly trained, then it was worth bringing you in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they arranged us together because of our potential to be the strongest warriors of our generation. You snapped some memories of our past, when we were childhood friends. But they're still hazy. And I don't even know if what I felt for you before is the same as I do now.\", hearing those words broke Kuesu's heart a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about I talk about what happened. What is the one you remember best?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we first met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, well I'll try to tell it best as I can although I'm not a good storyteller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fire away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>One day I was told I would be meeting someone who they said would be my future husband. Then they took me to my great grandfather's old lake sanctuary, where you were staying at the time. They introduced us, I was unimpressed. You were so uninteresting and not very special. They had us interact with each other much as I wasn't pleased. We went for a walk along the path across the woods by the lake and the whole time I didn't speak. And you were quiet too for a while, but I believe you were just nervous talking to me. Until you saw a flower along the way and asked me if I wanted it. I shrugged you off disinterested, but I was flattered by that being honest. When we went back to the house they made us sleep in the same room. Then before we fell asleep you asked me if I hated you. I finally replied, ''No. You're just boring.''</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite a switch from how you act around me now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me (Name) you were persistent. But you did soon enough steal my heart, rather you still have it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed, \"Kuesu...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should get some sleep for now. But hey, if you ever want me to talk about our past I will always be happy to do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\", before she dozed off you said this to her, \"Hearing you talk about it makes me feel at home. If that makes sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuesu's heart danced, \"It doesn't matter to me.\", she said smiling before shutting her eyes.</span></div></div>",

This time it was like last time where she used her more aggressive and powerful spells so she wasn't going easy this time. You spent most of the fight trying to break through her defenses but you managed to find an opening in her technique. Her spells had you consistently moving around tiring you but some of them were slow enough for you to get it close. So just before the next powerful spell came, you ferociously cut passed her defenses and held your sword to her face. Kuesu seemed pleased by your sudden advance but she still assumed she'd win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yield. \", you said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't beat me, you are exactly where I want you.\", Kuesu laid a trap and summoned an energy prison around you. \"I had you at a distance for far too long easily taking advantage of the fact you need to be near me to attack me. Be more aware of what your opponents strategy will be in defending themselves from you.\", she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good tip, now can you let me out please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\", the energy lowered and turned into dust. \"I will say if you had taken that chance sooner I'd be done for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? So I should take more risks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you'll be killed that way. Know. Don't assume. Take what action will assure you victory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged off the sourness from all the training and went back inside with Kuesu. She held out her hand wanting you to hold it. Hoping to take advantage of any opportunity to rekindle your old romance. You couldn't immediately fall back in love with her but you couldn't shake the desire to want to. You accepted her offer and held her hand which made a few more memories resurface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recalled the night after your first kiss with her and she became different to you. Now she would clung on to you all the time and she was more cheerful and happier around you. Those were her happiest times in her life you felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Let go of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! You're my fiancee' you can't get rid of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just let go of me please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't leave you. I won't let you go.\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kuesu! Come back inside now!\", her father called. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must let you go. But I'll come back my future husband.\"</i> The memory felt nice. You changed her for the better perhaps. She never did leave you alone after you two kissed for the very first time. Something that remarkably wasn't yet fully developed in your memory. You went back to your room and sat on the mat with Kuesu. She poured some tea for you and began making small talk. \"So how have you been doing?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just fine I guess. It was boring having just doing mundane things all the time. All I did was work at school and just work here all day.\", you said taking a sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does seem boring. I could have made it more interesting though.\", she flirted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe I believe you. But enough about me for once, what's been going on with you? Your hair is different for example, I remember it was brunette when we were younger. What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On one of my missions the only way I could stop a group of demons was by using a forbidden and dangerous spell. It was very risky as it nearly cost me my life so now I have silver hair as a mark. A permanent edition to reminder of weakness for having relied on such unstable magic to get me to this point in my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it this way honestly. It matches your skin and you look more radiant because of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, you always had a way with words (Name). Anything I thought was painful, you could make me feel better about it. Truth be told it's one of the reasons that got me to fall in love with you.\", she came closer holding your cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remembered when you clung on to my arm after our kiss. You were so cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know how to express my feelings back then. But now I do.\", she pulled your face closer until you stopped her lips from touching yours again. You leaned away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Kuesu. I'm....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it.\", she quickly said. Her heart felt crushed a little by your rejection but knew that patience was what she needed to do. \"Come on, were wasting daylight. This time we don't rest until those two demonic abominations are ashes.\", she said now more determined than ever. This time your confidence was higher than ever and you had no doubts for them to exploit. Kuesu and you left the dojo on the hunt.</span></div></div>",

So far everything was normal and only difference was that there were less people than before. Things seemed calm until when an explosion came from a hotel nearby. You both rushed inside to see where it was coming from or who may have caused it. Kuesu stopped you from entering though as she pieced something together, \"Stay here. It's too risky having you up there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you go into battle I go with you. Besides I can handle them this time!\", you protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) wait here. I'm not sure those demon girls are the ones who did this so we don't know what were up against, if I need help I'll call you.\", she pecked you on the cheek and left with her book. You didn't want to disobey her but you took out your sword and tailed her when she got far enough in. You kept your distance so she wouldn't notice you but close enough to watch her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after making to where the explosion hit, Kuesu saw that a demon was talking with another one. They spoke in another language so she didn't know what they were saying. She tried seeing who one of them was but one disappeared. The other was a brutish bull from hell and started charging through the walls trying to collapse the building on itself. Kuesu casted a protection barrier on the structure causing the demon bull to knock back. Furious it went looking for who conjured the spell. Kuesu revealed herself to it planning something, \"You are one ugly demon. I actually know a girl who at least looks easy on human eyes when she turns into a cat.\", she mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon bull charged at her but ran into another trap. This time a mini tornado blocked it and flung him near the edge of the building. But he regained his balance and charged around it flanking Kuesu. Seeing that spells were too long and ineffective she took out her hand gun and as soon as the dust cleared she fired a few shots. The bull charged again but she teleported behind the demon and shot at it again. The demon bled from the bullet wounds but didn't seem to do enough to weaken it. The bull turned around and ran at her again, but this time she teleported again and the demon ran out the window falling all the way down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt tried to cling to the building but flew too far off and crashed into the pavement. Kuesu looked over to see it vanish from existence. To her delight it did and it no longer threatened anyone. \"You can come out now (Name) I know you-\", she cut herself off upon seeing who she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to disappoint. \", Brie replied coming out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Least you saved me the trouble of looking for you. Where is your sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh she's around. Want her? All you need to do is get past me.\", she challenged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That demon I fought was meeting with someone, another demon. Discussing about a secret plan you demons are concocting?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just tried to bury us all alive so that there were no witnesses. I doubt us being here was pure coincidence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well in the meantime...\", Kuesu holstered her gun.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You ran up through the stairway searching for Kuesu. But the debris and sounds of the building collapsing gave off an unsettling vibe that made you more worried about her. You thought you heard Kuesu come down the stairs but it was really Xyla who seemed surprised by your arrival. \"(Name)!\" You holstered your sword and without even stopping for any reason and lunged at her swinging it ferociously. \"Wait! We didn't do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious my sister and I are innocent in this matter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still dying demon! You won't turn me into a pawn anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your right!\", she managed to grabbed the hilt of your sword locking your hands together, \"And that's what I want to free you from.\", you remembered the games she played before you were ready to see her in that lovesick vision you felt when she pulled that trick. But not this time. This time she spoke what she said only no glamour spell to lull you into believing her. It didn't fool you though and you went on to kick her in the gut and tried impaling her. Xyla jumped over the space in the middle of the stairwell and flew up. \"She isn't who she says she is.\", she said and again nothing feeling like she was tricking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen out of the wall beside you crashed in another demon! It was very spider-like and fast moving. It's body was skinny and had many limbs with a mutated face of spider and human meshed into one which made it disturbing to look at. It wasn't aimed at you but rather was focused on destroying the building itself. The spider-demon spat out acid around the stairwell and walls weakening the structure. You knew your best bet was to run down back to solid ground but some of the acid melted through the stairs on your way down and you fell right off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sure you would fall down but you felt someone grab your left arm, Xyla?! \"What are you playing at?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had our reasons for coming after you. But first we must capture that demon so we can learn who sent it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no we!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a demon yes, but I work under a family who also hunts demons. Even your 'fiancee'' can't deny that others haven't done this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you say so?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth is, Brie is only my half-sister. She was bred to hunt demonslayers her entire life. I had a choice. If you remembered back far enough, you know I'm telling the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't trust you!\", you swung your blade at her again. She blocked it and grabbed you by the collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) living under Kuesu's wing is not set and stone. You have me too. Your Uncle. He knows. And I'll prove it to you.\", she let you go and flew up to combat the demon. You felt normal not a single moment of feeling manipulated. Why? She was telling the truth? Nothing that came from her mouth had any validation after setting your memories in their proper place. Either way Kuesu needed help, you knew and that spider-demon needed to be stopped one way or another.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back with Kuesu, she was locked in combat with Brie. She was fired her spheres of magic energy at her, but Brie dodged them with ease. Brie countered with attacks of her own and Kuesu dodged them as well. She jumped back until she was a safe distance away from Brie's attacks. She was focused on the fight right now, but at the same time she couldn't help but get worried about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)... I hope you're safe,\" she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. It would be wise not to take your eyes of me,\" Brie said as she went on the attack again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuesu sensed that Brie was coming and was about to point her gun at her, but her reaction came too late. Brie knocked the gun out of her hands out of sight and fired a spell at her. She barely managed to dodge it, but it grazed across her arm making a small burned mark. She then fired a spell of her own. The spell hit it's mark and sent Brie skidding back, but she managed to stand her ground. Then Kuesu pointed her gun and started firing at Brie bullet after bullet. Brie tried to dodge all of the bullets, but couple of them managed to graze on her. Brie leaped back attempting to gain some distance away from Kuesu, but she kept on the attack by firing another spell. The spell hit it's mark and sent Brie flying making crash against the wall. Brie groaned and felt like her body was hit by a truck. She was about to get up, but then she found herself staring Kuesu standing right in front of her with her sword drawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's over,\" said Kuesu. \"Now, I need you to answer some questions for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think you're gonna get me to...\" began Brie, but then Kuesu pointed her sword dangerously at Brie's throat cutting her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be wise to comply, otherwise I'll won't hesitate to kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie immediately froze not moving an inch knowing Kuesu would make good her threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, first things first, tell what you know about the demons. \" said Kuesu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly out of nowhere, a glob of acid shot from out from the darkness and knocked the sword out of her hand. Then another glob shot out straight at Kuesu. She jumped out of the way and fired a spell from where the thread came from and assumed that she hit, but then a shadow leapt out of the darkness and went straight from Kuesu. Before she had a chance to react, the demon threw a powerful bunch straight at her stomach. Kuesu gasped as she felt the wind get knocked out of her and the force sent her slamming to the ground. Brie seeing this looked at the shadow as it landed to the ground. It was the spider demon. The spider demon talked to Brie using the same language. Kuesu couldn't make out what they were saying due to her still feeling dazed from the impact. If she had to guess, the spider demon must have come to help Brie which was bad for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it all,\" though Kuesu. \"This is bad. If those two are working together and without my sword, there's no way I can take them both on at once. If I can just get my sword...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuesu made an attempt to try and reach for her sword, but the spider demon saw her and shot webs at her arms and legs preventing her from moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie looked at what the spider demon did and glared at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you doing? I had her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider demon spoke to Brie saying 'it didn't look that way to me' Then it said something that made Brie's eyes widen in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider demon continued to talk. From what Kuesu can gather just by looking, she guessed that the spider demon was making some kind of deal or explaining something to her. When it finished, Brie nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then walked towards Kuesu and began charging a spell in her hand and aimed it directly at Kuesu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry demon slayer, but I'm afraid it's time to die.\" said Brie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuesu tried to break free from the spider demon's thread, but it held her in place. Just when Brie was about to fire the spell to finish her off...</span></div></div>",

Brie only registered your presence when the blade made contact with her left arm. It cut clean through with blood spurting out for a moment then dripping over like a faucet. She didn't scream or speak just a look of absolute rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're dead mortal! You won't die admiring my beauty but terrified of my real form! I'll will cleave your head from your very shoulders!\", she threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuesu grabbed her sword and made a B-line to Brie. Kuesu stabbed and jabbed at the demon-hybrid mercilessly on the offensive. Brie grabbed the blade and kicked Kuesu in the gut again with her prosthetic leg. The blow was worse than the last one having her insides already sore but the blow was harder and deeper. Kuesu knelt down and Brie was ready to thrust it into her head until suddenly...clang! Xyla kicked it out of her half-sister's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sister?\", she said being confused and felt utterly betrayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry sister.\", without another moment to sink in Xyla clonked her demonic sibling off the roof with her fist. Now all the was left was the Spider-demon but as with most others it wouldn't go quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt pointed directly at Xyla like it was placing her as a traitor of its kind. Xyla without hesitation lunged at it wither her nails extending like claws and with you alongside her ready to cut it into pieces. The spider-demon used its strength to crush the roof enough to get the both of you to fall. Xyla flew out of the way but you completely fell in. You managed to cling onto the top by sticking your sword into the structure. The spider-demon breathed in and spat out a stream of acid at you. Luckily Kuesu placed a protective sphere around you saving your life. Xyla flew in behind it and cut into its skin but it was too thick. It grew out an extra pair of arms around its back and clung to Xyla's wrists. The next pair grew out and grabbed from its rear a thread of webbing and tied it around her neck. The web was strong as piano wire chocking her to death. Kuesu then began using a string of lightning strikes from her spell-book and electrocuted the beast. The shock fried it making it collapse to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeakened it couldn't defend itself having now the three of you corner it. \"Ask it a question. It won't have much time left before it dies.\", Xyla said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you try to destroy this building?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It horded the clans of the demons. It was our army.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why destroy the army?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Break clans and the survivors go into hiding. Go into hiding and flock toward our new one eh hahahahaha-ack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is this new army?!\", the spider-demon shriveled and had its limbs in a curled state around it's belly. You kicked at it in frustration. \"Jerk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he wasn't working for you? And you aren't working for who had you hunt (Name) as of late. What are you up to ayakashi?\", Kuesu asking ready to blast her to cinders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was a spy for another demon-hunting house. And I have no idea where this new demon army is being gathered. I was with only the biggest group of ayakashi that were known among most in hiding. We were unorganized and not capable of destroying what was done here today. At least not so blatantly. Whoever did this wanted as many to rally behind against the 12 families. And you two are their #1 targets now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't answered!\", you threatened holding your sword to her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have left them, I'm a rouge. Judge me now for what I have done. Or am I to be blamed for a crime I didn't commit?\", she sternly protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you have done was trying to brainwash my fiancee into a slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was all a cover, besides he wasn't a bad kisser.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fu-\", before you could do anything Kuesu stopped you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now I'll reserve judgement. You may accompany us back to the dojo but you will be kept prisoner until I verify that you are one of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kuesu?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are families that have housed rouge ayakashi (Name). I want to be sure so that we have alleys in the fight to come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\", Xyla bowed, a hidden smile sprouted just as Kuesu casted the spell, then you and Kuesu and Xyla teleported back to the dojo.</span></div></div>",

Yet the details were still so sketchy only time would begin to unravel the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the dojo Kuesu had transported the three of you back to the dojo where Kuesu cautiously escorted Xyla to a certain part of the area where she used her most powerful sealing magic to keep Xyla imprisoned until Kuesu was certain. \"It's too dangerous Kuesu we should kill her and be over with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me I would but we need her alive until I figure this out.

I want to feel how you do with me but so much time has passed and it feels weird having everything come back and still not be the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry (Name) I should have known how you were feeling after what I and those demons put you through. I'm just too impatient. Good night.\", Kuesu said leaving to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went to bed and laid down trying to sort passed everything on your train of thought. \"Kuesu...she was my fiancee and still is. I can still feel what I felt but it doesn't feel the same like before, almost like it is our first time being together as anything. Xyla was there that night but what is she playing at? If its true then maybe she was protecting me from her half-sister. Certainly make sense. But then again I don't trust her even if she was a double agent. Sigh...I can't focus when I'm fighting with me being so uneasy around the both of them. Tomorrow I need to do something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuesu meanwhile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sighhhhh. (Name) no matter how much I throw myself at you and tell how much I like you and want us to wed, you still aren't letting us be together the way I hoped. My darling (Name) I feel so ashamed of myself for leaving you alone. All the time we could have had just by being together without our duty interfering with our relationship. What worries me is what the demons said to you that makes me worry, did what the other families do to yours truly shake your faith as a demon slayer to consider betrayal? I must keep a close eye on you, and I must find a way back into your delicate heart. (Name)...\", she thought to herself.</span></div></div>",

She quickly got dressed so she could see you as soon as she could. When she got her breakfast ready she already made an extra meal for you. She hoped it would spark your interest or at least make you appreciate her generosity but it was passed 10 o' clock and nothing from you. This made her uneasy so she hastily went to your bedroom to check on you but to her surprise you were still asleep. You were sound asleep breathing heavily. Kuesu found you to be so cute while like this, she quietly walked in your room knelt down and looked at you as you were asleep. You were so tired that you didn't even know she was there next to you. Kuesu gently stroked your cheek feeling your warm skin over her fingers. But Kuesu felt the presence of someone behind her, luckily it was just your uncle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuesu didn't say anything feeling awkward and embarrassed by him walking in on her inside your room. He came in to and knelt beside Kuesu. The middle aged man didn't say a word he didn't have to explain a thing because there was nothing to explain. He gently patted you on the back still showing his love for his nephew. \"You still care for him?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.\", he said answering her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anyway I can reach out for you to help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head, his face changed from calm and collected to twisted into a saddened face of pain. Tears rolled down his face and he gripped his hands into his pant legs. \"I'm sorry about that night. I wish I had him to keep and take care for. I'd have given him everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmmm.\", he grunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuesu got up and began to leave, \"Tell him food is on the table, it's getting cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour uncle rubbed his hand over your back gently, he may have made it tough for you but it didn't mean he cared any less. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meanwhile your friend Ono, who you last saw a couple days ago, was starting to be more curious about why you have't been at school. He was at his usual hangout by the arcade texting you a bunch of messages. \"(Name) it's me. What happened last night? Seriously call me dude.\" He was planning to go to the dojo to be sure you were safe since being MIA for a few days straight with no communication made Ono more worried you got kidnapped or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided giving you one more call would be the last straw before heading there. \"(Name) pick up the damn phone. If you get this I'm headed to the dojo to see if your fine. You better be sick, dead, or mute when if I find you there. If not...I really hope nothing screwed up happened.\" Soon as he hung up he was making his way to the dojo from the arcade. Then while he was walking past the more vibrant area of the arcade a faint voice came into his ears. \"Over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOno turned around thinking he was about to be mugged. He saw nothing but the mindless attention of several gamers glued to the screens of flashy machines. Ono figured it was nothing and went on, then the voice was louder. \"Ono! Over this way.\" He knew this wasn't background noise from a game, this was some freaky anime stuff. \"Go inside the janitors closet. You will be safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what?!\", nobody heard him as the volume of noise drowned out his conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The spell that will be casted in 5 seconds. Go now.\", it said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOno went in and shut the door. When the 5 seconds were over the door creeked open by itself. A girl with pink hair, blue eye shadow, red lips, and emerald green eyes appeared before Ono. \"Walk with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The area around us has been frozen. Time has slowed to a quarter of a second that movement has been rendered minute. Let me get to the point, (Name) is in danger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Is this some kind of crazy epic fantasy thing where he's the destined messiah to beat the ultimate evil?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No he's not that central, but you have the right idea about what he faces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must be chosen because I'm the moral support and he needs me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly, you put yourself down. You will be invaluable to (Name) and his survival.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will see...now boy look into my eyes.\", Ono had his attention on the girl. Before she finished her words he eyes caught Ono's attention as she bugged one eye at him. Then without blinking had opened up her eyes in a staring gaze. Then the irises in her eyes rotated like wheels in opposite directions. After they completely spun around at first the lights were moving normally again. But their positions all seemed to be centered around her now. Like she was the center of the light in the whole arcade and the light exploded off her whole body outward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was moving much slower for Ono. When her irises rotated Ono thought he was getting dizzy. Then he noticed that it made him feel light headed. The sensation was odd. Unnatural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the irises made a full rotation the white in her eyes began changing into a fiery yellow. Her irises went from just a green shade to a turquoise, orange, and red. Three layers of color forming with Ono in sheer awe. Ono's focus was on her eyes as she asked him. They were telling him something, something important. At first Ono couldn't make out what her eyes were telling him. They were just a morphed blend of color with no pattern. Ono wanted to focus, he tried.but it made him feel spacey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother rotation, this time he felt compelled by the eyes to focus. He still couldn't understand even though he wanted to. Then another rotation, this time the blurred splatter of color was taking shape. Ono was amazed, it looked unbelievable. His body felt numb. Now having seen a glimpse everything around him felt lost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother, then when the picture became more clear his feelings were being replaced with a level of impending danger. It looked horrifying. Ono began backing away from the eyes. His numbness was growing butt it was hard to tell if the increased disturbness of what he was seeing made him stagger back in fear or his body growing limp. Because of this his vision was blurred again like static.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis own eyes were turning lazy-eyed. As if one eye wanted to follow the one it was fixated on.  They were going back close together but, the dizzying effects were taking their tool. His head bobbled side to side with an audible moan of motion sickness escaping his mouth. His eyes were rotating opposite of each other mimicking the eyes he was seeing. His head jerk around a couple more times until he staggered back further until he fell on his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow his body was motionless with his mind centered on the girl's eyes. Ono's fear was gone then as his thoughts were becoming harder to form in his head. It was all just processing what he was being shown. Now it was all a full kaleidoscope of color, the images were making sense. The entire process was draining him, but Ono couldn't resist to soak in every detail this girl was showing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't they the most beautiful eyes in the world?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOno could't answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you have seen can never be forgotten. These eyes bring you great knowledge, great pleasure, but foreshadow great danger. Do you understand your role Ono?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOno nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let this be our link to each other. You and I are connected in a way not many share. We share everything, we complete our gaps, we have a gift that is rare as the winter rose. We share the omniscience bond. Go and may our next encounter be soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOno's next thoughts and feelings could never be brought to words but what she described was all true. Finally as Ono felt allowed to blink everything strange and odd ended instantaneously. \"Till we meet again...\", he thought.</span></div></div>",

Ono followed them without being noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery time you went out of the dojo more an more danger appeared in plain sight. \"Kuesu is it ever safe to be out on the streets anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There seems to be some kind of powerplay at work, so I'd say no. Why?\", she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will they be targeting just us or other people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both. Some hunt normal humans, others bait demon hunters.

She stared blankly off in her room, letting her mind circulate in thought. Then her attention got directed toward her desk. She went to it and pulled open a drawer, inside it was a scrapbook, in it were photos of you and her when you two were kids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one was the day after you first met, her hair was still brunette then and her attitude was stoic. You were next to her smiling and having your arm around her neck. Kuesu smiled thinking back on that moment. When that was taken she had nothing to feel good about, but now it felt like a good memory now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuesu flipped over a few pages and looked at another picture. This one had a heart around over it, she remembered when she was making this that this picture was her favorite. It was the two of you, hugging and rubbing your cheeks together, with both of you smiling. Kuesu teared up for a moment, the happiness from the nostalgia hit her more than she expected. She thought maybe another look at one more would be enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to the very last page in the scrapbook. The last picture was one of you and Kuesu waving to the camera and you were sitting over by the mountains. Kuesu looked at it with intent wondering where those good times went to all these years. But then she noticed something in the background. Curious, she took the picture off the page and took it to a magnifying glass. She saw in the distance a distinctly blurred section. She was no photo expert but she could see it was some sort of alteration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c(Name). Just what were your family planning for you?\u201d, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took out her phone and called up a college, \u201cSherman I need a favor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need you to take a photo under a deep magic analysis.

Despite what others claim, you knew better. That fire was the result of the 4th Holy Grail war. Your sister was among the last to remain in the battle, but she lost her life. Now you were the head of your family's magus line. You were skilled in Time Alteration, Mental Interference, Healing, and knew some Earth Magic for defense exclusively. You were never one for attack, your sister specialized in that aspect. However you were expected now, to be a master for the coming Grail war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only catalyst you had to use to summon a heroic spirit was a feather of an old bird. You had no idea who it would summon, but if had to be the best servant for you to use. Your servant would help you fight the 5th war and take the Holy Grail so you could make your wish come true. Seven servants, only one left standing, only then would he grail appear and fulfill the remaining master's desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time was right, and the incantation was ready, \"I CALL ON YOU, IF YOU HEAD THE GRAIL'S CALL! COME FORTH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour servant emerged. Standing in the center of the magical circle you made, a regal figure with an oddly shaped crown of sorts appeared before you. \"I am The WIZARD KING!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA king?! A wizard? Impressive to say the least. This will be an interesting chapter in your life.</span></div></div>",

So lets start with the heroine of part six Stone Ocean, Jolyne Kujo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 19<br>\r\nHeight: 174 cm<br>\r\nWeight: 58 kg<br>\r\nAppearance:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJolyne is a young woman of above-average height and slim to athletic build.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has light, turquoise-blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBold-eyed, she wears her hair in two \"layers\": A dark base including two large buns atop her head and a short length going down her neck; above which, lightly dyed or bleached, she keeps a plait or braid that winds around both buns, joining in a short length at back, and bangs that frame her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJolyne has a small star-shaped birthmark on the rear of her left shoulder, close to her neck; and has tattooed on top of her left forearm the image of butterfly wings superimposed with a downward-pointing dagger, which reappears on the chest of her outfits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJolyne's depiction in Part VI transitions slightly from a slimmer and smoother to a more dynamic and athletic build. Simultaneously, she works through a number of primarily dark outfits, characterized by a spiderweb-like print. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStand: Stone Free<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStats:<br>\r\nDestructive Power: \tA<br>\r\nSpeed: \tB<br>\r\nRange: \tC (1-2 m)<br>\r\nDurability: \tA<br>\r\nPrecision: \tC<br>\r\nDevelopmental Potential: \tA <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearance:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStone Free is a humanoid Stand of a height and build similar to Jolyne's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wears what appear to be a pair of sunglasses varying in darkness, obscuring vertically ridged eyes. Four blade-like protrusions run over its head from the top of the jaw to the back of its neck, bordering the sides of both eyes. Cones truncated at a length of one-third the width of its head protrude from the region of the ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wears elliptical shoulder pads with a vaguely snakeskin pattern, and hexagonal knee pads. Several patches of its lightly-shaded body reveal a fibrous interior, wound horizontally. Its forehead, neck, arms, and the area from its midriff to the top of its feet bear small, evenly spaced studs/bumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComposed of string, when unraveled its texture is like silk, apparently smelling of soap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Star Platinum, Stone Free's Stand Cry is \"ORA ORA ORA ...\", though it appears that Jolyne articulates this rather than her Stand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbilities:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    String Decomposition: Stone Free enables Jolyne to unravel her body as string. She may unravel around 70% of her body harmlessly, as well as quickly rewind. A versatile ability, feats it enables include Jolyne hiding parts of her body in spaces like a person's mouth, and weaving disguises or nets to trap enemies. At harm to herself, Jolyne may also cut her string for a further variety of applications. Stone Free's maximum range, unraveled to 70%, is about 24 meters.[2]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        Stitching Wounds: With her string, Jolyne may stitch wounds sustained by her or her allies to an improved healing speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        Long-Distance Hearing: By the same principles behind the tin can telephone, sound vibrating through her string, Jolyne may eavesdrop on distant conversations.<br>\r\n        <br>\r\n    Super Strength: When Stone Free's string is completely wound or compacted, it is very strong; the destructive force of its punch roughly equivalent to that exerted by a small, extremely fast meteor</span></div></div>",

Well let me make this 100% clear, I have never believed in the boogeyman. Yep, for my whole lifespan I never believed in monsters, nightmarish terrors, those creepy looking masks you see on Halloween. Never once got scared or believed any existed. But that might be because I'm one of those pessimistic douche bags who suck the life and fun out of everything but that's beside the point. For some reason my parents always loved getting me into the spirit of Halloween, and all those cheezy but admittedly cool movies. Sure I didn't believe in any of what was going on but I'm never going to trash the story of Frankenstein.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with my distaste for the wishful thinking of the supernatural being real in mind your guessing wait? Isn't this a self insert type story? Well your absolutely right, But I'm not the one who gets the girl, that would be you, lucky bastard. Well anyway I'm someone who comes in later. No it is not Ko. Too obvious. No, I'll show up to drag this story's plot along. But the real meat is getting you into the arms of that succubus that's destined to be with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow ordinarily these stories begin with the typical, you were born here, managed to get wrapped in this location, adolescent drama ensues. But in this story that isn't the case. No, your being saved for later. for we are taking a glance at the other most important character of the story, our young lady Kurumu.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a terrible afternoon, the worst kind, nothing was going to keep it from ruining everything. A young schoolgirl sits in the shade, crying her eyes out upon learning devastating news. She cries and can't stop for any reason. In the distance a group of people watch her feeling for her situation, pitying the poor girl. her only hope of survival is to find new love, one that can surpass her first love. She needed someone, she needed you. Her time was growing short now, you needed to be the one she gives her heart to now, but how long will she have?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cried whispering to herself, \"Tskune.......I can't love nobody else....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Unrequited love has been shown, some have seen it turn for the better, but more often they are devestating. This Tskune character chose another girl over her. And for those who don't know succubi thrive on love. To her, that succubus is living a fate worse than death, that poor girl is Kurumu. But hope is just beyond the horizon.</i></span></div></div>",

Nobody was around. Not a sound could be heard. The brokenhearted girl stepped inside, seeking an outlet to try and express herself. In the past she sung her heart out and it always fueled her passions and motivation. But her tears and choked up throat couldn't let out her voice. She sat on one of the chairs laid around looking at how such she always loved the beautiful sounds that were made when she attended class. As her eyes wandered around the room, she noticed a new instrument that was added, a piano. She always loved listening to just the piano but never could learn to play it. Too complicated. But for some reason she thought to maybe try and play it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down and started off tapping a couple keys. Then she went and started tapping on another set with her other hand. And suddenly, as if music began forming life, she played, and she was playing well. She couldn't believe it. She never prided herself on learning things so complex, but here she was creating a song that sprang to life so many notes and the emotion of her broken heart began to speak, or at the very least cry through those musical notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she kept playing,she didn't know how she was doing it but she kept playing, and playing, until she heard someone open the door inside the room. \"Oh!\", Kurumu reacted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry, I thought you were someone else.\", Kurumu's friend, Mizore, was the one who broke the succubus out if her musical bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you think I was Yukari?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Nobody was supposed to be here now since all the classes are done for the day. I thought you were a ghost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't we literally have ghosts as students here?\", Kurumu asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I honestly don't know.\", Mizore sat next to Kurumu. \"Was that you playing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe it or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was very good. I thought you were a singer at heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you and me both know, our hearts got really broken just now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tskune chose Moka over us because it was who he wanted to be with. Sigh....but I hoped it would be me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here. Only difference is, I will die from it. You'll at least live to get someone else.\", Kurumu pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You certain nobody can fill the void Tskune left in your heart?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll die from this, it's only a matter of time. If I can't live on love, who knows how long I got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore comforted her, hugging her in a chilly but tender embrace, \"You aren't alone. Even if Tskune doesn't love you the way we love him, then at least know he doesn't hate you. He is still your friend. And we love you too Kurumu so don't die.\", Mizore said. She kept her monotone as she said these things but her emotions could still be heard within them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You saying you love me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore blushed, \"I mean...we love you like family.\", she affirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurumu looked at Mizore intently, \"Kiss me.\", Kurumu asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiss you?\", instead of a violent reaction Mizore kept comprised and while surprised she didn't feel a harsh sense of rejecting the idea. This wasn't the first time they had kissed. Kurumu did it at a time when Mizore was at her lowest point. That moment made Mizore think that perhaps this was what Kurumu needed too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to know something, just a kiss.\", Kurumu explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizore nodded and leaned in, the two girls were on the verge of closing the distance....CRASH! The window shattered as something was propelled into the room with  Mizore shielding Kurumu and herself in an ice dome protecting themselves from the derbies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\", Kurumu asked.</span></div></div>",

Obviously excited about what you have just received now, you make a hasty trip there first chance you get. He lived very far away, and up high in the mountains. For about two straight days, you took a plane to the area, then a solid 3 more to hike up the mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever grandfather left me, had better be worth it.\", you said exhaustively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay Six<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally reached the top, you made it and could see the place miles away. Just from the high view, this place was the most beautiful location you had ever seen. Although the lack of people made you a little on the nervous side. With all the landscaping and excessive care to make this place such a marvel, there had to be people living here. More accurately the hired help had to be around and about working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got nervous, maybe you took a wrong turn. Or maybe this was the wrong mansion located in the mountains. The townsfolk said there was two so maybe he took a wrong turn up the trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued walking to the mansion itself passing by the gardens, maybe anyone there might give you directions. But then you felt a tremor, the ground was shaking and a loud noise was booming. \"Earthquake?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo.....a herd of maids came busting out the main door coming right at you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHHHHHHHHH!\", you screamed.</span></div></div>",

When they caught you, the world around you vanished, they had sucked you into a mob, from which you had zero chance of breaking free of. You were shoved, crammed, and felt the hands of several women all man handling you. Hugging, petting, glomping. It was as if it would never stop, and you would be dead, but a overpowering voice came from somewhere inside the crowd. You could vaguely see who, but in seconds the crowd spreaded out a bit. \"Welcome!!!\", the voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis maid had two large pigtails on the sides of her head, wearing an orange-esque color. She held out her hands and cupped your face. You were exhausted from the swarm you managed to love through so you couldn't be in much of a demanding mood as you were gasping for breath. The touch of her hands made you feel more awkward with having this much physical attention. But as she had her hands on your cheeks you felt this girl pulling you towards her. You felt confused by her gesture, but it hit you then, she was pulling you into a kiss. Your heartbeat grew steadily faster, the stress of everything was making this sweet moment in your life feel like you were in a war-zone. Just moments before you made contact, whether instinctively or in an attempt to speak against this, you opened your mouth for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally your lips touched hers, her soft lips felt smooth and you felt yours somehow remain locked. But she didn't intend you to have your very first kiss be cute, she intended it to be quite passionate. She pressed your mouth further into her own, her lips moving around your own, massaging your own. But it quickly went from a passionate kiss, to a full on sucking of face. Just before the audible smooching sound coming off the two of you, you moaned from the sudden force and pleasure this brought out. She moaned following yours either because of the force her kiss was delivering or she interpreted your own as a sign of enjoyment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held you in a lip lock for a few more seconds snogging you until she pulled away ever so slightly. A small gap was between the corners of your mouths but your lips were still touching. From a small window it could be vaguely seen, the tongues that were dancing within this forward force of affection. She kept pressing hers onto your own, with you only succumbing to the passion, giving no feasible resistance you wanted to offer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter one final moan from the girl, she fully pulled back ending the kiss, to your relief. Your heart was slowing pace from the sheer shock of the last 2 minutes. As soon as you regained your senses, you stepped back and demanded some explanations. \"Ok, what was that for?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is our tradition, which is why...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen two more girls who looked like the one you just kissed stepped in, \"Were all getting our turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All...\", you blankly repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the swarming mob went back again, although instead of ripping you apart, they were getting more literal with your clothing. You could feel the various pecks and sucking noises being made by a bunch of maids, all kissing you. Not limited to your lips this time, but all over your upper body and face. For maybe a solid minute they all sought to plant lips on you. It was less pleasurable with your body being restrained and the crowd forcing their way to you, kissing you forcefully, and quickly. But their lips still provided a level of affection that wasn't all unpleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally it came to an end when somebody called out requesting it to cease. By the time it did, you had kiss marks all around your upper body from your arms, chest, belly, and forehead. Either everyone was wearing lipstick or they were skilled in leaving noticeable hickeys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't the master uncomfortable? Oh hello I'm Mariel, head maid of the mansion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. Do you mind explaining what is going on? And why the neardeath experience?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies. Our maids here are very affectionate and we have been anticipating your arrival for a while. Please join me as I discuss what you have inherited.\", Mariel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"</span></div></div>",

On top of that whatever I ask you will be required to do, no matter how insane the request? That's basically what your saying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. Many of our traditions were modeled after your grandfather's wishes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING?! YOU MEAN TO TELL ME YOU ALL MADE OUT WITH AN OLD GEEZER?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. He was very flirtatious but only went for women his age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't answer my question!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh then its a no. The original staff was let go due to his passing and most of us have only been maintaining the household and learning the traditions for when someone would inherit the estate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hearing that I'm being labeled as a sex manic on sight thanks to my granddad's reputation doesn't make me feel any better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Mariel explained the details you were less the enthusiastic. \"This is still too sudden. 'Feel free to do whatever I want?' Do you expect me to just treat you like slaves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well its a dark way of putting but, more or less.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't! You can spread the word to every single maid here. Nobody is being treated like mere objects while I'm around. Now I'm opposed to being roped into this, but I am not going through the hassle of going back home the way I came, so for now this is my home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent news master (Name). I shall give word out to the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First things first, where is the lavatory?\", you asked politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scampered across the halls looking for the bathroom until at last you were successful. However soon as you found it you were confused, two staues of naked women beside the seat, but no sign of a flusher. \"Where the heck do I flush?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Press the statue's nipple.\", someone replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no it's true.\", soon as you did, an audio of a women's sexual moan hit the room with the flushing sound in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that geezer the biggest pervert of the rich people world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was envied by many as having access to many women in his privet home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, that makes sense. By the way why am I talking to some- gah!\", it finally hit you someone was invading your privacy. \"Wait I know you! You were the first girl that made out with me! And you were there, and YOU were there. And you were there too!\", you said pointing at the reflection of yourself. \"Oh yeah, no shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the three identical girls were out of sight, but you felt your pants being unbuttoned and loosened. \"WHOA HEY! GET OFF ME! Hands off the belt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The old master told us to do this.\", one of them said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I AM NOT HIM! Geez did he buy your silence?! That can't have been legal! STOP UNZIPPING IT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please be quiet, and stay still, you are making it harder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OTHER WAY AROUND! STOP! I CAN'T HOLD IT IN!\", you really needed to go, but now their intervention had brought up an unnecessary motivation below deck. Your needed to go, bad but now you needed to go in less than 3 seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you-\", you interrupted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GO AWAY OR I'LL...I'LL!\", in normal adolescent situations, this is typical for a young man to wet his pants while the opposite sex is present. But when has it happened when said sex had tried taking off your pants and forced out said outcome, the embarrassment levels couldn't be more higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just go away and let me change out of these.\", you spoke in a very angry tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, WE must do the changing!\", one of the identical maids said. They grabbed your pants much to your disdain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I SAID STOP! CEASE! DESIST! That's an-\", with that you were naked from the waist down. They finally left soon after in a blink of an eye, leaving you beyond bewildered. Luckily the baths were right beside the bathroom so you went to wash yourself. If not from the trip, then to cleanse yourself of that horrible ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swear I will fire those three! Ahhhhh but at least this will calm me down. Uhhhhhhhggggggghhhhhh! These maids need serious personal space rules. I'm not going through that again.\", you got in the water, rested on the stair and relaxed. The room was very lovely. Beautiful architecture of statues decorating the room. If this wasn't run by crazy hire help this wouldn't be so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat changed soon as you thought it was over. Suddenly those three spawned from under the water, and like you, were stark naked! \"I TAKE THE FIRST BATH IN OVER 5 DAYS AND STILL I GET NO PRIVACY?! JUST WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU THREE?! HUH?! WHEN I SAY NO, YOU GET THE DAMN PICTURE, GOT IT?!\", you said snapping at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough they backed away and lowered themselves in the water. \"We apologize master.\", one said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were are only following our duty.\", another said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we don't then we lose our only jobs here.\", the last one finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are sorry master (Name).\", they said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonal space invaded 3 times over and then some, you at least relented your anger at them enough to allow them another chance. \"Ok. But I ask if you hear me say to hold back on your duty, you will do so when I ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely master. Shall we begin washing you then?\", the one in the middle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok just for reference who are you three?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Ichigo.\", the middle one said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Ringo.\", the left one followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Sango.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we shall be taking care of you.\", they said together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh. Fire away, just leave the personal spots to me please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in your personal bed. The day was done and you had so much on your mind. \"Ahhhhhhhh........this is just crazy. One minute normal life, next a harem is now my life until further notice. Jeez louize. At least I have my rest to get me through the night.\", you thought to yourself. You turned off the light and started going to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you put your foot in your mouth when you saw and felt three lumps under the covers. Shocked, you turend back on the light only to find the triplets being what startled you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master going to bed now? Well then let us give you the final service of the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou backed away at the end of the bed in a mixture of embarrassment and horror. One of them turned out the light and from there darkness. You couldn't see but all you could do was feel. Feel them around you. From the sense of their actions, they had simply gave you a goodnight kiss, while they each ended up spooning with you through the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of insane asylum is this?!\", you cried out. Truth be told you couldn't tell if you said it aloud or thought it so loudly you assumed you yelled it out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Last night, post late night shenanigans, you managed to sleep well. The girls all didn't bother you in the middle of the night and just slept with you, though if you had to be frank their spooning did make the night far more relaxing. They ended up being surprisingly tender and their warm bodies did their job to keep you warm through the night. Morning finally came by and you started to wake up. As you started feeling yourself drift out of your state of comfort and you began feeling your environment, you felt as if your breathing felt like your breath was muzzled. You were mostly breathing through your nose in your sleep, but for some strange reason your mouth felt weird. You were too tired to care so you just tried getting more rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls on your sides were awake finally and their first sight of the morning was a bit of a shocking one. \"GASP! Sango!\", Ichigo and Ringo both screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir cries didn't shock you out of sleep but they did wake you up. You slowly opened your eyes, your vision adjusted to waking up. It took you a couple moments to realize but you saw Sango's face extremely close to yours. You figured she was resting on your chest, except you still felt your mouth muzzled by something. You looked down and noticed your lips were locked with hers. You were starting to put two and two together. Weird breathing. Kissing Sango. Weird breathing. Kissing Sango.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master (Name) can you breath?!\", Ichigo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Yeah I'm breathing through my nose just fine. Soon as I stop kissing Sango I'll go back to-. Wait wait wait.\", your thoughts were finally running again but moving at a snails pace. Mornings make you take time for your coherent thought to finally kick back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started moving back to try and get her off of you, and you started screaming into her mouth with the audible hint you didn't like this. Ringo started pulling Sango off, while you pressed her off too. Soon as your mouths broke apart and a loud, \"Mwah\", came out of the separation immediately following that was a huge scream from you, \"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathed heavily trying to make sure you weren't dying. Ringo tapped her sister's face to be sure she didn't pass out from oxygen deprivation while she had her mouth blocked by yours. Sango woke up not realizing what she was doing just a moment ago. \"Oh thank goodness. Sango-chan what were you doing?\", Ichigo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, I was sleeping on Master (Name's) chest last night. Nothing more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My morning breath would beg to differ.\", you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sango you must have slid your head downward to the master's lips during the night. It's incredibly lucky you both didn't suffocate.\", Ringo explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than be worried or filled with apology, she instead was ecstatic. \"A kiss! A kiss! The young master kissed me!\" Her sisters face palmed as did you. \"That was the longest kiss of my life then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget it. I'm brushing my teeth, and I may need to drink the mouthwash to get the breath out of my system. I'm just relieved nobody was seriously in danger.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were all relieved hearing your warmer tone and not a repeat of your attitude from yesterday. \"Sango you couldn't be more of an air-head.\", Ichigo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I was just, flattered. I wasn't fully awake, but it kinda felt nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps we need to rethink how to approach things with him. Huddle up I have an idea.\", Ichigo suggested.</span></div></div>",

You sat by the fountain with the main garden looking tranquil. You always savored moments where you could enjoy scenery like this, when so often you rarely get a chance to enjoy the things in life you can just look at. Mariel came by in a pleasant mood, \"Master (Name), I am aware that even though you are the inheritor of this estate I have some news you should be made aware of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to run an economy here. Someone else has to be more qualified for that. Besides I don't know squat about business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. It is much more important, you see you have become your family's new head.\", she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait? Like in terms of everything about my family? I now dictate where it all goes? But my parents are still alive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worry not, I already checked if they were fine. They are both alive and well, it's just that in your grandfather's will we just found out something. Since he gave you the estate and his shares, that legally puts you in charge of the family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway I can give it to anyone else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the sky got a lot darker. \"Uhhhh is the daylight here schizophrenic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's an airship. And not just any. Master (Name) despite your reluctance, you will need to be the family head right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took heed of her words, her tone and just how serious nature this was all turning into, you stood up and tried appearing as formal as you could. The airship landed with a pair of secret service looking people on the sides of a red carpet that was laid out once the ship landed. Then a pair of ruby high heels tredded down the steps, followed by a red dress with a purple bow tied behind. A refined and lovely girl with orange hair and huge pigtails walked across the carpet meeting you face to face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. This place looks so dreadful, well anyway you there servant, go fetch your family head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for the confusion but I am the new family head.\", you spoke politely. Her mocking the mansion really urked you seeing how it looked gorgeous, what would she know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh please that can't be you. Just tell the new family head that I am Ryuuka Jihiou, and I must speak with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me ma'am, but- \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you gawking at? Oh, well I can understand how you must be attracted to my unsurpassed beauty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just told you it's me. I AM THE NEW FAMILY HEAD.\", you said emphasizing the painfully obvious to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAAAAAT? But your just some random guy who could have been plucked out from any hole. I have to deal with you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please the compliments your giving are just too much. While I'm at I'll return the favor with, your angry face makes your teeth look crooked.\", you jabbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOW DARE YOU!\", she said punching you in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat punch was so hard she knocked you flat and made you pass out for 2 minutes. You woke up in one of the lounge areas where Ryuuka was sitting across from you with Mariel beside you, with Ichigo, Ringo, and Sango tending to your injury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I should apologize for attacking you. My temper is something I should show some restraint on given the circumstances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kidding. But I will admit that was a hell of a punch.\", you said turning the mood on itself. It even earned a giggled out of everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm amusing, you have a sharp tongue, however I hope your maturity is sharp when you need it to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Ms. Ryuuka, from what I can assume your family isn't buddy buddy with mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. However that is going to change, since in order for me to be the new head of the Jihiou family, WE MUST MARRY.\", she dramatically declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marriage?! No way!\", you reacted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sucks I know, believe me I'm not happy about it either, but that is how it has to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SO WHY DO YOU WANT TO MARRY ME IF YOU HATE ME!\", you said getting confused by her strange motivation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just told you, if I am to be the new head of my family I must marry into yours. Specifically you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone else want some snacks? I haven't eaten this morning.\", you offered. One of Ryuuka's guards was interested so you kindly offered up some food laid on the table between your seat and Ryuuka's. But your scatterbrained attention drove her into being overly ticked again. She smacked the tray of food and then grabbed your collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any objections to this marriage?!\", she said angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No shit I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, don't you like me?\", she started to act all gentler putting on a pouty face to try and get you to change your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've given me no real reason to in less than a minute. I'd say you flunked the first impression.\", if her attitude wasn't crap you would actually said yes. She looked very nice and to be honest it didn't matter who you married as long as they weren't scumbags. But she was acting like a real scumbag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrrrrrrrrrrrr! Well I won't take no for an answer! I will marry you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know being the head if this family draws in more attention than I'd like. In fact I'm planning on passing it down. So when I set that up, I'll try and make sure he meets your specifications. That way everyone wins.\", you suggested trying to diffuse the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not mock me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to be married to you, so we will have to live with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what will it take for you to say yes then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about leaving, I can be open to that snowball in July's chance we could end up together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FOR REAL! I am willing to be submit to your demands, but only through a fair way of expressing who's wishes beat the other's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what a challenge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly! One single test to have our family's future be decided. Do you accept this proposal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about it for a second and figured if it would stop her harassing you it would be perfect, \"I do.\", too bad your choice of words couldn't have been any more poorer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HA! I GOT YOU! Then it's settled!\", she said laughing like she won a popularity contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean the marriage proposal!\", you clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your words were spoken exactly 'I do' and in front of witnesses. Don't worry, the wedding was already arranged to be here on the spot.\", Ryuuka grabbed you and hauled you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELP MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!\", you screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariel and the maid triplets just stood in disbelief. \"Do you think she will allow us to keep our jobs with Master (Name)?\", Sango asked. Ringo and Ichigo facepalmed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't just let her get away with this. Right?\", Ringo asked Mariel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'm sure there must be a way to get him out of this.\", Mariel replied.</span></div></div>",

You had to admit it was impressive but you were still against the arrangement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Ryuuka for the last time I never agreed to this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said I do, after I said do you agree to my proposal. Just wait here, the tailor's will take your measurements and have your suit ready. Oh and to make sure you don't get any cold feat,\", she handcuffed you to her wrist, \"I'm breaking the seeing the groom before the ceremony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I want is to NOT BE MARRIED!\", you loudly objected to her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm aware your not crazy about it, in fact that's all we can agree on. But it is best for our families in the long run. Besides at least you are getting the better end of the bargain. I at least have to get used to your looks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, your personality is so ugly I can see it seeping through that angry face you make when you get too volatile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrr! If you make one more remark like that, then I will bury you soon as we are legally bound!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But after the honeymoon?\", you joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHY YOU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Mariel and the maid triplets were going through some documents seeing any legal loop hole they could exploit to get you out of marriage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't find anything. Apparently (Name's) grandfather never anticipated marrying into a rival family. All the others are about certain others.\", Mariel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it really nesecary? He doesn't like her, much less marry her. In fact we'd be better brides than that hot-tempered wench.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot-blooded females are his substitute? C'mon Ichigo. He'd never want to marry us. And even then he would have to pick me, you or Sango. Were just his servants, nothing more.\", Ringo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...sigh. You're right.\", Ichigo replied somberly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand, I don't see why we can't just voice our opinion. We've slept with him, made out with him, only thing we haven't is f-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sango shut up!\", Ringo yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wait! She's right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryuuka isn't a fan of (Name) at all. But if we made him out to be a womanizer, Ryuuka might become too disgusted to marry him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it will work. Ryuuka is determined to be the head of her family, (Name) could be the exact opposite of her type and still go through with it.\", Mariel explained. \"The only way to get him out of this is to have a legal excuse to make sure she can't go through with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they heard an organ playing an overture which meant the wedding was starting right now. \"Oh no! Girls, stall it however you can. I'm going to keep looking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh why can't his grandfather have let (Name) have his way?!\", Sango said. The triplets ran to the ceremony as fast as they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were chained to the stand where the priest was there awaiting Ryuuka to walk down the aisle. You tried getting out of your restraints but you couldn't break out. Surprisingly the priest didn't seem to have any issue with it. Then the music was playing the typical dum dum da duuuuuummmm which as expected Ryuuka was walking down now. She didn't look entirely happy as she did, maybe because you were still trying to break free, or she didn't want this anymore than you did yet dealt with it anyway for the sake of her family. She walked up to the stand and stood beside you, while you continued yanking your chain. Ryuuka grabbed your hand and squeezed it real tight forcing you to stop struggling and wince in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to join this man and this woman in matrimony.  \"Ryuuka Jihiou, do you take this man to be your husband, to live<br>\r\ntogether in matrimony, to love him, to honor him, to comfort him, and to keep him in sickness and in health, forsaking all others, for as long as you both shall live?\", the priest said his lines to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do.\", she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\", you yelled out. Ryuuka squeezed harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You already agreed to this (Name) don't give me cold feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never agreed! Your ah! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\", now she was on the verge of snapping your bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's just shy, go on.\", Ryuuka insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then (Name), do you take this woman to be your wife to live together in matrimony, to love her, to honor her, to comfort her, and to keep her in sickness and in health, forsaking all others, for as long as you both shall live?\", he asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain of Ryuuka crushing your hand was way too much for you to resist again. You nodded but mostly out of sheer pain. \"You may exchange rings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuuka pulled out yours and placed on your mangled hand, \"With this ring, I thee wed.\", in a very loving tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have one but Ryuuka pointed to your suit pocket where her ring was waiting. She still had hold of your one hand so you just got it over with and placed her ring on hers. \"Then by virtue of the authority vested in me under the laws of the Jihiou, I now pronounce-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the triplet maids finally made it yelling out, \"WE OBJECT!\", causing Ryuuka to be beyond pissed. But at least she released your hand finally. \"Ms. Jihiou, we would like to enlighten you on our master of his miscellaneous deeds in his very short stay with us.\", they said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, there is nothing you can do to stop me. Were just three words away from being married.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! But you forget you have to pucker up and land a big fat one on him and then you will be married!\", Sango replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRingo and Ichigo face-palmed again at her clear stupidity. \"Just to rub it in I'll do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't if I were you. His breath probably would kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please.\", she took a small whif of your breath and suddenly she felt incredibly sick. \"Eullllllllllghhh! Have you eaten wild boar?!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My breath still reaks from this morning?! I thought I got Sango's breath out of my own!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? You've sullied your own nest?\", Ryuuka said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just me. Ichigo, Ringo, and most of the entire staff. It's an all female staff and he wasted no time enjoying the benefits. We had such a pleasant night together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you....you.... hoar.\", Ryuuka said in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figured out what the triplets were up to and ran with it. \"Yep, and if you marry me. That behavior is part of this package. Married or not I'm still staying home, with my lovely maids. All of them willing to please me, however, I, desire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You had to be the sleaziest little man I could have gotten to be a husband! I would never marry you!\", she cried out causing the reception to gasp. \"But I'm far too close to becoming the head of the Jihiou family, so finish the speech.\", she told the priest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man and wife. You may kiss.\", he finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuuka closed her eyes, puckered her lips, grabbed you by holding your shoulders, and then darted in closing the distance. You had no time to say or do anything before she roughly crushed your faces together. Her lips squashed over your mouth aligning perfectly in this one-sided kiss. Her open mouth smooch was loud and sloppy, either on purpose or that was how well she could kiss. You were shocked and wide-eyed at the sudden turn of events was, in total disbelief of what was happening. \u201cMmmmph?! MMMMH!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clamped your eyes shut, and struggled to pull apart in a vain attempt to free yourself. Her grip held firm, as your head couldn\u2019t budge an inch within the girl\u2019s strong grasp, allowing Ryuuka the freedom to kiss you for as long as she wanted. She moaned softly as she did while her warm, soft lips puckered and pressed, in a forceful, rhythm over your lips, while she ignored your muffled cries of protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe triplets looked away in disgust by Ryuuka's unromantic sign of affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ryuuka\u2019s lips finally pulled away from yours, with a sharp wet pop and a vocal \u201cMWAH!\u201d, you let out a barrage of disgusted retching, hacking and spitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we are married and I'll be sure you don't go sleeping with the hired help, HUSBAND.\", Ryuuka declared in victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid he isn't your husband Ryuuka.\", just then Mariel stepped behind the priest with something in her hand. \"This proves that this marriage wasn't legal.\"</span></div></div>",

Therefore he can't be married to you when he is already with another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh?\", you reacted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since when?!\", Ryuuka asked demanding an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From this photo, you see our young master with his lovely bride the moment they were pronounced man and wife. We have the entire staff as witnesses, plus all the paper work that legally binds them. Feel free to look them over.\", you checked the picture. It was you and one of the triplets making out the day you came. You were beyond confused and baffled as equally as Ryuuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't he tell me this? LIES! This is all lies! You mean you married one of them?!\", Ryuuka said tossing out words in total rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't want to waste the chance, you went alone with it, \"I was trying to tell you, but you kept shutting me up! Now you look like an idiot not knowing your groom is already hitched.\", you played along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This isn't over! Gimme those papers! I'll have my lawyers and best people figure a way to let me into this family! And you will regret making a fool out of me! When I figure out a way to marry you, I'll be sure it's legal, binding, and you will learn to love me you sniveling bruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuute!\", she yelled storming off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon everyone left and you managed to evade marriage but you had tons of questions. \"Thanks alot Mariel. But how they hell did you fake that stuff in such a short time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be me! Ikuyo Suzuki, I orchestrated most of this. Mariel only gave me the idea.\", a maid popped out of nowhere. She was like most of the other maids except she wore glasses, stereotypically indicating she must be a genius mechanic or something brainy. \"You see that picture actually I took to capture the moment. Though I gotta say never thought it would come in handy. But the marriage paperwork and all that other jaz. They'll know it's fake in about two days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it mean then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Means we stalled them.'', she answered smiling widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, if they know its fake and it is then I'm technically married to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not true I recorded the entire thing, again capturing the moment, and legally your not married. Never said 'I do'. So what you need to do before they come back is marry one of those fine young maids there, until she doesn't come back again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face went red as you could already tell what that meant. Ichigo, Sango, and Ringo all squealed. \"WERE GOING TO BE MARRIED! IT'S ALL OF US OR NO DEAL! DON'T WORRY WE'LL SHARE YOU.\", they all said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mariel is what the Ms. Suzuki, marital attorney at law, saying true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahhahahaha! That was a good one. I think I'll put it on my resume.\", Ikuyo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that I don't appreciate the effort but was that the best idea you had?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When Sango said why your grandfather didn't let you marry who you wanted, it reminded me of a line in his will. So Ms. Suzuki managed to create a convincing story that would allow Ryuuka to leave. You not saying 'I do', might actually make it stick now.\", she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your getting married either way but at least they aren't forceful as Ryuuka.\", Ikuyo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frankly not by a whole lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we WILL change master (Name) we will change!\", the triplets said in unison again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh...it can't be helped. But thanks. If not for you three, I'd be with that crazy psycho.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then, everyone gather around, gather around we have a wedding to fall through with. Were in the mood, we have what we need. Now we just have to seal the deal to make certain they buy it for real.\", Ikuyo said leading a few maids around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time like the present I guess.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright (Name) I just need you to do a few things. First order of business, make me in charge of all marriages within the estate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now do you take Ichigo, Ringo, and Sango, your maids who tend to your physical health, your physical desires, your lustful fantasies, and obvious kissing fetishes, as your lawfully wedded wives. Which you will all cycle through daily to spread evenly so that he'll be fair.\", she started off. You felt embarrassed by her exaggeration of how the triplets did their jobs, but they didn't mind, which worried you even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we all sleep with him at night?\", Sango asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\", the triplets let out an excited cheer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back on track, will you take them, to have and to hold, in sickness and in health, so long as you all shall live?\", Ikuyo finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the triplets, not two days in they have more than shown you plenty affection, but if this was going to be a temporary set up it wouldn't be so bad. Besides, they helped you get out of an unhappy marriage. Might as well be stuck in a troublesome but overall far more pleasant one. \"I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok you three, same thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WE DO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then by the power invested in me by our master (Name), and legality of this marriage that was done through loopholes, technicalities and other convoluted stuff. I hereby pronounce you four, Husband and Wives.\", Ikuyo proclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of an kissing onslaught they instead went with a loving group hug. The maids all clapped, some crying, some cheering, some confused. But for all that happened this did feel nice. After the ceremony you went to bed to enjoy a good night sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut of course that wasn't going to fly with your new wives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been waiting (Name).\", Ichigo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We intend to make your nights a dream (Name).\", Ringo followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets, do, it.\", Sango finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAH! AHHH!\", you weren't very enthusiastic after having suffered enough affection for one day but given how its the night after marriage it couldn't be helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all puckered up and closed their eyes, they stuck out their lips seeking your face. In your eyes, their faces started smashing together and their lips started forming into one. And then you could only see nothing but pink, and hear the sounds of smoochy sounds. And so they kissed you yet again. Their soft lips frantically were placed all around your face. You were getting used to the feeling of being kissed that way to the point it started being less unbearable. You weren't sure if it was a sign of losing your sanity or just warming up to the triplets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes of that happened before finally you all rested for the night.</span></div></div>",

Now nearly every free moment you had was with one of the girls either fighting for time with you. Trying to get alone with you. Or all of them smothering you with affection. In the past couple of days the girls were growing wise to the fact you weren't enjoying this arrangement as well as they were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was morning, you woke up, this time no girls lips woke you. You still did find them around you as you slowly rose out of bed. You smiled, thinking that while they were aggressive they were indeed friendly, if excessive. But you were still getting up to your boiling point, since even when they all said they would improve, they haven't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got out of bed and did your usual morning routine. The girls were still asleep thought by the time you had gotten ready for the day. Perhaps the idea of them being married to you was like a dream they didn\u2019t want it to end. You went off to go and talk to the maid who helped you dodge the bullet from yesterday, Ikuyo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were already out of bed, but didn't so much as glance at them when they said good morning. Mainly due to the fact you didn't hear them as the door's noise from closing made them inaudible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. It seems our husband isn't feeling in high spirits.\", Ichigo noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he's having an allergic reaction.\", Ringo thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe he's gotten tired of us.\", Sango thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSango's twins sisters looked at her with glares as if they were looking at captain obvious. \"Sango, if anything Id say out of the three of us, it's YOU who he's tired of dealing with day in and out!\", Ichigo yelled out. Sango left the room, her head lowered feeling like she keeps screwing up. Mariel caught Sango, who looked at the twin with a level of urgency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sango? Why aren;t you with your siblings? I never once seen the three of you apart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sisters and (Name) think I'm an idiot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sango I'm certain (Name) doesn't think that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes he does, he stopped talking to us. He's never happy. And he ignores us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariel thought for a second wondering if what she was saying had some truth to it. \"Sango, why not go talk to Ikuyo. She may not be a psychologist but she's good at working solutions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSango thought it was a good idea and went to see Ikuyo. </span></div></div>",

Need me to annul another marriage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Our master I feel doesn't seem to.... like how I shower my affection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even 3 weeks in, and already your having troubles. No worries, hehe I just happen to have the antidote to your problem. Ya know Sango, if you feel the master is so displeased with you, I got a way to make him happy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis!\u201d, she presented to her. It was a coin on a string.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA coin? He wants pocket change?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo no no! It\u2019s like those silly moments in anime where they hypnotize someone into doing whatever they want.\u201d, Ikuyo explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe wants to make people do what they want? I thought that was what were here for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO NO NO! Use it on him.\u201d, Ikuyo reacted in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhhh. Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve hidden security cameras around his room and tapped his laptop. Specifically whenever he\u2019s looking up things incognito, I see what he sees. And I gotta say he\u2019s really into this. A hidden document of his favorite hypno scenes. Of course he doesn't look it up now, because he's all over the place, but this used to be his thing. So what you see him tonight, throw this his way and he might take you up on the idea, thus he\u2019ll start to notice you more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou peer into his private browser?\u201d, Sango asked missing the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNevermind that! Just take it to him, wave it in his face and get him to like you more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do I do it?\u201d, Sango asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh easy. About here you just swing it, like a clock and then say your commands in a compelling monotone. Cuz he loves it being done from women you should have no problem. Make him look deep at the coin, make him look deep at it, let him follow it, back and forth, back and forth. Until his mind becomes blank and willing to obey. Then at the last moment of his will assert your power and tell him what you command. Say something like you will get a full arousal, and hypnotize everyone into an aroused slave. Or something silly like that. Hehehe. He\u2019ll- hey Sango why the drool?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake everyone have arousal.\u201d, Sango swiped her coin and started swinging it. \u201cYou will get a full arousal and make everyone feel the same wayyyyy. Hypnotize everyyyooooonnnnneeeee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh no! Really shouldn\u2019t have tested on her, she so dimwitted she\u2019d fall\u2026..under\u2026.. Yes master.\u201d, in that moment Ikuyo was hypnotized and went to do it to the others along with Sango.</span></div></div>",

It stood out among all other's due to its ability for the players to interact within game to high degrees. But after a 12-year run, the game servers were about to be shut down. Within the game existed a guild named, Ainz Ooal Gown, once consisting of 41 members and credited as one of the strongest guilds in the game. Now only 5 of the members remain, the other 36 having quit the  game. Of those 5 only one actually continues to play; his name was Momonga and he remained the guild leader, maintaining their headquarters, The Great Tomb of Nazarick. He invited the remaining guild members but of those only two appeared...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys. Great to have you back in-game.\", Momonga said. Sitting around a large round table with the two other guild members sitting in opposing directions. To Momonga's right was a slime avatar called HeroHero, the other was you, a Dark Elf avatar you named Elven Black. You preferred to create your names based of of your characters classes or backstory you established in-game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good news for you Momonga, with this being the final day, I'm planning to stay until servers shut down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?! That's great. You too HeroHero?\", Momonga said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naw, I have work tomorrow and I feel how my Avatar looks. I'm not staying long. But hey serious kudos. This place looks great. I can't believe you kept it up and running for as long as you have. I hope we meet IRL dude. See ya.\", the slime avatar said with a sad emoji as he teleported away. Logging off the game one final time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This sucks. I'd have thought maybe the others would come back one last time.\", Momonga said slamming his fist on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry dude. The game ran its course. I guess people prefer to get on with their lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh what about you? Don't you have work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Between you and me I'm only 12 IRL. The avatar just looks like I'm 16.\", you confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A 12 year old with a job?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of. I don't work work like you guys did, but I have consistently done yard every season. Shoveling the snow, mowing grass. I've done enough to where it kind of counts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, you're lucky. I have to get up at 4 in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yyyyyyikes. Sucks for you dude. Maybe you should take my job instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks. I'd rather keep mine that doesn't have me sweaty all the livelong day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh it makes the cold showers worth it. Anyway, lets enjoy what we made here dude. I don't want the last few minutes to be in a dull room with skeletor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lol! Good one Black! Hold on, maybe we should bring the staff. SInce it holds all of our old friends' power in it. The culmination of our hard work in this one item. Make the last few minutes fitting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No reason not to. Besides makes everyone else not being here less depressing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Momonga walked out and saw a line of servants greet you as you walked out. \"Hmm, maybe we should let them do something for today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, nobody else is here. And were minutes away. Nobody will give a @#$% what we do. We could nuke the entire tomb and get away with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See your point. Follow us.\", Momonga commanded the servants. The two of you walked into the throne room where the strongest NPC guardian stood beside Momonga's guild leader throne. The undead overlord sat on the throne looking at the legacy he and the others left behind. \"You know what. I've spent so much time here. I feel maybe I can let it go knowing I'm not the only one who cared as much as me. Since you don't have to get up so early, how about I leave Nazarick  in your hands?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! But your the leader. I don't deserve it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you joined while there was just me and the other three. You may have started out weak, but all that time you spent with me when there was nobody else. It was nice watching you rise up the ranks. Jeez I sound so sentimental.\", he reacted with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I wouldn't have gotten to as high as you without your help. But I don't deserve it. I'm not worthy of holding that staff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you said, nobody cares, its the last day after all. I can't let the only other person who was dedicated to this not get a chance when I've had my fill. You earned it.\", Momonga handed you the golden staff and you felt like you inherited a fortune. You got a little emotional, after years of working and playing the game, this felt like such an accomplishment. While saddened by the inevitable state of things, he accepted the reality that the game was over and it was time he logged off. <br>\r\n\"Goodbye, hope I see you IRL too.\", the guild leader left with an empty seat left in the wake of his absence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat in it looking at the NPC's and navigating through the menus. You looked at the NPC who stood next to the throne, the succubus, and looked through her settings. \"Hmm wait? her personality is she's a bitch? Who would put that in there? Those perverted sick bastards never could keep from acting like trolls. Maybe I can fix it for the reminder of the night.\", you used the staff to change her data and entered the words, \"Has huge crush on Elven Black.\", you chuckled thinking you were being a total geek for doing that. But you had little care since you noticed the game was on its final minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that is the end. And with his last mark, the Dark Elf inherited, though briefly, the leadership of the legendary guild. And with the final minute counting down, second by second, he rested, peacefully drifting with the knowledge he earned the greatest power in all the world.\", you monologued keeping to your character's roleplay. And so, you stayed in the guild alone until the servers shut down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the time being midnight on the dot, there was nothing but darkness. It was official, the game was over. Then the time kept going, the game was over, but your stay in the tomb, had only begun.</span></div></div>",

HEY WHY AM I STILL HERE?!\", you yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a problem my lord?\", you turned to where the voice cam from, and to an even greater shock it was from the NPC. \"What is troubling you?\", Albedo asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah! Why did you speak?!\", and it occurred to you then your voice changed, possibly to reflect your avatar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me lord Black, I did not mean to speak out of term.\", she apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! I was just rattled by something. You are forgiven.\", you took a moment to gather what was going on. You tried opening the menu but nothing happened, making you more panicked. \"What the heeeeeck. Ok two things have happened, either I'm stuck in the game unable to call anyone, or I'm in a totally new world that happens to be exactly like Yggdrasil. But wait, if that is the case, I get to stay here, and command the Tomb to my design. THIS IS AWESOME!\", your fear turned to excitement as this revelation hit you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord, what do you wish for us to do.\", the head servant asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sebas, I want you to scout the outside of tomb. I have high suspicions about our current whereabouts.\", you addressed the servant by name having memorized all of the Pleiades by name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything for me my lord?\", Albedo asked blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually can you come over here please?\", you asked her politely. Her smile grew and did as you asked. The proximity from her felt strange, you could smell her, feel her body heat, her own breath tickling your face from her excessive panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I touch you Albedo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord! I never dreamed you would take me so soon, I am in awe of your forwardness!\", she said in total crazed bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! I mean I just need to touch your body and that's it! 'What did she mean by take her?' Just don't be so excited.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afraid I may have trouble with that command my lord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not take that remark so literally.\", you placed your hand on her shoulder and trailed it down her arm all the way to her hand. This was honest to god real. She was alive. \"That will be all Albedo.\", you said getting up from the chair. You noticed the staff was still in hand, it hadn't occurred to you if your powers still worked as it did in the game. You let go of it to see if it still acted like normal. Luckily it seemed fine, but this required a test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Albedo, gather the guardians in the 6th floor.\", you then used a teleport ring had equipped to go right to the 6th floor. \"Good I can still use my items. Now where are those twin elves? You know I'm technically an elf and yet never met those two I wonder what they're like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you walked out of the hall leading to the 6th floor you saw it was a giant battle arena. When you were in the center one of the Dark Elf twins came to greet you. \"Greetings lord Black! It was great to finally meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always nice to see a fellow dark elf. And your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aura Bella Fiora.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see and where is your twin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my brother is over there. MARE! Get your butt over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine over here thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MARE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK!\", he replied frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh geez. Those freaks made them cross-dressers didn't they?\", you realized as Mare ran to you and you examined Mare's clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello lord Black.\", Mare greeted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, anyway you two I would like to have you both perform a test for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What test?\", Mare asked worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, I'm going to summon a monster and you will destroy it. Think you can handle that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Lord Black!\", Aura replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\", you looked at the staff and took a moment to admire the power you and the other guild members spent creating it. You focused on what spell you wanted to cast, then yelled it out. \"SUMMON FIRE ELEMENTAL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the ground the beast engulfed in flames arose exactly like in the game. \"This proves all of the magic works like before. and the NPCs seem to be just as powerful like in the original game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then you received a message. \"A message?! From the Administrators?!\", you answered it hoping it would be, \"My lord\", with those two words those hopes were dashed away. You may have been excited to be here with all the power, but some answers on why you are here would be nice to know as well. \"Yes Sebas, what news do you have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is rather a large problem, perhaps you should see for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come to the 6th floor, the other guardians must be made aware of this new development.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish.\"</span></div></div>",

You noticed a portal open revealing the lovely True Vampire Shalltear Bloodfallen. \"Well, it seems I am the first to arrive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew she wasn't real but you still had a crush on Shalltear, having a fondness for goth women, but now that she was now alive you wondered if the idea might be worth trying. \"Shalltear, my darling.\", you regretted those words since you forgot you have never interacted with Shalltear before. In-game you did go and train with her to max out your exp. But never fully interacting with her since talking to NPCs was only just recently added in, or so it seems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHH! A supreme being flirting with me? Oh my. Lord I knew we grew close during your time rising through the ranks but surely you jest.\", Shalltear blushed waving air into her face. Apparently time you spent with the NPCs was in their memory, interesting fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, forgive me. My joy to see you got a little exaggerated.\", you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord the others have arrived.\", Albedo called out. Two other guardians walked behind her, Cocytus, a bug warrior with very powerful martial arts stats. Demiurge, a demon lord who is like the tomb's second in command should it ever be in crisis. With all of them gathered before you, they all began pledging their  fidelity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo me! My loyal followers.\", they all bowed their heads and called out to you pledging their undying loyalty to you. This was it, you had control over the rest of the tomb and everything in it. You became sucked into the role and started reveling in it. \"As the sole remaining supreme being here, I will command the tower from this day forward! You all shall obey my commands and become the very extensions of my power!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We hear and obey, all hail Elven Black!\", the guardians shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO! That name no longer has meaning for me. I have decided to change my name, Elven Black died when I became the last to lead this tomb. We are in a new era for Naverick. From this moment on I am Lord Ravage Norfleet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe pledge our loyalty to you Lord Ravage Norfleet!\u201d, they all shouted even louder than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRise my loyal guardians.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy lord you look so marvelous, I do find you to be so, authoritative.\u201d, Shalltear complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour words are wasted on me.\u201d, you answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you command of us, my lord?\u201d, Albedo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may Lord.\", Sebas appeared. You believed this would be good to hear his findings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT? The tomb has been transported?!\", you reacted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. By what we have no knowledge of. And it is in plain view since there is not much to hide ourselves in with the surrounding area.\", Sebas reported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. Mare I want you to hide us from the outside world. Do whatever you have to, camouflage the walls with the the vegetation in the area, and make sure were are not out of the ordinary with some illusion magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish, but if I may. Should I set up dummy hills to help us blend in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, actually that will be perfect. Magic will only get us so far, the less smoke and mirrors we need the better. Excellent call Mare.\", you said with benevolence. \u201cNow then, the world in which we inhabit now is new to us. Which means we were pulled in by unknown forces. To be frank I do not know what we will discover or what lies within this foreign territory. But I do know what we can expect to see from it, MYSELF AS IT\u2019S SUPREME MASTER!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guardians were in awe of your new goal. \u201cIncredible my lord. You truly believe we can accomplish this?\u201d, Demiurge asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were the most unbeatable force in Yggdrasil. This is not chance that we were pulled into this, but a test. To see exactly how worthy of our power we are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you say that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why else? Nobody stood equal to us in Yggdrasil. Surely a new challenge must be met. I intend to pave way for Nazarick's future. I will grant you all a goal worthy of our unstoppable power. We will rule this one, and lead it into an eternal rule under our banner. And should I ever leave to join the other supreme beings, never you fear. A line of descendants for you to follow will be granted for you. Making my rule immortal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour words of wisdom pierce through our doubts my lord.\u201d, Albedo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before I allow you all to fulfill my orders, I have a question for each of you. How do you all see me exactly?\", as if compensating for the fact you were handed this role you wondered if they truly felt you were worthy of the role of leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins started off with Mare being the first, \"You are a firm but fair leader, you started from nothing and now our leader.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAura was next, \"Someone who never gives up even with the odds stacked against him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCocytus followed, \"A fierce warrior in spirit as well as in battle. If Lord Momonga lend you this role, it would only be due to you being equally worthy to lead us into battle as he was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A prodigy that makes you a force to be reckoned with, also your passive nature makes your actions near impossible to predict.\", Demiurge said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stayed with us until the end, you were just as loyal to us as Lord Momonga and graciously serving us as justly as we do you.\", Sebas answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbedo chimed in next, \"You are one of the highest ranking supreme beings, our master and ruler of Nazarick, as well as the captivator of my heart!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, \"You are a tremendous and heartwarming man to Nazarick as only few would ever see past any faults between that and true beauty.\", Shalltear praised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall leave for now, do as I command. And rejoice, for the true fight of our lives begins today!\", you said teleportating to your quarters.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You paced down a long hallway where you saw vampires taller and much more sinister looking than Krul and Horn. Despite being one of them, you still felt terrified of them and their domineering presence. \u201cDon\u2019t be frightened, they are your kind now. They will pose no harm to you.\u201d, Krul said trying to reassure you, but the looks you were getting made you believe otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKrul, Horn has been wondering if her new pet has woken up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFunny you should mention him, Chess meet (Name), our newest member to our society.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIck! Why did she play with her food and just eat him? He looks worse off than he did as livestock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChess, behave yourself. He\u2019s scared and all alone. His only friends now are the ones who remade his life. Surely you can be a little more decent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf he is a good fit, then perhaps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine. Where is Horn?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIn the next room waiting for him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent. Come along (Name).\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Krul opened the door you asked her something that was buzzing in your mind, \u201cKrul?\u201d, she stopped herself for a second to listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill I be forced to kill other people like you did earlier tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you already know the answer.\u201d, she opened the door and Horn, the vampire responsible for your transformation sat in a chair, with another vampire sitting across from her. It was a tall red head male vampire who from what you could tell, was sizing you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrowley, this is (Name).\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm? The new recruit. He is quite young.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is, but he has promise. It takes a large amount of courage to try and bargain for your own life with a vampire.\u201d, Krul replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it bravery or cowardice?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCowardice from what it looks like. Look at him, he\u2019s shacking.\u201d, Chess answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI figured since he showed such audacity perhaps he could be well groomed to be one of us. He has something to allow him to appear before us.\u201d, Horn insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. He could be a powerful ally. But ultimately it is Krul\u2019s choice if she wants to bring him in. Personally I don\u2019t mind so long as he isn\u2019t more trouble than he\u2019s worth.\u201d, Corwley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI say we keep him around. Train him. See if he has what it takes to at least fair against our enemies. If he performs below our expectations, we\u2019ll leave him to starve. Fair compromise?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will take him.\u201d, Horn offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, but I will watch his growth. I will pass judgement to see if he will ever earn to be among us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you object, (Name)?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had your head hung over, what choice did you have? \u201cNo.\u201d</span></div></div>",

A cross guard sword, with an appearance of a cross. The vampire struck back with deadly precision and power. In just a few swings he cut down the human soldier. The other one tried to escape but the vampire appeared right in front of the terrified young man. The human tried attacking the vampire, but unable to hit either blade or body. The soldier\u2019s last swing was cut off by the vampire\u2019s own grasp, the vampire pulled the human helplessly over him with the weakling kicking his feet trying to reach the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood work, doesn\u2019t he look delicious? I can smell his adrenaline from here. Take a bite, embrace your nature.\u201d, a voice coming from behind the vampire holding the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampire let go, moving aside. \u201cVery well, one vile of blood to make up for your payment.\u201d, then out of nowhere another vampire grabbed the human and bit into his neck. After the vampire drank the human dry, it gave the other one a vile as promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the shadows came Horn Skuld, wiping the blood off her mouth. \u201cExcellent work, my dear (Name).\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few years had passed, by now you were a permanent addition of Krul\u2019s team. You were proficient with a crossguard sword and served as Horn\u2019s personal bodyguard. You haven\u2019t fully accepted to your vampire side yet. But you have been quenching your thirst for blood through Horn\u2019s blood, much to her objection.  Your emotions have grown more and more lost as time passes. You have lost almost all semblance of joy, and only find solace in sleep. The only time when you can picture and recapture the last few moments before your transformation. The nightmares of your transformation haunt you, as your biggest regret looms over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had just finished crushing a small rebellion of humans who have been defying the vampires. And  your fellow vampires congratulated you on your success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeautiful work (Name). You have truly become part of this unit.\u201d, Krul congratulated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou surprised me today. Any chance you want to celebrate the fruits of your victory?\u201d, Chess said flirtatiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf anyone is going to celebrate with him, it should be his master.\u201d, Horn intervened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWere finished here. Have Crowley, set squad to take the survivors to the camps.\u201d, you answered. You walked away from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t fully embrace his nature yet?\u201d, Krul said puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe just does what I tell him to do. Nothing else.\u201d, Horn replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA shame. He has a long life ahead of him. Chess, you seem to fancy him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI admire his, decisiveness in battle. Brings out a certain cute feature in him.\u201d, Chess answered blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were wandering in the ruins of what was once a great city teeming with life, and an example of humanity\u2019s achievement, you sensed someone following you. \u201cWhat do you ask of me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting weaker. When you ran off, I noticed you drank that vile as if you had never drank anything in your life.\u201d, Horn stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been cutting off my supply of blood. I give you one human per day on the battlefield in exchange for one weeks worth. But now its one human per vile?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s cut the charade. You need to stop denying your nature. I am tired of feeding you my blood. It is time you embrace what you have become. That vile is the final one I will give you. From now on, you must feed on the real source of strength.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?! I\u2019ve served you faithfully. I demand-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? You making demands? Do you forget? Who you even owe your life to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have forgotten nothing. But why now?\u201d, you demanded to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause Chess and I have grown fond of you. We want you to stop pretending and be one of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFond? Fond how?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeed I spell it out? Chess, and me, have grown attracted to you. And we all agree that your attempts to stay as human as possible have grown stale now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou knew me when I was only a boy. Now you think of me like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAge is irrelevant to us. The heart likes what it likes. And as far as I have seen. Your only source of pleasure is by dishing out your blade against the humans.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t become like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will have little choice. Soon the starvation will consume you. Either you become a mindless monster, or revert to a full vampire and become immortal. It is your choice. I don\u2019t require your affection or my permission, only that you continue to perform what I need.\u201d, she said leaving you.</span></div></div>",

What is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish to drink your blood.\u201d, you requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell now. Years ago you refused mine so disrespectfully. But now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHorn has cut me off from her blood. She won\u2019t give me hers anymore. She\u2019s pushing me into being a full vampire.\u201d, you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t say I blame her. You had to have known she wasn\u2019t going to let you keep it up forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just that.\u201d, you hesitated to tell her but you came out with it anyway, \u201cHer blood hasn\u2019t been enough these past few days. I\u2019m hurting even now. I thought your blood as a queen might be able to satisfy my craving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wish to take my blood? I don\u2019t know. Horn and Chess prefer you to embrace your vampire side. They have grown to fancy you quite a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel any joy or pleasure anymore. I just want the blood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I were, what would you offer me?\u201d, she said forcing you into a deal you knew would strip you even less of your old self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I give that don\u2019t already have?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour companionship. If you want my blood I want you to be mine. It would put me one up over Horn.\u201d, she mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou all disgust me. How much lower do you want me to sink?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEither that or you starve. But tell me, why do you continue to prolong your turn into a full vampire?\u201d, she asked. Her tone shifted indicating she was serious in her questioning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI let Horn turn me because I wanted to live. Now I have lost my reason to live at all. What is the point when all I have is just a lifeless shell continuing to kill my own kind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're not them anymore, remember you chose this life because you wanted to survive. We have done much of that in our history. In fact, I did my share for a majority of my life. Most of the others were turned much earlier than I. But do you know why they enjoy it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Tell me. What enjoyment lets them kill them so easily?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you accept being a vampire. All of your old senses are charged to their fullest potential. Many say live life to the fullest. Every second, is that moment humans try and isolate for a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where is the joy in it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you embrace that euphoria, (Name) many who turn are often drunk on this feeling. Years of trying to keep it make the memories of your old life fade away with enough time. I know you have been feeling more cold recently. But take things into perspective, me and Horn's team have cared and fought beside you for years. You may deny it but you have a bond with them. Tell me, do you think you could find happiness with us?\u201d, Krul asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I were honest, it would be in paradise. I deny these senses their full power. Now every day I get a taste for it and it hurts everyday I hold it back. I\u2019ve fought along side you and the others for years. The only family I have, sad is it is. If I became a full vampire, maybe I could learn to live again. Again as the irony sets in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have only so much strength to last as long as you have. Believe it or not, we do care for you (Name).\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou left. You're blood thirst was calling again. You needed blood. You had only two options right now, you could try to steal blood from another vampire or unleash your desires and finally feast on a human.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were a boy that was born from a clan of shinobi. You were trained and raised to become a strong ninja to uphold your family's legacy. Your mother was a great shinobi in her own right, so she was the one who trained you on everything there was to become a ninja. The training was hard and your mother was strict, but you were able to push through and grow stronger and better as a ninja. Unfortunately you were still a novice, so it wasn't enough for your mother. She wanted to become one of the best ninja in the world just like her was to make her proud of you. So your mother decided to send you to a place to take your training to the next level. Hanzo Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first some people in your clan were against it, for a lot of reasons. The one that stood out most of all was the fact that you were a male. The ninja that were trained at Hanzo were all girls and sending a boy over to that school to train was unheard of. They were probably worried that you would end up fooling around with the girls there. But your mother still sent you to Hanzo for she thought that there was no room for that sort of thing in the ways of the ninja. All that mattered was completing your mission and becoming a strong shinobi. The head of the school also accepted you and so it was arranged. You would enrolled into the academy, but not before you passed a final test first. Your mission? To infiltrate and steal a secret scroll containing secret arts. You would be graded based on your performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a dark night with the moon shining above. In a small building in the middle of town, many guards stood alert keeping an eye out for any enemy. In the entrance of the building, two guards stood standing guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure you keep a sharp eye out,\" one said. \"Don't let your guard down for even a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood,\" said the other. \"There's no way that kid's gonna get his hands on that scroll. Not without getting past us first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping vigilant, they continued to stand by the gate. Then suddenly, the guards saw something move close to the trash cans. One guard immediately went on guard and shone their flashlight at the bushes. A startled cat yowled at the guard and ran away into the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man. It was just a rabbit,\" the first guard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor thing,\" said the second. \"I feel kinda bad for scaring it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be fine,\" said the first. \"At least we didn't hurt it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the guard returned standing guard in front of the gate. What the didn't know was that cat was distraction. Just behind them past the door hiding from them behind the door was you. You were able to sneak past them while they were occupied by the rabbit you set up hiding your presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too easy,\" he thought. \"Guess that trick worked after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled up your mask covering your lower face and ran through the halls of the building. Pretty soon you were in a big and spacious room. You hid behind a corner of the hallway and peeked out. You could see the scroll in the middle of the room standing on a pedestal. There were lots of guards in that room all standing around on high alert. Not to mention there was a couple of lasers here and there. If you tripped on even one of them then it would all over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it. Looks like security's even tighter than it was before. I gotta catch them off guard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around and you saw a guard. He was standing in front of a door that said 'Maintenance. This gave you an idea. You dug into your pocket and pulled out a small tube which is also known as blowgun and a small needle laced in something yellow. You took careful aim, took a big breath and blew. The needle shot out and hit one of the guard that was walking around right on his neck. The ninja clasped his neck and pulled out the needle. Then he fell over unconscious. You grabbed the guard by his legs and dragged him into the maintenance then shut the door behind you. Then you took off his clothes and put them on while putting your clothes on the guard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. Now for the next part,\" you thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to the circuit breakers which controlled the power and the building went completely dark. You heard a commotion outside the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Who cut the power?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's gotta be him! He somehow got into the building!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's gotta be in the maintenance room! Quick! Everybody head over there before he escapes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately went to the door and banged on it and made noise like you were struggling. Then you got on top of the guard like you were putting him in a hold just as the door opened and multiple guards came into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Help me out here guys!\" you said pretending to be the guard. \"I got the suspect apprehended!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice work! We'll take it from here!\" said one of the guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all got on the guard that was dressed like you thinking he was the culprit. Seizing your chance, you then quickly stepped out of the room pulled out a small ball. You threw it in there and then shut the door locking it behind you and breaking the knob. In a few seconds the door began to leak out smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That takes care of that,\" you thought. \"Now to take care of the rest of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What's going on over there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head snapped to the voice and there running towards you was a guard. When he saw you he was about to scream to alert the other guards, you immediately took out your blowgun, loaded some needles and fired one at the guard hitting him right on his neck. The guard reeled back and them fell to the floor unconscious. You looked over to where the scroll was and saw that there was at least a few guards left and they all heard the commotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! It's him! Sound the alarm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't!\" you thought and fired a couple more needles. Before the guards had a chance to react, the needles struck them all in their necks and then fell unconscious. You let out a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was too close,\" you said. \"Now all I have to do is get the scroll and I don't even have to worry about the lasers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went over to the scroll and were just about to take it, but then you hesitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute. Now that I think about it, this was way to easy. What if I'm walking right into a trap?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully looked around trying to see if there was something that you missed. The only thing you could see were the guards lying unconscious on the floor. Then you grabbed the scroll and put in your pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, out of the shadows a smoke bomb rolled out and exploded covering the area in smoke. When the smoke cleared, you eyes widened in shock. You were completely surrounded by ninjas. If you had to make a guess as to how many there were, you had to say that there was at least two dozen of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it all,\" you muttered. \"I should've known it was too easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right you,\" said a ninja wielding her sword. \"It's over. Hand over the scroll or you're gonna get hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a stance and prepared to yourself. You had one of two options. To either make a break for it or fight every ninja here and then make your escape. Then after a few seconds of thinking...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"OK, OK. You got me,\" you said calmly slowly walking forward. \"Guess you can take it now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dug into your shirt making it seem like you were gonna pull out the scroll. You dug through your shirt until you found a smoke bomb in your shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK then,\" you thought. \"I only have a couple of these so I better make them count. I can't afford to fail this mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up!\" snapped a ninja. \"We ain't got all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the ninja and pulled out your grenade in your shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want it? You asked for it!\" you shouted as you threw your grenade straight into the ground. With a loud bang, smoke billowed everywhere covering the entire area. You immediately ran towards the other room and leaped on top of the railing above. Then you jumped towards the ceiling grabbing a hold of a metal beam flipping yourself up and getting on top of of it. You ran towards one of the windows and jumped straight at it crossing your arms. You broke through the window and landed outside in a roll. You then broke into a run trying to get as far away as you could. You thought you had given the ninjas the slip, but then you heard the the pittter-patter of multiple feet coming from beside on your left and right. You quickly looked beside you both ways and saw that the ninja were in hot pursuit of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! I should've known that they wouldn't be thrown off by that,\" you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaped off the rooftop falling a couple feet until you landed on another rooftop. The ninja landed in front of you cutting you off each one throwing a shuriken or kunai. You dodged by using a back handspring multiple times before landing on your feet on the next building. Immediately a ninja jumped and went straight you with her ninja sword raised. You quickly drew one of your own and raised it blocking the blow. Both swords locked with a sharp clang grinding against each other sending small sparks. Using your strength, you pushed the ninja back sending her stumbling and then falling to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dodge!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing your instincts, you leaped up again dodging two weighted Kusarigamas. You landed on the next building and made a break for it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Block!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising your small sword, you rapidly slashed deflecting multiple shuriken that shot out at you. Two other ninjas threw their Kusarigamas, big sickles with chains attached to the ends. You leaped out of the way dodging once again into the air and landed on your feet. You straightened up just as the ninjas landed in front of you. With the ninjas in front and the edge of the roof behind you, you were trapped like a rat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is getting me nowhere,\" you thought. \"I have to ditch these girls and get to the destination. On the other hand, I can't just use my smoke bomb in an urban area like this. I gotta give them the slip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking a quick decision, you jumped backwards off the ledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that guy crazy?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't just stand there! After him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignored the ninjas shouts of surprise as you dove straight down towards the ground below with the ninjas falling after you. Each one used a small string with a grappling hook to catch themselves so they wouldn't fall to the ground below. This was what you were waiting for. At the last minute, you saw a flagpole on the side of the building. You grabbed the pole and did a horizontal bar flip like an olympian launching yourself up. You zipped past the ninjas and then you threw your shuriken cutting the strings holding the ninjas up. Not having anything holding them up, the ninjas fell to the ground below. You landed back on the roof and then bolted away as fast as you could before the ninjas could get back up on the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe that worked,\" you said. \"Now I can hopefully get to my destination without any trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran across rooftop to rooftop until you saw your destination in sight. You destination was a local subway station. When you got the scroll, you were instructed to catch a ride on one of the trains and head back to your place and wait until further instruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I'm in the clear,\" you said to yourself. \"All I need to do is get on top of one of those trains and it's mission accomplished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped on the roof of the station and looked around at each train trying to remember which train you to jump on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now... Let's see... if I recall correctly, I think the train that I'm supposed to catch is around here somewhere,\" you muttered to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at each train searching for the right one. Then you saw the train you were looking for. It was blue with a white stripe on it's sides and it was about to leave the station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap. I better get on,\" you said as you ran towards the train. You prepared to jump, but suddenly a chain shot out and wrapped you around your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen another one wrapped on your other arm and a ninja landed on both of your sides holding the chains that wrapped your arms. You pulled trying to break free, but the chains held you tight. You moved to pull out something from your shirt, but suddenly two more ninja landed in front and behind you and pointed their blades dangerously at you. One from behind pointed her blade at your neck and the other pointed her blade at your lower area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take one false move and you'll get neutered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gritted your teeth and did as you were told. Then one more ninja landed. She walked towards you until she was a few feet away from you. She dug into your shirt until she pulled out the scroll that you were supposed to take. All you could was stand there not able to move unless you wanted to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well. Looks like this is the end for you kid,\" she said. \"I'll give you credit though, you were a lot tougher than expected and you almost got away with it, but sadly you failed this test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then dug in her outfit and then blew powder right in your face. You screamed as you were temporarily blinded holding your eyes in pain and also coughing. You left the chains loosen on your arms and the ninjas blades of you. You couldn't see anything at first, but eventually you regained your vision. There was not a soul to be found with you the only one standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it,\" you said \"They managed to get the drop on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA person going through what you just went through would be upset for letting the ninjas take the scroll back, but you grinned. You dug into your left calf in your outfit and pulled out a scroll. This was the real scroll. Back when you were in the building where the scroll was stored, you hid the scroll in your outfit and had a fake one in case that you had the scroll taken from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. They fell for it,\" you said yourself wearing a victorious smirk. \"Good thing I had a fake just in case. I may have had to endure a little pain, but it was worth it. Now then, I better get out of here before they realize it's a fake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tucked the scroll in your ninja shirt and jumped onto the train just as it was leaving the station. As the train sped along, you pulled out an earpiece and put it on your ear. You pressed a button on it and spoke into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is (name) reporting. Mission Accomplished.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were on a boat heading for Hanzou Academy. After your mission you were assigned to head there infiltrate it and hone your skills as your mother instructed. Dead to rights you knew this would be a challenge as you never faced socializing with girls your own age. You didn't know what to think, but you knew they were a force to be reckoned with. In reality you were daft to attraction of the opposite sex altogether. You've never had any flirt with you, talk, or so much as hug you so you were in uncharted waters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill things were looking optimistic. You finally reached the academy and met with your teacher adviser. He was an old guy with white hair and wore all black. \"Hello Kiriya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Mr. (Name). Happy to meet you.\", you two shook hands, \"I taught your mother here and she was a good student here. I'm holding you to a higher standard, Specifically behaving among the other students.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry I just talk, train, and be polite to them like any other person. I don't need the experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On having a decent reputation but i assure you, here you will be accumulating all the experience needed when handling life's greatest mystery. Women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That bad huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends. Now this room will be your dorm and here are your roommates. Oh by the way, eyes up here.\", he warned pointing at his own eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon as he opened the door 3 girls were all lined up. The first was a small girl with pink hair and eyes, looked very young for a ninja. Second was a tall blonde, with blue sapphire eyes. Next to her was a medium tall tan girl with brown hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small one introduced herself first, \" Hi I'm Hibari!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third one spoke next, \"I'm Asuka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Katsuragi! Great to have a boy all to ourselves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is (Name). Nice to meet you three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok introductions are out. I'll leave you to get settled as I return with your next assignment.\", Kiriya said as he left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why you here in an all girls academy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't answer to maintain secrecy so you made up a random explanation, \"I asked for it and said please!\", you said acting like a big-shot when you were only making an ass of yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liar.\", Asuka replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I buy it.\", Hibari followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could that work if I transferred?\", Katsuagi asked to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn awkward pause filled up after that last comment. \"I'll just unpack.\", you walked away sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls then huddled in secret, \"What do you think? A spy?\", Asuka questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too cute to be one.\", Hibari answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cute how?\", Asuka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The funny kind.\", Katsuagi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody can fake being funny cute. He's clear.\", Hibari followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what then?\", Asuka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we going to fight over him?\", Hibari followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's cute, I'd least want one date.\", Katsuagi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's worth two.\", Asuka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relationship level?\", Hibari questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That level of funny cute?\", Katsuagi followed equally curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possibly. Deserves further investigating.\", Asuka replied now getting on the wagon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we all going to conduct our own investigations?\", Katsuagi asked believing this may be war between the three of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every girl for themselves?\", Hibari wanted clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah.\", Katsuagi answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to get in bed with him right?\", Asuka asked making sure they weren't going too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell no, never think that far on the first impression.\", Katsuagi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just dating?\", Hibari asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just dating.\", they all said at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do we get his attention?\", Asuka asked.</span></div></div>",

They seemed very social, a quality you weren't prepared for, at least in terms of gender. You thought to just act serious until the end. That way it could be easier to keep them guessing. But then maybe it would draw too much attention and feel like you were honestly infiltrating the academy. Which you still were technically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the danger wasn't just those three, there still were other ninja that you might encounter throughout your time there. In any event the fact that this would be your greatest mission finally got through to you. Then you heard a knock on your door, you pretty much finished unpacking so now you had to start with creating the act. You opened the door to see...</span></div></div>",

How do I know you were about to kill me just now?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha. You call yourself a ninja?\", Katsugari joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Considering I just managed not to slice you all open, I figure the answer is YES!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No not that, I mean you call your self a ninja after reacting like a 5 year-old? I'd expect a, 'Be less noisy in the future', or a, 'Knock 4 times to know you mean informal conversation. But instead we get a, 'Don't scare me like thaaaaaat, I could have killed you guuuuyyyyyysss'.\", the girls all laughed at Katsugari's joke. You stood there and looked both embarrassed and quite ticked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slammed the door in their faces, the girls then quickly snapped out of their fit of laughter. \"Hey c'mon we were just teasing.\", Asuka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww please come out. We won't tease you again.\", Hibari followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey (Name), I'm sorry for busting your chops but honestly I didn't mean to offend.

You were inexperienced but you knew what that meant! \"Do I choose the date?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? You want to lose that badly to get someone alone with you? Hehhehehe.\", Katsugair giggled with Hibari and Asuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were blushing a little bit, \"NO! I- I mean no. I just would prefer it not be someone random. I don't want to be pulled into a 9th circle of hell in the off chance I lost.\", you stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crushing hard on someone already? Ooooohhhhhhh.\", Hibari teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already said I ain't planning to lose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you can take everyone in our group?\", Asuka goaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any-time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!

Instead they brough two more. Unknown to you, they had two other friends that they meant by their group. You had handled 3 ninjas in the past, all were quite skilled. But that was when you had ways of compensating for the disadvantage of numbers. A full-on fight against 5 competent ninja that you have had no experience fighting? Clearly you needed to be smacked upside the head because no inexperience with women would be excuse enough to be this stupid.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The training arena had been accommodated for a 5 to 1 fight. The teachers were watching all with their degrees of interest and varying degrees of optimism. Hibari, Asuka, and Katsugari had lined up front and center. Their other two friends, Yagyu and Ikaruga were in second position. They all agreed to this formation to at least have the fight be fair for a little while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had only 3 weapons to choose from which consisted of some smoke pellets, a blow-dart, and your signature weapon, a pair of ninja claws. A glove consisting of  two blades around the knuckle. With just these matching against the 5 others, whose skill and weapons you had no idea of you had only a single plan to fall on when the battle commenced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3...2....1!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher rang the gong and everyone was now in full battle mode. Asuka charged first she pulled out a pair of small katanas from her waist and started with a clean diagonal slash from the bottom left. You countered her slash by managing to get both her blades stuck in between one of your claws, then proceeded with a horizontal uppercut. Asuka leaned back missing the blades, she wrapped around you looping her arms around your upper body, using the claws as a way into your defenses. She held her swords to your neck smirking at how easily you were beaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thinking of where you're gonna take me? Figured the one who does you in, gets to be the lucky lady.\", she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the contrary.\", you replied. Just then Asuka heard something fall to the ground, it was a smoke pellet that just as she noticed surrounded her and you in smoke. Hibari in an attempt to help Asuka ran into the smoke with one of the other girls, Ikaruga following her into it. Yagyu and Katsugari held back from going in, either too afraid or too cautious to enter it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smoke was very thick and large, a deliberate move hoping to take them by surprise. Asuka lost her grip leaving herself to wander aimlessly through the smoke. She kept her guard up trying to find you. \"No fair! This is meant to be a REAL fight!'', she complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ninja's best strength isn't force.\", you said whispering in the smoke. Asuka felt a quick pain in her arm. She rubbed it to find a little needle sticking out. \"It's stealth.\", you finished appearing in front of her. Her eyes peeled over and collapsed right on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asuka! Asuka! Cough! Where-\", without taking any chances you used your blow-dart to fire another needle at Hibari. She got nipped in the leg by it and squealed in pain from the sharp pinch it made. Real quickly she as well passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got a little overconfident seeing how you knocked out two out of five but suddenly, you heard a sword being unsheathed from their hilt. Ikaruga tried cutting you from behind, however you blocked the attack holding your forearms up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coward! Using cheap tactics to win?\", Ikaruga said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When your best element is only stealth, you use it whenever you can. And when you can't find it, you make it!\", you acknowledged. \"After all I am a bit outnumbered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't hide from me in here.\", she said confidently. She pressed the attack and wailed away giving you no room to evade of parry. Blocking slash after slash she just never relented. With the fight being so intense the smoke began dissipating. She had you worn down from her onslaught, leaving your arms weary and sore. \"Give up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh not at all. Pleasant dreams darling!\", you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkaruga looked confused by your reply, but then saw you lift one of your ninja bands around your arm with your teeth. It had another smoke pellet hidden underneath, spraying a bit of smoke into her face. But instead of smoke, it was an anesthetic gas, rendering Ikaruga asleep instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatsugari and Yagyu saw that last move you had just used and knew not to let themselves open for any trickery. You were tired, both arms were hung over like they had done over a hundred push-ups. No way you could fight head-on again with either, and this time they were ready for another giant puff of smoke. And they  knew to watch for any chances to spray them in the face with stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatsugari and Yagyu partnered up and made a collaborative array of moves against you. Katsugari attacked using mostly her feet and nothing else, giving you no idea how to even latch onto her in anyway. It was like throwing punches only replace fists, with feet. And Yagyu kept Katsugari's movements blind to you by opening and closing her umbrella in your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arms were just getting battered all the way through and you just couldn't find any way to counter back. You had one last gamble, first when Katsugari made contact with your claws, you opened your arms parrying her back. Katsugari landed behind Yagyu to which she opened her umbrella, however you retaliated with throwing a pellet directly at the umbrella. The smoke only blinded for just a moment, being ineffective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Katsugari went in for the attack again she didn't see you, you attacked her from the side. It gave you enough time to get a chance to get a quick reprieve to attack her one on one. You were about to connect a hit on her and...</span></div></div>",

You were about to, essentially, nail her in place. But you underestimated how agile she could be. Thus while in mid-air as she dodged your misleading blow she somehow propelled herself to kick you in the face with her foot. It was so hard it flipped you like a coin, making you land flat on your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the Winner is the team consisting of Katsugari, Yagyu, Ikaruga, Hibari and Asuka! Also in the future please make a team name, saying that is a mouthful.\", the teacher commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the last two panting heavily after having gone through an intense match they saw first hand just how resourceful you were.

He used mainly his wits through the fight and just easily took you down one at a time.\", Yagyu commended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we can all agree on one thing. He may have lost the bet, but this certainly wasn't a lose.\", Asuka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes no sense.\", Katsugari replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You get the idea! He's a very skilled warrior. I'm happy we have someone like that in our ranks.\", Asuka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now there is the question of who he takes out?\", Katsugari mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\", Yagyu reacted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, we didn't say this, but he takes one of us out if he lost.\", Katsugari explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well seeing how Yagyu and you were the last ones standing, it would be fair to be the ones he forcibly takes out. Rubbing it in his face even more.\", Ikaruga suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great idea! But who?\", Asuka wondered.</span></div></div>",

They continued their speculation but things took a turn for trouble when they were on their way to meet their sensei. When they got to his office another ninja was awaiting patiently outside the sensei's office. Sensei popped out of nowhere just from a puff of smoke startling the main trio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello master sensei.\", they said together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A new mission has just come to our attention. While on this mission you will all be working with this girl you see before you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's she?\", Asuka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Yuuta Kesho. I'm studying here but will be working primarily solo given my early experience.\", she proudly presented herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all eyed her down assessing her. She was a very odd looking woman, for starters she was rather plump for a ninja. In fact none of them believed it given her large size. She wasn't overweight but she had noticeable curves where being a ninja would find detrimental. Her face was highly well groomed, eye shadow perfectly painted on, and her eyelashes stretched out very well. Another thing that caught their attention was her lips. They were coated in lipstick so much it was almost like they formed another layer. She wore a fancy extravagant dress and wore other various jewelry she accessorized herself with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls paused a moment and asked, \"Is she really a ninja?\", Katsugari asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second thought, Katsugari was slapped in the face by Yuuta. The fancy ninja crossed her arms in disgust, \"If you think I can't handle the job then you couldn't be farther from the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is correct. Her experience has ranged from thefts of various enemies of the academy, and assassination of our greatest rivals from the other academy's. Don't let appearances deceive you. Now head out, and report back. That is all.\", sensei puffed out and so the girls did their assignment,</span></div></div>",

Mean-time let us review your battle with the 5. Now in your words, what was the toughest moment in battle?\", Senesei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When Ikaruga fought me. My arms were numb and I couldn't think. I could only react.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is good. You reacted rather than thinked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that Sensei?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You relied on the unexpected to gain victory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I didn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very true, in fact the way you were beaten was a single act of carelessness. But you showed adaption when the odds stacked against you. That is a remarkable asset. So tell me what connects those two moments. How you beat Ikaruga and how you lost to Katsugari?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought for a moment wondering what it was, \"I acted quicker than I thought?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you're very right. But not what I meant. What was it that made you beat Ikaruga, yet you lost to Katsugari?\", Sensei repeated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha! I didn't expect the unexpected! I used it against Ikaruga because she never guessed I'd have another way of incapacitating her. Katsugari won because I didn't account how versatile her technique could be, which resulted in my guard being wide open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. You recognize the flaw you made. So today, you will be tested on the unexpected. Which means one thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will assist in your preparation for your date with Katsugari!\", he yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\", you blankly reacted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A man's greatest challenge doesn't await in the field of battle, but in the pursuit of love! No man here has ever managed to have a peaceful, loving, and genuine relationship within these halls! It has been a method used for assassination, manipulation, and a cruel joke designed to break the spirit of the ninja! My young lad, no matter your reasons, whatever you do, TAKE THIS AS SERIOUSLY AS YOU DO WITH YOUR VERY LIFE!\", Kiriya screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.... you want me to make I don't go through with this too plainly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU DO NOT GET IT YOU FOOL! True romance has a chance to bloom here. I am not saying, 'don't take this too plainly', FOR THAT IS A GROOSE UNDERSTATEMENT! I AM SAYING YOU DO NOT SCREW IT UP! IF YOU ARE DOING THIS TO BE ANOTHER BACKSTABBING NINJA LIKE THE REST, THEN CONSIDER YOURSELF ON MY LIST! And do you know what happened to the last rookie who wound up on my list?\", he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head slowly as if it sounded like a rusty machine. \"Do you want to know what happened to who was on my list?\", you nodded now. \"You don't wanna know what happened to who ends up on my list.\", now you shook your head but in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But most of all, YOU ARE NOT TO MENTION A WORD OF THIS TO ANYONE!\", he pointed at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yessir.\", you said cowardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Then let us review, have you done this before?\", Kiriya began rapid-fire questioning you about what you knew about dating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you had any girl friends outside of family?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you had a crush on any girl before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a crush on any girl here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, then you will be able to pull this off in no time. Now here is what you need to do...\"</span></div></div>",

Just as you two ended your session a messenger came by delivering an important message. Sensei looked at it and without delay left. \"Sorry (Name) I must attend to something. Go out to the lake's to meditate on tonight's events.\", with that he disappeared in a puff of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensei appeared into the infirmary to see the ninja girls return from their last mission. From their condition's things were not well. Hibari and Asuka were in the worst shape as they had bandages around their bodies with bruises and cuts all around their arms. Katsugari and Yuuta were the only ones who weren't in grave shape but had a couple smaller bandages applied for smaller wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\", Sensei asked looking shocked by the outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our mission was a partial success. We identified the ones responsible for the recent attacks and confirmed it to be, the Serpent Academy for Girls. We tracked the puppet assassin from her rendezvous point but we lost her. She wasn't alone though, she had us ambushed by a group of foot ninjas and we barley escaped.\", Yuuta explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They probably are hiding something within the academy or else they wouldn't keep a watchful eye on their elite.\", Sensei deduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was all fine until she hadn't rushed in.\", Yuuta pointed at Katsugari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were the one who promoted the idea, we fight every last foot soldier to pick up her trail! We nearly lost two of our own!\", Katsugari voiced out her complaint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both of you stop! Yuuta, I'm aware of your inexperience with working within a team, however you must consider the well-being of your teammates. And you Katsugari, you rushed in? That was irresponsible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was vulnerable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Appearances are never the best reliable course of action.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did my part exactly to the letter. I was efficient, and precise. It was these rookies who deserve the blame, not me! I was perfect.\", Yuuta argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were barking orders, putting everyone down, and never cared about anyone else but yourself! You're just acting like a big fat prissy-\", Katsugari got cut off when she received another slap in the face from Yuuta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can think what you may about my attitude but my skills were never the problem!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, that was strike two sister! Wanna test your luck again?!\", both girls grrred at one another but Sensei got in between them before things got out of hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough! Settle things later, for now I believe both of you should relax, and allow the simple fact that everyone is alive and will recover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two ninja girls left with great disdain for the other.</span></div></div>",

The thought of tonight's event was nerve-racking, however Sensei's advice helped immensely. You were contemplating how to end the date when you heard a sharp noise within the gardens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA piercing whip of the air was being repeated over and over again. Someone was swinging a sharp object around. You saw that near the edge of the garden trees was another ninja practicing her knife throwing skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched silently, enjoying someone show off their prowess. But it quickly ended when the ninja threw her knife next to you. \"I didn't have to miss, you know.\", she pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spying on me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Just heard you practicing and figured I'd not disturb you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would be less disturbed if you acknowledged yourself. Among ninja, it is a sign of trust, or at least honor. Hiding yourself shows you're either hiding to kill, or you're a coward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'm more used to hiding then. But I swear it wasn't to kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I wanted to spy on you, you wouldn't have found me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or you are just that bad at stealth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not in my case I assure you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then show me. Hide in the trees, I bet you I can find you in under a minute.\", she challenged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Good luck.\", you ran into the forest, where tall trees and full grown leaves provided excellent cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped and scaled and had, without a sound went across several trees. When you stopped and rested, you leisurely sat back and relaxed while the ninja tried finding you. You have the ninja the slip for a good 50 seconds, just 10 more to go. You started to get impatient wanting to show off, but then about 5 seconds before time was up the ninja jump-scared you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BOOOO!\", you fell out of the tree and fell flat on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was so close!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you weren't. I caught up to you half way when you tried giving me the run around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You caught up? You're super fast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I'm among the fastest in the entire academy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're skilled ninja, what's you're name? My name is (Name)\", you introduced yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Yuuta Kesho.\", she introduced back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say you look nice.\", you complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuuta blushed at your compliment, \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm hmm. You just fit in so well with the garden it's almost like you were apart of the scenery.\", you meant it in earnest. Yuuta had always taken pride in her appearance. But very rarely did she hear someone, other than herself, compliment her beauty. Immediately she liked you already, and was curious to see how much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem really nice (Name). Do you mind walking with me?\", Yuuta asked.</span></div></div>",

Yuuta and you walked around the garden talking about yourselves with some simple ice breakers. You told each other why you chose your weapons of choice and your preferred method of attack. Then things started getting juicy, \"So (Name), how does it feel to be the only guy in the academy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't flustered by her question, it was a fair one to ask. \"It's a little odd, but despite the competitive nature around here, the others are really nice. I don't mind it.\", you did kind of mind it. Women were a mystery to you, but you knew better than to advertise that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you like anyone here? Not as a friend, I mean LIKE like.\", Yuuta wanted tease you on the subject of who you had a crush on. She found that stuff to be very fun to discuss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh! No! Nobody! Well, I'm going out with someone tonight, but only cuz I lost a bet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww that is still so sweet. I hope you sweep her off her feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might not be so easy. But what about you? Who do you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good question, you see (Name). I actually like girls and boys.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\", you didn't know what she meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm bisexual (Name). I think girls are as attractive as boys are. So in a way I do have two people I might be crushing on. But that's a secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough. But I never knew anyone who liked both sides of the sex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no shame in that, just as there is no shame with my body. You think I look beautiful, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuuta pulled out her mirror and lipstick. \"Why do you wear so much makeup if you don't mind me asking.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I keep my body to look as beautiful as I feel it is. Everyone assumes because I'm plump, I can't be a ninja. You didn't judge me, you just treated me like anyone else here.\", Yuuta applied her lipstick as if to reapply another coat, like sunscreen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'm not quick to judging.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me (Name), have you kissed a girl before?\", Yuuta asked. Soon as she asked that, your throat felt squeezed, your stomach's insides were being pricked by needles, and you were mildly shaking in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KISS?! When was that on the table?! Why ask me?! I've never! I've seen it but I don't know-\", your thoughts were making you unable to answer Yuuta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speechless? Awwww, you've never been.\", she walked up to you. Those feelings in your body were increasing, \"Do you want me to give you your first kiss? I wouldn't mind kissing you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said nothing, just being bombarded by the feelings of odd pain in your body. It felt like you were in a blizzard with the pain stinging and numbing your body. But you were feeling warm at the same time. Yuuta lowered herself and was really close to your face. \"I won't kiss you unless I have some way of you telling me it's ok.\", she kindly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were blushing, you felt your heart thumping hard, like a drum banging inside. You could feel her sweet breath touching your face while she was in proximity. you started focusing on her question now. Did you want to let her? You were more than nervous, but you were curious all the same. You looked at her lips, they were colored pink from the lipstick, and their size was as big as everything else. He looked her in the eyes, her lovely eye shadowed eyes, they were somehow telling him what she wanted. She wanted a yes. The emotions were bubbling up, you were in the heat of the moment. You gave a gentle nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, puckered her lips and was closing the gap. You just stood still, waiting for her to make contact. Just as she was an inch from your face, she immediately pulled back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have your permission, but I don't give a kiss for just any reason (Name).\", she winked giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt normal again but felt totally confused. \"But- um, I thoug-\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen (Name), I'm think your very sweet and I kinda like you. But you need to earn the LIKE like status.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a bit angered but disappointed. \"This is why I can't understand women, they lead you thinking one way, then turns out they meant the other. UGH! And why did I nod?! Do I really wanted my first kiss from her? She's crazy! Wait? Why do I want one at all? I'm here to spy and get stronger here! I can't grow any attachments! ARRRGH! My head hurts from all the confusion!\", you ranted in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya around (Name)\", she blew a kiss at you. Now your thoughts were stirred into a frenzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what does that mean? Why didn't she then? And- AHHHHH dammit! I think I have a crush on Yuuta! He! But now the only thing good about the date tonight is that I will get her out of my head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello (Name).\", Katsugari said. You turned to her to find her in a cute casual outfit. A plain white t-shirt and miniskirt. She was ready to be taken away by you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...I'm trading one for another. And this one is worse!\", you thought. \"Ready then?\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lead away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went with her to take her out, you steadied your thoughts and kept what Sensei and you talked about as your train of thought.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You and Katsuragi headed for one of the most basic places to have a date. A theme park. Sure it was basic, but it's one of the best places to start out for someone on their first date. At least that was what Kiriya Sensei had told you. One thing was for sure, Katsuragi was excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hells yeah! I've always wanted to come to this place!\" she said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you liked my pick,\" you said. \"Well then shall we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could ask Katsuragi of where she wanted to go, Katsuragi grabbed your arm and dragged you along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! Let's go on some rides! I wanna ride every single one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every single one?!\" you yelped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Come on! Let's go!\" said Katsuragi still dragging you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap. What have I gotten myself into?\" you thought to yourself. \"Maybe I was better off choosing other options besides a theme park. Like a mall. Or maybe a walk in the park or something. Just get through it (name). You're on this date because you lost a bet. Just suck it up like the ninja you are. Besides, we're just going on the rides. It could be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst they went for the roller coaster. It was about 120 ft tall with a 105 ft drop. Katsuragi wanted to start on that one first. You both were seated in the front car and were strapped in. You couldn't help but feel a little nervous. After all it was the first time you've ever ridden a roller coaster. The coaster went up and up until it was at the top. Then it surged straight down in an incredible speed. Kasturagi screamed with glee raising her arms while you held to the bar for dear life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that you both went parachuting. You and Katuragi each had a parachute strapped to your backs. Then you both had to jump off a very high ledge and jump down. Katsuragi jumped off doing a small flip as she dove down. You looked down and dove after her. As you both fell, Katsuragi couldn't help but show off a little by doing tricks in mid air as she fell. You simply rolled your eyes and opened your chute slowing down your decent. Eventually you touched down on the ground making a perfect landing. You just turned around checking to see if Katsuragi came down yet, but then you saw a pair of striped panties slam right in your face. Next thing you knew, you found yourself on flat on your back with Katsuragi sitting on your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha. Sorry bout that (name),\" said Katsuragi scratching her head. \"Should've warned you bout that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... no problem,\" you said trying not to ream her a new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least you provided me with a cushy landing,\" she joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you happened to look down and saw Katsuragi's underwear. When you saw them, you immediately blushed a bright red and looked away. Katsuragi tilted her head in confusion, but then she smiled mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like the view of my panties (name)?\" she smirked. \"I don't mind if you see them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get off me will you?!\" you said your eyes clenched tight in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, you both went for a ride that had something that neither of you expected. Extreme zip-lining. It was like a normal zip-line, but this one was several feet high above the park. It was high granted, but the view above it was spectacular. You could see the park from below as well as a few other sights. Katsuragi was especially hyped to try this ride. She couldn't wait to get on. You on the other hand were a little nervous. You've been in high places before, but never this high up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy...crap,\" you breathed as you were strapped to the zip-line behind Katsuragi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter (name)? You scared?\" teased Katsuragi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly kept your mouth shut and remembered what Kiriya Sensei said. You have to show that you're willing to do anything for your date! Even if will make you sick, beat up, or die. That what a real man is! At least that's what Kiriya told you. None the less, you couldn't let this slide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way. I'm not scared. Just watch me. This'll be a piece of cake,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked over the edge of the platform and prepared to jump. You instinctively gulped as you looked down to the ground that was several feet below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK... Here I go. I'll go on three. One... Two... Th-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could say three or even attempt to say it, Katsuragi came up from behind you and gave you a shove sending over the edge and down the zip line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KATSURAGIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!!!!!!\" you screamed as you surged down the zip-line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry (name)! You'll thank me for that later!\" called Katsuragi as she jumped after you whooping with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force of the air blew right in your face forcing your cheeks back a bit. Katsuragi giggled and yayed as her hair danced in the wind. You had to admit it, you may have had your doubts at first but it was starting to turn fun. The view was pretty nice too. The trees, a couple houses, and the mountains; everything was beautiful. Eventually you could see the end of the zip-line. You touched down to the ground with Katsuragi following suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... was fun!\" you breathed smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? I told ya,\" said Katsuragi grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Technically you said that I'd thank you for pushing me which I won't,\" you said. \"But yeah. It was fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater you and Katsuragi sat on a bench eating some ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man! This has been the best date ever so far!\" said Katsuragi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I hate to admit it, but it has been fun,\" you said. \"Not too bad for a first date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe. Be honest with me. You were scared on that zip-line weren't you?\" asked Katsuragi. \"You screamed like a little girl when you went down. Hehe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because you pushed down the zip-line!\" you said blushing a little. \"Any person would scream if they got pushed down a zip-line!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatsuragi laughed. \"You're just too cute (name)! You're also fun to tease!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glared a little and turned away with a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any case, what do you think we should do now? We got plenty of time left,\" said Katsuragi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about what to do next when...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Katsuragi squealed like a sharp ringing in your ear. \"Oh my gawwwwd! They have the last plushie I need to complete my little collection of my favorite anime! I must win it before anyone else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just 1150 yen for a single try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1150? What a jip! But take my money anyway! I'm getting that plushie!\", Katsuragi said with almost possessed determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game looked easy enough, it was one of those shoot the water gun in the center type games. A few other participants made their way so that there could be a game to play so you watched Katsuragi play for her prize. Soon as the bell rang, she only missed the target  for only a second but got the water spraying inside perfectly the rest of the way. She kept her hands steady and firm, she could see her number rise to the top, and then ding ding ding! She lost her chance! That single second costed her the match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraciously the kid who won didn't want the prize Katsuragi was aiming for. But she still felt pretty down. \"Hmph, c'mon (Name) I won't put you through-\", before she finished you placed yourself in the next round. \"(Name) if you win this I will owe you BIG TIME!\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up and hang back. Only got one shot.\", she did exactly that. You made sure to align your shot perfectly. Needed to be absolutely certain it would hit the target soon as the gun could fire. 3...2....1! Soon as the next round rung, your gun immediately fired out the water. You pressed the triggers before the bell rang and you managed to get your shot within the center. Just like that despite Katsuragi watching with tense anticipation, she screamed aloud in joy as you won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That one sir.\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy ranging the gallery got it down and you handed it to Katsuragi, \"And that is why you can never worry about me winning a prize in one of those.\", you boasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatsuragi swiped it out of your hand and held it up like a pet. \"It's beautiful! My childhood collection has been complete! Thank you (Name)! I could kiss you!\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT WHAT?! NOT THIS AGAIN!\", you screamed mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry- I got too hyped. Nobody does that on the first date. At least the couples who want it to last, from what I've heard.\" At least she gave you a straight answer this time. You didn't understand completely but it sounded like she wasn't messing with you. \"Anyway I- GASP! Limited edition plushie! MUST GET!\", but where she was looking from was like looking into the pits of hell, the claw machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name)?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll owe you twice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOOOOOO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owe you twice, plus a kiss on the cheek.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owe you three times, plus a kiss on the cheek, from me Asuka, and Hibari.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not going to happen. Those things eat money more than anything. It is no different than gambling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owe you three times, peck on the cheek from three girls, plus one on the lips from anyone of your choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it with girls trying to lock lips with me?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably because your very cute, and the only boy in our academy. Boys who look as handsome as you would be jumping the gun by now! C'mon or else the deal is off and we leave with me in a sour mood.\", she urged you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UGH! Alright! But get rid of the parts with the kissing and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I- I don't think that feels right.\", you didn't want her to know off hand that you have never been kissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So chivalrous, thank youuu.\", she said batting her eyes at you flirtatiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inserted the money into the machine, and positioned the claw above the plushie. You had it exactly over it, you lowered it and it grabbed it, but soon as the claw hoisted up, the claw would suddenly be bumped open a smidge causing the plushie to fall out. After a series of close calls, half-grabs, half-lucky breaks, and 3446.34 yen spent just to get that single plushie, you eventually managed to win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so so so so so so so so so much (Name). I had a great time.\", she thanked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just spent all my money getting you that thing, I hope it was worth it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh trust me it was (Name)!\", she replied very seriously. \"I'll mail them to my home and make sure they are properly placed in my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really seem to like that stuff. Never imagined a ninja would be an anime buff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still like those things regardless of my profession, besides I don't live and breath ninja like most do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not saying it's bad, I'm only saying I never see that from anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you learn something new every day. Hey, first thing I owe you is the money you spent winning these for me. So consider that you have only two favors to call from me.\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a bit whacky while there but you ended up feeling satisfied, and ended up enjoying it overall. You enjoyed hanging with her and did find her to be very cute throughout the experience. And it didn't hurt to have her flirt with you occasionally. You enjoyed it, but at the same time hated it. You liked when she did it, but got annoyed by having her be so wishy washy. Was she interested? You couldn't really tell, your experience with women nowadays was testing you. But really all it was amounting to was, which girl was actually throwing themselves at you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end the date went well and you headed back to the academy...</span></div></div>",

A ninja has broken into the history of Shinobi exhibit in the museum building and has engaged local law enforcement.\", Sensei explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood. We'll head there now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back-up will meet with you in 20 minutes. Good luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\", Katsuragi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Shinobi exhibit in the city museum is being raided. We need to intercept. Think you can handle it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, think maybe you can not get knocked out by a kick in the face this time?\", she joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both hid yourselves from public and changed into proper ninja gear. You put on a hood and equipped your ninja claws, while Katsuragi equipped her boots and wore her usual school uniform. \"Don't you think it's less conspicuous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I've never bothered wearing ninja gear. They never gave me my own, you just have yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no big deal, right now our priority is capturing this ninja and find out what they're up to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both made it to the museum where the alarm was still going off and the building seemed empty. Nothing seemed amiss yet, but that was what worried you. Things looked and felt too quiet, that meant this ninja was a natural using stealth as their use of attack. Whoever was still here wasn't the boastful type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) you sure the intruder is here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure, only until we've swept the area. Let's split up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you and Katsuragi took different parts of the building, where you both remained on guard until every inch was clear. On the outside, through the windows you could see the cops forming up around the building. They were getting ready to invade the museum at any time, which meant you needed to keep your movements under-wraps or else they would storm inside. You had 16 minutes before your back-up could arrive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continued through the empty halls and rooms, statues and wax figures of ninja of the past, you kept your guard up immensely, as you expected any to suddenly come to life and kill you. Sure enough they did!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were grabbed and had your mouth covered, however a few moments went by which made you understand the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHHHH! It's alright, son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\", you realized. She let go and met you face to face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the one who broke in? This is dangerous! I thought I was meant to be undercover!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your voice low. Listen, I didn't trigger the alarm here, but I needed to come because of what was being stolen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An artifact, a real display of an original piece of history from Shinobi history, was being stolen. The ninja who attempted this, is still here, and she is trying to escape with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you're going to help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I can't be seen here. Not while you still learn while your in the heart of a hostile environment. But tell me, are you managing well there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Though I wish you prepared me for dealing with girls a lot better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could never give you the experience you would be facing here. But hold fast, soon as you get what you need, they will never be the wiser.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. Where is the ninja?\", you asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trying to escape on the narrow side. If you can, take her alone and, keep the artifact for yourself. If you can smuggle it into the academy without them realizing you have it, then we'll have an edge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On it. Love you mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be safe hon.\"</span></div></div>",

I wish he or she would just come out already and me and (name) were having so much fun on our date too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked past more exhibits and displays, but she still didn't find anyone.

I'm so freaking bored right now that I feel like I wanna scream!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Katsuragi sensed someone coming towards her. She quickly hid behind the corner of the hall and peeked out. There was no one there. Then she heard running footsteps and saw a figure go past her. As the figure ran, Katsuragi saw that the figure was carrying something in a small bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it! That's gotta be the thief!\" she thought. \"Time to kick some ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came out of the corner and leaped towards the thief with a kick aimed directly at her. The figure saw the attack coming and blocked it crossing her arms. Both fell to the floor and landed safely. Katsuragi looked up and could now see who the figure was. She was a young girl with pale skin with green hair amber eyes that had a feral look to them. She wore a yellow torn up shirt with gashed up blue jeans with the zipper down. She also had leather constricts on her arms and legs carrying knifes and had a couple snake tattoos here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I finally found you, ya thief!\" said Katsuragi. \"Now hand over that thing you stole! Or I'll pound your face in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked at Katsuragi and smiled and held out the bag. \"You want this? Then you're gonna have to take it from me. That is if you can. Shinobi Kekkai.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the surrounding around Katsuragi and the girl turned into a strange eerie blue color and began to twist and distort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell? A Shinobi Kekkai?!\" exclaimed Katsuragi. \"Then... that means that you're a...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl whipped out her knife and with a twisted smile gave it a lick as she prepared to fight Katsuragi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then...

I gotta get there and get that artifact before she does! Not to mention there's no telling how much danger Katsuragi's in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran down the hall towards the direction of where you were sensed the shinobi kekkai.

From the looks of things, she was from another school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there,\" said the girl as she calmly stepped out of the darkness. \"I'm Haruka. The one who 'wanted to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brandished your claws keeping your guard up. \"So I take it you're in cahoots with the ninja who's trying to steal the artifact am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you must mean Hikage,\" said Haruka. \"Although... cahoots is a pretty strong word. She's more like a dear friend of mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. I see,\" you said. \"So, you mind telling me what you two are doing here stealing the artifact in this museum?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka waved a finger clicking her tongue. \"Ah, ah, ah. I can't really tell you that now can I?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better tell me. Otherwise you're gonna get hurt,\" you threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my. So feisty and hostile. Like a little puppy being held against it's will. How adorable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know why, but your face instinctively turned a bright pink from being called adorable. You shook your head trying to shake the embarrassment off. Then you heard a voice that came from a loudspeaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention hostiles! We will be storming the building in five minutes! If you do not give yourself now, we will show no mercy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it,\" you thought. \"I don't have time for this, I gotta help Katsuragi and get that artifact before the cops get here and to do that I'm gonna have to beat this girl quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately took a great leap and slashed at Haruka using your claws in a blinding speed. Haruka fell to the floor in a heap as you landed behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Haruka, but I have no time to be dealing with the likes of you. I've got a comrade to save and an artifact to get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back at Haruka's now dead body, but something was wrong. You felt it in your gut. You went over to Haruka's body and touched her neck to check her pulse. Her skin was hard as a rock. You looked at her face only to find that her face was a face of wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute... It's a puppet!\" you said. \"Shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou straightened up only to find that the area around you had changed to pink color and had strange objects floating here and there which meant one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap! She trapped me in a shinobi kekkai!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then heard Haruka's laugh echo throughout the kekkai. You looked around trying to find where she was. Then you saw her standing on top of what appeared to be a giant teddy bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now. Let's not be so hasty,\" she said. \"I wanna play with you just a little longer okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me out. If I do I promise I won't hurt you,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe. How cute. The puppy thinks he's a wolf. Shinobi Transformation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a burst of light, Haruka's clothes changed into her shinobi attire. She now wore some kind of pink and white lingerie with white cups with a diamond shaped opening revealing her cleavage. She also had white garments on her legs with she wears thin white bottom with pink high heels. Lastly on her back was a large white lab coat lined with many different vials. She appeared to look like some kind of scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, shall we start this dance?\" asked Haruka beckoning you with her index finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine by me,\" you said. \"Once I'm done with this 'dance' I'm gonna get Katsuragi and the artifact and call it a day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran towards Haruka with your arms trailing behind you making your claws scrape along the ground. You jumped up and fell towards Haruka, your claws aimed right at her throat. With a battle cry, you slashed at Haruka with the intent to kill, but Haruka simply side stepped dodging the attack. You skidded to a stop and then slashed again, but once more Haruka dodged the attack elegantly. Haruka attacked you with a punch aimed for your midsection, but you dodged by moving your hips. Haruka attacked again with a kick aimed for your left leg, but you dodged by raising your leg like the way a ballerina would. You attacked again with a straight punch, but ducked dodging the blow and suddenly you found her face just inches away with yours. Haruka giggled and touched your chin lifting it slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my,\" chuckled Haruka . \"You're quite the dancer my little puppy. Would you mind dancing some more for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyebrow twitched in anger upon hearing the word puppy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop screwing with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attacked Haruka once more using your claws to stab her. You stabbed something, but it wasn't Haruka. Instead you stabbed a teddy bear. Haruka then landed behind you with that same teasing smile making you turn around and look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe. Are you done my little puppy?\" she asked. \"Come on... dance with me some more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clenched your hands in anger feeling more irritated, but then you took a deep breath and calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to calm down,\" you thought. \"She's just messing with me. Just ignore her and take her down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a fighting stance and prepared to attack Haruka again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww what's the matter little puppy? Did you want to play some more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka once more began to tease you, but you gave no reaction. You stood in your fighting stance waiting for Haruka to leave an opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not talking huh? Come on. Why are you being so cruel little puppy? I just wanna play with you so we can be friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crouched low and then rushed toward Haruka in a blinding speed and with a fierce cry and clear head went on the attack again.</span></div></div>",

She now had you vulnerable to an attack, however instead of evading her attack, you reached out and grabbed the same blade you had thrown. In a swift motion, as soon as you grabbed the blade, you swung it directly behind you, causing Haruka to visibly show a sign of shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your blade land, but it was caught with two hand narrowly stopping it from reaching Haruka. One of her puppets formed right behind her, and stopped you. In retaliation, Haruka said with tones of her anger breaking her image of her gentler demure, \"I was far too careless. You actually have had some experience against other shinobi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This dance being too much for you?'', you joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, this dance is sweeping me off my feet, but you're not the one who's getting flat feet!\", she went on the offensive and relentlessly punched, jabbed, kicked at every conceivable placement your body was moving to. You could block and deflect her strikes but you were overwhelmed by how fast and precise she was. \"And the most elegant way to end all great dances, has the leading partner dip the other.\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled back from you and made an awkward jerking motion, as if she was pulling something out of thin air.

If I was in the mood, I'd let you be one of my own personal servants. You do serve as darling eye candy while wrapped under my power.\", she said feeling disappointed. \"Now- uh? Wait?\", she noticed you had something. You lifted your head up to show you had a smoke pellet in your mouth. You spat it out in her face. Haruka brushed off as much of it as she could, but when she regained herself, you were out of your entanglement and her strings lied still and tangled on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impossible! Nobody could escape that trap. He can't have gotten far.\", the strings came to life and returned to Haruka. Her genuine scare of someone breaking one of her most powerful puppet techniques made her search for you incredibly tense. Probably the first time in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boo.\", you said in her ear. Haruka swung in a reflex behind herself. You narrowly dodged it but you had a clear shot and stabbed Haruka in the rib-cage. Your smoke gave the illusion of camouflage which made her believe you got free. \"HA! Now I got you!\", soon as you looked up at her face, it turned out to be another dummy of Haruka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back to see her clenching her side, \"You almost had me. For a second I thought you were going to kill me. So now I'm going to keep my distance. I'll make this fun though. Since I'm growing very fond of this game of ours, and growing a liking to how powerful you are, I think a loyal puppy like you should be encouraged to come to their new home. Come to mommy, c'mere puppy. Let mommy gives you kisses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all the awkwardness from Yuuta and Katsuragi, you wondered if you were some sort of cosmic magnet for girls wanting to smack lips with you. But this wasn't the type of kissing you had in mind. She blew you a kiss, but hearts came out of her mouth when she pressed against her fingers, then a literal heart came at you and in moments blew you half to hell!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attack was so out of the box, it was a direct hit. You were weak and bruised, you couldn't defend against another, or let alone evade another incoming attack from her. \"Now stay. Mommy's going to take care of you, you'll be such a good boy. Hmm hmm, I may not be sure what I'll do with you if you miraculously make it out of this.\", Haruka walked towards you, confidently expressing her glee in her victory. However you still had one last card to play.</span></div></div>",

No smoke pellet would work since you wouldn\u2019t be able to move, and camo would stall for seconds at best. The only trick you had left was your trusty blow-dart. A shot from it, and Haruka would be out like a light. You pocketed it, while crawling away from her to try and give the false sense of victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka giggled, \u201cTsk tsk, is that all the fight you have? I thought you would at least try and put up a fight in your moments of defeat. This is just making me disappointed by how well you fought, but then when your beaten you try and escape with your tail between your legs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBiggest problem with ninja like you, is that I can never know\u201d, you took the blow-dart and fired it at Haruka. The dart managing to hit her arm. \u201dWhen to get the drop on them when they get caught up in their own victory.\u201d, you smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka took out the dart and began to feel dizzy. Her shinobi kekkai was beginning to fall, and she was losing balance. But she took something from out of her labcoat, and drank a vile of some sort of liquid. She started to get back up now as if the dart had no effect. \u201cOhhhh clever, clever, clever my little puppy. You managed to break my focus, so now I can\u2019t bring it up until your little drug gets out of my system.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn! She had an antidote!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka walked over to you but stumbled as she made her way. Your sleeping drug was very potent, even with Haruka shaking off the sleeping agents, it still didn\u2019t work completely. \u201cUgh, you are being more stubborn than I imagined. Whoooa!\u201d, she dropped to the floor with her knees keeping her from falling all the way down. \u201cBut you still can\u2019t get away. I still have you. When this stuff clears out, I\u2019ll keep you on a very tight leash.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bite.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll bet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard the sound of the cops starting to enter into the building. You were in no shape to move but you needed to get out of there. \u201cCops. Because of your drug we might not get out of this alive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeast you won\u2019t be getting out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, nnnnghhhh. But maybe I can still- gyahhh!\u201d, she tried to stand but tumbled down. \u201cHow long is this going to last.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you have something to totally knock out that stuff. Neither of us will walk out of here if I can\u2019t get us out of their sights.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t want to be carried off by her, but you had little choice, \u201cIn my left front pocket.\u201d, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka crawled over to you and took out a small container having the antidote. You saw the cops starting to barge through the doors. Haruka swallowed it, and almost immediately regained enough of herself to pick you up and sneak away from the cops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took you to the rooftop where she placed you down gently, \u201cToo close.\u201d, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrankly I wish I didn\u2019t let you talk me into it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo still going to try and put up a fight?\u201d, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs long I\u2019m still able to think.\u201d, and in one blow to the face she kicked you, knocking you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, now you\u2019re beaten.\u201d, Haruka shook her head, still feeling nauseous. Seeing how hairy things were getting, with Hikage still inside, Haruka sent a flare, signaling someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Katsuragi was locked in a heated duel with Hikage....</span></div></div>",

However, she had suffered multiple bruises and a couple cuts and her clothes were tattered and sliced. while Hikage had hardly suffered any damage at all. Katsuragi attacked with a flurry of kick, but Hikage dodged them and slashed her with her knife. Katsuragi jumped up dodging the attack or so she thought. She felt a slight twinge of pain on cheek. She touched her cheek and saw the blood on her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! This is crazy!\" she thought. \"I'm kicking her as hard and fast as I can, but she hardly has a scratch on her! How is she doing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikage stood there lazily as if fighting Katsuragi had been nothing but child's play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on... I'm getting bored,\" she said lowering her knife. \"Is that really all you got?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! I'm just getting started!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatsuragi ran forward and jumped up bringing her leg down giving a downward kick with a great force, but Hikage crossed her arms blocking the kick. The force of the kick sent a shockwave that spread throughout the shinobi kekkai. Katsuragi's eyes widened in shock while Hikage licked her which were in a predatory smirk. She threw Katsuragi off of her by pushing her leg and before Katsuragi could react, she attacked with a slash of her knife that so fast Katsuragi couldn't dodge. Katsuragi screamed in pain as her clothes were torn and she was spent sprawling to the ground. Hikage lowered her knife and licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How pathetic. You're even weaker than I thought.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly a bright light flashed just above them. Hikage knew what that was. She put away her blade and turn to Katsuragi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. As much as I want to continue this, that'll be enough for today and I'll be taking this with me,\" she said as she held up the bag containing the artifact. \"It's been fun. See you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she started to walk away and she dispelled the shinobi kekkai. Katsuragi struggled to get up refusing to be beaten. She managed to get on her feet and stared at Hikage's back with defiant eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get... back here... I'm not done with you yet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't be focusing on me blondie,\" said Hikage. \"You should be focusing on yourself and apparently your boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatsuragi didn't know what Hikage meant, but before she could even ask what Hikage meant she heard a voice down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over there! I think I heard someone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap! It's the cops!\" cursed Katuragi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned back to Hikage only to find that she had disappeared. She wanted to pursue her, but she knew that it wasn't the time for it. She had to get out of there as soon as possible before the cops caught her. She quickly made her way towards the rooftop while staying under the radar from the cops. Eventually she made it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew. I managed to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Katsuragi was welcomed by a startling sight. There was you lying there covered in bruises, your clothes tattered, and completely unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! (name)!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatsuragi immediately rushed to your side and gently shook you trying to wake you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)! (name) wake up! Come on! This isn't the time to be taking a nap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did not move nor did you respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! He's out cold. I gotta get him over to Kiriya sensei so he can be treated!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving no other choice Katsuragi wrapped your arm over her shoulder and lifted you up grabbed a hold of your waist and then took off running, jumping over to the next rooftop and heading back towards Hanzou Academy. </span></div></div>",

It's a school that's similar to Hanzou Academy, but in this school only evil ninja train here. The training was harsh and if you were too weak to handle it, you would die. When Homura and Hikage arrived at the school, they were greeted by two girls. One wore an eye patch, was practically looked young and had blue hair that went to her shoulders and the other was dark skinned with a long black ponytail that went past her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you two. Welcome back,\" said the eye patch girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she saw Haruka was feeling a little unsteady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell happened to you Haruka?\" asked the eye patch girl. \"You look like hell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm OK Mirai,\" said Haruka. \"Let's just say that I met a cute puppy and he didn't like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna head to the infirmary?\" asked the ponytailed girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks Homura I'm fine. Besides we have to go see Shizune to make our report.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean that your mission was a success?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a look for yourself,\" said Hikage and she showed them the pouch. Then another girl came up to them. A blonde with blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys! I've got something important to tell you!\" the girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikage sighed. \"I'm afraid to ask, but what's the problem now Yomi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was walking around town, when I saw the new prices of the sprouts! They were ridiculously high! Which is very unfair and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I'm gonna ignore that and just gonna go see Shizune,\" said Hikage as she walked past Yomi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You're not listening to me!\" complained Yomi pouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Yomi. You can rant about the rising prices of sprouts later,\" said Homura. \"We gotta go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right fine,\" grumped Yomi. \"But I still think it's unfair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, the five of them gathered in front of a woman who was wearing a samurai uniform with a mask on so they couldn't see her face. She was Shizune. Hikage stepped forward and gave the pouch to the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done you two,\" said Shizune. \"You obtained the item just like I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to Haruka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haruka. You should go get yourself treated,\" she said. \"I can tell by looking at you that you've been poisoned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poisoned? By who?\" asked Homura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka chuckled. \"Oh nothing special. I just met an interesting boy from Hanzou. He really showed me a good time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on... a boy? Are you pulling my leg?\" asked Mirai. \"Since when have you been interested in a guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough,\" said Shizune. \"We received brand new orders from the top.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean from the headmaster?\" asked Homura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct,\" said Shizune. \"All of you are to infiltrate Hanzou Academy and find the good ninja's secret base and also...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed a picture in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to find this person and when you do, capture the person and have this person brought here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the girls looked at the photo and nodded and disappeared into the darkness to start their mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Hanzou...</span></div></div>",

Haruka and Yomi stood above the tennis courts watching the students below with Yomi in one of her rants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn them... They everything they could ever want and yet they still complain,\" she said clenching her fists. \"They don't appreciate how privileged they are as if they are entitled to such generosity. It's people like that that make me sick to my stomach. But we'll teach them a lesson won't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now Yomi. You know that we're not supposed to do anything to them,\" said Haruka. \"But I think I can understand you. They would become such beautiful puppets. It's a shame that we can't do anything to them. Oh well. I guess I'll have to settle for one for now when we complete our mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled in delight giving a light lick of her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in another part of the school, Haruka and Mirai walking around the school heading to the main building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man... how boring,\" complained Mirai. \"Why the hell are we walking around like this again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know why Mirai,\" said Haruka. \"We have to search the campus for the good ninja's base of operations where they train.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I know,\" said Mirai. \"It's still a pain in the butt. While we're on that topic, why would they hide something like that in a college prep school anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think about it, It's as a wise old man once said,\" said Homura. \"Hide a tree in a forest, hide a student in a school. Although... they do seem to do things the roundabout way for some reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares? As long as we get to outsmart those goody goodies who cares how they do things,\" said Mirai with a smirk. \"By the way, where's Hikage? Isn't she supposed to be here too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hikage is working with Yuuta on capturing out target,\" explained Haruka. \"She's also briefing her on a plan she has going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another part of the school, Hikage was also walking around the school searching for your training school. Then she met a girl who was standing under a tree waiting for her which turned out to be Yuuta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you the one Homura speaks of? The one called Yuuta?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct,\" said Yuuta. \"And you must be Hikage. All right then. Listen up because I'm only gonna tell you this once. Here's what you'll do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Yuuta began explaining her plan to Hikage making sure that she knew what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got that?\" asked Yuuta after she finished explaining her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I got it,\" said Hikage. \"I gotta say, your plan is kinda devious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the ways of the ninja, it doesn't matter how devious the plan is,\" said Yuuta. \"What matters is getting the job done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. I hear ya,\" said Hikage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater after searching the entire school, the Hebijo girls came to an old building which was in fact Hanzo's main base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well. We've searched the entire campus and this is the only place left,\" said Haruka. \"You think that is might be it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pretty old than the other buildings,\" said Yomi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to mention it's not of use anymore,\" added Homura. \"Probably here for historical purposes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Off limits except for authorized personnel huh?\" quirked Mirai looking at the sign. \"That practically spells secret base. I think we found it girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mirai's right,\" said Yuuta. \"This the Hanzo's main base. I guess you better get started then. Hikage. You know what to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I know,\" said Hikage. \"Well then, let's get started shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. We shall,\" said Yuuta. \"Now then... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside the base...</span></div></div>",

You do so by standing with your feet firmly on the ground and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he droned on with his lesson, Ikaruga and Yagyu were giving their upmost attention. Hibari looked like she was paying attention as well, but she was most likely pretending to pay attention because she didn't understand. As for Asuka and Katsuragi, like any other normal student in school they started to feel drowsy. Asuka was on the brink of falling asleep trying to stay awake. Katsuragi however was completely asleep and unfortunately Kiriya noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katsuragi!\" snapped Kiriya. \"Wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatsuragi opened her sleepy eyes and looked around sleepily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What's going on? Is it lunch time already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy. She's in trouble,\" said Asuka. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katsuragi! You have to pay attention!\" said Kiriya. \"How are you supposed to get stronger if you're gonna be sleeping through my lessons?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Sensei! It's not like we're learning anything. You're just teaching us the basics over and over again,\" said Katsuragi. \"Besides we should be focusing on something else. Like finding those skanks who attacked us and hurt (name)!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand Katsuragi. I do, but you have to train to get stronger in mind and body,\" said Kiriya. \"That's why I'm teaching you all the basics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Sensei! We should be out searching and you know it! I hate to say this, but it's a big waste of time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katsuragi! That's enough!\" snapped Ikaruga. \"I understand you want revenge believe me we all do, but have to get stronger and come up with a plan. If you really want to get payback, then you'll focus on getting stronger. Physically and mentally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatsuragi clenched her fists and was about say something else, when Yuuta busted into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sensei! Girls! We got trouble!\" she said panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Yuuta?\" asked Kiriya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw her! One of the girls... from Hebijo Academy... she's right here in the academy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone's eyes widened most especially Katsuragi's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" asked Kiriya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm positive! Take a look on the periscope!\" said Yuuta. \"She's right by the courts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiriya snapped his fingers and a periscope came down in front of him. He looked through it and searching through the school. Then saw her. There walking to towards close by the tennis courts was Hikage. She looked at him as if she knew she was being watched and waved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impossible! How did she get here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Yuuta. \"But I do know is that we need to drive her away before she gets close to the base.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkaruga stood up. \"Yuuta. What does she look like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see...\" pondered Yuuta. \"She had long green hair and kinda looked like a delinquent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatsuragi immediately stood up as well. \"No doubt about it! It's that Hikage skank!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do sensei?\" asked Yagyu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiriya turned to Yuuta. \"Yuuta I want you to pursue her and drive her out and try to get information from her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood Sensei,\" said Yuuta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sensei let me go with her!\" said Katsuragi. \"This is my perfect chance to get even!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not,\" said Kiriya.m \"Besides Yuuta can handle it on her own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually Kiriya, I need Katsuragi's help on this one,\" said Yuuta. \"I could use a little extra muscle. Besides I'd feel a lot safer if she's with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... very well,\" said Kiriya. \"Just don't go fighting into the school Katsuragi. Need I remind you that you're a ninja.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know sensei!\" said Katsuragi cracking her knuckles. \"Now then, time for me to get some well deserved payback! Let's go Yuuta!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katsiragi wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatsiragi dashed out the door with Yuuta close behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... Katsuragi's sure raring to go,\" said Asuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well can you blame her? She still blames herself for what happened,\" said Kiriya. \"She thinks it's her fault that (name) got injured.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it wasn't,\" said Hibari. \"Those mean old Hebiji girls are the ones who hurt (name).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That may be true Hibari, but Katsuragi feels responsible,\" said Kiriya. \"Not to mention that she was utterly defeated by that girl called Hikage. She wants to make it right by defeating her I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And she really loves (name) after all,\" said Asuka. \"Ah! The power of love is such a beautiful thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna pretend that you didn't say that Asuka,\" said Ikaruga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a very loud alarm began to blare throughout the base. Asuka, Hibari, and Yagyu all jumped in surprise while Ikaruga remained unmoved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap! That's loud!\" complained Asuka covering her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone's tripped the intruder alarm,\" said Ikaruga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" said Hibari clinging to Yagyu.\"Intruders?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiriya looked at the periscope again. This time at the entrance to the base. Sure enough, by the entrance there was two boys standing by it looking like they were loitering around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like they're ordinary students,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So there's no need to worry?\" asked Hibari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Don't worry I'll take care of this girls. You all stay here,\" said Kiriya as he headed for the entrance to the base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the entrance, Kiriya walked up to the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What are you boys doing here?\" he demanded. \"Surely you do realize that students are not allowed in this area. You two playing hooky or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys said nothing. They stood up and glared at Kiriya ready to start a fight with him. They rushed toward him with their fists aimed right for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not talking eh?\" said Kiriya. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dashed forward in a blinding speed and punch them both in the gut. Then then grabbed them both by their collar and walked them both outside the entrance and dropped them to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right you two. Tell me your names and classes or I'll take you straight to the faculty office,\" said Kiriya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys still said nothing. Then suddenly they slumped over completely motionless on the ground. Kiriya went over to them checking to make sure that they were all right. As soon as he touched one, the head rolled to it's side and revealed a wooden face of a puppet. He checked the other one and it had a wooden face too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're puppets?\" puzzled Kiriya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen his eyes widened in shock. He had been tricked. The puppets were a trap to lure him away from the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! The girls! (name)!\" he said as he turned around to run back to the building, but he was too little too late. Right then and there, a shinobi kekkai wrapped all around the building with Kiriya outside of it. Kiriya tried to break through it, but he couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! I should've known! An evil ninja sneak attack!\"</span></div></div>",

The ninja girls inside the academy noticed that they were surrounded in various shinobi kekkais around the building causing most of them to be separated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour room happened to be within one that was controlled by none other than Haruka, the ninja you faced a while ago. She walked inside your room verbally taunting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoo hmm hmm hmm. I don\u2019t know if your faking being asleep, or you really are passed out. But I feel you should know, I found our fight to be a very kinky. It is going to be soooo much fun wrapping you around my fingers.\u201d, she then started planting something on you but suddenly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake your hands off of him!\u201d, Asuka yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh dear, sorry I didn\u2019t know he was taken.\u201d, Haruka teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka blushed, \u201cBack away! I don't know who you are but you won't take him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow now. There is no need for trouble. I won't even put up a fight, really, I swear I won\u2019t lay a finger on you.\u201d, Haruka said but waved her hand over you. Suddenly like a puppet you were moving despite your sleeping state. You took out your ninja claws and got into your fighting stance, \"But he will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shit.\u201d, Asuka reacted pulling out her blade in defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c(Name), go and play with her.\u201d, Haruka said then pointed at Asuka and then you lunged at your fellow ally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're eyes were half open but all they showed was the lifelessness you felt while being forced to move against your will. You were totally unaware as your mind was still drugged but now Haruka had control over the body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka didn't or rather couldn't go on the offensive as she clearly knew this wasn't your own doing. \"(Name)! It's me! Asuka! Your friend! Wake up!\", she tried pleading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No use trying. I control his actions and all he can do is follow them. Doesn't matter if you wake him, I'll still be manipulating his movements.\", Haruka mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the heads up coach!\", Asuka knocked you down by tripping you while she held back both of your arms. She lunged at Haruka but only to find that when Asuka swung her blade at Haruka, she missed. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk tsk tsk. You ninja never learn. You think I don't notice that by singling out the fact I'm the one pulling the strings, you lend me yours. A trap I lay around myself and it always works.\", Haruka mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't...move...somethings wrapped all over my limbs.\", Asuka thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two playthings. So cute. You two are like dolls, which reminds me what do kids do with them again? Oh that's right they play with them\", Haruka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Asuka sat down on chairs sitting across a table. It seemed like Haruka was taking that analogy a bit literally. \"You won't get away with this! Better hight tail it out of here before the others get here.\", Asuka threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope I doubt it. You see, I'm not the only ninja here, and we've got most of you preoccupied. Think I'm entitled to a little fun. So tell me, what is the connection between you two? Ohhh I know, truth or dare. Yeah, that will be hysterical. What do you want first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To slit your throat.\", Asuka answered as she tried moving her arm that still held her sword in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dare then. I dare you, toooooo kneel down and propose to him.\", Haruka waved her hand and suddenly Asuka felt forced into doing a kneel and extended her hands as if she was proposing. Haruka manipulated your body to do an exaggerated physical reaction like your were all awestruck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, look how happy he is. What now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I get out of this-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will do dare again, man, you really are a daredevil. Ok now what to make you do next?\", Haruka acting too playful didn't notice Asuka subtly motioning her hand to cut a few strings off. Didn't matter what they held on to, they would weaken Haruka's grip on her. \"Oooo, care for a little frisky massaging?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily Asuka freed her arms and in a frantic fury sliced off all the strings attached to her and you. You collapsed but Asuka held her sword over at Haruka, just on the skin of her throat. \"You got far too careless.\", Asuka threatened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, if I was worried my mission wouldn't be completed, I'd never send my best ninja to deal with half-baked ninja in training.\", she said with a smile.</span></div></div>",

I sure hope everyone's okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Hibari heard a voice that made her jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't be worried about your friends. You should be more worried about your self.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHibari turned around and saw one of the evil ninja which turned out to be Mirai. When she saw her, she couldn't help but feel a little scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep! You're one of the evil ninja aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No duh Sherlock,\" said Mirai. \"Did you figure that out all by yourself? You may have gotten away last time, but this time you won't get away! I'm gonna pay you back for those lousy bunny attacks! Shinobi Transformation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Mirai's outfit quickly transformed into a black, white and dark teal frilled dress and bonnet with cat ears, cat tail, and what looked like black angel wings on her back with an umbrella with her right hand. With two hands she aimed it right at Hibari like a gun and then a nozzle from a gun appeared from the tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you die!\" said Mirai as she fired at Hibari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHibari ducked down and thought she was a goner, but for some reason the bullets never hit her. Hibari peeked open one eye and saw why. There stood Yagu who had activated her shinobi transformation and shielded Hibari from the bullets using her umbrella. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yagyu! You saved me,\" said Hibari happy to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK Hibari,\" said Yagyu. \"I'll always be here to protect you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's you again!\" growled Mirai. \"I never thought I'd see your face again you hussy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're just as annoying as ever,\" said Yagyu. \"I take it you're the one who hurt Hibari before am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so what if I did?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you will pay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYagyu took her stance and pointed her umbrella at Mirai like a sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone who hurts Hibari is gonna pay. I'll make sure of that,\" said Yagyu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yagyu...\" murmured Hibari her eyes filled with admiration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh I'm so scared,\" mocked Mirai. \"The only person that's gonna die today is you! You and all of your friends! Including that lousy boy that's here too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she said the word boy, Hibari suddenly remembered you being in the infirmary. Which meant that it was mostly likely that you were in a shinobi kekkai too. Yagyu knew this too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're talking about (name). Where is he? Tell us right now and we'll let you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in no position to be making demands!\" snapped Mirai. \"Besides there's no way I'll tell you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Hibari stepped forward. She was a little timid, but she plucked up courage and stood up to Mirai. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is (name)?\" she said trying to sound demanding. \"Tell us right now... or you'll be sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're threatening me? Oh please! You're not strong enough to take me on!\" said Mirai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hibari stay back and let me handle this,\" said Yagyu. \"She and I are a lot stronger than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Yagyu... I wanna fight with you!\" said Hibari. \"I know I'm not as strong as you and I may be the weakest ninja, but... (name) is in danger and... I'll fight if I can protect him! I'm gonna do my best to protect him\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Hibari came running straight at Mirai with her arms flailing around like a child's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hibari...\" murmured Yagyu who was clearly impressed with Hibari's courage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please,\" sneered Mirai. \"You couldn't fight out of a wet paper bag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe aimed with her umbrella gun and fired at Hibari, but then Yagyu came to the rescue by shielding Hibari once again with her umbrella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!

The puppets from before were decoys to divide us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a laugh echoed throughout the kekkai. Ikaruga looked behind her and there stood Yomi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You upper-class kids are so gullible,\" she smirked. \"This is one of the reasons why I hate people like you..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're the one responsible for this kekkai,\" said Ikaruga looking at Yuna up and down. \"And that uniform... I get it know. You stole our school's uniform and then infiltrated the academy to search for our base. That's quite the bold move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYomi twirled around making her skirt flutter in the air. \"Of course. After all a school for rich students would have such material. Although I'm not particularly a fan because the thought of how much uniform like this must cost makes me wanna puke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" snapped Ikaruga. \"What do you want with us? What business do you and your comrades have here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How typical,\" scoffed Yomi. \"Always demanding more and more. Very well then. I'll tell you even with your snobby attitude. However you'll have to defeat me if you want me to talk. Shinobi Transformation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Yomi's attire changed into a teal green dress with a white slip underneath with the top revealing a lot of bust and a single white collar wraps around her neck. On her arms she had long white gloves and green diamond shaped arm sleeves with white frill underneath. Around her waist is a white apron with shuriken pattern on it and a belt that holds a brown bag and a strip of replacement darts for her crossbow weapon. She also wore a teal beret with a large white bow on the back of it and an even larger bow on the back of her dress. For her legs, she had a pair of white stockings covered by long brown boots with black bows at the top. Lastly she had a long giant sword. And so another fight in a shinobi kekkai began.</span></div></div>",

Yomi attacked again and once more Ikaruga dodged by jumping back. The force of Yomi's attack caused a giant whirlwind to blow through the area forcing Ikaruga to block with her sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She possess incredible power! If I don't do something, I won't be able to last much longer!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Yomi came swinging with again with another attack attacking Ikaruga in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? Getting sweaty from our fight?\" she taunted. \"Afraid you'll mess up your air you privileged brat?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkaruga dodged the attack again and jumped back hoping to gain some distance, but Yomi then suddenly lifted up her skirt and strange spiked bomb like things came out and zipped straight for her! Not being able to dodge in time, Ikaruga had no choice but to take the hit. The bombs hit the mark as Ikaruga was hit making her scream in surprise and pain. Smoke billowed everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah! Take that!\" jeered Ikaruga. \"Where's your money and wealth now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen from the smoke Ikaruga darted forward with her sword raised and before Yomi could react Ikaruga preapred to strike with her sword, but suddenly Yomi's weapon changed. The sword was quickly replaced with a crossbow. Yomi aimed and then pulled the trigger. Ikaruga immediately rolled back with arrows narrowly missing her. She jumped up and landed on her feet and looked at Yomi to see what she would do next only to see that Yomi's weapon had changed again. This time into a hand cannon. She aimed and then fired. A huge explosion rocked the whole shinobi kekkai confirming that the target was hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was easy,\" smirked Yomi. \"Sorry, but having money doesn't automatically make you a great shinobi. Remember that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYomi thought that she scored with her cannon, but when the smoke cleared. There was no sign of Ikaruga. There was nothing left, but her tattered and slightly singed jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where'd she go?\" wondered Yomi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she looked up in time to see Ikaruga diving bombing straight for her with her sword raised. This time she was wearing nothing, but a black two piece bikini and glowing with an orange-red aura. For those of you that don't know, this is called the Life or Dash technique. A technique that lets a shinobi engage in combat without their uniforms allowing them to focus their attack power and speed, but it's also a very risky move leaving the user vulnerable if they are struck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkaruga attacked by swinging her sword releasing a wave of fire right at Yomi. Yomi yelled in surprise and pain as the fire burned all of her clothes except for a green swimsuit with white frills. Ikaruga then dashed toward her her sword pointed right at her. Yomi immediately went on the defensive by switching her cannon with her sword ready to strike, but Ikargua jumped up and stood on top of Yomi's blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now! Defend yourself!\" she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. You certainly have a nasty habit of barking orders from above huh?\" sneered Yomi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then threw a cat figure in the air which exploded into seeking fireballs. Ikaruga back flipped into the air dodging them all, but that left her open for attack which Yomi took advantage of. As soon as she landed on her feet, Yomi brough her sword straight down ready to slice Ikaruga in half, but Ikaruga blocked her sword just in time. Sparks leapt from the collision of metal. Ikrauga grit her teeth trying to withstand Yomi's attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it... you disgust me! You lead a life of luxury while people like me have to fight just to survive. You don't know what it's like to experience grief and misery the poor suffer every day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkaruga glared, but then her eyes softened. She knew that Yomi was wrong. She did know what it was like and because of that the softness in her eyes was quickly replaced with determination. With a defiant shout and her aura flaring she threw Yomi off of her sending her flying into the air and then sprawling to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impossible...\" groaned Yomi. \"How... did she get so strong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up!\" said Ikaruga. \"Don't you make any assumptions about me because you don't know anything about me! You may not know it, but I too have experience grief and misery. However... I sealed it all away inside Hien! If I'm looking high and mighty it's because of one thing! It's because I'm proud! Proud and prideful of what was entrusted to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped into the air glowing brighter than ever with her sword being cloaked in flames. Her aura also came to life taking on the shape of a phoenix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Secret Ninja Art! Hien Phoenix Flash Suite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a fierce cry, Ikaruga unleashed her ultimate attack. A great fire erupted from her sword and barreled right into Yomi. She tried to block it with her sword, but she was overwhelmed by the flames of Hien. Eventually the flames of Hien died down and Yomi lied on the ground defeated. Ikaruga sheathed her sword and walked over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's over...\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-damn you...\" said Yomi. \"You'll pay... for doing this to me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough talking,\" said Ikaruga. \"You said if I defeated you, you would tell me everything I want to know. So talk. What are you and your comrades doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYomi glared at Ikaruga, but she complied. \"Fine then. I'll tell you everything I know as part of my agreement.\"</span></div></div>",

They went by the courts where Yuuta had seen her, but she was no where to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! Where the hell is that skank?\" muttered Katsuragi. \"She's gotta be around here somewhere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it easy Katsuragi,\" said Yuuta. \"I understand how you're feeling, but you have to keep a cool head about this especially since we're out in public. Don't worry. We'll find her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey checked all around the courts still not seeing Hikage while at the same time keeping a low profile, then suddenly they spotted her. She was walking out of the courts and towards a tree. As soon as Katsuragi saw her, she power walked right towards her with Yuuta close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katsuragi -pants- S-slow down!\" she gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatsuragi didn't listen. Hikage walked towards the tree and she happened to see them. When she did, she flashed a teasing smile and disappeared from behind a tree. Katsuragi then broke into a run heading towards the tree. Katsuragi and Yuuta came around the tree only to find that Hikage had disappeared. Not only that, the landscape around them had changed. The area had turned into an amber color and there were strange demonic specters floating here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! A shinobi kekkai!\" said Yuuta. \"Looks like we walked into a trap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell cares?!\" said Katsuragi. \"Where'd the hell did that snake eyed witch go?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath and called out in the kekkai; \"Hey! Where the hell are you?! Stop hiding and come out and face me you coward!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a bell sounded. Katsuragi turned to find a railroad crossing had appeared behind them. A subway train rushed on by and when it passed by there stood Hikage. As soon as Katsuragi saw her, her blood began to boil remembering what she did to her before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well. It's about time you found me,\" smirked Hikage. \"What took you two so long? I would have found someone more exciting if it wasn't my orders, but I guess you two will have to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine by me!\" said Katsuragi cracking her knuckles. \"I've been meaning to get a rematch with you! Prepare to get your ass kicked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. And I take it that both of you are gonna take me on?\" asked Hikage coolly. \"How lame. Getting help to fight your own battles. I guess you're as weak as I thought you were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd you say?!\" snarled Katsuragi clearly insulted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it easy Katsuragi,\" said Yuuta. \"She's just trying to psych you out. If we take her on together we can...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay out of this Yuuta,\" interrupted Katsuragi. \"This tramp's all mine! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Katsuragi wait!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shinobi Transformation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Katsuragi wouldn't listen she ran towards Hikage and transforming into her school uniform and boot attire and leapt right at Hikage her foot raised for a kick. Hikage chuckled not moving. With a shout, Katsuragi launched a powerful kick sending a shockwave of force. Suddenly Hikage suddenly appeared right behind her. Katsuragi immediately reacted by kicking behind her again, but Hikage dodged the attack with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on... why so hot and bothered? Do yourself a favor and calm down a little,\" said Hikage as they landed on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" snarled Katsuragi. \"I'm like this because that's how I fight! If don't fight the way I do, the how am I supposed to win?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth sides leapt at each seeming like the glided past each other and then landed on the ground again. Then Katsuragi's shirt ripped on her right arm revealing a gash that oozed with blood and Katsuragi found herself looking at the sharp edge of Hikage's knife with Hikage standing right behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe there's an old saying,\" sad Hikage her eyes gleaming. \"Fights are won with skill. Not emotion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Damn it! How'd you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katsuragi! Hang on! I'm coming to help you!\" cried Yuuta as she ran towards Katsuragi and Hikage.

The person drew her katana and slashed straight at her with it. Yuuta immediately leaped back and dodged.

It was Homura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gotta be kidding me,\" muttered Yuuta. \"Another evil ninja.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but I can't let you interfere,\" said Homura. \"If you wanna fight someone, then fight me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of my way,\" snarled Yuuta branding her shurikens. \"Hang on Katsuragi.

Hikage dodged with ease and leaped back. Katsuragi quickly got back on her feet glaring daggers at Hikage. Hikage stood calm and collected still smiling slyly. Yuuta wanted to help her and tried going to help, but Homura bared her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, you're fighting me now,\" she said. \"I wouldn't be so worried about her if I was you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on Katsuragi! Once I deal with her, I'll come help you!\" called Yuuta as she threw a couple shuriken. Homura immediately reacted and blocked them using her katana. Then she slashed at Yuuta swinging her sword which Yuuta dodged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget about me Yuuta,\" said Katsuragi. \"I told you this skank is mine! Focus on that other dark ninja.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Katsuragi...\" said Yuuta, but then Homura was suddenly upon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, worry about yourself!\" she said as she pounced on Yuuta making her jump. When Yuuta got back on her feet, she turned around going to try once again to help Katsuragi, but then she found that the space around her had changed. The space was now a grassy landscape with a river in a shade of orange red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another Kekkai eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course,\" said Homura who stood right behind her causing her to turn around. \"I figured I'd help you focus since you were so worried about your friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How charitable of you,\" said Yuuta sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then...\" said Homura taking her stance. \"Let's see how you fare when I go all out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached behind her back and grew six katanas and with a battle cry she dashed at Yuuta her swords aimed right for her.</span></div></div>",

When Katsuragi swung her legs at Hikage, the evil ninja leaned back narrowly missing a hidden blade in Katsuragi's boot. The tip managed to draw blood from the green haired assassin but resulted in drastic consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. Now I guess I have to be serious now.\", Hikage pulled out two sets of knives around her fingers and threw them at lightning speed at Katsuragi. The blonde kicked or evaded most of them but a coupled managed to cut her at the arm and shin. \"See now look at that. Because you showed your little trump card you had over me, you aggravated your opponent, and now forced you have your best offense become your greatest weakness now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can handle a simple cut.\", Katsuragi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe but that still gives you a big handicap. Oh and one other thing, in fact given how much of a novice you are I should have mentioned this earlier, every one of my knives are poisoned.\", she giggled smiling as her snake-like eyes turned purple. The color in her eyes signified nothing but pure pleasure of sadistically realizing her fantasy of utilizing her ninja animal motif in battle. Katsuragi looked at her wounds. Nothing looked out of the ordinary but she guessed it must be a slow-working poison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give you the courtesy of what those ones were. Hemotoxin, designed to mess with your red bloodcells. It may not hurt yet but soon you will be in a lot of pain. Just picturing it is making me smile more than I have in my whole life. What will act up first? Blood clotting in your brain causing irreversible damage? Or maybe you will never be able to use those legs of your again even when you get properly cured. Frankly now, I'm just too curious that I almost want to watch you die slowly. But I need to haste things along. Time table you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatsuragi didn't have much choice. Hikage was right there, she wanted payback for all of her taunting and harming you. But she may not have much time, and with Yuuta already inside a Kekai, she would be leaving Yuuta more problems if she felt too weak and Yuuta needed to have a quick escape.

She moved too fast for the her opponent to dodge this time which caused Katsuragi to knock the wind out of Hikage, and allow Katsuragi to tackle her down. Hikage couldn\u2019t breath for a moment as she struggled to get the air back in her lungs. As she was pinned down on her back by Katsuragi her arms were grabbed by the blonde warrior unable to allow her to take out her weapons. Katsuragi grinned as she thought her opponent was taken down, reveling in her victory. But as she failed to realize, Hikage was much more cunning, and more experienced with underhanded attacks. In one quick motion Hikage pulled her arm in front of herself, giving her an opening, to bite into Katsuragi\u2019s arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatsuragi reeled back in pain, and grasped her arm tight. She noticed the bite marks looked uncommon, but realized it looked like an actual snake bite. This worried Katsuragi as she feared she was injected with more poison. \u201cHehehehe! You don\u2019t have much time left now. That was a direct injection to your bloodstream. Before you had maybe half an hour but now it will be less than 10 minutes.\u201d, Hikage taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatsuragi could feel an intense amount of pain for her arm as it felt like it was on fire from the inside. Katsuragi knew then and there that it was a mistake to fight back. She was a close ranged fighter who was battling against someone who thrives on that type of prey. Katsuragi threw a smoke pellet down on the ground to provide cover for her to escape. She wanted to help Yuuta but entering a kekai without assistance in the shape she was in, would prove ruinous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to make a hasty retreat back to the academy and take an antidote for the toxin. Every breath she took from that moment on felt scratchy and painful. Like a fever and your whole throat just felt so hot you couldn\u2019t want to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer right arm thumped hard in pain, she could feel the inside of it being all twisted and limp. She scaled and leapt across the skyscrapers back to the academy, tired and hurting. Then as she made another jump across she felt a sharp pain in left shoulder. She saw she was hit with another one of Hikage\u2019s poison tipped daggers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot talking much now huh? What\u2019s the matter? Snake got your tongue?\u201d, she said smiling and having her own tongue stick out like a real snake. \u201cThat last dagger should shave a couple more minutes now. I\u2019d hurry if I were you. By now you could suffer some permanent damage. I\u2019d wager in your arm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatsuragi wanted to speak against her but her throat was in too much pain as was most of her. She stepped back hanging over the edge of the roof. Hikage took out another dagger, waving it in front of herself. \u201cSo now, where to stick in this next one? Hmmm, the cheek? Or maybe the thigh. No how about the hand! Yes that would be marvelous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKatsuragi took another step back but noticed she had nowhere else to run to. She was too weak to successfully dodge Hikage\u2019s throw this time. Blocking it would threaten her balance. Too much pain to concentrate. Too much\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another second she fainted, falling backwards over the edge. Hikage left in delight, feeling accomplished over her actions. </span></div></div>",

Not many can out maneuver my attacks that quickly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, I work hard to get that kind of praise everyday.\u201d, Yuuta threw a couple sets of shurikens at Humura. Her blades blocked every single one. Yuuta didn\u2019t have many options. She needed a way to get past her defenses. But it would be near impossible. Her only weapon were ranged attacks and nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem to be ill-equipped for me. Guess it was a mistake to come after another ninja so blindly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t need the proper weapons to finish this battle. A true ninja uses everything at her disposal to win.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpoken like a ninja from our clan. You would fit in well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m right where I\u2019m needed. C\u2019mon, I\u2019ll give you a clear shot at me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish.\u201d, Homura lunged at Yuuta and readied her sword for a mighty swing over Yuuta\u2019s neck. She swung hard as she could, her blade connected, but in the middle of the swing it stopped. Instead of hearing flesh being ripped apart, she heard metal grazing against each other. Yuuta tightly gripped her shurikens in between her fingers and used them to match steel with Homura. The force of Homura\u2019s swing dug the shurikens into Yuuta\u2019s knuckles, blood leaking, pain unfathomable. Homura reeled back in fear for a moment by Yuuta\u2019s strategy. However her mere flinch was enough for Yuuta to hit her opponent square in the gut, causing multiple puncture wounds in Homura. When Yuuta let go and pulled out her weapons stuck in her hands, she exited the shinobi kekai, hoping to find Katsuragi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she easily broke out of the kekai, in large part of Homura being brought down, she saw Hikage chasing Katsuragi across the skyscrapers. Yuuta chased after them hoping to help her hot-headed friend. By the time she caught up to their last position she saw Katsuragi across from the next rooftop fumbling over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuuta snuck up to Hikage, where she was in too much of a high from her helpless prey struggling to survive to notice anything else, which Yuuta was about to take advantage of. But before she could knock out Hikage, Katsuragi fell back over the roof. Yuuta jumped to the side of the building, then tethered herself to the top, swinging  herself around, hoping to catch her friend in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Katsuragi fell too far Yuuta barley managed to grab her hand. Noticing her condition, Yuuta took out a vile in her bag and force fed it to Katsuragi. A half minute went by in silence, but Katsuragi coughed heavily and showed signs of life. They dangled over feeling tired and beaten, all Katsuragi could muster was, \u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem. But she escaped.\u201d, Yuuta explained. \u201cC\u2019mon lets head back to the school.\u201d, Yuuta said carrying her ally back safely.</span></div></div>",

He went over to the puppets that he took out before and was inspecting them to see if they had some kind of clue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were disguised as puppets, but I still can't believe they were able to get inside so easily,\" he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I for one am surprised that they were able to get past our detection network,\" said a voice. \"That's not a small feat considering we have sensors all over campus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiriya turned around to the source of the voice and saw a black cat up in a tree above him. When he saw the cat, he knew who it was. The cat continued to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One thing's for sure, whoever organized this is someone who knows how things work around here. Someone who is or was once a good ninja.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiriya's stared at the cat not believing what he was hearing. He was about to to talk to the cat, but the cat had vanished without a trace. Then suddenly two wormholes opened right next to him and then three people appeared out of the holes. The first person was Ikaruga and from the other came Yuuta who was carrying Katsuragi on her shoulder who had fallen unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...? Where am I?\" wondered Ikaruga as she looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like we made it outside of the kekkai,\" said Yuuta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ikaruga! Yuuta! Katsuragi!\" said Kiriya with a hint of relief as he ran up to her. \"Thank goodness. Are all you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're fine, but Katsuragi is in rough shape,\" said Yuuta. \"She's been poisoned, but I managed to give Katsuragi an antidote.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn,\" cursed Kiriya. \"That just leaves Hibari, Yagyu, Asuka, and (name).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiriya sensei,\" said Ikaruga. \"I just remembered. There's something I have to tell you all right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ikrauga what happened in there?\" asked Kiriya. \"Tell me what's going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen after a few minutes, Ikaruga told Kiriya what had happened and brought him up to speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" he said. \"I should've known it'd be them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the others?\" asked Yuuta. \"Do you know if any of them are OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Ikaruga. \"All I know is that I fought one of the girls and I made her tell me everything. The next thing I know I was kicked out of the barrier, but I do know what they're after. I had the evil ninja I fought tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's that?\" asked Kiriya. \"Tell us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkaruga then told them what Yomi had told her and what the evil ninja's goal was. Upon hearing, Kiriya's and Yuuta's eyes went wide with surprise and shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! It can't be...\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Why would they...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but I do know that we have to get back inside the kekkai as soon as possible and warn the others,\" said Ikaruga. \"Kiriya sensei, if you know a way inside please you have to tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiriya hummed hesitantly. \"I do. If someone within the barrier is in desperate need, they can call someone outside thus allowing them to force their way into the kekkai, but...it's forbidden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forbidden? Why is that?\" asked Ikaruga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it takes a large amount of power to break the barrier,\" explained Yuuta. \"Especially a shinobi kekkai. There's a huge risk of physical damage or worse. Death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkaruga's eyes widened a little for a split second, but then they were replaced with a firm determination as she walked towards the the barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ikaruga what are you doing?\" asked Kiriya concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to try breaking through the barrier,\" said Ikaruga. \"If I can get one of the girls to sense my presence, I'm sure I'll be able to break through and force my way back into the kekkai.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do it! You're just risking your life!\" cried Yuuta. \"It's too dangerous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care,\" said Ikaruga calmly. \"I have to at least try. Now that I know what the evil ninja are after, I'm not gonna let them have their way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkaruga raised her hand forward, focused her power emitting a red aura, and concentrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on... come on... someone sense my presence,\" she thought to herself praying that someone, anyone would feel her.</span></div></div>",

They were both lying in their beds resting. Ikaruga was reading a book while Katsuragi lied in her bed glaring at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God dammit!\" she cursed slamming her fist onto the mattress. \"I can't believe I let that snake skank get the drop on me like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down Katsuragi,\" said Ikaruga looking up from her book. \"We all got beaten by those girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But still! Dammit it pisses me off!\" said Katsuragi. \"That skank was toying with me! I gave it everything I had with all my training and they still beat us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But being angry about it isn't gonna solve anything,\" said Ikaruga calmly. \"If you really want payback then get even stronger. We'll be discharged tomorrow morning after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Asuka, Hibari, and Yagyu came into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you two,\" said Asuka. \"You two sure seem fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you guys feeling?\" asked Hibari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm feeling fine as is Katsuragi,\" said Ikaruga. \"You can tell by how angry she is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you blame me?!\" snapped Katsuragi. \"Not only did I get beaten by that snake skank, she and those other girls got away with the master scroll!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not only that, but they were also after (name) too,\" said Asuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatsuragi snapped out of her rage and turned to look at Asuka. \"Wait what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. They were after (name) too for some reason. Ikaruga found that out from defeating one of the Hebijo girls,\" said Asuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is (name)? Is he okay?! Don't tell me they took him,\" said Katsuragi now looking worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. He's fine,\" said Yagyu. \"He's back at the base.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew,\" said Katsuragi. \"That's a relief, but... why isn't he here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said wanted to be alone,\" said Hibari. \"I think he feels terrible after what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did happen?\" asked Katsuragi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls then explained what had happened when you were under the control of Haruka. When they finished, Katsuragi's eyes were wide with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh damn... I had no idea,\" she said. \"I know that I've been feeling pissed before, but (name) must be feeling really pissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't blame him,\" said Ikaruga. \"Not only did that puppet girl get the drop on him again, but she also used him against us and used him to steal the master scroll.

As you were training, you were remembering what had happened as soon as you woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You slowly opened your eyes having finally awakened from your induced coma still feeling a little groggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...what happened? What's going on?\" you wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name)! You're awake! Thank goodness!\" said a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen belonged to Kiriya who was sitting by your side keeping watch over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiriya Sensei? What are you doing here?\" you asked. \"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiriya looked at you his face in a very serious expression. \"(name). Listen to me. I need you to tell me something,\" he said. \"What happened to you while you were resting at the infirmary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... just fell asleep,\" you replied. \"Why do you ask? Did something happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kiriya explained what had happened. When he finished telling you, your eyes were wide with shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...no way...\" you murmured. \"All of that happened while I was asleep?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. That's why the girls are at the hospital. Only Katsuragi and Ikaruga had major injuries, but... that's not the worst part. The master scroll was stolen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! How?!\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiriya hesitated, but then he told you how Haruka used your body to not only attack for her, but used you to steal the scroll for them. You stared at Kiriya in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...you're kidding.... I...did all of that while I was asleep?!?!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I wouldn't exactly say asleep,\" said Kiriya. \"Someone had put something in your room to put you in an induced coma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we were attacked by those Hebijo girls again and that witch Haruka came back and used me to steal the master scroll!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiriya answered with a simple nod. You clenched your fists in anger. Then you ripped the covers off of you and got dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)! Where are you going?\" demanded Kiriya. \"I haven't finished telling you everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't answer. You left the base heading straight for the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you were there, you headed straight for the room where Katsuragi and Ikaruga were in. When you got there, a terrible sight awaited you. Katsuragi and Ikaruga were in their own separate beds covered in bandages and bruises. Both of them looked like they had fought in a war. Just by looking at them, a storm of emotions went through your body. Mostly anger and disgrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Godammit,\" you said to yourself clenching your fists tightly drawing a little blood. \"This is my fault. If I was awake. I would have seen this coming...and if it wasn't for me...they wouldn't have stolen the scroll...and none of them would have gotten hurt... It's all my fault... How could I let them do that to me? To my friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Katsuragi started to stir upon hearing your voice. She opened her eyes, but all she saw was an empty room with no one but Ikaruga next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird,\" she said. \"I thought I heard (name) just now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to her, you had jumped out an open window undetected and leapt into the darkness.<i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddammit,\" you said as you punched the bag harder and harder every time you cursed. \"Damn it... damn it, damn it, damn it, DAMN IT, DAMN IT, DAMN IT, DAMN IT!!!!!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cursed loudly punching the bag with all of your anger and strength. The bag was knocked off and it was sent flying and onto floor to the floor with a loud thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were panting hard taking out your anger on the punching bag a little tired, but you still felt angry at yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a disgrace...\" you said. \"I'm a disgrace to all ninja...a disgrace to my mother... I don't deserve to call myself a ninja.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not true!\" said a voice indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around and you saw....</i></i></span></div></div>",

Ninja where I trained before, they expected more! I take it back even, I failed, but you?!\", Hibari's face melted into a tearful look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou relented immediately, \"I'm sorry. I shouldn't judge. Look, I get that you want to help, but I just hated that I put up no defense against that technique, and out of all the kind I'm used to defending, mental attacks have always been my weakest to fight against. It just brought up a lot of frustration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok. Normally I get mad at myself for having others help me all the time. But it motivates me to do better.\", Hibari replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never have to worry, your too adorable to let anyone not try and take care of you.\", you patted her head making her head blush like a tomato. \"Uhh Hibari?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) called me adorable.

I didn't mean to say that so loud, or at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hibari I am flattered, but I don't feel that way for you.\" Hibari stood still and her body just started shaking, she didn't cry or scream she just rapidly spasmed out for a minute. \"Hibari I'm sorry but that doesn't mean that I hate you. Your sweet but your much too young for me. Someone else will snag you away.\", you said trying to cheer her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm only 16! You're 17!\", she yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I mean- WAIT?! How did you know how old I was?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We went- uh oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We? So you and who else went through my stuff?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nevermind. Forget I said anything. Including the liking you bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, Hibari you aren't young in terms of age, I meant you act too young. I don't mean that necessarily in a bad way. I prefer someone more mature. Someone is going to find your attitude much more attractive and will be great for you. That's all I meant by. So can we let this slide, and make sure you don't snoop through my stuff again.\", you reached out hoping she would accept the handshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I'm sorry for everything. I came here trying to cheer you up and ended up having you do it for me.\", she reciprocated it and you brought her in for a nice hug to boot. It may have been awkward but at least you two we better friends for it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In your own strange way, you succeeded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who else is in on peeping around my belongings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHibari face palmed.

I didn't know you were here,\" said Kiriya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well a black cat told me that there was trouble, so I came right over,\" said Hanz\u014d as he sat down in front of Kiriya. \"Now then why don't you tell me what's happened? Tell me everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiriya then explained what had happened to Hanz\u014d and he listened to every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. So that's what happened,\" said Hanz\u014d stroking his beard. \"The girls fought hard and they got overwhelmed by the Hebijo girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Kiriya. \"We'll have to assume that the Hebijo girls must gone through rigorous training to achieve that kind of strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have heard tales that the training at that school is so difficult that some of the students get injured, maybe even die,\" said Hanz\u014d. \"Although there haven't been any reports, so it could be just a rumor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... that could explain the overwhelming strength they had,\" said Kiriya. \"It's also no wonder why they were so strong and devious as they are. But... there's one thing I don't understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why were those girls after (name)? They already had the scroll so why bother to capture him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. You mean the boy. I remember his mom was one of the most greatest ninjas in the world today. It could be because he's her son and they could want him to serve as blackmail. That I don't know. One thing's for sure, that boy may be strong but...he needs to get stronger for the upcoming battles along with the girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that Hanz\u014d?\" asked Kiriya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiriya.

However that relief was bit short lived for soon after Kiriya told to get ready for the next part of their training. The most hellish kind of training you and the girls have ever experienced. You were curious as to what training it was, but at the same time you personally didn't care. Any kind of training was training. If it meant for you getting stronger, there was no kind of training you were willing to endure to get stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, Kiriya, and the girls left and soon came to a open forest that was far below from where you were all standing. In front of them stood a giant mountain that reached high up in the sky past the clouds. You and the girls eyes were wide with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap...\" you breathed. \"That's a pretty large mountain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiriya Sensei. You're not gonna make us climb that mountain are you?\" asked Asuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please tell me you're joking,\" said Katsuragi. \"What is this? An journey into uncharted territory where we could fall to our deaths?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not too far off the mark Katsuragi,\" said Kiriya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkaruga walked to the edge of the cliff looking down at the forest and then she suddenly gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute... I know what's going on here! This is part of the forbidden training isn't it Sensei?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're exactly right Ikaruga,\" said Kiriya smiling. \"A pretty good guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkaruga's face then paled in terror, a face that you or any of the girls have never seen before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap... We're so screwed!\" she cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? What makes you say that?\" asked Yagyu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard rumors of an ancient training that the ninja once did, but was eventually stopped due to how dangerous it was and even made it not required for students. And it was called...Hai-kin-gu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh....didn't you just say the same thing Ikaruga?\" asked Hibari who was a little confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me to explain Hibari,\" you said. \"Hai-kin-gu or crawling tense dread as it's called is one of the most severe forms of training for a shinobi. A training of survival and skill. Shinobi have to survive a deadly terrain like this one for approximately two days with only the bare essentials. After that, shinobi then have to carry out a mission with a specific purpose to strengthen their survival skills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... how do you know that (name)?\" asked Asuka. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I took this kind of training myself. Twice in fact,\" you replied. \"The first time I almost died. The second time I was close to dying, but I managed to make it through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the girls looked at you in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... I thought hiking was supposed to be fun and stuff!\" whimpered Asuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I'm scared! I don't wanna go!\" cried Hibari her eyes welling up in tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a scroll somewhere on top of the mountain over there,\" continued Kiriya. \"The first shinobi to get it will be the winner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's a competition now?\" asked Ikaruga a smirk working to her lips. \"Interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Sounds like a lot of fun,\" said Katsiragi pumping her fist. \"Let's do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But can't we just go on a normal hike instead?\" whimpered Hibari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Hibari,\" said Yagyu. \"There's nothing to worry about because I'll protect you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" said Asuka pumping herself up. \"Let's do this. I can do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right! Now we're talking!\" you said cracking your knuckles. \"It's been a while since I've had do life or death training. This'll be good for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually (name). You'll be staying behind,\" said Kiriya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Why?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be undergoing a different type of training,\" explained Kiriya. \"A training that's different, but just as difficult as the Hai-kin-gu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww come on Sensei! I want in on the action too!\" you complained. \"Sure it was dangerous and... I almost died both times, but it was good training for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough of your complaining,\" said Kiriya. \"Besides I don't want you help the girls considering the fact that you've done it twice. Now girls...ready..... go!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he said go, the girls disappeared into the air leaving you and Kiriya by yourselves. You were a little disappointed that you didn't get to go, but you felt a little relieved too. Kiriya then turned to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then... (name). Are you ready for your training?\" asked Kiriya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I'll do any form of training you ask Sensei,\" you said. \"Bring it on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" said Kiriya. \"You will be undergoing training from an instructor who I assigned to you. Wait here and your instructor will be here. Good luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Kiriya disappeared in a puff of smoke leaving you coughing from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez. Sometimes I hate it when he does that,\" you muttered. \"I wonder who my instructor will be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou answer came sooner than expected for just then...</span></div></div>",

That's who said that,\" said the voice. \"Now listen up kid. I'm only gonna say this one time so you better clear the gunk out of your ears and pay attention. Your objective in to go into that forest and head up the mountain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... just like the girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. However there's gonna be some illusions in the forest. They may not look real, but they pack a mean punch,\" said the voice. \"Your job is to hunt them down and defeat them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds simple enough,\" you said. \"Then what happens after I defeat them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I can't say,\" said the voice. \"You're just gonna have to find out for yourself. I should also add that you don't kill the illusions. You only need to defeat them. Nothing more and nothing less.

The wind was howling fiercely as she flew threatening to rip her off the kite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man! This already hard and we barely just started!\" she yelped. \"All right then! Time to get off! Ninja Art! Flying Squirrel Flight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kicked off away from the kite dive-bombing towards the forest below. Then using a drape as if she was a flying squirrel, she slowed down her fall heading towards the trees. Unfortunately that didn't help her with the landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap! Oh crap! Oh no!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka tried but she couldn't stop herself from smacking right into a branch. She wasn't hurt, but it was a bit of a comprising position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow... Well I guess that landing was bound to be rough. I wonder how everyone else is doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the cliffs, Ikaruga had just landed safely on the ground using the Flying Squirrel Technique. Although she was a long ways away from the mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man. I still have a long way to go,\" she said to herself. \"Oh well. I better stop complaining and get to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she set off heading towards the mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another part of the area, Katsuragi had landed somewhere where there was lots of snow and frost. Given the outfit she was wearing she would most likely be freezing, but not Katsuragi. This was nothing to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! This'll be a piece of cake!\" she said with confidence. \"Just watch! I'm gonna be the first to the top of that mountain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn yet another part of the forest, Hibari had just landed but not as gracefully as the others were. She had just dropped to the ground smack on her bum making her yelp in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow....that hurt!\" she whined. \"I really need to work on my landings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up and then looked towards the mountain. Then she looked at the forest before her. To her it looked really dark and spooky, but she quickly put that fear out of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't get scared. I gotta go forward! I'm gonna make it to the top and then make (name) and all the other girls proud!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then ran into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the river inside the forest, Yagyu using her umbrella like a surfboard was speeding along the river. However. she wasn't heading to the mountain like the others. She had a different objective in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to find Hibari before I do anything else,\" she said to herself. \"Now I wonder where she could be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with you, you were searching through the forest trying to find the illusions that you were instructed to find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez. What the heck is with this forest? It's more like a jungle rather than a forest,\" you said aloud. \"I wonder how I go about finding these illusions anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then as you walked past a tree, you sensed something in the trees. You instinctively threw a kunai up in the treetops, but all the kunai hit was the tree itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's there?! Come out!\" you called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one answered. Then suddenly something came shooting out of the darkness right at you. You branded your claws and deflected the blows. Then something came at you from the right and pierced right on your shoulder. You looked to find it was a needle. It didn't hurt you, but you couldn't help but feel a little irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Who's there! Come out you coward!\" you yelled. \"If you're one of those illusions then come out and face me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Typical. Someone attacks me and then they go hiding,\" you muttered. \"Maybe I can trace where the attacks came from. They shot out at me from the right, so maybe... this way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you ran off into some bushes where the needle came from. Then you saw it. One of the ninja illusions that you were supposed to defeat. It appeared to be some kind of person. The illusion appeared to be shadowy and you couldn't the person's face, but the illusion looked just like...</span></div></div>",

Time to give her a beat down she'll never forget.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mirai continued surfing down the river, you leapt up in the trees and followed close behind her in hot pursuit. You jumped from tree to tree until you caught up with her. You leaped from the trees and dive-bombed straight at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirai looked up in time to see you coming straight at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're mine!!!\" you screamed as lunged at her with the intent to take her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the-! (name)!?) cried MIrai. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brought your leg up and swung it straight down right at her. Your leg hit the umbrella causing a large explosion of water and Mirai to go flying out of the water. Mirai quickly opened her umbrella to ease her falling making her land safety on the ground. You leaped out of the water and then stood in front of her taking your stance to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name!) What are you doing?\" she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it look like I'm doing?\" you said. \"I'm gonna kick your ass. Prepare yourself illusion Mirai!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Illusion? Mirai? What are you talking about?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou responded by dashing straight at her and swung at her with your claw. Mirai using her umbrella quickly blocked the blow. You repeatedly swung and slashed at her using your claws and Mirai kept blocking every blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)! Snap out of it!\" she yelled. \"I'm not who you think I am! You're not thinking straight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough talk! Just shut up and fight!\" you yelled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swung at Mirai again and again until you finally knocked her umbrella out of the way. Then you swung around and gave her a powerful roundhouse kick to her gut. Mirai's eyes bulged as she had the wind knocked out of her. She held her stomach in pain trying to get her breathing back in order. You took advantage of this by swinging at her with your claws again. This time the attacks connected. Your claws ripped into Mirai's clothes tearing into them. Mirai tried to defend herself from the attacks, but she couldn't. You slashed and swung with your claws and then you finished your assault by crossing your arms and then dashing towards Mirai and attacking her in a blinding speed. You reappeared in front of her and there was silence. Then Mirai's clothes exploded and ripped and blood gushed out as she screamed in pain. She then fell to the ground defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's one down,\" you said to yourself. \"That was easier than I thought it would be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Mirai and inspected her. She was wincing in pain, her clothes were ripped, and she had cuts all over her oozing with blood from your assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. These are some pretty convincing illusions,\" you thought. \"It's almost as if they're real. Anyway, onto to the next illusion.\" You then straightened up and left Mirai lying there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Hibari was walking through the forest searching for anyone who she could find in the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man. I sure wish that I knew where everyone is right now,\" she said to herself. \"I wonder where they all are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she pushed past some bushes and then her eyes widened.

I feel like the wind is gonna blow me away,\" she said as she moved her hair away from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she heard a strange sound. The sound of hissing that was coming from her feet. Ikaruga looked down and immediately cringed in disgust and slight fear. There close to her feet was a large brown snake. It slowly wrapped itself around her leg and working it's way up to her body. Ikaruga would have broken free, but she didn't dare make a move in case the snake was poisonous and so she wouldn't fall off the ledge she was on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why,\" she thought. \"but I'm getting a vibe from the snake. Something bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snake was now at her hips. As it moved around, it flicked his tongue around Ikaruga's body tickling her. Ikaruga trembled trying to restrain herself from laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-stop it!\" she commanded trying to get the snake off of her. \"I mean it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snake didn't listen. It moved it's way to her chest and then flicked it's tongue on her breast. That was when Ikaruga had enough. She grabbed her sword and then quickly smacked the snake on it's head before it had a chance to react. The snake now feeling dazed lessened it's hold on her. Ikaruga then seized her chance to grab the snake by it's head and threw it off of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take that,\" she said feeling victorious. \"Now I can keep going so I can get that scroll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ikaruga continued carefully making her way across the ledge until eventually she had made it level ground. She then walked down the trail until she had entered the forest. She immediately felt the heat make her sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew it's hot, but I gotta keep going,\" she said to herself. \"Once it reaches nightfall, I'll sure to stop and take a break and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she stopped. She began to get a feeling in her chest. A feeling that an enemy was coming. She hovered her hand over her blade ready to draw it. A few tense seconds went by then suddenly... Ikaruga drew her sword and turned around behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's there?!

Ikaruga then deflected them all just barely. Taking advantage you took off one of the blades of your claws and flung it at her. Ikaruga tilted her head making the blade scrape across her cheek causing blood to drip out a little. Ikaruga looked back in time to see you right in front of her with another detatched blade from your claws and swung it straight at her. Ikaruga and you then were locked in a sword fight. Your blades clashed and clanged sending sparks. Until finally just when Ikaruga was attacking you, you stepped to the side dodging the blade and you swung your blade claw sending Hien into the air until it landed on the ground just behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... Hien!\" cried Ikaruga as she tried to reach for her blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she could, she felt a small prick on her thigh. She felt her leg to find the source of the pain to find that a needle was stuck to her. She pull it out and took one look at the needle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no... not again!\" she cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back at you to see that you had your tube in your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right evil ninja,\" you said. \"It's my special poison needle.

A giant polar bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?!?!\" cried Katusragi. \"I thought this was Japan not the Arctic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe polar bear growled at Katsuragi and stood up on it's rear paws thinking that she was invading in it's territory and then charged straight for her letting out a ferocious roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna go? Fine then!\" smirked Katsuragi. \"Time to boogie with the bear!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaped up above the bear avoiding it's charge then gave it a sharp kick to it's back causing the bear to stumble on to it's face on the snowy floor. The bear got back up and then charged towards Katsuragi again, but then Katsuragi side stepped and glomped onto the the bears back and wrapped her legs and her arms around the giant's neck putting it a large headlock. The bear struggled and bucked trying to knock her off it's back, but Katsuragi kept a firm hold not letting go squeezing tighter. The polar bear was soon running out of air and getting weaker by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" smirked Katsuragi. \"Giving up already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast gave a weak grunt practically saying that it gave up as Katsuragi finally let go and the bear fell to the ground defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let that be a lesson to all bears who decide to pick a fight with Hanzo Academy's number one shinobi!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen feeling cold from another chilly breeze, Katsuragi couldn't help but let out a small sneeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez! It's freaking cold out here!\" she shivered. \"I better transform into warmer clothes before I freeze to death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the power of the Shinobi Transformation, Katsuragi quickly changed her clothes. Although it wasn't what she expected. She was now wearing a body suit of a sumo wrestler. Not only that, but it was also very heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the.... heck is this?\" she wondered. Then she shrugged. \"Oh well. As long as it keeps me warm who cares? In the meantime... I better get to the top before anyone else does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatsuragi then started walking with the suit heavily weighing her down. Then suddenly she saw something else. In the howling winds with the blowing snow, something stood in front of her a few feet away. A strange shadowy figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the... who is that?\" wondered Katsuragi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure stood there as if it was watching Katsuragi then it went straight for Katsuragi making a mad dash toward her. Before Katsuragi had a chance to react the figure attacked her by zipping right by her causing her to stumble and almost fall but she managed to stay up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What the hell?! Show yourself!\" Katsuragi yelled. \"If you're looking to pick a fight, then I'll give you one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine with me,\" said a voice. \"I've been looking for a fight. Especially with you Hikage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the crap? Hikage? What are you talking-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Katsuragi could react, the figure attacked again knocking Katsuragi back and tearing her sumo outfit lightly. Katsuragi then suddenly realized something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute... I recognize this! This is what (name) did back from before!\" she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)! Is that you?!\" she called. \"If it is then why are you attacking me?! And why do you think I'm Hikage?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's something that you don't need to know,\" you said seeming to come from all around her. \"After all you're going to be defeated right here and now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you dashed back and forth attacking Katsuragi with your claws. Katsuragi tried to fight back, but due to her weighted sumo outfit, she couldn't do much of anything. Her outfit also kept getting ripped open with gashes due to your claws. At the this rate, her outfit would be gone and she would be wide open to the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta turn back and try to fight back,\" she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just about to, but then you attacked again right at her leg. The blow didn't hurt her due to her outfit, but it caused to stumble. She tried to regain her balance, but she couldn't. She fell over and then started to roll down the slope. As she rolled, snow began to stick to her and then she started to turn into a giant snowball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.... what the... aw crap! Somebody stop me!\" she cried as she rolled down the snowy slope out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched a little surprised as to what had happened to Katsuragi, but then you put it out of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least that's one more down,\" you said to yourself. \"That makes three. And considering the fact that there have been nothing, but those evil ninja girls from before, there should be two left. That swordswoman that Asuka fought and that Haruka girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clenched your fists the moment you remembered Haruka. You wanted nothing more than to get back at her for what she did to you and the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just you wait Haruka....\" you growled under your breath. \"You may be an illusion in this trial... but I'm coming for you....\"</span></div></div>",

The temperature had risen higher and things were starting to get very hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew... is the place really Japan?\" wondered Asuka as she wiped her brow. \"It's so hot I feel like I'm melting... even my boobs feel hot. Better give them a little air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then took off her scarf and loosened her necktie and opened her shirt using it to fan her chest to try and cool herself off. Just then, she felt something strange land on her left breast. When she looked at what it was, her eyes went wide for on top of her breast was a leech. Then dozens of leeches started to rain down on her. As she was covered in leeches and as well as feeling disgusted and freaked out by the number, Asuka took off running screaming in terror. She kept running until she came across a stream and immediately went straight for it. She took off her shirt and and her sweater vest and dove straight into the water. When she resurfaced from the water all the leeches had come off her body floating helpless in the water. Asuka felt relieved, but that was quickly short lived. For right then, something rose out of the water lifting her up and wrapped around her body with it's tail. It appeared to be a giant eel with whiskers like a cat fish. Asuka didn't even have a clue what this creature was, but she wasn't about to lose to the thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what the heck you are, but you're going down!\" she cried as she smacked the creature with her sword still in it's sheath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature groaned in pain as he let go of Asuka and disappeared into the water. Asuka felt a little sorry for it, but she quickly put it out of her mind and swam back to shore. When she made it out of the water, she groaned in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez... my clothes are all wet now. At least I was able to get those leeches off. I'll just dry off and then continue on towards the-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly she heard something rustling in the bushes. She immediately put her guard up and had her hand hovering just above her ninjat\u014d ready to strike. Then she heard a pair of familiar voice from inside the bushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling any better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Hibari... I'll be fine with a little bit more rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka knew who those voices belonged to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hibari? Yagy\u016b? Is it really you two? she called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Hibari and Yagy\u016b stepped out from behind the bushes Hibari carrying Yagy\u016b. Asuka was surprised to see the two in such a state especially Yagy\u016b.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asuka it's you!\" said Hibari with relief. \"Thank goodness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hibari?! Yagy\u016b?! What happened to you guys? And why is Yagy\u016b beat up like this?!\" cried Asuka as she rushed to their side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was (name)...\" said Yagy\u016b. \"For some reason he attacked me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! (name) did this?!\" exclaimed Asuka. \"But why? Why would (name) do something like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yagy\u016b said that it was because (name) thought that she was one of the evil ninja,\" said Hibari. \"Although she doesn't know why. Maybe we got poisoned or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but this could be a problem,\" said Asuka. \"If (name) has been poisoned and is seeing things, then there's a possibility that he could come after us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Please tell me you're joking!\" whimpered Hibari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as I hate to say it, but I think Asuka's right,\" said Yagy\u016b. \"(name) will most definitely come after us and to add to that he's an experienced ninja. I'm afraid it's only a matter of time before he finds us and I don't know if we can put up much of a fight against him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we gotta get moving before that happens,\" said Asuka. \"And we better find Katsuragi and Ikaruga too. Those two are practically by themselves and if (name) finds them... I don't even wanna think about it. Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then helped Hibari carry Yagy\u016b and were just about to start walking when suddenly...</span></div></div>",

It's (name)!\" said Yagy\u016b.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what do you know,\" you said as you straightened up. \"Looks like I found the rest of you.\" You glared at Hibari. \"I've especially been looking forward to finding you, Haruka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHibari cringed a little seeing the hatred for Haruka on your face. Yagy\u016b wanted to protect her, but she still haven't fully recovered. Asuka then stepped in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name) what are you doing attacking us like this?!\" she demanded. \"Don't you know that you're attacking your own friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet Homura!\" you snapped. \"You can try to talk this out all you want, but I'm still gonna take you and Haruka out. No need to take out Mirai since I already beat her anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to us (name)!\" cried Hibari. \"We're not who you think we are! It's us! Asuka, Hibari, and Yagy\u016b!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not gonna fall for your tricks Haruka!\" you said. \"You may have been able to get me the first two times around, but you won't get me a third time! I'm especially gonna enjoy beating you up as payback for what you did! Even if you are an illusion!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou readied your claws and prepared to attack and Asuka readied her twin swords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hibari! Get Yagy\u016b to safety and run!\" she cried. \"I'll try to hold him off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Asuka! I can't!\" said Hibari. \"(name)'s way too strong for you to fight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter!\" yelled Asuka. \"Just run!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka then dashed straight to you and swiped with her sword, but you blocked the attack making the collision of metal ring throughout the area. You and Asuka clashed with swords and claws and it seemed that both of you were evenly matched, but then you were able to knee Asuka in the stomach knocking the wind out of her. She held her stomach in pain coughing trying to get her breath, but you then gave her a sharp kick to her cheek sending her flying into the air and sprawling to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Asuka!\" cried Yagy\u016b.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then turned to Hibari and Yagy\u016b. \"Don't worry. You are next!\" you growled as he ran straight to the two of them. Yagy\u016b immediately got in front of Hibari to try and protect her, but you knocked her out of the way with another kick sending her slamming into a tree knocking her out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Outta the way Mirai,\" you said. \"I already beat you, so you stay out of the way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yagy\u016b no!\" cried Hibari. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then saw you walking towards her cracking your knuckles. \"You should be more concerned about yourself,\" you said. \"And trust me, you better be concerned because even though your an illusion Haruka, when I'm done with you you're gonna wish you never laid eyes on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHibari trembled feeling very frightened. She didn't know what to do. She knew she had to fight you, but she was scared of hurting you. But then, Hibari remembered when she cheered you up back when you were upset. That made her pluck up courage and put up her fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry (name)... I know you're not thinking straight, but I'm gonna try and set you straight!\" she said determined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirked branding your claws. \"That's just the way I like it,\" you said. \"Hope you're ready for a beat down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHibari then dashed forward and attacked with a flurry of punches, but you parried each one with ease. She then tried to kick you, but you caught her foot and threw it away causing Hibari to stumble. Seeing an opening, you then gave Hibari a punch to her stomach making her gasp in pain. Hibari held on to her stomach feeling the wind being knocked out of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Haruka, is that the best you got?\" you asked. \"If it is, then I'm very disappointed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)! I'm not Haruka!\" said Hibari. \"It's me Hibari! You have to to snap out of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring her plea, you then attacked again slashing Hibari with your claws. They tore through her clothes as well as her skin making her yelp in pain. You slashed and attacked Hibari until her clothes were in tatters and her skin was littered in bruises and cuts. Hibari was in pain and could hardly stand, but she still stood bravely before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)... please... you have to wake up...\" she said weakly. \"please... wake up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou answered by slowly walking up to her and gave her one more punch to her gut and punched her right in the cheek making her fall to the ground unconscious. You walked up to her and then stepped on her stomach like a hunter killing its prey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that makes five,\" you said. \"Now that I took out all of the fakes, it's time for me to head up the mountain. Too bad the girls aren't here to see me kick as and get some payback.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then after taking one last look at Hibari who you thought was Haruka, you walked away heading towards the mountain.</span></div></div>",

You have a genetic power that allows you to manipulate and neutralize a field created by an alien race called Novas. Your a rare and special case as the source of your power called \"Stigmata\" had suffered a rare genetic disorder making your powers exceptionally limited compared to other limiters. You have already gone to an academy that honed your skills and had a partner called a \"Pandora\". But due to a recent attack from a Nova your partner died. Many speculate the cause of he death was due to your flawed stigmata forcing you to return to the academy. Your return is expected to be less than welcoming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got off the bus dropping you off and you saw the campus for the first time in a year and a half. The memories of your first couple years came rushing back as you walked through the grounds again. It was lucky that nobody knew who you were on sight, but still you couldn't help but feel judged. Sooner or later, the whole school would know about me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dropped off your belongings in your old room. Convenient being placed in your old one from your previous years. Your first class wouldn't be until tomorrow so you thought for today you'd go around and see who the top students are this time. \"Hmm?\", looking out from your window you could see a sparring match with a young blonde woman against another student. You shut your window and lifted the blinds, \"This won't be like last time.\", you said to yourself. Walking out your door you made your way to where the action was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were making your way to the match you noticed in the courtyard a dark skinned woman, with short white hair, eating a burger along with two other girls. One who was shorter than the rest with white hair but curly loops on her sides and a tall red-head with a pony tail. They all seemed to be socializing but then the pony-tailed one noticed you and called you over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey! You!\", she called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wishing to be rude you went over to see what she wanted. \"Yes? May I help you?\", you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look very familiar do I know you from somewhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course someone who went here long enough to have noticed you but still be taking classes would spot you eventually. But from her choice of words she may not know who you are. Not yet at least. Probably the best thing would be to lie, but honesty is always honored among friends. Assuming these people are going to be your friends.</span></div></div>",

She looked at you up and down and all around trying to figure out where she saw you. Then the girl with white hair and curly loops spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl with white hair: What's wrong Arnett? This boy interest you for some reason?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl with red hair: Shut up Attia. I'm just trying to figure out who this boy is. I swear I could've sworn I seen of him before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I'm sorry but again you must have me confused with someone else. Sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark skinned girl: Hey.

I'm trying to figure out who he is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia: Well that's a first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark skinned girl got up from her seat and came up to you.

But then you out that feeling out of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Hey there. My name's Creo Brand. You already met my friends. The one who was looking at you was Arnett McMillan and the short girl over there is Attia Simmons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia: Hey!

Well (name) it's a pleasure to meet you too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Creo smiled at you, you couldn't help but look away. Then you heard the sound of something metal clashing. It was coming from the training grounds. You almost forgotten that you were trying to get to the fighting area to watch the fight. You figured it was time to end the conversation before you missed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Listen. Sorry, but I have to go. There's something.....I need to do. Bye!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you ran off. Attia, Arnett, and Creo watched in curiosity as you ran toward the grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia: Well. He certainly seemed like an interesting boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: Yeah. Hmm. I wish I knew where I saw that kid. I get the feeling that I've heard of him before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia: He's a first year perhaps?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: He definitely isn't a first year. That's for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: How could you tell?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: I can tell just by looking at him. He's probably a second year at the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: Wow Creo.

She was covered in scratches and blood and her clothes were in tatters. She was Ganessa Roland. A second year fighting the blond girl you saw earlier, but you didn't know this yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGanessa: Damn it. No fair! What's the point in getting stronger if she's gonna get stronger too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked in front of her to see that a young boy with two girls staring at her. They were Kazuya Aoi, Chiffon Fairchild, and Ticy Phenyl. Ganessa blushed and defensively covered herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGanessa: Hey! What are you looking at you perv?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoung boy: Um....sorry ma'am nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen another young woman leaped from the window and landed between them. She was the blond haired woman you saw before who was Satellizer El Bridget. She was tall and practically had not a single scratch on her. As soon as the two saw each other the boy rushed forward toward the blonde girl and hugged her from behind causing both of them to fall to the floor in a very awkward position. Everyone who was watching the scene gaped in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiffon: Oh crap! Why did he have to grab her of all people?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTicy: Oh no! Kazuya!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were expecting Satellia to fly off the handle and kill him, but she had a different reaction that puzzled them. Kaguya who was now burying his face in her breasts crying made Satellia blush with a frightened look on her face and she was trying to push her skirt down so her panties and her garter belt wouldn't show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiffon: Wait a minute. Why is she acting all cutesy and shy all of a sudden?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTicy: I know. Weird right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: I missed you so much! Don't ever leave me again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer: No....please! Let me go! Stop it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: No! Never!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a grid like pattern spread itself around them making Satellizer unable to move. When you saw it, you immediately knew what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: What the crap?!? A freezing area?! How is that possible? Is that kid causing it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you saw Ganessa who was almost forgotten in the sidelines. She jumped up and unleashed chains with spikes that came from her back and went for the kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey! Look out!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGanessa: This fight isn't over yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen what happened next made you freeze in horror. Ganessa's attack connected and the scene was died in red. As soon as you saw the blood, a vision or your memories flashed in your mind. You were next to your partner holding her in your arms. She was covered in blood and she was on the brink of death. You were crying and kept saying sorry over and over again. Your partner said nothing. The only thing that she did was smile at you. Then she passed on in your arms. You seeing your partner die screamed in despair. You couldn't bear to see this scene anymore so you ran. Chiffon hearing your footsteps looked in time to see you run away. At first she was going to call out to you to stop you, but taking care of Kazuya came first. Meanwhile you kept running. You didn't care where you went or how long you had to run. You just wanted to get away from the scene that had just transpired as soon as possible. Soon you stopped running and took a breather. You didn't know where you were but you didn't care. You were too freaked about having that vision of what happened to you and your partner in the past. You clenched your fist and punched the wall in anger and despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Damn it! Why?! Why are those memories coming into my head right now?! Why now?!? Why now of all times?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly the only thing that answered you was a small echo of your voice. Then.....</span></div></div>",

Your just an interesting guy and we wanna be your friends. If sparking our curiosity didn't do it, then that joke certainly sealed the deal.\", Arnett explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was both flattering and heartwarming to see people positively gravitating to you. They took you to a bench outside and all gathered around wanting to know what got you so angry and upset. \"OK so now that your in a more calmer setting you feel like talking about it?\", Arnett asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost wanted to, but you couldn't. Them knowing about your past would be difficult enough, but wanting to remember it was impossible for you. But you needed to tell them something. They're opening up to you by showing such compassion, the least you can do is provide an answer. \"It....upstairs someone named Satilizer was frozen in place during a sparring match.

How'd she lose?!\", Arnett asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some guy just grabbed her and she was all timid and shy and then her opponent just froze her in place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait some random guy touched her? Anyone who ever touched her, even accidentally got the piss beaten out of them.

We switched it from (Name's) issues to someone else.\", Creo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh c'mon he can shrug it off this is more important! I'm going to get the details about this!\", she said running off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attia! Ugh, she can be so inconsiderate at times. Hey (Name) are you feeling better?\", Arnett asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll just get some rest in my room and I'll be back in order. And thanks, it's great to know I got you friends like you.\", you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, that's sweet.\", Arnett said with her and Creo blushing lightly at your compliment. Arnett was about to hug you but being so close to her made you uncomfortable. It triggered another flashback of your partner, the memory was the two of you hugging and seeing Arnett about to do the same thing made you terrified. You immediately went to your room without saying anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett and Creo were confused. \"You think he might be related to Satilizer?\", Creo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is defiantly something he's not sharing with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give him time he'll open up. But what was that anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\", Arnett wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't show that sort of affection to people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know he was just sweet and...never mind Creo let's go. Attia's probably expecting us to be right behind her right now.\", Arnett blushed more and not cleverly dodging the question. Creo smiled knowing Arnett had a little crush on you. But truth be told she was a little touched by your compliment too.</span></div></div>",

People were surrounded by map giving updates on the pandoras and the carnival which you had just witnessed the final moments of. Above them were three colonels who were watching the fight on screen along with a young woman wearing religious attire. (Sister Margaret) They had just witnessed everything that had transpired and the colonels were surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman: Satellizer El Bridget was caught in a freezing area. Origin unknown......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColonel 1: Does this mean that her opponents limiter was fighting too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColonel 2: That couldn't be possible. The carnival was made to be a battle between equals. Not to mention using a limiter would be against the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen from a camera near the scene a picture of an unconscious Satellizer with an unconscious Kazuya in her arms appeared on the screen. Chiffon and Ticy were also in the picture along with Ganessa standing in triumph and you in the back watching and then running. The camera zoomed in on Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColonel 3: There's the culprit. But why would he interrupt the fight? Is he a limiter protecting his partner?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman: Negative sir. He's not a student in this academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColonel 2: But he's wearing the uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister Margaret: I see. It's you Kazuya Aoi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the second Colonel squinted his eyes as if he was double checking what he was watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColonel 2: Wait, go back a second. And zoom in at that boy in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera zoomed in to where you were and soon your face was on the screen. When the colonels saw you, they all had looks of surprise and concern on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColonel 1: That boy. Is he.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColonel 3: Yes. There's no mistake. That's the boy who was involved in that incident that happened a year and a half ago. (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColonel 2: But.....what is he doing here? I thought he was sent back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColonel 1: Sister Margaret. Do you know anything about this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister Margaret was silent. Then she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister Margaret: Yes. I had him transferred here in the hopes of being a fine limiter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColonel 3: Why would you do that? We all know that it is virtually impossible for that boy to become a decent limiter. You are aware of his condition right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColonel 1: His condition was the cause of death of a pandora. One of our most strongest assets no less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister Margaret: Yes. I am aware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColonel 2: So why then? He is a danger to himself as well as the entire academy. He should be sent back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister Margaret: What you see as a danger, I see as a glimmer of hope. That is all I can say at the moment. For now, he is attending this academy. Do not worry. I will keep a watchful eye on him. Until then, he'll stays. Now I must go. I have business to attend to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Sister Margaret left leaving the colonels with worried looks on their faces. She walked out of the room and headed to her office. When she got into her office she sat down on the chair behind her desk and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister Margaret thinking: You may gone through a terrible ordeal (name), but I feel confident that you will be fine. You just need some time to heal and a partner. A partner that you can count on and trust. A partner that has the power to end your pain. I only pray that you will find that partner soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile back in your room, you were lying down on your bed staring up at the ceiling. You were feeling a little bad for pushing Arnett away when she was trying to hug you. But you felt it was for the best. After all, you were still feeling a little scared after what had happened. The memories of you and your partner that you had tried to forget were now flashing in your mind for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Damn it. Why are all of my memories coming back right now? I promised myself that I'd forget about all that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled to your side and looked at your desk and saw a photo. It was a photo of you and your partner smiling and being together. You got up from your bed and walked over to your desk. You picked up the photo and looked at it. Just looking at it made you feel even badder about what happened. You turned away and placed the photo face down so you wouldn't look it anymore. Then looked out your window. The sun was beginning to set and the sky was painted in a deep orange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: I'm surprised that no one's recognized me yet. But then again I can't be too sure. I can't afford to let anyone find out about my condition or what happened. Because if they do, they'll call me useless or some kind of murderer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you walked back to your bed and plopped down on the bed lying face down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I never want to go through that again. I'll never be someone's partner or have a relationship. Never again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen.....</span></div></div>",

I'm sorry.\", she apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be. I've got issues.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't peg me for someone who has issues.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you shouldn't judge people so intently until you've properly gotten to know them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True enough. But honestly I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be, again not your fault. It's....don't tell Creo or Attia. Especially not Attia. I've had some problems with getting close to someone. And I'm taking my time and trying my best recover. So whether or not your just being flirtatious, all the physical affection you want to give out needs to be off limits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, fine I guess. I'll accept your wishes. But who said that hug wasn't meant to be flirting? Maybe I got a massive crush on you and want you as my limiter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when she said that you recalled the painful memories again however this time you diffused the unintended tension with a calmer attitude. \"When i do decide to pick a pandora, I am making it strictly a professional partnership. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH! Jeez look at me, making you uncomfortable twice in one day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, guess your excellent at pushing my buttons. I guess being your limiter would never work after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehhahahahaha. Well anyway me and Creo will be having sparring matches for the next couple weeks. Attia has had hers already but maybe if you have time to catch them, Creo and me would appreciate you being there.

And Creo's too of course.\", you replied trying not to let your issues get in the way again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she'll be glad to hear that. Any way see ya, talk to you tomorrow then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett left waving goodbye relieving some of the stress you had mount up earlier today. You went to the desk and turned over the picture and looked for a second. You tried looking for a bit longer but the pain was still fresh.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day, you got up to another new day. You got dressed and got ready your first day in class. You were looking forward to seeing Attia and Creo in their sparring matches later on today, but at the same time you were feeling a little nervous because you were hoping that no one would recognize or know who you were in class. You fixed your uniform and prepared to leave for class. You were about to leave, but then you looked back. You saw the photo of you and your partner lying face down on your desk. You sighed and you walked out of your room trying to get the pain out of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: I can't think about that right now. I have to at least try to be a little more positive about things. Until then, time to get to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you set off for class. A little later class was about to begin and you took your seat. Your class was a mix between second years and first years. It was arranged that way because so the first years can learn a few things from the second years. Not to mention it was a great way to get two people together for partnership. Everyone was abuzz and talking about the latest news as well as the carnival. As you walked toward your seat, you couldn't help but overhear what some of the students were talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy 1: Hey. Did you guys hear about what happened that the second year's carnival?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl 1: Yes. I heard! The untouchable queen Satellizer El Bridget was defeated by Ganessa Roland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl 2: No way! You're joking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy 1: I wish I was, but it's true! I saw it on the TV this morning!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy 2: Man. She must have been a powerful pandora to take down someone like Satellizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): More like a dirty coward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust remembering what happened the other day made you annoyed. You scoffed hearing this conversation and took your seat. Then a young woman stepped into the class room. She had short brown hair that extended to her neck. She was very slim, curvy and very young for her age. She was wearing a pale blue shirt with long sleeves with a tie matching her navy blue skirt. She was Yu-Mi Kim. She used to be a pandora who fought in the eighth nova clash, but now she serves as a teacher in the academy. Everyone immediately took their seats and gave her their utmost attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu-Mi:  Alright everyone. Today we have a new student in our class today. I expect you all to give him a big welcome and to treat him with the utmost respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a boy entered the room. As soon as you saw him, you immediately recognized him. It was Kazuya the boy who you saw interfere with Satellizer's fight the other day. Then another vision entered your mind. You were seeing your partner for the first time in your class. When you first saw her, it was love at first sight. You couldn't help but stare at her. Then she saw you. When she did, she gave you a friendly smile. You shook your head trying to snap out of your vision. Kazuya politely bowed and introduced himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: Hello. I'm Kazuya Aoi. It's really nice to meet you all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a young girl with short brownish red hair gasped in surprise as if she had seen him before. She was Kaho Hiiragi, a first year student and the class rep. When Yu-Mi caught her outburst she teased her a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu-Mi: What's is it Ms. Hiiragi? Something caught your eye?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaho: No! It's nothing like that ma'am!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu-Mi: Calm down I was joking. (laugh) In any case, you can take a seat in any desk that's available Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: Ma'am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kazuya went to take his seat. As he walked past a couple of girls, they giggled and went on about how cute he looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl 1: Oh wow. He's so cute!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl 2: Yeah! He's just my type!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl 3: Hey Kaho. He's certainly got your attention am I right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaho: Oh be quiet. That's how rumors get started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kazuya sat down in an empty seat two seats away form you from the side.When you saw him, you couldn't help but recall the past events that triggered your memories to resurface. Not to mention you were trying to figure out who this boy was and how he did what he did when he froze Satellizer. Just thinking about it for some reason made you annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Damn it. I don't know why, but every time I look at this guy he annoys the hell out of me. Not to mention I'm still trying to figure out how the heck he was able to use a freezing area without an ereinbar set. Damn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kazuya looked at you as if he felt that you were staring at him. Both of you stared at each other for about a few seconds. Then Kazuya smiled and waved at you trying to be friendly. You looked away and just ignored him. Class went by pretty quickly and it was soon lunchtime. The cafeteria was abuzz with chatting and the smell of food filled the air. What was great about the cafeteria in the academies was the different foods available and it was all you can eat. Everyone was in groups eating their lunch either chatting about the news or watching the TVs. You were sitting alone by yourself eating your lunch ignoring the noise of bustling students. You didn't like being alone, but you were used to it by now. Besides the only people that you ever talked to was Attia, Arnett, and Creo and they were no where to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: They're probably getting ready for their sparring matches. I wonder if they're at the training field for their sparring matches. Well. Might as well go find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finished your lunch and were just about to leave for the training area when....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You finished your lunch and were just about to leave for the training area when Kazuya along with Kaho and another boy named Arthur walked up to you. When you saw them, you instinctively looked away and pretended not to notice them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: Um..excuse me. You're from our class right? I couldn't help, but notice that you look a little lonely being by yourself. I'm Kazuya Aoi. It's nice to meet you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said nothing. You simply got up and walked away. You knew that it was a little mean to just ignore Kazuya like that, but you felt that it was for his own good. After all you didn't want to stand out. As you walked away, you heard Kaho and Arthur talk to Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaho: What the heck is his problem?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaho: Talk about rude. Why did you try to talk to that guy anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur: Yeah. He doesn't exactly look like the type that wants to make friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: I... don't know. I guess... I just hate seeing the guy looking alone like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust hearing Kazuya say that made you feel even more annoyed. You walked briskly away trying to get away as soon as possible. Then the whole cafeteria went quiet. Nothing could be heard except for hushed whispers and murmurs. The reason was Satellizer. When everyone saw her, they either looked or ran away in fear. Satellizer paid no attention. She simply walked to the Burger Queen stand bought three bags worth of burgers and walked away. Needless to say, you were a little puzzled by everyone's behavior. Not to mention you seemed to be the only one who wasn't frightened by Satellizer's appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: So that's Satellizer huh? I wonder why everyone's so afraid of her. She's not that scary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya seeing Satellizer walked up to her and grabbed her wrist. Everyone gasped in shock seeing Kazuya's actions and they expected the worst like Satellizer killing him or something, but the exact opposite happened. Satellizer blushed and pulled her hand away which caused her to drop her bags of food. Then she briskly walked away. As she was walking away, she wracked her mind trying to figure out the feeling she had when Kazuya touched her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer thinking: He touched me. He touched me, but I didn't feel that horrible sensation. Why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she noticed that someone was right by the exit of the cafeteria staring at her. You. When you and her locked eyes, Satellizer had a look of surprise and a bit of a scowl at the same time. You stared at her back not wanting to stand to no nonsense in case Satellizer was wanting to start something. The whole lunch room went deathly quiet. It was so quiet that you could cut the tension with a knife. Then finally you spoke breaking the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Can I help you with something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer was silent for a moment and then her scowl changed into a look of as if she knew something that you didn't. She studied you carefully and then she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer: It's you. You're that boy from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that made your heart jump. Not to mention the cafeteria erupted in whispers and murmurs again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl 1: No way! Does Satellizer know that guy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy 1: She must know him! After all she said it herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy 2: Yeah, but who is that guy? I've never seen him before until today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl 2: Maybe he's a transfer student or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Oh crap. This is the exact opposite of what I wanted. Now everyone's trying to figure out who I am. I better end this conversation before it takes a wrong turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) aloud: Listen. I don't know where you think you saw me, but all I can tell you is that you got me confused with someone else. Now if you don't mind, I got somewhere to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you turned around and walked away to the training area. As soon as you left, Satellizer watched you leave never taking her eyes of you. Then she left after you along with Kazuya who chased after her after picking up her burgers. Needless to say everyone was shocked as to what has just happened. Not only were you completely unfazed by Satellizer but you had the gall to talk to her too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy 3: Oh man! You saw that right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl 3: Yeah! That guy just totally talked to Satellizer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl 4: No one's ever talked to Satellizer like that before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy 4: I don't know if I should call him brave or call him crazy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile back to you, you were headed to the training area to see Arnett and Creo's matches. Hopefully you were able to make it before the matches were over. You walked down a corridor and came to a room with big doors. You walked through them and were welcomed to the sight of the training area. A sight you knew too well. The room was black with green lines all around it and as big as a small football field which was split into two sides. Here is where the pandora train to fight simulated matches on fighting nova to prepare them to fight the real thing or have spatting matches to train to see where they against other pandora. On one side was the simulator that simulated nova and on the other side was the simulator that simulated battlegrounds for the pandora to fight in. Pandora were clashing left and right either fighting nova or sparring with each other. You looked around trying to find Arnett or Creo, but the room was filled with mostly third years and their limiters so it was hard to find them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Man. Where could they be? I didn't think the training area would be this popular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(voice): Well. I didn't expect to see you here Mr. (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around and you see.....</span></div></div>",

We had high hopes for the both of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because of this damn system and your poor judgement she died that day. Not because of me, no YOU got her killed. So help me don't ever let me find you again or I won't be held responsible for what I'm going to do.\", you threatened letting her go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if you could back up that threat were always keeping track of our most promising assets. Even special cases like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Send my regards to the bureaucrats not getting their hands dirty in this damn war.\", you walked away. \"First that Satilizer girl, now Sister Margaret. My secret won't be safe much longer. How did Satilizer know me? I never saw her before. Hmm, there's defiantly something she knows. Ugh, never-mind came here to enjoy myself, not get worked up.\", you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some extensive looking around but you managed to find Arnett and Creo. They were in the audience seats watching other matches. Creo flagged you down and you sat in between the two. Certainly flipped over your mood. \"Glad you came, I'll be going in 9 minutes to get ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome, worried I missed your match.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuum...(Name) want one of my soft pretzel nuggets. They are REALLY good.\", Arnett asked blushing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you, sure.\", she took one from her tray and fed you one, you took a bite and couldn't believe how right she was. \"Oh my god this is amazing.\", you reacted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here try it with mustard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eww want me to gag I hate mustard.\", you replied. Creo laughed lightly but Arnett felt a bit hurt. You immediately apologized not intending to be rude. \"Sorry I was just exaggerating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! My bad, uh want another plain one then?\", she asked holding another one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I refuse such a kind offer.\", you answered. She fed you another and you ate it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) get up and cheer! They just took down a S-class Nova simulation! C'mon get up and roar!\", Arnett said. She got up and cheered but honestly you'd prefer to just sit and watch. You instead clapped for the winners and relaxed in your seat. Creo was with you on that and did the same. You started to forget that the point was to find a pandora that would suit you without any emotional ties. But Arnett and Creo seemed to make you stay in the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross from the arena Sister Margaret saw you with Arnett noticing your positive behavior with her. \"Hmm? I think we may have found our replacement.\", she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time for Arnett to leave and get ready to her small reluctance, \"I'm going up soon. You'll see me in the arena, wish me luck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck out there.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't let them rip your shirt again exposing your assets.\", Creo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny Creo but thanks.\", she left to her station with you alone with Creo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how long have you know each other?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just about all 3 years. You've seen her when she's nice, nicer than normal when she sees you even. But when she's fighting...\", she hinted she'd be alot more different out in the arena. But you had no idea what she'd be like. \"Now answer me a question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your a second year right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come you came back for a remedial course? No first years does this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Held back because of an illness, I'm technically finish my first year but taking second year classes in conjunction.\", you lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\", Creo responded. She thought it was a decent excuse but still something clicked in her saying it wasn't the full story. \"Y'know Arnett has a crush on you right?\", she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not thick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why are you looking for a pandora who you don't even know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same reason why everyone does I guess.\", you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now lemme ask you something, you and Arnett have any limiters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet.

It was about as long as her height and double-headed with one of the blades being longer than the other. At first you were awed by Arnett's volt weapon, but then you noticed something. Arnett had a whole different look on her face. She had a look of complete pleasure and sadism on her face. She looked a lion licking it's chops before pouncing on her prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: Now then....let's have some fun shall we? I swear when I get a hold of this cute little thing I can't control myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Angelia went on the attack. She brought down her swords and slashed at Anrett with her all her strength, but Arnett somehow disappeared and reappeared behind her. Angelia tried again, but the same thing happened. Then she used acceleration to try to get behind Arnett and get her in a sneak attack. Sadly it would fail for simply used her scythe to defend herself. The metal colliding made a loud clang that echoed throughout the area. Angelia gaped in shock while Arnett looked up with a bored look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: Oh come on. I would have at least hoped to get a decent fight from you. How boring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelia: It's not over yet! Don't underestimate me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelia went on the attack again trying to at least score a hit on Arnett, but every attack either missed or was deflected. To make matter worse for Angelia, she was getting tired. Her moves were getting more and more slower. Just when she was about to attack her again, Arnett made her move. With a twisted smile on her face she dodged it again, but this time she attacked. She dodged the attack and appeared in front Angelia with an acceleration that had so much speed, you didn't even see her move. Then she gave her scythe a mighty swing and slashed her at her. Blood gushed out from Angelia's wound while she screamed in pain as her skin as well as her clothes were ripped. Arnett only smiled and she licked the end of her scythe tasting the fresh blood on the blade. This sight made you get chills down your spine and little nauseous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: Well, well. Looks like I may be able to have some fun with you after all. Come on! Play with me! Let's play some more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What the crap?! What's gotten into Arnett? She's become a completely different person now. Not to mention she's super fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: That's how she is. Normally she's like any other girl. But when she gets into combat or even thinks about it, she becomes a complete sadist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Say what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: That's right. But as twisted as she is, she's a master of her scythe as well as a master of the accel turn. It's because of those things that make her the woman she is. The fourth ranked of the third years. The Scythe Trickster. Arnett McMillan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile back at the fight, Angelia was completely at Arnett's mercy. Arnett had been slashing at her left and right making her covered in wounds. Angelia tried to defend herself, but she couldn't keep it up much longer. Arnett gave her one more swing of her deadly scythe. There was a moment of silence. Then Angelia's chest exploded with blood from a huge gash on her neck and she fell to the ground. Arnett had won. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman: The winner of this match, third year student Arnett McMillan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole crowd erupted in cheers while two people who were paramedics placed Angelia on a stretcher and carried her away to be healed. You needless to say were a little shocked about what you had just witnessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Whoa. She's.....brutal. Not to mention strong. That other girl couldn't even get a scratch on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: I know. Told you so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Remind me not to get her angry or have her not to think about fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Heh. Nice idea. Anyway I gotta go. It's my turn up next. Wish me luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Um..yeah. Good luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Thanks. Hope you like the show.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThen Creo got up and went to get ready for her match while you stayed your seat. You were still feeling a little creeped out after Arnett and her sadistic side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Oh man. I still can't get over it. The way Arnett  was fighting was crazy. It 's almost frightening. I never thought she had a dark side like that. (shivers)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen......</span></div></div>",

And the fight was....man you were just.....different.\", you said unsure what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creo probably put it best so I won't repeat it. But trust me when I say your safe around me ok. As long as your not on the receiving end of my scythe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to know.\", you answered sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe, seriously relax.\", she wrapped her arms around yours pulling you close to her. You blushed big time and tried to pull away but Arnett wouldn't let you. \"Oh c'mon ever been this close to a girl before?\", she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe it or not NO.\", Arnett then remembered, just as she was about to persist, about your issues and released you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god sorry I got caught in the moment. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise you didn't feel like when she tried hugging you before. This time it felt natural, the pain was completely oblivious. For some reason Arnett in particular was instigating relief to your pain. Seeing her so down you decided to let her go along with it, as a sign showing your opening up to her. \"Hey it's fine. You can cling on if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett was surprised but slowly accepted your offer. She blushed a shade of pink and her heart beat rised. \"(Name) do you like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't hard to figure out she was fond of you, and even Creo said she is, but still you couldn't allow yourself to go further with it. But still, \"Your very beautiful Arnett and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't. But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your not ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that. But yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...what ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your really cute, your mysterious, funny, handsome what's not to like about you? But hey I won't force myself to wait on one guy. Besides we'll need to find our own partners if were not going to end up as a match.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand. I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey if were still without a partner by the time we graduate I'll leave myself available for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone who has you as a pandora will be the luckiest guy in the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ditto.\", she hugged you this time no flashbacks, no nothing. You returned her hug and wished nothing but the best for her. The announcer started to introduce Creo which meant she was going to show her stuff.</span></div></div>",

This time one side was a girl with long red hair and on the other side is Creo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: Here we go. Make sure you watch closely (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman: Next match. Third year student Tsubaki Parker versus third year student Creo Brand. The next match will begin in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Begin battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki: Volt weapon deploy! (An axe appears in her hands)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Whoa. That's a pretty big axe. Wonder what volt weapon Creo has.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo cracked her knuckles and punched her hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Volt Weapon deploy. Infinity Fang!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a pair of steel gloves appeared in her hands. When you saw them, you were a little puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): A pair of gloves? That's her volt weapon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: I wouldn't underestimate her if I was you. I'll admit it her volt weapon doesn't look much, but trust me. There's a reason why she's ranked fifth in our year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Huh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki: Get ready Creo! You're going down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki raised her axe, charged at Creo using acceleration, and brought down her axe with all her might. Creo stood there completely calm and side stepped the attack. Tsubaki tried again, but the same result happened. Tsubaki kept attacking but Creo was able to dodge them with ease. She hadn't even made her attack yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki: Damn it! Stay still and fight me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Sorry to disappoint you, but you won't be able to hit me with attacks like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki: Grrrrr!!!! Why you....!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that comment Tsubaki seethed in anger and charged at Creo again. This time she charged at her using acceleration and then she began to glow and split into two of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): She's using an acceleration and a tempest turn? Amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: Oh please. That's nothing. She's got nothing on Creo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Huh? What do you mean Arnett?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: Just watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the match Tsubaki was using her speed and her afterimages from her tempest turn to run around Creo to try and confuse her. Then she appeared from behind and attacked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki: Now I have you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh no! Creo!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the looks of things it looked like Creo was gonna get hit, but then Creo simply turned around and blocked the axe with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki: No way! She....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Blocked it with only one hand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: You ain't seen nothing yet. Creo's just getting warmed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki tried to pull back her axe trying to get away from Creo, but some reason she couldn't. Creo had a firm hold of her axe and she wouldn't let go. Then she looked at Tsubaki with a confident as well and a serious look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: You call that a tempest turn? Please. You're way too slow. Don't take this personally, but I think it's time I finish this. I don't wanna drag this out anymore than I already have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Creo suddenly disappeared. Before Tsubaki had a chance to react she left a powerful punch hit her on the side of her face. Next she felt punch on the other side of her face and a punch in the gut. Tsubaki staggered back, but she got her footing. She now had coming out from the side of her lip. She looked around trying to see where Creo was. Then she saw her on her right. She then went on the attack again and slashed at Creo. You were expecting Creo to dodge, but the exact opposite happened. Instead she sliced right at Creo's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh no Creo!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: Don't worry. She's fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki: Ha! Got you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki thought she actually scored a hit, but she couldn't have been more wrong. Creo's body was expected to fall after she was hit, but instead it disappeared. It was nothing more, but an afterimage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki: What the...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): It was an afterimage?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Creo appeared right behind her. She charged at her using a tempest turn which made it look like there was three of her. Tsubaki tried to defend herself using her axe, but Creo punched right through her axe shattering it. Then she unleashed a barrage of punches at a lightning fast speed. Blood spewed out from Tsubaki and her clothes were ripped to shreds. Then Creo reappeared in front of her and stood there. Tsubaki staggered for one moment and then she fell down to the ground defeated. The crowd erupted in cheers while you gawked in shock after what you just witnessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman: The winner of the match, third year student Creo Brand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): No way. She defeated her in an instant. She was as fast as you Arnett. Maybe even faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: Well I don't know about that, but I can tell you that Creo is definitely a strong opponent. She's an expert at close combat and she's well known for her excellent speed which is why she's known for two things. The fifth ranked third year and The Lightning Hammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): The lightning hammer huh? It definitely suits her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you looked back to the battlefield you could see Tsubaki being carried away by medics and being sent to the infirmary and Creo heading back to the rooms. When she looked and saw you in the crowd, she gave you a small wave and you waved back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Wow. I never imagined that Creo was so strong. I hate to admit it, but she would make an awesome partner for any limiter. Well almost any limiter excluding me.</span></div></div>",

I still can't over how incredible Creo and Arnett were today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes and thought back to Creo's and Arnett's matches.

And they don't even have limiters. It's hard to believe that they're only ranked four and five. One things for sure, whoever becomes a limiter for either one of those two is definitely gonna be well protected. Maybe even me. Then again, I don't think I'll ever get a partner again after what I've been through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashes of you and your partner ran through your mind again which made you cringe. You looked at your desk in the corner of your room. The photo of you and your partner was still lying exactly where you placed it. You got up and walked over to your desk and picked up the photo. The photo showed you and your partner looking so happy together. Seeing that photo made your memories come up in your mind again and that made you a little sad.

You got to your class and got ready to sit through another lesson about something that you really couldn't care less of. Soon you were at the door to your classroom. As you were about to open the door, you heard some of your classmates talking which made you stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl 1: Hey! Did you see the matches in the training area the other day?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy 2: Yeah. The third years are strong as they always have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl 2: Yeah. Did you see the way Arnett totally slaughtered that chick? I mean brutal right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl 3: Well, did you expect anything less? I mean Arnett isn't called \"The Slashing Trickster\" for a reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl 2: Yeah, but still. I can't help but feel sorry for Angelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy 1: Yeah, but you got to give Arnett some credit though. She definitely showed off why she's number four in the third years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl 1: You can say that again. Not to mention Creo. She may be number five, but she's no slouch either. In fact, I bet she could give Arnett a run for her money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl 2: No kidding. Maybe she can get even higher. That is if she cane beat numbers three through one that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy 2: I'll tell you what. I think Arnett's the perfect partner for me. I'm gonna ask her if I can be her limiter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl 1: Forget it. You wouldn't stand a chance. Arnett would turn you down in ten seconds flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy 2: Oh come on. Give him a chance. You never know. I'm going for Creo. She's got beauty and brawn to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy 1: Yeah! Let a guy dream would you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl 2: You boys never change do you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point for some reason you were really annoyed hearing this conversation. You opened the door and entered the classroom. The group of students were were a few seats from your seat almost immediately stopped talking when you came in. They looked at you for a moment and then they looked away and huddled. You paid no attention. You simply walked over to your desk and took your seat. when you sat down, You could hear them talking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy 1: Hey. You see that guy? That's the guy who talked to \"The Untouchable Queen\" the other day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl 2: What? No way! That's him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy 2: Yeah. Apparently he had the guts to talk to her. He wasn't even scared of her. And that's not the weird part. Apparently \"The Untouchable Queen\" knows him for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl 1: Really? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl 3: Did they go to school together or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy 1: I don't know, but word on the street is the guy is a second year and he attended a different academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Damn it. So much for trying to lay low. I wish they'd just leave alone already. Satellizer just had to go and say that she knew me. But the question is where? And how?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Yu-Mi came in and class was underway. A little later it was lunchtime and you were eating by yourself as usual. You were sitting by the window looking at outside. At first it was the same as usual, but then Satellizer came into the lunch area again. Everyone who saw her once again steered clear and got out of her way. Satellizer bought her her food and walked out of the lunchroom. As she was leaving you and her locked eyes again. This time you didn't say anything. You simply looked away and pretended she wasn't there. Then she left. Not long after, you noticed that a certain someone followed her again out of the lunchroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh brother. That Kazuya kid is at it again. I'll give him credit for not giving up, but at the same time I wish he'd stop already. If this goes on he'll probably get beaten p or something. Then again why do I care. It's none of my business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while you finished your food and walked out of the lunchroom. You figured since there was still some time left, you would go somewhere to be by yourself until the lunch area was over. You went over to a tree and lied down. You were hoping to get some nap time before the lunch period was over, but then.....</span></div></div>",

The two of you really had no clue on what to talk about so for a short while there was a long pause until Creo furthered the conversation. \"Why are you laying low?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer line of questioning was very direct to which you tried steering away from,\"You tell me.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your PTSD kicked in again this time harder than usual. Your mind recalled your first baptism and everything leading up to her demise. Your thoughts and feelings rushed back, washing against your body. You remember where it took place, in your former classroom, class was over and you two had seemed to hit it off decently. She was already quite lovely, Makoto your deceased partner, she took an interest in you and you believed her reasons to be romantic. You asked her with a deep yet confident breath to ask her to accept your request to baptize with her. She blushed and accepted. That night you two were baptized and you two became partners, unbeknownst to you at the time you assumed that whoever you baptized with would end up being your lover and future life partner. However on the night before her death, you had confessed your feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo you it became more than just keeping one another alive, you thought about her all the time. Your physical relationship began taking bigger steps. You knew for a fact you loved her and assumed she must feel the same way. But in a stunning twist......she didn't love you back. She loved someone else who already was in a partnership. It broke your heart but where you drew the line was when she casually stated the fact they'd still sleep together and have sex sooner or later. The idea of doing those things with someone who didn't even love you back was disgusting to you. You stormed off that night and spent the night alone in your own dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the following day you and Makoto were needed for a mission, a Nova appeared and was stronger than the usual ones that appeared within the last month. Your head wasn't in the game that day because of how awkward everything was between you two now. The Nova had nearly wiped out the whole platoon forcing all remaining to retreat so they could send reinforcements. You and Makoto were among the those reinforcements and Makoto was first to engage the enemy. The Nova was making you breach your limits which strained your powers. Your stigmata was already weaker than most but you still held out for several minutes. However it started to wain on you and due to your mental focus being substantially weakened it began to fail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou told Makoto that you couldn't hold the freezing field any longer, she didn't argue and retreated but the Nova had grabbed her pulling her farther away. You tried to focus and maintain it longer enough for her to break loose and make it out. But the strain was too great and your powers gave out. Makoto had already just managed to break free but she was frozen in time. The Nova took advantage and in one fell swoop was crushed before your very eyes. Some of the other pandoras managed to rescue you and eventually destroyed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mission was a success but at the cost of your partner. Your feelings were all mixed, love, regret, guilt, sadness. The first and only girl you loved was dead, and you were to blame. The sisters placed you back to the academy to strengthen your stigmata and find a new partner. However despite looking for one, you made sure to never fall in love again because of the system. It's design was personal yet for people to do this and not be romantically involved was outlandish. So you choose to try ad find someone who wasn't interested in love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind came back to reality and you were found passed out on the ground, someone reached out to you and turned out to be...</span></div></div>",

What the....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision was blurry for a moment but when it cleared up you saw the last person you expected to see. Kazuya. You looked at him and then at the hand he was offering to help you up. Then you looked away and got up on your own without taking Kazuya's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I'm fine. Don't worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: Are you sure you're okay? You were passed out on the ground you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I just felt weak that's all. I'm fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still a little freaked about having your memories surface back up again, but you didn't show it. The last thing you needed was Kazuya knowing about your past and who you were. Kazuya looked at you with worry, then he smiled trying to be friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: Okay then. As long as you're alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you noticed that Kazuya was carrying another bag of burgers. No doubt who the burgers were for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey. Kazuya right? Are those burgers for who I think they're for?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: Yup They're for Satellizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Don't tell me that you're gonna go after her again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: Yeah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I'll tell you right now, I don't know if I should call you crazy or stupid. Listen. Take my advice, stay away from her if you don't wanna die. Plus it's getting a little pathetic watching you follow her around all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya now had an indignant scowl on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: How dare you! It's not nice to talk about someone you don't even know like that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): You don't even know her yourself kid. Not to mention you been getting on her bad side for the past few days. It was bad enough that you actually touched her but then you had to go and interfere in the carnival and cost her the match. I'm surprised she hasn't killed you yet. If it were me, I'd probably would have beaten you into a bloody pulp. I'm only telling you this for your own good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya's face now changed to one of regret. He squeezed the bag of burgers into his chest slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: I know. I'm well aware that what happened at the carnival was my fault. But still... I need to apologize to her. I'd feel bad if I let things stay the way they are right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I don't understand. Why are you going so far just to make up with her anyway? I mean....you hardly know her. Not to mention that she might kick your ass in a heartbeat if you get close to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya was silent. Then he looked at you with a firm look in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: Because.....everyone keeps telling me that she's dangerous and I should just avoid her. But I don't believe that. She's a good person and she's not as bad you all say she is. I know she has a reputation for being feared and a strong pandora, but when I saw her I thought that she was just....alone. So I'm going to her whether you like it or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Kazuya's response surprised you. It also made you feel a little bad for being so harsh before. You watched as Kazuya walked inside a building. As you watched him walk away, you had a thought. Satellizer for some reason knew who you were and since Kazuya was going to see her, you had an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Wait a sec. Kazuya is going to see Satellizer. This could be a good opportunity. Satellizer for some reason knows who I am. Maybe I can get some info from her as to how she knows me and how much she knows. Plus.....hearing Kazuya talk like made me want to try to look out for him and try to get to know Satellizer myself. He may be a little stubborn, but at least he has guts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey. Kazuya. Hold on a minute. Look. Sorry about what I said earlier. You're right. I shouldn't have judged Satellizer like that. That was rude of me. Hey. I know that we just met and stuff, but would you mind if I come with you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: I.....guess so, but why the change of heart?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well...let's just say that I want to see the good Satellizer too. Plus there's something I need to talk to her about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKauzya: Okay......if you say so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you and Kauzuya headed for the rooftop of the school.</span></div></div>",

Kazuya went to her first, you stayed behind and let him come near her knowing she would probably deck you if you went near her. Kazuya sat next to her and held out the tray of burgers to her. Satilizer noticed them and smiled at Kazuya, she thanked him for his generosity. But her lighter tone in mood switched when she saw you. Kazuya explained that you meant no ill-will toward her and came to bury the hatchet. \"I don't want him near me.\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Satilizer he said himself to me he wants to see the good in you, like I do.

Talking about a baptism perhaps?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of you turned to look and there was a young woman with short blue hair with three different guys (Miyabi). For some reason when you saw her, you couldn't help but get the chills. Not because you were scared or anything. It was more like you didn't like the way that she looked. Satellizer knew who she was, but she couldn't imagine as to why she was here or what business she had. One thing was sure, it wasn't good. Even Kazuya had the feeling that she was trouble, but he was also puzzled as to what Miyabi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: Baptism?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: Oh yeah. You're just transferred here so it's only natural that you don't know. When a Pandora and a Limiter agree to become partners, they perform what we call a baptism. Of course this isn't exactly the best place for it. It's much more special when the two of you are alone, unless you're into people watching you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: And who are you miss?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: The Releaser of Chasity. Miyabi Kanazuki and I'm a third year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Wait a sec. I've heard of this chick. But she didn't have a name like that one she said. She was more well known as \"The Limiter Eater.\" She baptizes any good looking limiter she can get and when she gets bored with them, she takes their stigmata and throws them away like trash. She's not even interested in fighting the nova. If she's here.... then she's here for one reason. (looks back at Kazuya) I better not get involved, so I better leave before things get a little out of hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned and walked away with Satellizer following suit. Apparently she was thinking the same thing you were. But just as you and Satellizer were about to leave, they heard Miyabi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: Stop right there. Do you think a second year can just walk away without acknowledging their senior? I'm talking to you too boy. Even if you are a limiter, that applies to you also.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as you wanted to tell Miyabi to shove it, you kept your mouth shut as did Satellizer. So you both slightly bowed and continued on your way. Kazuya followed after you two, but suddenly Miyabi grabbed Kazuya's arm and stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: Why don't you wait a moment? I'd be more than willing to let you receive my baptism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the words that came out of her mouth, you and Satellizer stopped cold. Kazuya was getting a bad feeling about this girl. He tried to get free of her grip, but she kept a firm hold on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: Um....sorry. I don't understand what you mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: Then let me make this as clear as I can. I want you to say that you'll let be your big sister. I can make your life on campus a much more pleasurable experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed her hand on his cheek and traced it with her finger. She also licked her lips in anticipation as if she was a cougar ready to pounce on her prey. Just seeing her act that way made you disgusted and annoyed. Kazuya who was now way out of his comfort zone finally wrung free of Miyabi's grasp and spoke as politely as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: I'm sorry but you're not the one I want to be baptized with. Please forgive me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he followed you and Satellizer trying to get away as soon as possible. Then two of Miyabi's limiters blocked his way and Miyabi was now glaring at Kazuya like he just insulted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: You stupid bastard. Do you honestly think that you can just walk away unpunished after insulting me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the looks of things, it was going to get ugly. That's when...</span></div></div>",

He doesn't want to be your limiter so just accept it and walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya and Satellizer looked at you in surprise. They never expected you to do that. You didn't even expect speak up like that yourself, but personally you were getting sick of Miyabi's behavior and someone needed to tell her a thing or two. Miyabi gave you a dangerous glare and walked up to you. You glared right back at her, not wanting to back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: What did you say to me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I said leave him alone. You already got three other limiters already so why even blow a gasket about it? You're just making yourself look like a fool and wasting our time. So why don't you.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could finish your sentence, Miyabi gave you a hard slap in the face. Kazuya and Satellizer gasped in shock as you were sent sprawling to the ground. Clearly she had enough of your talking. You winced in pain as you held your cheek. Miyabi stood over you with an even more pissed off look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: You little bitch. How dare you talk to me like that?! It seems that you both need to be punished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Satellizer stood in front of Miyabi with her volt weapon pointed directly at he removing her glasses as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer: If you dare to lay as much as finger on either of these boys, I'll make you regret it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was your turn to be surprised. You never imagined that Satellizer would come in to help, but then again you thought that it was probably for Kazuya's sake that she stepped in. Miyabi chuckled at the blade pointing at her and looked at Satellizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: You made a grave mistake underestimating me girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Satellizer had a chance to react, Miyabi had grabbed her arm, threw her over her shoulder and slammed her into the concrete sending small bits of debris flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: I wonder how I should teach you this lesson so you don't have the gall to challenge your senior again!? Volt weapon deploy! Homing Dagger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sound of her voice, six floating daggers materialized around her. Satellizer got up and readied herself for battle. Miyabi smirked with confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: I wonder what skills you'll entertain me with?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wave of her hand, Miyabi fired all of her daggers at Satellizer. Satellizer deflected them all with ease without even moving from where she was standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: I'm impressed. Such good form too. However...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Miyabi disappeared in a flash of blue light and then reappeared behind Satellizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: Can you keep up with my speed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: So she knows it too. The Accelerating Turn. I'd expect no less from a third year. Wonder how Satellizer's gonna fare against that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Miyabi went on the attack by slashing down at Satellizer with one of her daggers, but then Satellizer surprised her as well as you by disappearing in a blue light and reappearing behind Miyabi swinging her weapon at her back. Luckily Miyabi dodged it with ease with a one handed flip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: No way! Satellizer can use it too? How is that even possible?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi went on the attack again by turning around and started her Accel turn with Satellizer following suit. Both looked like they were about to collide, but they both disappeared. The rooftop rumbled with shock waves as Satellizer and Miyabi clashed again and again with blinding speed. Eventually both fighters reappeared across from each other out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: What a surprise. That move is not usually taught to second years and yet you've already mastered it. You certainly live up to your reputation Satellizer El Bridget!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth fighters leapt at each other, swinging their weapons with a mighty force and in a flash of bright light they collided. Then they both skidded to a stop, both standing where the other once stood. There was a moment of silence. Then a gash appeared on Miyabi's cheek and blood oozed out. Miyabi dropped to her knees in shock. She touched her cheek and looked at the blood on her hand. When she saw it, she let out a scream of horror that rang throughout the rooftops. This must have been the first time that she has been wounded before. You felt a little sorry for her, but at the same time she had it coming. Miyabi's limiters tried to rush to her side to see if she was okay, but Miyabi stopped them. Her face that was filled with horror now changed to one of an angry and deranged psychopath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: I didn't expect that. Intriguing. I only planned to teach you a little lesson, but we've gone beyond that now. Yes past the point of no return. I'm changing the game you fricking second year bitch! I'll shove a full course meal of humiliation down your throat until you choke!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then gave her limiters a quick nod and her they surrounded you, Kazuya, and Satellizer. You immediately knew what they were up to and braced yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: Ereinbar set!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLimiters: Freezing Area!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi began glowing in a blue light and all three of her limiters her limiters launched their freezing areas at once. When you saw the green scale like rays of the freezing coming towards you, that's when...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You immediately jumped out of the way behind Satellizer, avoiding the freezing area just before it hit you. Unfortunately for Satellizer and Kazuya, they weren't so lucky. They were hit full on with the freezing unable to move. Miyabi laughed as she walked towards you spinning a knife in midair above her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: So how do you like the feel of a freezing from three limiters at once? And here you are without a limiter against me. Admit it, you're at my mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Miyabi was wrong. Satellizer mustered all the strength she had and leaped high into the air surprising Miyabi and you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): No way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: Even if the casting is incomplete, how is she still able to move in the freezing area?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer thinking: I have to get out here! Fast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she saw Kazuya. He was struggling trying to get up or at least move. Instinctively she landed back down and reached for Kazuya trying to help him. Sadly that move would leave her wide open for an attack. Right when she was about to grab Kazuya's hand, two of Miyabi's knifes hit her. One on the left wrist and the other on her right shoulder. The hits sent Satellizer to the ground. To make matters worse, the freezing now complete making Satellizer as well as Kazuya unable to move. Miyabi walked over and stood over Satellizer her calm demeanor returning to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: Serves you right paying attention to that boy in our fight.How many times are you planning to disrespect me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya could only watch as Miyabi picked up Satellizer by her hair while she stared back at her. You wanted to help Satellizer, but you had a plan and you couldn't afford to screw it up. So you pretended to be caught in the freezing field waiting for the right opportunity to strike to catch Miyabi off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: It's not too late to make amends. You can start by begging for forgiveness for this wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer said nothing and stared blankly at Miyabi. Then Miyabi gave Satellizer a powerful punch in the gut, making her cough up a little blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: Stop it, let her go!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, Kazuya's plea fell on deaf ears as Miyabi materialized one of her daggers and pressed it close to Satellizer's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: Repeat after me; Miyabi can you forgive for being such an insufferable bitch?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer's lips began to quiver as she was about to speak. Miyabi's grin grew wide as she awaited to what Satellizer was going to say. However Satellizer sadi something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer: Please...let the boy go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made kazuya as well as you gape in shock. Miyabi was more annoyed than surprised. Enraged, Miyabi used her daggers to rip the top half of Satellizer's outfit causing her breasts to spill out. After seeing that, you had had enough. You stepped out from behind Satellizer and Kazuya and charged at Miyabi and Satellizer, much to the shock of Kazuya, Satellizer, Miyabi, and her limiters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I'll make you pay for that you bitch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: No way! He's moving?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: Impossible! You should be caught in the freezing field. How are you able to move!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Easy. I dodged your freezing area. Right before you cast the freezing, I jumped out of the way and was able to avoid it. From there, I just pretended to be caught in your freezing area so I could catch you off guard and it worked. Now it's time I take you down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi gave you a look, but then she smiled and began to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What's so funny?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: I must admit, you impressed me by dodging the freezing, but what do you intend to do now? You can't possibly hope to beat me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Who said anything about beating you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you charged at Miyabi's limiters. The plan was to disable the freezing, you had to incapacitate the limiters in order to free Kauzya. Unfortunately that plan would fail. Just when you were about to connect a punch to one of Miyabi's limiters, you heard Kazuya scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: Watch out! Behind you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you had a chance to react, Miyabi appeared behind you and gave you a powerful kick to your side. You gasped as you felt the wind being knocked out of you from that single kick. You staggered back and stood your ground while Miyabi walked calmly toward you with a knife rotating in midair on her hand gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: Did you honestly think that you could win just for attacking my limiters and disabling the freezing area? Don't make me laugh!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Miyabi went on the attack again. She punched you square in the left cheek and then the right one. Then grabbed her knife and slashed you across your chest, your thigh, and your left arm. You screamed in pain as blood spurted from your wounds. Miyabi smirked and delivered a powerful uppercut straight at your jaw. You were sent flying about a few feet and then you fell slamming to the ground. You tried to get up, but your body was wracked with pain and you couldn't move. Then Miaybi picked you up by the neck and threw you into the freezing area in front of Satellizer and Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: Let that be a lesson to you punk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKauzya: How could you be so cruel?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: Well, looks like got another one in need of a lesson. Teach him boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLimiter: Whatever you say Miyabi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen limiters started to beat Kazuya up. You tried to get up to help him, but you were held down by the freezing area. Then you heard Satellizer yelp. You turned to see that Miyabi was now fondling Satellizer's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: My, my. I must say, you have quite the figure. It's a shame that you insist on being The Untouchable Queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer: No....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: No? Why is that? I think it's time that someone showed you how good is feels to be touched by another person like this. You're starting to like it aren't you? I can tell you're starting to get into it. I'll keep this up until you finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer's phobia was now starting to kick in as tears began streaming down her face. You and Kazuya tried to get up, but the freezing was going on strong. Miyabi smiled sadistically as her hand traced along Satellizer's cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: Like I said, I'm going to make you swallow a full course of disgrace and humiliation.until you can't take it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Miyabi gave a kick to Satellizer's back, causing her to fall over her hips raised on her knees and her chest on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: My, such a position. One might think that The Untouchable Queen is a bit of a slutty girl. You got a good start, but let's make things a little more interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi lifted up Satellizer's skirt exposing her panties and then she pulled her panties down. Kazuya turned away while you struggled trying get up not wanting to look either. As for Satellizer, all she could do was blush in shame as Miyabi clapped enjoying herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: It would be such a shame to keep this glorious view to ourselves wouldn't you agree boys?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi's limiters pulled out camera phones and began taking pictures of Satellizer in the position she was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: Take as many as you can. Remember this day as the day The Untouchable Queen was broken like an animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: You monster! Leave her alone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi heard Kazuya's remark and gave him a sadistic smile and began walking towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: Seems like you still need to be taught a lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you watched Miyabi walk towards Kazuya, you knew that you had to help him. You didn't want to see him hurt anymore than he already has. You were still a little beaten up, but you had the strength to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey! Leave him alone...you slutty bitch! Why don't you pick on someone....your own size?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi looked to where you were and gave you neutral look. You struggled to your feet using every ounce of your strength to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): That's right. Don't waste your time with him! I'll be your opponent!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: What the... What are you saying?! Stop it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Come on! You ain't so tough! You're only tough because you got these limiters with you! Without them you're nothing! You're just a second rate pandora who doesn't know how to control her hormones!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Miyabi caught your attention. She stopped walking towards Kazuya and started walking towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): That's right! Come and get me you whore of a pandora, if you got the guts! Or are you just a slutty coward!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the final straw. Miyabi's eyes went wide with anger. Then she used an acceleration to and gave you a punch in the gut making you cough up blood and she elbowed you on the head making you slam to the ground. Then she materialized one of her daggers and raised it over her head preparing to stab you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: You little bastard. I was gonna take my time giving you your punishment, but the only punishment I can give you, IS DEATH!!!!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought down her knife and you shut your eyes. Then....</span></div></div>",

Miyabi and her limiters were frozen in place while you at the same time were able to move again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: He was able to cancel out their freezing while casting a freezing on me?! Impossible! No limiter should be able to have so much power!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Incredible! He did it again! This time it's way more powerful than before! He was able to cast a freezing area without an Ereinbar set! Kazuya......just what the hell are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you felt a tremendous aura coming from behind you. When you looked, you gasped in shock. Satellizer was now back on her feet. Her face was filled with rage and in each of her hands she had two of Miyabi's limiters. You also saw third limiter lying on the ground with his eyes staring at the sky. You couldn't tell if he was still alive or dead. Lastly at her feet were the phones that they were taking pictures with. They were smashed and broken to pieces. No doubt she probably kicked the crap out of them and destroying the phones so they wouldn't send the pictures they took. When Miyabi saw what Satellizer had done in such a speed, she was frozen in fear. Then Satellizer throwing the unconscious limiters she was carrying aside, charged Miyabi with an acceleration. Before Miyabi had a chance to react, she was hit with series of punishing blows to the face. Then Satellizer gave her a powerful punch in the gut sending her crashing to the ground. You and Kazuya watched in shock as this sudden turn of events played out.Then she slowly walked towards Miyabi with a murderous look in her eyes. Miyabi who was now scared out of her wits was crying and spoke in a timid and scared voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: Please....let me go. Just let me walk away from this and I'll never bother you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer ignored her. She walked closer and closer to her until a voice stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(voice): Stop this at once!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kazuya looked to where you heard the voice and you saw the girl with short brown hair and the girl with long blue hair you saw the other day along with Arthur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiffon: I order you to stop this right now and step away from Miyabi this instant! Need I remind you that I'm the student council president!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): She's the student council president?!? Seriously?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: Whew. Thank goodness. Just in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer looked at Chiffon in an icy cold stare. You were expecting that Chiffon not back down, but....you got the opposite reaction. Instead she hid behind Ticy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiffon: Well...it's just a clear violation of regulations. So I would be eternally grateful if she would comply with my request right about now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Are you kidding me?!? Some student council president she is!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer ignored Chiffon and continued her walk towards Miyabi until she was standing right above her. She also summoned her volt weapon and prepared to strike her. Then two more people came onto the scene. The two teachers Yu-mei and Elize. When they saw what Satellizer was about to do, they prepared to deploy their weapons to stop Satellizer, but someone else beat them to the punch. You. Before Satellizer could bring down her weapon, you stopped her by grabbing her wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Satellizer stop! You have to calm down! You can't do this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer: DON\"T YOU TOUCH ME!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately you would only make things worse by doing what you did. Satellizer's eyes flared in anger and she gave you a wicked punch in the face sending you sprawling flat on your back. You tried to get back up, but then you found yourself staring at the end of Satellizer's weapon with Satelizer staring at you with the same murderous intent in her eyes. If you weren't scared before, you were now. Everyone gasped as Satellizer raised her weapon and prepared to strike you. Just as you thought you were going to die...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: Don't do it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya activated his freezing just in the nick of time stopping Satellizer and saving your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: Satellizer please listen to me, you've got to stop this! I understand you're angry! What Miyabi did was unforgivable! I saw everything! But you're going to far! Don't do this! You know that the pandora weren't made to fight each other like this. This is wrong! Besides that boy is not your enemy! He was only trying to help you! If you do this, you'd be no better than Miyabi. So please stop!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer glared at Kazuya from the corner of her eye, but Kazuya didn't back down or look away. They stared at each other for a good ten seconds, then Satellizer relaxed. Kazuya smiled and then deactivated his freezing. Satellizer also got off of you and deactivated her volt weapon. She was then taken away by Yu-Mei and Elize to discuss her punishment. Your heart was still beating about ten miles per minute after being through what had just happened, but you were still alive. Kazuya rushed to your side and checked on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: Hey. Are you okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I'm...fine. More or less. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to get back on your feet, but your wounds stung. You fell on your knee in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Damn. Miyabi messed me up pretty good. I can't even get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Kazuya looped one of your arms around his shoulder and helped you to your feet which surprised you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey. What are you doing? I said I was fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: No you're not. You're hurt. I'm gonna take you to the infirmary. We have to get those wound fixed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): But..why? Why are you helping me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: It's my fault that you got into this mess in the first place. Besides it's my way of saying thank you for helping us. Not to mention you're not in any condition to move. It's the least I can do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Kazuya in surprise as Kazuya gave you a friendly smile. Seeing Kazuya's smile made you look away embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK... I suppose I could use a trip to the infirmary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you both left to the infirmary. Unknown to you two, a certain gray haired girl with twin ponytails in swirls was sitting on the fence across from the roof where fight had taken place. She had observed everything that had happened. Her eyes narrowed while watching you and Kauzya. After that, she leaped off the roof and disappeared. </span></div></div>",

Instead of seeing Miyabi you saw in back of a familiar woman with snow white hair, Creo. With a stern determined look on her face after she managed to knock the knife away from Miyabi, she got out her gauntlets and got in her fighting stance. Miyabi tried to grasp what the hell just happened, \"The hell are you? Get out of my way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll never hurt (Name), Kazuya, or Satilizer! Not while I'm here.\", she said with a threat embedded in her final sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were standing up to a spoiled, selfish, brat who came close to fatally wounding a fellow limiter. I'd report you, but I think a well taught lesson will suffice.\", Creo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah! As if a fifth ranked student can stand up against me. Freeze her!\", Miyabi ordered her limiters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you didn't need your limiters for a real fight. Prove it!\", Creo called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then, raaaahhhhhh!\", she cried out. Miyabi threw a bunch of daggers around Creo, expecting her to move in multiple directions. But Creo stood still, and kept her guard up. With an opening, she went in to get up close. Miyabi slid to her right and threw a couple daggers at Creo's arms. She managed to rip Creo's sleeves with the force of the daggers sending her back a few feet. If the area was confined Creo would be stuck to a wall but they were on an open rooftop so it was out of her element dealing with someone as competent as Satilizer, but more focused right at the moment. You wanted to help but knew this was now, Creo's fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get the hell out of here you don't even know what's going on here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were about to hurt my friend, that's all I need to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For fuck sake just leave and go away!\", Miyabi was getting frustrated by Creo. But Creo began getting wiser to Miyabi's patterns of attack. Finally Creo was up close and began striking at Miyabi. Miyabi dodged and redirected a few of Creo's blows but every hit that connected, she felt and was wearing on her. Creo tried to finish it in one good punch, but left herself too exposed causing Miyabi to slash a dagger at Creo revealing her cleavage. Miyabi then took advantage of Creo being distracted by people looking at her assets, and stabbed a dagger right in her knee cap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo fell down in sheer pain from just the sheer appearance of how deep the wound was. Miyabi gloated reveling in her victory, \"Serves you right you annoying little shit for being so fucking annoying and getting in MY business. Now you, I didn't forget what you called me earlier. If you beg to be MY limiter, I may let you baptize with me and sleep in m-\", Miyabi was cut off by a clean punch to the face with Creo landing blow after blow in Miyabi's pressure points. She punched in the stomach, her \"pretty\" face, her arms, nearly every part of Miyabi's body got decked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo finished it off with a clean uppercut to the chin sending Miyabi flying a good 2 feet. Miyabi was unconscious for the moment having been taken by surprise. Her limiters helped her up only to start worrying Creo would demolish them. Satilizer got up having Kazuya comfort her and regain her composure. \"You alright Satilizer?\", you asked concerned about what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatilizer just glared at Miyabi saying all that was needed to know. Satilizer stood beside Creo and nodded to each other planning to take down the bitch together.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Creo and Satellizer split in two different directions using acceleration making them look like they both disappeared. Miyabi tried to keep up using her acceleration to intercept, but she was still rattled after being hit by Creo. So her speed was almost cut in half. Creo hit Miyabi with a flurry of punches in her face causing her to stagger. Then Satellizer appeared behind her and slashed at her back. Blood sprayed from Miyabi's back and splattered on the floor as she screamed in pain. You and Kazuya looked on, both of you with awestruck looks on your faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: Wow! She's as fast as Satellizer! Maybe even faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): No doubt! Miyabi can't even hold a candle to what Creo is capable of! Just watch her kick the crap out of slutty excuse of a pandora!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kazuya were so focused on the fight, you didn't see that Miyabi's limiters had regained consciousness. When they saw that their pandora was in trouble, they knew they had to help her. Back to the fight, Miyabi was know screaming in anger as she fired dozens of her knifes in retaliation. Satellizer and Creo deflected the knifes with ease without even breaking a sweat. After Miyabi gawked in shock, Satellizer and Creo took the opportunity to both attack at once. Satellizer disappeared in an acceleration and slashed Miyabi repeatedly causing her to stagger. To finish it up, Creo disappeared in her own acceleration hit Miyabi with a right cross, a left hook, and a punch in the gut in blinding speed. Miyabi was sent sprawling to the ground. Seeing that Miyabi was done, you rushed to Creo's side totally stoked after what you just seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): All right! You did it Creo!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Well I didn't exactly do it on my own, but it was nothing. You okay Satellizer?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer looked at Creo with a bit of a scowl on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer: What's a third year like you doing here? Aren't you with her or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey Satellizer! That's not...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a little upset that Satellizer was being a little rude towards Creo, but Creo tapped your shoulder to stop you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: It's all right. It's only natural for she's doubtful. Actually two first years told me you guys were in trouble, so I rushed on over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): First years? What do you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could ask what Creo was talking about, you heard someone scream. You looked to see Kazuya who was now being held by Miyabi's limiters. Two of them where in front of Kazuya so he wouldn't escape while the third had Kazuya in a head lock ready to suffocate him. Miyabi was also back on her feet with with a sly smile on her face at the sudden turn of events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh no!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer: Kazuya!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Damn it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: Hahahaha!! That's right! I've got your precious limiter! If you don't want me to hurt this boy, you'll stay where you are. Don't try anything funny or I'll have my boys suffocate this bastard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Why you..!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): That's playing dirty you.....!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: I wouldn't be so rude to me if I was you kid. Give up right now. Because if you don't.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe limiter tightened his grip on Kazuya making Kazuya gasp struggling to breathe. Then Miyabi made a knife appear and pointed it at Kazyua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer: No Kazuya! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: I said stop. Get down on your knees and surrender. Otherwise this first year's time in this academy will be cut very short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Damn it. What can we do? If we move even an inch, Kazuya's as good as dead. There's got to be something we can do. But what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wracked your brain trying to figure out how to save Kazuya, but you didn't know how. Then you remembered something. You thought about how you first saw Kazuya when he interfered with Satellizer's fight and stopped her with his freezing. That gave you an idea. You spoke in a low voice so only Creo and Satellizer could hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Satellizer. Creo. Listen. I have an idea, but we need to work together on this. Okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked especially at Satellizer. You could tell right away that she was the lone wolf type, but you need her help on this. Satellizer looked at you indignant at working with a third year, but she reluctantly agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: What did you have in mind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Okay here's the plan. Creo when I give the word, you and I will attack Miyabi and her goons. Satellizer when the moment comes, go save Kazuya. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer: Wait a second. How is that gonna work? They'll kill Kazuya as soon as we try to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Then we'll just have to stop them before that happens. Won't we?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer and Creo looked at each other puzzled. Then you shouted at the top of your lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Kazuya! Snap out of it! We need your help! Don't tell me you're lying on the job at a time like this?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: Heh. You must be delusional. You expect this boy to help? He can't move let alone help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Come on! I know about your power! Your power is the only thing that can save us as well as you! Come on! You can do it! Use your power!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya struggled trying to break free, but he couldn't. The limiter holding him tightened his grip making Kazuya's losing more air. You knew that he wouldn't last much longer so you had to use your secret weapon. It was time to make it personal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: Are you gonna let her get away with it?! Are you gonna let this disgrace of a pandora get away with what she did to Satellizer?! Need I remind you that she practically raped her right in front of you and you're just gonna sit there and do nothing!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya's eyes snapped open after hearing you that time. He remembered what Miyabi did to Satellizer and the mere thought of it made his blood boil. He could feel power flowing through his body and he felt himself getting stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Come on! Show that bitch what she's done was wrong! Make her pay for what she did!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: Are you finished with your little speech? Then I think it's time that we end this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Miyabi could make her next move, Kazuya let out a bellowing scream as his body glowed in a bright blue light. Then a bright blue hexagon pattern spread around Miyabi and her limiters making them unable to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: What the hell?!? A freezing area?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo thinking: Impossible! There's no way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer thinking: I knew it! I had my suspicions back then, but now I'm sure! He was the one that cast the freezing before! But how? A limiter normally needs an Ereinbar set to cast a freezing, but somehow this boy was able to do it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Now's our chance! Creo! Attack now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMusic plays. Zen Ball Master 5:45<br>\r\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkIe3G0s8dA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4m50s\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkIe3G0s...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo snapped out of her shock from seeing Kazuya and charged at Miyabi with you by her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Wait a second. If we both take on Miyabi, then won't her limiters freeze us?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Don't worry. Leave the limiters to me. You focus on Miyabi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Okay! You got it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you both separated. Creo went for Miyabi and you went for her limiters. Creo jumped up in the air and gave Miyabi and punch in the face. Meanwhile you did the same move as as Creo and punched the limiter holding Kazuya square in the face forcing him to let go and setting Kazuya free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Satellizer now!! Get Kazuya!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer: Right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer used an acceleration to immediately appear at Kazuya's side and carried him to safety. Miyabi who had just recovered from the punch could not believe what had just happened and frankly she didn't like it. Neither did her limiters. Miyabi used an acceleration to try to get Creo off guard with a punch, but she blocked it one handed. One of Miyabi's limiters ran at you with a fist aimed for your face, but you blocked with one hand the same way Creo did. Then you gave the limiter a right cross and sent him reeling back and knocking him out. Creo threw Miyabi's fist to cause her to step back and hit her with a right cross just like you. Miyabi came at Creo with a knife in her hand and attempted to slash her, but Creo side stepped, got in close and punched her in the gut knocking the wind out of her. The second limiter came at you throwing fists left and right, but you dodged every one. When he punched again, you dodged it, got in close and gave him a punch in the gut knocking him out. You both didn't realize it at the time, but you both were fighting in perfect sync. It was almost like a scene from a movie. Satellizer and Kazuya couldn't not believe their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: Incredible...They're both....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer: In perfect sync!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyabi: There's no way! How are they mirroring each others moves like this?!? It doesn't make any sense!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you both each delivered the finishing blow to your respective opponents. Creo jumped up in the air and gave Miyabi a superman punch smack in the jaw and you gave the last limiter a punch in the exact same way. Both Miyabi and the last limiter were sent flying and then sent crashing to the ground knocked out cold.<br>\r\n(Music ends)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Whew. Well that took longer that expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah. But at least we won. Nice work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: You weren't so bad yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then....</span></div></div>",

To their surprise they found Miyabi laying on the ground bruised and banged up badly. And Satilizer next to Kazuya without her acting all nervous. They turned to you and Creo asking what the hell happened, \"Creo what did we miss? We could here half the commotion from across the grounds.\", Attia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Satilizer came to you and Creo, \"Thank you both. I appreciate your compassion and respect your teamwork. You two are one of the finest partners I've seen here.\", she complimented. She left walking to Kazuya probably to discuss about how well they worked together just now. Creo was shocked at how she mistook her and you for a team when you two never even baptized each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatilizer's compliment however forced you into deep thought, \"Satilizer gave praise on our teamwork? I had no Creo and me were that compatible. This may be my best option, I'll ask her. But....never again will I fall in love because of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo contemplated too her thoughts on being your partner, \"(Name) and me? We showed great skill and the best pandora said we were the best she'd seen. I'm going to ask him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh why did she say you guys were the best when she obviously took down those guys?\", Attia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they did most of the work Attia.\", Arnett figured out. She looked at the wake you and Creo left and was impressed. You and Creo turned to each other and said, \"I want you to baptize with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Arnett squealed in excitement thinking you two would have a heartwarming romantic embrace. But instead you and Creo just shook hands. \"Wait a minute? What was that?\", she asked bewildered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creo I understand the nature of our relationship now, but I hope you understand that I am making this emotionally void.\", you stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo felt no issue about it and nodded in agreement. The two of you walked to off to one of your rooms to begin the baptism. Arnett gave a look saying, \"We'll see how long they stay 'professional'.\" While Attia grew angry at having Creo be a pandora for you.</span></div></div>",

Let me get something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate it.\", she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took out some bandages and rubbing alcohol along with a needle and thread. Creo put pressure on the wound to stop the bleeding, you came and took a look at her stab wound. \"Is it bad?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very. I'm no doctor, but I know when someone went through some shit. We'll take you to the infirmary soon as I at least clean thee wound.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But before we complete the baptism.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name), thank you.

Pffffffft! Mmmmmmm! That never is pleasant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was it like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beautiful landscapes, lots of likeable people. Had some friends too. But it didn't last there.

That really stings!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just keep still, it's going to make sure the leg doesn't get infected. Hand me that bandage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's your background?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I prefer not to talk about my past. In any form.\", you said gently rolling the bandage up a bit before stitching up her cut..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sooner or later we'll have to move past it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The wound wasn't big just deep. But I can't sew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you cannot be serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou handed her the needle and thread and lett her sew the cut. \"If it makes it better you could let me rub your leg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do that, help numb the pain. Ok, AHHH! Grrrrr that fucking hurts. You need to learn to sew so that I'm not torturing myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duly noted. Hey Creo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were both going to try and keep it professional. No emotion carrying us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, its what we agreed to. I have no reason to fall in love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. Bandages are all set, we'll wait for he wound to close then I'll get you to the nurse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine Creo, just a scratch nothing serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here.\", she took the alcohol and rubbed it on her hands, she gently rubbed your wounds with her mighty but sensitive hands. You winced in pain too, but Creo handled it with care. Soon as she was done, it came time for the baptism. Creo laid further back in her bed and left you some room. You laid right in front of her and spooned next to her. You cuddled and relaxed trying to let the calm peaceful nature of the baptism ease you both of the pain and stress. </span></div></div>",

You looked on the bed and saw Creo's sleeping peacefully on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: That's right. I had a baptism with Creo. She's my partner now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly got out of bed not wanting to wake her up and looked yourself over. You knew that one of Creo's stigmata was now inside of you, but you were curious about something. Ever since you had your first baptism, you were curious as to how the stigmata got into your body. You looked all over seeing if there was any changes or something different about yourself,  but your body was still the same as it was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Hmm The human body and stigmatas are still a mystery to me. I guess it just happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you looked at the clock on Creo's desk. It said 6:50. There was still a couple hours left before class started. You decided to get dressed and head for class a little early. You were gonna get dressed, but there was one problem. When you put on your clothes, you saw that they were still ripped and were a little bloody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Aw crap. My clothes. I forgot that stupid bitch Miyabi ripped them up. I should've gotten extra clothes before I came here. Oh well. I better go to my room and change. After that, I'm gonna head to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou headed for the door and were just about to leave when you stopped. You looked back and saw that Creo was still asleep. For some reason, you felt that you should tell her that you were leaving, but then you decided to leave anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): It's not like I have to let her know where I'm going every two seconds. Besides, I don't want to wake her up. But I guess I should let her know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went over to Creo's desk and saw some sticky notes and some pens. You took a pen and wrote on the sticky note, \"I'll see you in class. Thank you. (name).\" Then you stuck the note next to Creo's clock so she could see it. Then quietly you left Creo's room and headed back to your room. A few minutes later, you made it back to your room. You went to your closet and took out another uniform. Then you took off your old ones and got dressed. As soon as you were finished, you decided that you were gonna sit by the tree that you lied down on the other day until classes started, so you started walking to the campus. The sun was already rising as you arrived at the campus. As you entered the campus, you noticed how quiet it was without all the students bustling around. Not a sound could be heard. Personally you thought it was nice to have some peace after the day you went through. Soon you found your resting tree. You walked over, lied against it, and closed your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): -sigh- It's so peaceful. I should probably do this more often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were enjoying the silence so much, you felt a little tired and sleepy. You were about to go to sleep, when a voice broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(voice): Excuse me. You're (name) am I right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened one of your eyes to see....</span></div></div>",

Easy! I'm here for nothing of the sort!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTicy: She's right! Calm down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh yeah? If that's not the case then why are you here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiffon: Look. I just wanted to tell you that you need to lie low for while. Not to mention that you need to stay away from Satellizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Lie low? What do you mean? And what does Satellizer have to do with this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiffon: She attacked a third year! Not to mention that you were an accomplice and got Creo involved too. Creo would probably get off easy, but you and Satellizer have gone way too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Just a damn minute! That third year was the one who started the whole thing in the first place! Not to mention that slut threatened to kill Kazuya and sexually harassed Satellizer to the point of rape!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiffon: It doesn't matter. Being a second year you should know this already. The hierarchy of this school is like a military ranking system and absolute. The third years aren't gonna take two second years attacking one of their own lying down. In fact, they they've been tolerating Satellizer's actions up till this point and to make things even more insane a limiter's involved. Once word of this gets out, they will come for Satellizer and they'll come after you too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long pause. Then you spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Listen. I appreciate the warning, but I can take care of myself. I'm not scared of a bunch of third years. Besides its none of your business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiffon glared and you glared right back at her. Then the bell began to ring signaling that class was about to begin. You not wanting to be late and not wanting to speak to Chiffon any more than you had to turned around and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): If that's all you want to say to me, then I'm out of here. I'm don't want to be late. See ya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTicy: Hey! Get back here! You can't speak to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTicy was a little upset that you spoke to Chiffon with such disrespect and was gonna give you a piece of her mind, but Chiffon raised her arm and stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiffon: It's okay Ticy. Let him go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTicy: But Chiffon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiffon: It's fine. In fact, he acted the way I expected him to. He's exactly as Sister Margaret said. Brave and not afraid to speak his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTicy: Yeah. But still....will he be okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiffon: Who can say Ticy? All we can do is watch and hope he survives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile....</span></div></div>",

She sat up from her bed, stretched and looked around her room. Everything was the same as it was before. Except now, she now had a limiter. Then she looked at her bedside. She expected to find you next to her, but you were gone. She looked around her room to see if you were still in her room somewhere, but you weren't there. Then she saw the sticky note next her clock. She picked it up and read it. When she finished reading, she sighed in a mixture of exasperation and annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: He's gone? Hmm. I know that he's a lone wolf type but still, he could have at least told me that he was gonna be leaving. Oh well. It's not like we have to be together every two seconds. Anyway, I better get ready for class. I don't want to be late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo then took a shower, got dressed, and headed for her classroom. On the way to the classroom, she ran into Arnett.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: Hey Creo!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Hey Arnett. What's up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: Hey, how did it go last night? You know, your baptism I mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Well, nothing seems different. But the baptism was a success. More or less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: That's great! So what was it like? Did you and (name) do some stuff during the baptism if you know what I mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Get your mind out of the gutter Arnett. We didn't do anything like that. A baptism isn't anything like what you're thinking. Besides it's just a custom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: Oh come on Creo! You could at least try to be a little romantic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Why? It's not like (name) and I are a couple or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: Speaking of (name), where is he anyway? I'd would have thought that he would have been with you when you woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Nah. He left early this morning before I woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett nearly fell over after hearing Creo's response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: What?!? What do you mean he left early this morning?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Calm down Arnett. What's the big deal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: What's the big deal?!? What of partner leaves like that without saying anything?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Arnett. You're blowing this out of proportion. It's fine. Besides I don't have to know where he is every five seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: But Creo if you're both gonna be partners shouldn't you both be acting like partners?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: You do have a point, but (name) made it clear. He wants our partnership to have as less emotion as possible. And I wouldn't want it any other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett stared at Creo. Then she sighed and pinched the bridge of her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: Man. A stick in the mud as usual. Fine. Do what you want. But I still think that you both should act a little more romantic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Yeah, yeah. Come on. We don't want to be late for class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Creo and Arnett were about to start walking, they were greeted by a familiar face.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately she wasn't in a good mood at all. She had a serious expression on her face. She ignored Arnett and walked straight up to Creo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia: Creo. We need to talk. Now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: What about? If it's not important, can't it wait?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo walked past her not wanting to deal with Attia nonsense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia: You know very well what and no it can't wait. About you being partners with (name). You need to break up the partnership with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett looked at Attia in shock while Creo stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: Attia! What the heck are you saying? What do you mean \"break up the partnership?\" Why would you want Creo doing that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia: Because that boy is nothing but trouble. In case you haven't heard the details from yesterday, Satellizer wasn't the only one who attacked Miyabi. (name) attacked Miyabi as well by attacking her limiters. Any second year who attacks a third year as well as her limiter is only asking for punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: What?! Hold on Attia, Creo got involved in the fight too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia: She got off easy because of her being a third year. But the next time she won't be so lucky. I don't need you to get dragged to (name)'s level so I want you to break up the partnership. Not to mention you don't know anything about him or who he really is. It's for your own good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere a long silence. Then Creo spoke in a low voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: I told you before. I'm getting sick and tired about you getting up in (name)'s ass all the time. You don't know anything about him either. So stop trying to say that you do. And don't worry about me. I can handle myself. I'm a big girl. So do yourself a favor and mind your own business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Creo went away. Arnett and Attia watched as she walked away. There was a long pause. Then Arnett spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: She is right you know. You shouldn't judge people by their covers Attia. Sure (name) is rough around the edges, but he's pretty cool once you get to know him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia said nothing. Then the bell began to ring. Arnett not wanting to be late ran to class. Attia on the hand was seething in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia thinking: Damn it to hell! It's bad enough that I've lost Creo, but now Arnett's on his side too?!? It's that boy's fault! He taking them both away from her me! (name).... You're you pay! I'll show you what happens when you steal from The Architect of Evil!!!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were sitting in class going through another one of Yu-Mei's lectures. A lecture about limiters. Everyone else was paying attention, soaking in all the knowledge. You on the other hand were not paying attention at all and were looking out the window. The reason for this was because you heard this lecture already due to you being from another academy, so you felt that you didn't need to hear the same lecture twice. You yawned as Yu-Mei continued her lecture. Suddenly Yu-Mei's voice snapped you out your daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu-Mei: (name)! Is learning about the fate of world that boring to you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Wah! No! I mean no ma'am!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu-Mei: I understand that you come from a different academy and you probably learned this already, but please pay attention. You need to set an example for the other limiters here you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yes ma'am. Sorry ma'am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu-Mei: Oh I know. Since you're pretty familiar on this subject and you're a limiter yourself, why don't you tell us a little about them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yes. Like the pandora, we limiters are also implanted with stigmata which gives us the ability to deploy a freezing area. We limiters are what protect the pandora in battle when dealing with the nova. The sole purpose of a limiter is to neutralize the freezing field that the nova releases so that the pandora can move freely without being frozen in the nova's freezing field. In addition, the limiter can not only neutralize a nova's freezing area, but they can also generate one of their own to restrain other targets including low class nova targets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu-Mei: Very good. I'd expect no less from a second year. Take note everyone. Make sure you remember that. Now moving on to the next thing....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh of relief, glad that you were off the hook. After that, you paid attention through the rest of class just in case that Yu-Mei called on you again. Soon class was over and it was the lunch period. You were on your way to the cafeteria hoping to get a good lunch. But as you were walking, you passed by a couple of first year pandora. When they saw you, they huddled together and began whispering to each other. You paid no attention. You figured they were just a couple of students who gossiping trying to figure out who you were like the students the other day. Then you came to the lunch area. The same thing happened again. A couple of students saw you every time you walked by and then they whispered to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Geez. Can't they give it a rest already? It's starting to get on my nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bought your lunch and went to find a decent seat where you could be by yourself, but there was no seat a available. Just then Kazuya came up to you carrying a bag of burgers. You were a little surprised to see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: (name). Whew. I finally found you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Huh? Kazuya? What are you doing here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: I came to see you of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): To see me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: Well yeah. I wanted to talk to you the next time I saw you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah? What's up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: First of all, I wanted to thank you for helping me and Satellizer the other day. And I also wanted to apologize for getting you involved in the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Um..it's no big deal. I just.....acted on my own. Besides I couldn't stand that slut pushing you guys around like that. I was glad to do it. (looks at bag if burgers) Let me guess. Going to go see Satellizer again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: You bet. I was just gonna meet her for lunch. Oh yeah. There was another reason I came to see you. I wanted to ask if you wanted to eat lunch with me and Satellizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Eat lunch? With you and Satellizer?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: Yeah. Since we didn't really have time to chat the other day, I figured that we try again. With no interruptions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Um...well...I...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: Oh come on. Please say you will. Didn't you say that you wanted to see the good in Satellizer? Besides you look lonely sitting by yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had your reasons for being alone, but Kazuya did have a point. You never really had a chance to get to know Satellizer due to Miyabi's interference. Plus you didn't want to admit it, but you were getting sick of being alone. But at the same time, Satellizer knew who you were and what happened to your partner so maybe it wasn't such a good idea. Not to mention you remembered Chiffon's warning about staying away from Satellizer. After a long pause you.....</span></div></div>",

Satilizer was still in the same corner she sat by yesterday but this time when she saw the both of you. A warm smile grew on her face, mostly directed at Kazuya but still circumstances had removed the tension you and her initially had at first. Kazuya sat next to her and got out lunch for himself and Satilizer. He offered you to sit next to him to which you agreed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya handed her, her food and she replied, \"Thank you Kazuya.

As you were walking back to your room, you couldn't help but think about the time you spent with Kazuya and Satellizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): You know... I hate to admit it, but... I actually had fun. It's nice to talk to some people once in a while. And who would've thought that The Untouchable Queen would have a soft side. Hahaha. She may be a little serious at times, but once you get to know her she's an ordinary girl. Not to mention Kazuya was nice enough to let me get to know her. Hehe. Looks like I made some more new friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you remembered Chiffon's warning about staying away from Satellizer which made you puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: I wonder why Chiffon told me to stay away from Satellizer. Maybe cause she's worried that she could attack me? Nah. She's probably just being paranoid about a second year like any other third year. Speaking off third years, I wonder where Creo and Arnett could be? I know. I'll go look for them and see how they're doing. Besides I haven't seen Creo and Arnett in a while. It'd be since to talk to them. They're probably at the third year dorms. I'll check there first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo instead of heading to your room, you headed to the third years dorm in hopes of finding Creo or Arnett. When you got there, you looked any signs of Creo or Arnett, but they were no where to be found. As you looked around, you noticed that a couple the third years were looking at you for some reason. It was like a second year have been in their dorm before. As much as you hated being stared at, you paid no attention. You just focused on finding your friends. Suddenly a voice called out to you making you stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(voice): Hey! Second year! Stop right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen two third years came up to you. When you saw them, you recognized them as the two girls that lost to Creo and Arnett. Angelia and Tsubaki. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Oh crap. It's those girls from before. Oh man. Maybe I should've looked somewhere else. Okay. Keep it cool (name). You're in hot water with the third years as it is, so keep it cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki: What's a second year like you doing around these parts?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelia: Yeah. Usually a second year doesn't come here unless they're receiving a baptism. And I don't think you're here for a baptism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou politely bowed and spoke as politely as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I'm so sorry.  I was just looking for a friend of mine. I couldn't find her in the school, so I figured that I'd check here and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could finish, you noticed that Angelia and Tsubaki were looking at you all over as if they were checking to see if you were telling the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Um...is there something wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAneglia: You know... you're kinda cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Excuse me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki: Yeah. I gotta say second year, you pretty easy on the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Um... thanks. I think. Well I better be going. Please excuse me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou politely bowed and tried to walk away, but Aneglia stopped you by grabbing your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAneglia: Hold on. Don't be in such a rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki: Yeah. Why don't you stay for a while and maybe we'll help you find your friend? We'll even have some fun together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tsubaki spoke to you, she held your chin with her finger and traced it upward making you shudder. Angelia was also now hugging your arm like she had found a boyfriend. One thing was for sure, you were getting creeped out and a little annoyed at the same time. You tried to pull away, but Angelia kept a firm hold on your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I'm sorry, but I have to go. I don't want my friend to worry about me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki: Oh come on.

I'll make note of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering (Name) btw, if you could join me for a walk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh. Sure, a long period of time together will strengthen our bond.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\", the two of you were completely robotic to the initiation of going out. For you it was simply trying to repress your emotions of attraction toward Creo but you held them back. In her case it was casual and nothing seemed to bother her. You two went over to the school gardens where the sweet aroma of flowers filled the air. Nobody was around at this time of day so it was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, whats it like having all the perks of a third-year?\", you started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just means your less liable to get punished when you're in trouble. Some added bells and whistles but not much else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how did you know Arnett and Attia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arnett was my room-mate since my first year. Attia I met not long after. How about you? Anyone you've known or getting to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kazuya and Satilizer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I'm not kidding. And Satilizer is really kind ounce you get to know her, I think next time you should accompany me if they invite us to the rooftop. Maybe we could get Arnett too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure (Name), I'd be willing to for your safety at least but Arnett and Satilizer would probably spell disaster if were going for a peaceful method.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it was just an idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) I have to ask though. Why is it you want our partnership to be so devoid of emotion for each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to talk about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. It was selfish of me to pry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its ok.\"</span></div></div>",

It had turned into a peach orange which meant it was getting late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well I guess I should head back into my room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: You want me to walk you back? I don't mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you were about to decline, but then you remembered how Angelia and Tsubaki tried to take you for \"a good time.\" You could use a body guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Sure. Thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you both headed for your room. There was another awkward silence as the two of you walked to your dorm. You had to break the ice somehow so you started up another conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): So....how's Arnett been doing lately?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: She's fine. She finally found a limiter actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Really? Who's the lucky guy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: I think it's a guy named Morrison Abebe. He's a second year like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What's he like?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Well... when I first met him, he seemed to be a little naive. And a little reckless too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Reckless? How do you figure?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Creo could answer, something caught her eye and you saw it too. A third year pandora and her limiter walked past you two. The limiter had blue eyes and short blond hair. He was almost as tall as you, but he was a little shorter. The pandora had long flowing red hair that went all the way to her back and her eyes were bluish green. As they walked past you and Creo, the girl with red hair looked at you. When you looked at her back you saw that her face was a face that you knew all to well. Cold and emotionless. You watched as the pandora and her limiter walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: What the... Who the heck was that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: (name)? Let's go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah. Sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you and Creo started walking again. As you both headed back, you couldn't help but look back at the pandora you saw. You didn't know way, but you felt a strange feeling from that girl. Soon you and Creo were at the the second year dorms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well then. This is my stop. Thanks for walking me home. I guess I'll see you later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: (name) hold on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could head to your dorm. Creo stopped you by gently placing a hand on your shoulder. Also she had a serious and worried look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What is it Creo?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Listen. You need to be careful. Especially with that girl. Avoid her anyway you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Why? Is she bad news?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: You could say that. Her name is Ingrid Bernstein. The Protector of Order. She's a girl that's obsessed with keeping things in order. In fact, she puts order above everything else. Whenever someone breaks rules in the academy, you can be sure that Ingrid will be there to dish out some punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Seriously?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Yeah. So if you see her, try to avoid her as much as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I'll take your word for it. But don't worry, I'll be okay. I can handle myself. Anyway, thanks again for walking me home. I'll see you tomorrow. Say hi to Arnett for me. Later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo watched as you went back to your dorm. Then she started back to her dorm. As she was walking she couldn't help, but feel worried about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo thinking: I hope that (name) will be okay. Seeing Ingrid made me worried a little. But.... I'm sure that he'll be fine. He can take care of himself. I think,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...</span></div></div>",

Then a bright flash of blue light erupted in the middle of the desolate city. When the light dimmed down an R type nova emerged and unleashed a freezing area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo: Target confirmed as type R. Freezing radius estimated to be about 200 meters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInrgid: I'll only need forty seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo: Don't worry. I'll be good for about two minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid materialized her volt weapon which was two bladed tonfa and leaped off the building diving headfirst at the nova. As she fell, Leo extended his hand and prepared to what was coming next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: Activating Ereinbar Set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo: Freezing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ingrid landed on the ground activating the Ereinbar set, Leo activated his freezing so she wouldn't be caught in the nova's freezing. The nova who know noticed Ingrid went on the attack. It fired stigmata shaped fragments from it's arm at a very high velocity. Ingrid dodged them all by twisting and skimming around them eventually coming to a stop behind the nova. Then it was her turn to go on the attack. Her body began glowing blue and she split into four counterparts of herself. All four of the counterparts attacked the nova at once which eventually revealed the core on the nova's chest. Then Ingrid counterparts became one and she delivered the finishing blow by slashing her tonfa in an x right at it's core. The nova was still for a moment, then it exploded with a loud boom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo: Still one minute and twenty seconds remaining. You took exactly forty seconds. Excellent Ingrid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: You too Leo. Well done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo: Hahaha. I think you did a better job than me ma'am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid blushed and looked away to hide her embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: Idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater as Ingrid and Leo were leaving the training area, they were greeted to the sight of a certain petite silver haired girl with her limiter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia: You certainly do live up to your reputation. The Protector of Order, Ingrid Bernstein. It's no wonder that you're the seventh ranked third year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: What the hell do you think you're doing here Attia?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia: Any reason I can't be? If I didn't know any better, I'd think you're not happy to see me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: Then excuse me then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid walked past with Leo wanting to leave Attia behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia: Can you do me a favor? Two of our second years are in need of protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: Which ones?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia: The Untouchable Queen of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid's head turned slightly her eyes focused on Attia. Then she turned her head back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: And who's the other? Another Pandora?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia: Actually the exact opposite. A limiter. You know him as \"The Imperfect Limiter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid's head turned again, this time her eyes were wide with shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: Him? Are you sure?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia only answered with a slight nod. Ingrid's head turned back and after a moment she left with Leo following close behind her. Attia watched them leave with a sly smile on her face pleased that her plan of revenge had been set into motion. Now all she had to do was watch and see what would happen.</span></div></div>",

It was a little dark due to it being so early, but you didn't mind. At least you got to see the sun rise. You didn't know why, but now you had a habit of going to the tree before class began. It helped you relax. You had just walked into the courtyard and were going to go to your resting tree, but then something or should you say someone caught your eye. There a few feet away from you was Satellizer. She was walking around the courtyard trying to kill some time. At first you were gonna go up to her and say hi, but then you sensed something. Something dangerous. You instinctively hid behind a tree and waited for the unknown danger to come out. Then just as you suspected someone came out of the darkness and walked towards Satellizer. At first you couldn't tell who it was, but then you saw her long crimson red hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: It's that girl from yesterday. Ingrid Bernstein. But what's she doing here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: Satellizer El Bridget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid walked around Satellizer as if she was examining and assessing to who she was dealing with.  Then she stood in front of her. Satellizer kept her guard up, readying for a fight if need be. You kept quiet and readied yourself to intervene in case a fight started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer: Who are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: Silly me. Pardon my manners. My name is Ingrid Bernstein. A third year. You've probably heard of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer: Are you here to avenge your slutty friend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Satellizer wielded her volt weapon and dangerously pointed it at Ingrid's neck. You instinctively gulped as you thought things took a turn for the worse. Ingrid looked at the weapon and then back Satellizer. Then she calmly moved her weapon away from her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: I'm well known around here as The Protector of Order. I use my abilities to punish those who induce chaos and disrupt order. Troublemakers like you for example.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer: Is that a fact?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid walked past Satellizer before coming to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: As a pandora, I defend order with every fiber of my being. Find yourself a limiter by noon tomorrow. I will personally see to it that you will pay for what you done. You and your limiter both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ingrid walked away and soon Satellizer left as well. You waited till Satellizer was out of sight before coming out from behind the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Did I just hear what I thought I heard? Ingrid challenged Satellizer to fight?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Ingrid appeared right behind you and when you heard her voice, your heart jumped about ten feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: You know, it's rude to eavesdrop on someone's conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned and took a fighting stance ready to fight. Ingrid stood there calm and composed, but then she began to chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What's so funny?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: You'll have to forgive me. I just thought it was a little amusing how you think that you can fight a pandora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Look lady. I don't know what you want with Satellizer, but if you're messing with her, you're messing with me! And I'm not afraid to fight you if I have to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: I'll gotta hand it to you. You're certainly are brave. Unfortunately you'll have to wait. I'm only here to tell you that you better show up to the fight as well. You're just as guilty as Satellizer is. No. I take it back. Your crimes are much worse than Satellizer's. The only thing I have left to say to you is that you make sure you're there along with Satellizer tomorrow. I want to make sure you both pay for your crimes. Especially you (name). Or should I say, The Imperfect Limiter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ingrid walked away leaving you with your eyes a little wide in shock upon hearing Ingrid's last words. Your heart was thumping loud in your chest and your hands were know shaking a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: How...how did she know that name?! If she knows that then...damn it. First Satellizer and now Ingrid?! Is anyone left who doesn't know? Great. Can things get any more worse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you felt a hand placed on your shoulder. You immediately turned around and prepared to fight the person who tapped your shoulder a little startled, but the person who was behind you was...</span></div></div>",

And I would choose my words carefully because if I don't like your answer, I'll tear you apart and put your head on a mantle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister Margaret was silent. Then Sister Margaret spoke in a calm manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister Margaret: It would be wise for you to calm down Mr. (name). What would the students think if they saw some limiter threatening to kill the headmaster out in the open like this? Especially since that limiter just so happens to have a reputation like yours?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou growled at her words. At much as you hated it, but Sister Margaret was right. This wasn't exactly the place to be taking your anger out on the headmaster at school, no matter how much you hated her. You reluctantly let her go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What do you want this time? I thought I told you the next time I saw you that I won't be held responsible for what I'd do. Not to mention you didn't answer my previous question. Answer me. How do Satellizer and Ingrid know about me? If you told them....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister Margaret: I'm not sure how they know and no I never told anyone. The only thing I can tell you is that they probably must have heard about it from the other sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I see. So what are you doing here? If you've come here just to check up on me, I'm fine. I don't need these surprise visits all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister Margaret: Actually I came to see you for a different reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): And what reason would that be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister Margaret paused impressively. Then she spoke in a low and serious voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister Margaret: There's been a nova sighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you heard the word nova, you felt your heart skip a beat and your blood ran cold. You also had a flashback of your partner dying and the creature that killed her. Just remembering the nova sent an uneasy feeling in your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): You're joking right? If this is your idea of a joke it's not very funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister Margaret: I would never joke about something like that. A nova has been spotted a few hundred yards from here and is getting close to the academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Why are you telling me this? Shouldn't you be sending someone to take care of it or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister Margaret: That's why I'm here speaking to you Mr. (name). I want you help to intercept it and destroy it before it gets any closer to the academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened to the size of saucers and you felt your heart stop for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Say what?! You can't be serious! You expect me to go out there and take care of that nova given my condition?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister Margaret: No. I expect you and Creo to go out there and take of care of that nova given your condition. After all she's your partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Why you smart-ass! How the hell do you know that?!<br>\r\n.<br>\r\nSister Margaret: I have my ways of knowing. In any case, this is a direct order from the higher ups, so you don't have a choice in the matter. Also Creo also has been notified and is on her way to the runway as we speak. You both will be leaving in about nine hundred hours so I would get going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): And I'm assuming if I say no, you'll have me court martialed or some threat like that right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister Margaret answered with a simple nod. There was a moment of silence between the two of you. Then you looked at your watch and saw the time. It was 7:58. It was about an hour and two minutes before the appointed time. You let out a sigh and you finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Fine. I'll go. But don't expect me to be fighting you or those stupid excuses for generals. I'm only doing this because Creo's my partner. And that's what partners do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, you walked away. Sister Margaret watched you walk away with an emotionless expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister Margaret thinking: Now. The test finally begins. I wonder how you will fare Mr. (name)? Will you succeed? Or will you fail?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile as you were heading to the runway where the choppers were, you were trying to get your thoughts together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Damn it all. As if things weren't bad enough. First Ingrid challenges me and Satellizer to a fight and now this crap. Shit! What am I gonna do? If we fight that Nova, there's a possibility that Creo will figure out my secret. I can't let that happen. There's only one thing left to do. I'm gonna have to refrain from using my freezing unless I absolutely have to. It's pretty much my only option. Well then....I guess I better pick up the pace. I don't wanna be late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickened your pace heading for the runway before nine o'clock. A little latter...</span></div></div>",

Come with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu-mei led (name) to a hangar where a black chopper was waiting. Then you both walked into a room with a giant screen. When you both came in, there was someone already in room waiting for the two of you. It was Creo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: (name). You're here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah. More or less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu-Mei: Listen up you two. This is really important, so I need you both to listen very closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Yu-Mei explain the situation about the nova. It was spotted off a few hundred yards from the academy and was heading towards the academy as well. As far as it's objective was, no one knew. All that mattered was that the nova must be taken out before it got any closer to the school. A little later at nine hundred hours, you and Creo were enroute to the coordinates of where the nova was last spotted. As the helicopter carried you both to your destination, you stared out the window in silence watching as the landscape below zipped by. On the outside you looked fine and ready to fight, but on the inside you was very nervous. You were still worried about Creo finding out who you really were. Not to mention you still hold the horrific experience of losing your partner to the nova. Just remembering it sent shivers down your spine.

But the biggest was the simple matter of the inevitability that you were going to tell Creo about how you lost your first love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creo's right, I need to tell her about why this has been such a difficult transition. Now that were fighting together, she needs to know why I'm so emotionally distant. She'll understand why I need this to be devoid of romance. So that I don't lose someone precious to me again.

If you encounter the nova, commence combat operations immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Roger that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilot pulled the level and the hatch door opened. Then you and Creo each put on an earphone so you both can keep in touch with the pilot and the base and jumped out of the ship and into the ground below. It was a bigger drop than you expected, but you managed to land on the ground safely. Then you heard the pilot's voice in your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPilot: Good luck down there. If the nova's too powerful, we'll send for reinforcements immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Roger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe helicopter zoomed away leaving you and Creo alone. You surveyed your surroundings. The scenery was filled with nothing, but trees. From the looks of things, you and Creo were in the middle of the forest and somewhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): So. Any idea where we should start looking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: No clue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I guess we'll just have to look around until we run into it. Hopefully it won't get the drop on us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Don't worry. That nova is going down. I'll make sure of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I know you will. Let's go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you and Creo ventured into the forest in search of the nova. It was very quiet. Not even the sound of birds were chirping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Geez talk about ominous. It's so quiet that not even the animals can be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well there is a nova in this forest after all. So it's only natural that the animals would be scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: And I don't blame them because I'm scared myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Creo looked all over for the nova, but it was nowhere to be found. Then suddenly there was a loud boom that made the ground shake. Then a bright green light shone in the distance which made your heart stop.  You knew exactly what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Hey (name). You know what that was right? (name)?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't answer. You were frozen in fear. You had another one of your flashbacks. You recalled the nova that you and your previous partner fought which caused her death and the face that she had before she died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: (name)! (name)! Snap out of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo's voice snapped you out of your flashback and brought you back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What?! What's going on?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: (name)? What happened? You froze for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I'm fine. I just zoned out that's all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: You're still feeling scared aren't you? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou answered with only a nod. Then Creo came up to you and placed her hands on your shoulders causing you to look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Don't worry. I'll protect you. I'll always be there for you, so there's no reason to be afraid. OKay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo then gave you a reassuring smile that eased a little of your fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Thanks Creo. I feel a little less scared now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Come on. The nova's over there. Let's take it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Creo raced ahead with you following suit. You and Creo kept running following the green light until you came to a clearing. There a few hundred feet from them was the nova. It was the same nova that Ingrid fought in her simulation. Only this one was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: So. There it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): This is (name)! We have a visual! ! I repeat, we have a visual! Target is a type R nova and is estimated to be about two hundred and twenty meters from our position!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu-Mei: Roger that. Commence combat operations. I repeat commence combat operations. Take that nova down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Alright! I'm going!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Be careful Creo. Don't die on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: I won't. I'm counting on you if the nova activates it's freezing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK. I'll do my best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Alright then. Time to take this thing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as Creo charged at the nova ready for battle. You hoped and prayed that Creo would come out of this ordeal alive and also that your freezing wouldn't fail you.</span></div></div>",

You both also felt a shock of pleasure go through your bodies and your senses became one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Volt Weapon deploy! Infinity Fang!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo donned her volt weapon and headed straight for the nova. You stood a few feet back watching the battle from afar, but you stood ready to help in case a problem should arise. The Nova who had now noticed Creo, went on the attack. It fired shards from his arm, but Creo was able to side step the attacks and dodge with them with ease. The nove fired again, this time Creo punched the shards that came her way shattering like ice. She gunned straight for the nova in an acceleration and rapidly punched the nova in different areas at once causing the nova to falter. Then the nova raised one of his arms and brought it down towards Creo trying to squash her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Oh come on. It's gonna to use brute strength to take me down? How boring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the nova's arm could crush her, Creo used an acceleration and got out of the way before the nova crushed her. Then she ran up the nova's arm and rapidly punched the nova in the center until the core of the nova's body was exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: All right! She exposed the core! Now all she has to do is hit the core and take out the nova.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo thinking: This is getting to be way too easy. I was hoping that this thing would put up more of a fight. Oh well. Better end this now while I have the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Creo leaped into the air, ready to deliver the finishing blow. But then suddenly, the nova activated his freezing, releasing a giant green sphere of light around the area. Unfortunately Creo got caught up in the freezing causing her to fall to the ground unable to move. To make matters worse, the nova's wound on it's chest was healing, making it's core safe from harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh no! Creo!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Damn it! I... cant move...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nova who saw that her prey was caught in it's freezing,  began slowly coming towards Creo. You stood in the sidelines, trying to figure out what to do. You knew that had to use your freezing to help her, but you were scared that your freezing wouldn't work and it will be a repeat of what happened before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: This is what I was afraid of!  I have to use my freezing now! But... what if it doesn't work? What if it fails? What if....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had yet another flashback about your partner dying which made you even more scared, but then another flashback came into your head. This time, you saw Creo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(flashback)<br>\r\nCreo: Don't worry. I'll protect you. I'll always be there for you, so there's no reason to be afraid. Okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered that reassuring smile that Creo had and you felt a little less scared. In fact you felt courage welling up inside you. The nova was now preparing to attack Creo with it's shard attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: I know it's been a long time since I've used a freezing and I don't know if I'm capable of using a freezing, but....I have to try. I owe it to Creo! I have to protect her! I have to try!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nova fired it's shard attack Creo wanting to finish her off. You raised your hand and took a deep breath. Then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Creo! Here it comes! FREEZING AREA!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blue pentagon light erupted from your hand and spread throughout the area. It neutralized the nova's freezing and set Creo free. Then she dodged the nova's attack just in the nick of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: I did it! I really did it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen after a few seconds of your freezing being active, it disappeared. The nova fired it's shards again, but this time Creo charged straight at the nova's attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: I was hoping you do that. Now you're going down! Tempest turn!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Creo split into three of herself and punched the shards that fired at her and sent them right back that the nova. The shards impaled the nova one after another and then the nova's core was exposed once again. This time Creo used her acceleration and went straight for the nova's core. From there she gave the nova's core, a devastating and powerful punch. The nova's core began to crack and nova staggered. Creo jumped away before the nova convulsed and then exploded with a loud boom that shook the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yes! She did it! Way to go Creo!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: You too (name). You saved my ass back there. Thanks for the assist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Anytime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard Yu-Mei's voice on the earphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu-Mei: (name)? Creo? Do you copy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Yeah. We read you loud and clear Ms. Yu-Mei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu-Mei: Status report.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Target has been eliminated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu-Mei: Good. Very well done you two. Head back to base. I'm sending a chopper to pick you two up. Stay there and await further instruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Understood. Over and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, you and Creo were picked up by the chopper and were on your way back to the base. By the time you both got to the base it was close to evening. You both were back with Yu-Mei in the debriefing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu-Mei: You did a very good job you two. I'm very proud of you both. Now go and get some rest. You're both dismissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both bowed politely and left. Then you walked with Creo back to the dorms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: (name). You did a pretty good job today. You saved my hide and you helped take out the nova.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well... I didn't do anything special. You did all the heavy work. Besides, my freezing should have came a lot sooner..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Don't be so modest. You did awesome today. If it wasn't for you, I would have been a goner. Thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Um.. yeah. Sure. Anytime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but feel a little embarrassed from Creo's thanks, but you tried not to show it. Soon you arrived to the third year dorm and it was time for you to head back to your dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): All right. I guess I'll see you later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Are you gonna be okay walking back to the dorms?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I'll be fine. I'll see you tomorrow okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Okay then. Be careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen after that you headed back to the dorm. As you were walking back, you thought about what had just happened. You were happy that you were able to use your freezing, but at the same time you were worried that it lasted for a few seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I may have been able to help defeat the nova, but my freezing only lasted for a few seconds. Okay. I'm gonna have to not use my freezing unless I have too. I cant risk Creo knowing about my secret. Ingrid either. Especially since I have to help Satellizer fight her, but on the positive side at least I figured out I can use my freezing again. Anyway I better get some sleep. I got a big day tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

I hope it isn't what I think it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raced towards the direction of where you heard the explosions. As you got closer to where you heard the noise, you heard the sounds again and the sounds of metal clashing. You turned around the corner towards the first year boys dorms and what you saw was what you hoping wouldn't be happening. There was Ingrid holding Satellizer by the hair lifting her off the ground. Satellizer looked barely conscious as she hung there helplessly. From the looks of things, Satellizer and Ingrid were engaged in battle and Ingrid was winning. Meanwhile a certain conniving third year who set these two up against each other was sitting in her room a couple buildings down.  She closed her phone and looked back at the scene below with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia: Well. Maybe it's a good thing I didn't call Leo. And it looks like our final star has finally shown up. Now things will get interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the fight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: Don't tell me you passed out already. We're not finished yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Damn it. I knew it had to be those two. And from the looks of it, Satellizer's getting her ass handed to her. I gotta go help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo: Ingrid!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Leo came running to the scene towards Ingrid .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: Leo?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment when Ingrid looked back at Leo, Satellizer used the distraction to her advantage to break free of Ingrid's grip and distanced herself away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: You're not giving up huh? You don't have a chance in hell for beating me, you must know that. I even gave you time to find a limiter and you ambushed me. And that's why I'm going to engage the Ereinbar set and wipe you off the face of the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer got up and readied herself to continue the fight, not ready to give in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: Very well. I'll give you one last chance. Seeing as how we're by the first year boy's dorm, if you can find someone stupid enough to be your limiter, I'll wait until the baptism has taken place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned toward the first year boys who were watching the fight from the balconies above along with the other students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: Well boys? Will none of you come to the aid of The Untouchable Queen? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up to where you were hiding at the first years. None of them said a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Damn it. I can't blame those guys. Not only are they terrified of Satellizer, but even if they wanted to help her, Ingrid wouldn't hesitate to punish them. Someone's gotta do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: Looks like you're out of luck. Now Leo!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo: Yes ma'am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: This isn't good. If they engage the Ereinbar set now, Satellizer doesn't stand a chance. I gotta get in there and help her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were just about to jump in to stop Leo and Ingrid, when you heard a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: Hold on! Wait!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice belonged to kazuya. He had now joined the fray and was ready to fight with Satellizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: I'll do it! I will become Satellizer's limiter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: Well. I never expected anyone to come to her defense. I guess you have the right. But let me warn you before you join up with her. She is an enemy or hierarchy and order. If you become her limiter tonight, you will share her fate. Are you prepared for that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: Look ma'am, I didn't come to this school to rock the boat all right? But I'll be damned if I sit back and watch you both gang up on Satellizer like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you came out from the corner and joined the fight as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): That goes double for me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya and Satellizer were surprised with your sudden appearance while Ingrid's eyes narrowed in a glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: (name)? What are you doing here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What's it look like? I'm here to lend a hand. You are my friends after all. I'm not gonna stand by while my friends are getting picked on by a third year. Especially this girl right here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer thinking: These two.. Why would they...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: So (name) too huh? It won't make a bit of difference. It saves me the trouble of finishing you off later. I'll take all of you out. Hurry and perform the baptism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: Satellizer listen. I know we've only known each other for a short time, but I want to help you. Please administer the baptism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer: I....I can't...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were expecting for Satellizer to be all for going for the baptism, but you were surprised to see that Satellizer was blushing and avoiding eye contact with Kazuya. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: Why not? At this rate, you'll never win Do you hate me that much?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah Satellizer. What's wrong? You need administer the baptism for Kazuya right? So why can't you do it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer: Because... it's dirty. It's so dirty that I can't stand it! The sensation is like my body is being licked! The Ereinbar set...makes me sick to my stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer turned away blushing in shame while everyone else who heard it looked on with confusion. You, Ingrid, and Leo on the other hand blushed with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: I didn't know forming the Ereinbar set was as nasty as all that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Kazuya I can assure you, it's nothing what Satellizer is saying or thinking. I mean... it's a little weird but...it's not what you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: He's right. Sharing your sensory input with someone does take a little getting used to, but there's nothing wrong with it. Most people think that their first set was a sacred experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I wouldn't go as far as sacred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: Enough! Leo, form the Ereinbar set!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo: Yes ma'am!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo and Ingrid both began to glow as they activated the Ereinbar set. Leo then immediately activated his freezing area. Satellizer tried to get out of the way, but she was still hurt from Ingird's recent assualt resulting her being caught of Leo's freezing. Ingrid then closed in on Satellizer, ready to finish her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: You're finished Satellizer!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Kazuya stepped in and lauched his freezing knocking Ingrid back and canceling Leo's freezing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: Impossible! How the hell can he cast a freezing area without a baptism? In that case, I better take care of you first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed in on Kazuya preparing to strike him down, but you rushed in and went straight for Ingrid defending him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): No you don't!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attacked Ingrid with a flurry of punches and kicks, but Ingrid dodged them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: Oh please. Did you really think that a little boy like you can land a blow on someone like me? You're wasting your time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): We'll see about that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you attacked again. This time Ingrid sidestepped the blow and used her tonfa to hit you in the stomach sending you few feet into the air and straight to the ground hard. You gasped trying to catch your breath. You were about to get up and try to fight again, but you found Ingrid standing over you preparing to strike you with her tonfa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: Now. It's time I finished you off. Time for you to be punished!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you thought you were done for....</span></div></div>",

Ingrid recoiled back from being caught off guard. You immediately sprang to your feet and went straight for Ingrid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: She's dropped her guard! Now's my chance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) aloud: Take this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swung your right fist and punched Ingrid in the face hard. The blow echoed around the area. Everyone who had just watched what happened could not believe their eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaho: Did.... Did he just....?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur: He punched her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo: No Ingrid!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo rushed to Ingrid's side as she stepped back holding her cheek in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): How'd you like that? Didn't think I could land a blow did you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo: Ingrid, are you alright? Come on talk to me! Say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid said nothing. Then she looked up her face etched with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: Damn you... Damn you for disrupting the order of things!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: How come keeping people in line is the only thing that you care about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah! What's the point?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: Shut up! You will submit!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid went on the attack again gunning straight for you, but Satellizer jumped in and blocked it with her Nova Blood. Then both fighters used Acceleration and were fighting at high speeds, while you and Kazuya could only watch trying to keep up with the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Man. This is crazy. This is even more intense than when we fought Miyabi earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: Why is she so obsessed with order?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Beats me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(voice): You haven't figured it out yet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kazuya turned to the sound of the voice and there was Ganessa Roland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGanessa: That's her pet cause. She's as committed to upholding her as her responsibilities as a pandora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Wait a sec. It's you! You're that girl from before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGanessa: And you're that limiter everyone's been chatting about. I must say that you're not what I expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: Ganessa, is there a reason why she's like this? If there is, would you please tell us?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGanessa paused. Then her face turned solemn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGanessa: The reason being is because of of a friend of hers. It happened a little over a year ago, when I was still  a first year at West Genetics. The Untouchable Queen hadn't been there back then and I'd say it was a good thing she wasn't. The faculty sent us on an off-site carnival for the first years for experience and to toughen them up. Then suddenly, a Type S nova appeared out of nowhere causing our platoon to panic and broke formation. A support group was sent and defeated the Type S, but sadly the platoon leader, Marin Maxwell didn't make it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): So...in other words, Ingrid watched her die?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: I can't imagine what she went through losing a friend like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGanessa: Those two were inseparable best friends. I'm sure that Ingrid believes that if the first years had maintained discipline and upheld order, Marin wouldn't have died that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): That's... so sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now felt sorry for Ingrid for finding out her reasons for being obsessed with order. In a way, you could relate as to how she was feeling losing when it came to losing someone special to you. Suddenly an explosion interrupted your train of thought. Satellizer wasn't able to protect herself from Ingrid's attack and was sent to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: Now Leo!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo: Right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo activated his freezing holding Satellizer in place. Kazuya immediately upped the power of his freezing, casting an omnidirectional freezing, cancelling out Leo's freezing and making Ingrid unable to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: He cast an omnidirectional freezing?!? Impossible! This unbapitized freak has the same abilities as a nova?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia who was still watching the scene jumped up at the sight of what had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia: Impossible! Who the heck is this kid and how is he able to do that?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the fight...<br>\r\n(name): Kazuya! Keep it up! I'll take out the limiter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: What are you waiting for Leo?! Hurry up and undo that little bastard's freezing already! He's headed straight for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo only had enough time to look up at your fist connecting to his face. You gave Leo a right cross to the face, then a left, a knee to the stomach and a spinning roundhouse kick sending Leo to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: Leo!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Satellizer! Take her out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer went straight for Ingrid ready to finish it. With her limiter unconscious and herself being caught in Kazuya's freezing, it seemed that Ingrid was finished. Or so you thought. Ingrid had one more technique she had at her disposal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: Activate, Pandora Mode!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an explosion of power, Ingrid's hair turned white, rings of light appeared around her wrists and ankles, and her eyes turned golden yellow as her Pandora Mode was activated. She also was now unaffected by Kazuya's freezing as she slowly walked towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: She's activated Pandora Mode?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): So... this is the form a pandora takes when she engages Pandora Mode. The technique a Pandora can use to move freely around a freezing field without being frozen. I've heard tales about it, but... I never imagined I'd get to see it with my own eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: Now it's time for you pay for your crimes! Anyone who flouts the rules will one day abandon their comrades! It's my duty to make sure that pointless deaths like Marin's will never happen again. And they only way to do that is to purging these weaklings from our ranks!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid slashed her tonfa creating an air vacuum shock wave that was able to reach Satellizer who was a few feet away. Ingrid launched the shock wave again. Satellizer tried to defend herself, but due to the overwhelming power, Satellizer was knocked to the ground and her volt weapon was destroyed entirely.  When Satellizer's eyes regained focus, she saw that Ingrid was standing over with her weapon raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: You will die so that others may live!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to drive her weapon down to deliver the finishing blow, but then you stood in her path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: Get out of my way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Never! You think that killing those who defy the rules is something that will help people live?! That's wrong! It's nothing more, but utter nonsense. If your friend Marin saw you the way you were right now, she'd not only disapprove of this, but she'd be ashamed of you! Especially after what you just said!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: Shut up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid then hit you in the face on the blunt end of her tonfa. You were sent flying into the air and face first to the ground. You felt like you just got hit by a truck. You tried to get back on your feet, but you couldn't. Ingrid was now standing behind you ready to strike you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: I was gonna save you for last after I finished The Untouchable Queen, but now I'm letting you die first! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid raised her tonfa and prepared to strike you, but then another freezing area spread and forced Ingrid to the ground and at the same time deactivating her pandora mode. You looked to see the person who cast the freezing was none other than Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): His freezing was not only stronger, but it was able to shut down Ingrid's Pandora Mode? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: He's right Ingrid. And I think so too!  How could you say that about Marin? How could you even think that her death was pointless when we all know it wasn't!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: What the hell do you know!? You've never even heard of her before tonight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: You're right! I don't know! All I know about her is what I heard about her. But still, her death could've never been pointless. When she died I think that she upheld the principles of a Pandora all the way to the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: Shut up... Shut the hell up!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: She could've never had died in vain. And neither did my sister!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: Your sister?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer: That boy is Kazuya Aoi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid: Aoi? Wait... don't tell me that you sister was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: My sister said to me that it wasn't just stigmata that she carried on her back. She carried our hopes and dreams as well because we are the only ones that can defeat the nova. Those were her last words before she died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he finished, a tear slid down his cheek. Then Ganessa walked up next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGanessa: I agree as well. When the first years left Marin, she never called them back into formation. Instead she told them to run. Marin knew that the first years wouldn't stand a chance against the nova the way they were due to them not having limiters. So she stayed behind to fight the nova to buy time so the first years could escape. She could have gotten away, but didn't. She wanted to protect the underclassmen no matter what, even at the cost of her own life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid began to cry realizing that Marin's death wasn't pointless and that she was wrong about everything. Satellizer walked up to Ganessa with a puzzled look on her face as if she was asking why she had intervened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGanessa: What's that look? Gratitude? Don't get the wrong idea. I didn't do it as a favor. I only did it because she had to find out sooner or later and it seemed like a good time as any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ganessa walked past Satellizer and headed back to her dorm. As you, Kazuya, and Satellizer, you all headed back to your respective dorms as well. Back in her room, Attia was angry that her plan had failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia: Damn. That didn't work out the way I hoped. No thanks to that boy Kazuya my plan backfired. No matter. I got other ways of getting payback at you (name). It's only a matter of time.</span></div></div>",

(sigh) Anyway, I better get some sleep. Today may have been crazy, but that doesn't mean tomorrow won't be better.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two days had passed since the fight with Ingrid. It was another day of class and learning about the nova for you. You sat through class listening to the lecture that you've heard a lot of times before. A holographic picture of a nova appeared in front of the classroom. It wasn't a perfect picture, but you didn't need a picture to remember the details what a nova was and what it could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu-Mei: This is your standard Nova. As you already know when they materialize into our world from their dimension, all living things are forcibly restrained within a certain range. To put it simply, their appearance causes a freezing area. This is where the limiter must do his part to neutralize the Nova's freezing area and create an area within which his pandora can kill her enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked over at Kazuya who was staring at the Yu-Mei taking in every bit of her lecture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: A freezing huh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(flashback)<br>\r\nIngrid: He cast an omnidirectional freezing?!? Impossible! This unbaptized freak has the same abilities as a nova?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: I still don't get it. Kazuya shouldn't be able to cast a freezing due to him being unbaptized, but he was able to do so anyway. How?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater after class, you decided to ask him and find out for yourself. Just as you left the classroom, you saw Kazuya heading down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Kazuya! Wait up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: Oh. Hey (name). What's up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Listen. There's something that I have to ask you about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: What is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): It's about what happened the other night. You know, the fight with Ingrid. How did you do that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: Do what exactly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): You know what I'm talking about. Your freezing. How were you able to use a freezing field to that degree? I've never seen anything like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya thought about this scratching his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: Hmm. I....I don't know how I did that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What?! You're kidding me! You really don't know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: Um....yeah....no idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Seriously? You've never been baptized and you cast a freezing out of the blue and you're telling me that you don't know how you did it?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: Yeah more or less. Satellizer was in trouble and the freezing just sort of happened. I know it's weird, but that's what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I see. Hmm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya: Anyway sorry to run, but I gotta go meet Arthur and Hiragi. Apparently they wanted to talk to me about something too. I'll see you later (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Wait Kazuya..!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could stop him, Kazuya had dashed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Geez. So much for that. I wish that he knew how to. I'd give anything to have a freezing like that. But sadly I can't. I may be able to use a freezing now, but it's weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at your hand and memories of your past came back into your mind. Then you remembered the time that you activated your freezing when you and Creo encountered the Nova. You clenched your fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): If I didn't activate my freezing right when the nova activated it's freezing, Creo would be dead. I have to make sure that she doesn't know anything about this. For that matter, I have to make sure that no one knows about this. Especially Creo. If she were to find out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(voice): Hey! (name)! There you are!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard a voice call out to you snapping you out of your thoughts.

You took a shower and then you got dressed making sure that you were at least half way decent. You were wearing black dress shoes, a pair of black dress pants, a white t-shirt with a white button down. You looked at yourself in the mirror checking to see if there was anything out of place. Everything looked fine. You had never dressed up fancy for a dinner before. To be honest, it had been a while since you had went out with anybody and you were feeling a little nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Okay. Looks like I'm good to go. It's definitely been a while since I've went out like this. I hope that Creo and Arnett don't think this looks too weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you realized something. This was the first time in a while that you cared about how you looked. You haven't felt this way since you were with Makoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Why in the world am I caring about what Creo and Arnett thinks about how I look? I never before so... why now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also remembered Creo looking a little nervous when she was asking you to dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): And also.... I wonder why Creo was acting nervous like that? I mean we're just going out to dinner right? It's not like this a date or anything. Wait a minute. Could it be that she wants it to be a date? But... that would mean that she.... No. It couldn't be. I specifically made this relationship emotionally void. I promised myself I'd never fall in love again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked yourself in the mirror and stared at yourself for a minute or two. Then you sighed and ran a hand through your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Good grief (name). What's wrong with you? You've become so depressed that you've practically forgotten how to be happy. I got to try to be more positive. Maybe going out tonight will help me clear my head. Well, I better get going. Don't want to be late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making sure you looked good and nothing was out of place, you headed out. A little later, you arrived to where you were supposed to meet Creo and Arnett. When you went inside, you were amazed. It was a lot bigger than it was outside. Inside there were three separate rooms. The first was the main hall where everyone dined on cuisine and other foods. The second room had a bar where you can booze it up while watching TV. The third was a dance floor where you can dance the night away. It was pretty much like a night club. One thing was for sure, you had never seen a place quite like this before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Man. This place is pretty swanky. I definitely have never been in a place like this before. I wonder how Creo knows this place? For that matter, where is she? I hope she's not running late. Maybe I should find her at a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

She was in a stunning dress in red complete with having brushed up her makeup, sporting a hot red color on her lips and green eye shadow. She effortlessly took your breath away, leaving your mind as blank as a rock. \"Hello (Name).\", she said politely. Your dumbfounded face worried her for a moment until she snapped her fingers in your face bringing you back to earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah..uhhh...hey.\", you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong with how I appear to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly hot....I mean not. Not. Certainly not hehe. (Jeez pull yourself together. Remember that there is no room for this anymore.)\", you quickly took a deep breath and finally regained your senses. You started acting normal at last and didn't let Creo's fetching looks distract you. You held out your arm so she could cling to it like an old fashioned refined couple while you two made your way to your seats. Arnett and her limiter were already seated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Morrison this is my friend (Name).\", she introduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.\", you shook his hand with him having a likewise reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what you've seen tonight?\", Arnett asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah this place looks fantastic.\", you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but anything else? Ahem!\", she exhaled heavily hinting at Creo most obviously. You already did and truth be told you liked it a lot but that wasn't what you and her agreed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm positive, I was so nice looking he froze in place. And no limiter was around to force him.\", Creo replied taking a friendly jab at your reaction. You felt embarrassed by it but frankly you were determined to get some shred of payback later tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple hours passed after having a pleasant dinner conversation with Arnett, Morrison, and Creo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that is how me and this lovely young lady ended up as my pandora.\", Morrison ended his story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Revolving around a fountain? People get introduced so abnormally. This place is cursed to have people meet under crazy circumstances.\", you replied. Arnett and Creo laughed at your general comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So (Name) have you ever danced before with a pandora?\", Arnett asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually you didn't even with Makoto, \"Not really.\", you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tEj6gXA_eA\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tEj6gXA...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on loosen up. Very least see how it's done.\", she took your hand and took you out on the dance floor. \"Hold my waist, get in close, take my hand, and now just move with the music.\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a bit flustered being near her like this and considering her feelings for you in the past it made you feel uncomfortable. However while you two danced you both seemed to be doing fine as a pair. In fact ounce you were amazed by how easily you followed her, the awkwardness left you. Creo saw you two dancing and was pretty happy that you were feeling comfortable being around someone. The only one not too pleased was Arnett's limiter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swoop in on my girl huh? Well two can play at this game.\", he thought. Morrison took Creo's hand and danced with her two trying to make you jealous. While you and Arnett were enjoying yourselves you noticed Creo with him but for some reason you felt unhappy about it. Arnett noticed and got very mad ending your dance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morry what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dancing with your friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock it off, it's about as opposite from what your thinking as it gets. (Name) doesn't mean that way to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought he did.\", said Creo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriosuly? C'mon it's always been the norm for a pandora and limiter to be lovers. That's how me and Morry are.\", Arnett said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except what about the ones who don't think that way?\", you interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name)?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arnett I appreciate what your doing but you have got to stop.There is a reason why were not a couple, me and Creo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? She's not pretty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not your type?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have to answer you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wait I think we both deserve one (Name). I'm your partner and if either of us are going to survive you need to be honest with me.\", Creo protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Tell us why you don't want to be with Creo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it Arnett.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I CAN'T BE REJECTED AGAIN!\", you yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took off leaving without saying a word. Creo and Arnett were stunned by your answer. Suddenly it all became clear as to why you were so distant. They understood now.</span></div></div>",

Being a limiter, the Nova, and pandoras. You couldn't seem to take it anymore after having all of them cause you nothing but consistent grief. You kept like this until you heard someone knocking at the door, \"(Name) please open up.\", it was Creo. You weren't angry at her at all, yet you replied in an angry tone, \"Leave me alone Creo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) please, I want to talk to you. I want to help you, and I can only do that unless you talk to me. Why are you so angry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to talk about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That isn't an excuse anymore, you've put this off long enough and I deserve an answer.

I......I don't know. Sigh............Creo I'm not mad at you. Or Arnett.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then tell me what your so angry about so I can help understand you. Let me in.\", Creo waited patiently until you finally did. You sat on the bed with Creo sitting across from you on a chair waiting to hear your story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It happened last year, I was already a limiter to another pandora. We were a pair for two years, we were close. Closer than I thought we would be. Her name was Makoto, we hit it off well and we worked well against the Nova's but even better we seemed to be great together when we weren't risking our lives. I fell in love with her and assumed she loved me back. Mind you we had done the baptism and had slept together for months trying to boost our compatibility. But I found out one day she didn't love me back. He.....after all we were ALL we been through she felt nothing back. She had her eyes set on some other limiter, but she wasn't going to dump me for him, she wasn't cruel. It's just she honestly didn't fell the same way yet all we did was nothing but intimate. Things fell apart after that and............came back here to find another pandora. One that wouldn't make me go through that same thing again. To tell you the truth Makoto was a lot like Arnett, sweet, lovely, looked interested in me romantically. As much as would like to date her, this kinda thing isn't how I can really feel for someone anymore. That's why you were the only person I could turn to to be my pandora.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo felt your emotional turmoil and hugged you tightly. You stood still unable to properly return it. Creo met with your eyes, you two looked deep into them. You each felt something you looked away, you couldn't make the same mistake again. Creo let go and left for her own dorm, \"Hey, I care about you no matter if I think of you as either a friend or a lover.\", she said finally leaving.</span></div></div>",

When you were fighting with her and when you hanging with her. Then you shook your head as if you were trying to shake the thoughts out of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Ah. Who am I kidding? Creo says that now, but if she were able to find out the truth about what happened to Makoto, she'd hate me. Arnett too. In fact, the whole school would probably hate me if anyone found out. (sigh) Damn it. Why do things always have to be this way? Can things get anymore complicated?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly as if right on cue, there was a knock on your door. You sighed with exasperation as you got up and headed for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Looks like I spoke to soon. It's probably Arnett wanting to check up on me too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went to the door and opened it. You were expecting it to be Arnett and were ready to tell her that you needed to be left alone, but it wasn't Arnett. It was Arthur. The boy who you saw hanging out with Kazuya before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Wait. You're a friend of Kazuya's. Arhtur right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur: I'm so sorry to bother you this late sir, but there's been trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What kind of trouble?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur: It's Kazuya. He's been...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later, you and Arthur were running towards to other part of the academy. Arthur brought you up to speed of what happened along the way. Apparently Satellizer had invited Kazuya to her room and he along with Arthur and Kaho were heading for the second year girl's dorm. Then they were confronted by three second years, Audrey Duval, Tris Mckenzie and Aika Takeuchi. All three of them had all lost to Satellizer in the recent carnival and upon hearing Kazuya becoming Satellizer's limiter, decided to take out their frustrations out on him and tortured Kaho and Arthur who had interfered. Kazuya activated his freezing to try and them, but then he fainted process. Then a girl came and rescued them by defeating all the second years at once. Soon afterwards Kazuya and Kaho were transferred to the infirmary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): So how's Kazuya now? Is he alright?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur: I don't know. All I know is, he hasn't woken up since he lost consciousness and they moved him to the infirmary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they rounded the corner to where the infirmary was. When you got to the infirmary, you were surprised to find that there was someone waiting outside of the infirmary. She had waist-length blue hair that was tied in a ponytail by orange hair bands. She was young and had blue eyes and she had a small blue tattoo in the corner of her left eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): And... who might this be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur: Oh. That's the one who saved us. I've never seen her before though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl with blue hair stood up from the bench and gave you a friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl: Hello there. Are you a classmate of Kazuya's?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yes I am. Um... pardon me, but.... how is he? I mean Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl: Don't worry. The doctor said that he'll be fine. Perhaps you along with your friend inside would like to wait with me. My hope is that the doctor will allow him to have visitors soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Wait a sec. \"wait with you\"? Are you... a student here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl: Well I haven't been enrolled in this academy yet, but I will be first thing tomorrow. My name is Rana Linchen. It's very nice to meet you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Rana Linchen huh? I'm guessing you're a transfer student?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Arthur interrupted. He led Rana away down the hall close to another room down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur: Hey! Rana? Could I borrow you for a quick moment? Hiragi said that she wants thank you for saving her life too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRana: But I'm waiting to see Kazuya!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur: Just trust me on this okay? This has to come first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Arthur led Rana disappeared into the darkness of the hallway leaving you by yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Now what was that all about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the door opened and out walked Elize Schmitz another teacher at the academy. You immediately went up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Excuse me? Ms. Schmitz?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElize: (name)? This certainly is a surprise. Can I help you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah. I'm here to see Kazuya Aoi. Is he okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElize: Kazuya? Oh yeah. He's fine. He's just exhausted that's all. You sound worried about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well... I'm not. I mean...maybe just a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElize: It's okay. It's only natural to be worried about about a friend. You know Satellizer showed up not to long ago as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): She's in there too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElize: Yes. She may be the Untouchable Queen, but she cares about her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she walked past you leaving you standing outside Kazuya's room. At first you weren't sure if you should go see them or not because you wanted to respect Satellizer's and Kazuya's privacy, but at the same time you wanted to know if Kazuya was alright. Then Elize spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElize: Well? What are you waiting for? Go see them. You can least stop by and say hi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): But I...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElize: He needs his friends by his side. Sometimes seeing your friends can help ease some stress off your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Wait. How do you...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can ask what Elize was talking about she had already left leaving you by yourself. After hearing what Elize had said, you knew that she was talking about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): How could she possibly know about....? Never mind. I guess I'll go see them. Maybe it will ease some stress off my mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you knocked on the door and entered. You found Satellizer standing next to Kazuya wearing a satin outfit.Satellizer heard you come in, she was looked up in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer: (name), it's you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer: What are you doing here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I figured that I stopped by for a little visit. So, how is he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer: He's fine, but he's still unconscious. The doctor said he'll be back in class tomorrow morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): That's good news. By the way, what's with the getup? I mean are those pj's or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer immediately blushed and looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer: Y-yes! These are pj's! Got a problem with what I wear?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hahaha. No. Not at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer: In any case, where have you been? I haven't seen you for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well... let's just say that I've been busy with stuff. In fact, I got a lot on my mind at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer: I see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long pause. You didn't know what to say or how to break the silence. Then you had a thought. Satellizer knew your secret and yet here she was talking to you. This made you feel a little curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey Satellizer. Can I ask you something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer: What is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well... do you...consider me a friend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer looked at you in mixture of confusion and surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer: What makes you ask that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): It's just a question. I\"m curious that's all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer: Well to be perfectly honest, when I first heard of you and what you did I hated you. But... that all changed a little while back. When we were all together back at lunch and when you and Kazuya stood up for me, I realized that you couldn't be all bad. So... yes. I consider you a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were taken aback by Satellizer's response, but at the same time you felt a little better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Thanks Satellizer. That means a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer: Sure. Anytime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Anyway, I gotta go. I don't want to interrupt your alone time with Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer: Shut up would you? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hehehe. See you in class tomorrow. Try not to stay up too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, you left the infirmary. As you stood outside the door, you thought about what Satellizer said. You couldn't help, but smile a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Heh. Thanks Satellizer. At least there's someone who considers me a friend regardless of my past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you went back to your dorm room wanting to get some sleep.</span></div></div>",

One thing was for sure, she had never seen you in such a state before. She wanted to find a way to help you and to make it better, but she didn't know how to. Then she decided to head to the pool to try to ease her stress. She went to the locker rooms and changed into her swimsuit. She wore a white two piece swimsuit with green around the edges. When finished getting dressed, she walked to the pool area. As she came in she noticed that Arnett was already there dipping her feet into the pool. When Arnett saw Creo, she immediately went up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: Creo! There you are!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Hey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: So how'd go with (name)? Is he okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: To be perfectly honest, I'm not really sure. But he's not angry at us if that's what you mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: But... was it true about what he said? Was he distant because of a heartbreak or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Creo explained about what you told her about your past. When she finished telling the story, Arnett looked at Creo her eyes wide in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: You gotta be kidding me... So that's why he was acting the way he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Yeah. I know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: And he was partners with a girl named Makoto? I've never heard of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Me either. I'm guessing that she was a Pandora that attended a different academy along with (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: Yeah. That also explains why he kept his distance from me. Damn. I feel so sorry for him. I wish there was something we could do for him. I especially want to give Makoto a piece of my mind! Why would she even reject (name) like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(voice): It was because she was forced to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett and Creo turned around and there walking towards them was Attia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: Attia? Wait, what are you talking about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia: As you recall, Creo told you that Makoto had her eyes on another limiter right? Well there's a logical explanation on that. It was because the limiter that Makoto had her eyes on... was seduced by someone who wanted to make (name) suffer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: What?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett stood up and looked at Attia in shock while Creo sat still and listened quietly. Attia continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia: You see she liked (name) and wanted to be with him. However, when she found out that (name) liked Makoto, her lover grew into jealousy and hate. She wanted to make (name) pay for liking another woman so she made a plan to make him pay. She was aware that Makoto didn't feel the same way about him and she liked another limiter, so she took the limiter that Makoto liked and she pushed Makoto towards (name). She hoped that (name) would end up being heartbroken and distant after finding out about his crush didn't love him. Sad thing is, she actually managed to succeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: That's... that's so messed up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett's hands clenched into fists almost to the point of drawing blood. Creo simply sat still and didn't say a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: Who the hell would want to do such a thing to (name)?! Tell us!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia was silent and then she looked up with a evil glint in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia: Satellizer El Bridget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Attia said her name, Arnett gasped in shock and Creo's eyes snapped open in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: No way... The Untocuhable Queen? She's the one responsible?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia: I'm afraid so. When some of the third years told me about it, I was as shocked as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett was silent clenching her fists again. Then she face turned into an angry scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: That bitch... she'll pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia: I figured that you would react that way Arnett. But you'll have to be patient. I already have a plan set to make The Untouchable Queen pay. You two are my back up plan if all else fails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: But...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Creo suddenly stood up which made Arnett go quiet and for the first time since Attia came in, she spoke in a low tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Attia. What you're saying about Satellizer... is this true?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia: Yes. It is. I've never lied to you before have I?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: Good. That's all I need to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett: Creo? Are you OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo was silent. Then when Arnett looked at Creo's face, she saw that Creo's face was filled with nothing but anger. Pure anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo: To be honest, no. I feel angry and the need to punch something. But I know who I can take it out on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia: Easy there Creo. Like I said, you're the back-up. I've got a plan set to make sure that Satellizer pays. But for now, try to keep your anger in check. Save it for when you need to fight Satellizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo said nothing with her hands clenched into fists and her teeth grinding in anger. Then she left the pool. At first Arnett, didn't know what to say or do but then she followed suit. After they both had left, Attia went over to a table and sat down. She smirked in triumph pleased with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia: That takes care of my back up plan. Now all I have to do is have a chat with our cute little exchange student and then (name) is as good as done. One thing's for sure, things have gotten a little interesting around here.</span></div></div>",

You were getting in too deep in this partnership and it was worrying you more and more. Yet the alternative to remain distant felt just as sickening if not more so than speaking the truth it felt. Would she understand? Would she forgive? How would the others react? Probably with disdain and anger and disgust for having known you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that there were dozens of points you could have said the truth much earlier and sparred them the pain quicker but remained silent. It wasn't your fault you said over and over, it wasn't hers, it happened. But things ended terribly, multiplied by how she wound up after the fact. Her death and how you both felt before hand was the worst period of your life and you wouldn't repeat the past. But you couldn't make the steps to lead you away from them.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The class was all grouped together and it was the only thing outside of tournament competition where a taste of real combat could be experienced among the limiters and pandoras. Soon as you went out in the field you linked up with Creo, you were still curious regarding her question about you and Satellizer so you figured get it out of the way now. \"Hey Creo,\", you said hugging her, \"Quick question why did you ask about Satellizer earlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo didn't want to say because she thought talking about your previous relationship and the behind the scenes regarding it would place you into an unfocused state of mind. So she cleverly dodged the question by changing the topic to something else more technical. \"(Name) I have been thinking lately and, I think maybe....we need to break down our physical barrier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) about what I said after you told me your past it got me to think about how I feel about you.\", her words wiped away what you asked about earlier in the beat of a heart. It felt like she was going to confess something to you. From the tone of it she seemed to have an attraction to you and it was obviously mutual to you alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creo are you saying-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not saying anything because I don't know yet. But,\", she placed her hand on your cheek, \"I may give you an answer yet.\", soon as she finished she held you tightly around her arms. Your heart beated fast, you returned her hug, your faces were touching side by side. You weren't sure what it meant but it meant something good. For the very first time since Makoto, you felt like maybe in all of the chaos the world gave you managed to find love. It couldn't be the same, it wasn't, no Creo was special and you felt nervous but still excited. Giving it more thought you had a sense even if she didn't like, LIKE you, she would say it where it wouldn't come close to how Makoto broke your heart. Never again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon as you let go Creo smiled in both relief and excitement. She was happy to finally say what was on her mind with you but felt like she could enjoy how you were taking the news. A bit of pride washed over her seeing how, while not advertised, you clearly showed signs that you were ecstatic about her trying to figure out if you were her guy. Or more accurately THE guy for her. She saw how from the blush on your face if stoked up something in you, but from the limiter exercises you were putting in a lot more aggression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class went on like usual with the typical order but it was time for a match between two sets of pandora and limiters. Given recent events it was no shock to anyone that Rana would be the one to be called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK Rana now is there anyone exactly you would like to spar with?\", the coach asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I would like to make a suggestion, I know it is non-traditional but wouldn't it be a good idea to have Rana's opponent be a pair randomly selected, in both limiter and pandora class?\", said one of the classmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is an excellent suggestion. Something to note: In battle despite your survival chances being slim if separated with your designated partner, it is always in good thought to have some connectivity with more than one pandora or limiter. That way two teams can work together to kill a Nova.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about the Untouchable Queen?\", said a random student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And (Name).\", said the one who made the suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea.\", the coach agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure about this and thought that this was crazy, \"Creo I don't think partner switching is a wise idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine working with other pandoras helps our real partners see how well we work as a unit. Helps forge bonds with our partners.\", Creo reassured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just that I never had that in my academy.\", you felt better seeing Creo wasn't too worried even with Satellizer being your partner for the match. Satellizer herself on the other hand didn't like the fact. Kazuya understood her and was the only one she would allow to be her limiter. However she didn't refuse to the circumstances being that you two have an understanding and you two were able to tolerate the other. This would defiantly be an educational match.</span></div></div>",

This battle will be between Rana Linchen vs Satellizer El Bridget and a limiter (name).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRana took her stance and Satellizer took hers. You took a stance as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure you stay back (name),\" said Satellizer. \"I don't want you getting hurt. Plus, I want you to be ready when you deploy your freezing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Satellizer deployed her volt weapon Nova Blood and went on the attack. She slashed at Rana aiming for her chest, but then Rana suddenly leaped into the air and dodged Satellizer's attack. The class gasped in wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! You see that?\" one student said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She jumped so high! And she's fast!\" said another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Rana went on the offensive and attacked Satellizer with a flurry of punches. Satellizer dodged each and every punch and attacked again with her blade, but once again Rana ducked and dodged the attack once more and she attacked again, but Satellizer was able to dodge by stepping back out of the way. Seeing Rana's moves and how she dodged made you get that she was a close range fighter like you which made you want to take a crack at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Satellizer, let me have a go at her,\" you said running towards Rana joined the fray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer was about to protest, but you were already on Rana. Rana was a little surprised at first, but she accepted your challenge. You attacked Rana with a series of punches and then went for kicks. This time instead of punching, Rana met your blows head on with her own. When you both broke away, Rana spoke to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive,\" she said. \"I've never seen anyone like you match my blows before. Even though I'm holding back a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same to you,\" you replied. \"You're not so bad yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both then clashed again kick with kick and punch with punch. You were a little surprised at first, but at the same time you felt a little excited. The class was a little excited too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check that out! (name)'s not a bad fighter!\" A girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. He can definitely hold his own in a fight. That's for sure.\" said a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is Creo's limiter after all,\" said a third. \"Maybe Creo's fighting skills are rubbing off on him. Right Creo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo said nothing. She simply stood there watching the match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you and Satellizer kept fighting Rana switching back and forth and Rana kept dodging and blocking every blow. Then Satellizer feinted an attack and called out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name). Do it! Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" you nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's hoping it works again,\" you thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Then you held out your hand and it began to glow blue and then you released your freezing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freezing area!\" you shouted as the same blue pentagon like net erupted from your hand and began heading towards Rana. It seemed that she was gonna get caught in it, but suddenly it stopped just inches away from her feet. You tried to make it go further, but you couldn't. Not to mention you couldn't maintain it for long, so it quickly dissipated. The class was a little surprised seeing that. Creo especially. She had never seen anything like that before and this worried her a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" she wondered. \" I know that (name)'s switched partners,  but his freezing should have been stronger than that. Was his freezing always that way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\" you cursed to yourself. Then you heard the coach call out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it! Time's up! Nice work ladies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer and Rana stopped fighting and stepped back. The coach then came up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)? You okay? You're freezing as a little weak back there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realizing that everyone saw your weak freezing quickly made up an excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... nothing. I'm fine. I... wasn't able to sync with Satellizer. That's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's to be expected. You were with a different partner, but try to make sure that your freezing's in ship shape. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Of course,\" you replied to the coach. \"Good match Rana. You're a pretty strong fighter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You as well,\" said Rana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ganessa came up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on. You call that a match? We all know that she was holding back. She didn't even use her volt weapon. Let me fight the transfer and I'll show you how it's done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...OK,\" said the coach. \"Sure why not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped off to the side wanting to watch the match.

Four familiar chains with flails at the ends sprouted from her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chains of Binding!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust seeing them made you remember back to when you first saw Ganessa attack Satellizer and causing your memories to come back to the surface, but you quickly shook that thought out of your mind and watched the match. Ganessa then went on the attack and flung her chain straight at Rana. Rana stood there unmoved, then she activated her volt weapon as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four Mind Sets!\" she yelled as a pair of metal gloves and a pair of metal boots materialized on her hands and feet. She then deflected Ganessa's attack. Seeing her volt weapon for the first time made you and Satellizer's eyes widen a little in surprise. And you weren't the only ones surprised. Creo was too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her volt weapon...\" said Creo. \"It's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like Creo's.\" you finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students reactions were more puzzled than surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's her volt weapon?\" said one. \"A pair of gloves and boots?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRana then leaped high into the air causing dust to kick up into the air. Ganessa looked up trying to keep her eye on Rana, but thanks to the sunlight, she couldn't see her. Rana took advantage of this by dive bombing towards her with a kick. The impact caused another dust cloud to kick up. At first it looked nothing happend, but then Ganessa's shirt suddenly ripped open causing her breasts to be exposed. Rana then went for a one legged drop kick, but Ganessa blocked the attack using one of her chains and sent her back. Then two stared at each other down daring each other to make a move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice kick,\" said Ganessa with a grin. \"You may not look much, but you're not bad for a rookie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your wits are as sharp as your tongue,\" said Rana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help, but grin slightly from Rana's slight insult. Ganessa's clothes returned to normal her smile quickly changed into a glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're trying to aggravate me, I must may you're doing an excellent job!\" she snarled as she launched all four of her chains at Rana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four of the chains were aimed directly at Rana's blind spots. One above her head, another behind her head, another a few feet away from her feet on her right, and one more on her left behind her leg. Having no way to dodge, Rana had no choice, but to take the hit. The chains hit their mark causing a mighty boom that shook around the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn! She hit all of her blind spots!\" you instinctively yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course,\" said a student. \"That's Ganessa's specialty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGanessa had a victorious grin on her face thinking that she won, but that look quickly changed into shock. For when the dust cleared, there stood Rana. Her clothes were a little torn and she had some scratches (and her skin was exposed as well), but she was fine. She had her arms crossed and was in a defensive stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She took the hit and protected all her vital points!\" Ganessa thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheeky girl!\" she said aloud as she retracted her chains and flung them at Rana once again. \"I think I'll have to put you in your place!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRana charged toward Ganessa heading straight towards her chains. She jumped over the first one, dodged the second in a back flip, kicked the third out of the way in mid air, and punched the last to the ground. Now Ganessa was wide open for an attack  Before Ganessa could react, Rana was inches away from her face with her fist aimed directly at her midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me ask you something,\" said Rana coolly. \"Do you know when is the best time to counterattack is? After surviving your opponents strongest attack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't damage a pandora at this range!\" said Ganessa. \"You're too close!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Rana's fist began to glow a bright yellow. You sensed a powerful energy going through that fist. If Ganessa got hit from that fist, it would all be over. Then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough!\" the coach called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 3 minutes were up. Rana and Ganessa stepped back while the coach walked towards them applauding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done you two,\" she said. \"Make sure you take note everyone. That's the kind of battle I would like to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a couple of the girls ran up to Rana excited as to what she just did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to go Rana!\" said one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! You were incredible!\" said another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like Rana's gonna give our number 1 second year a run for her money!\" said a third.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And The Untouchable Queen as well!\" said a fourth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rana talked to her fan club, you couldn't help but stare at Rana trying to figure out what had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That girl..\" you thought. \"She's got some serious power. If this wasn't a mock battle, Ganessa would be breathing through a hole in her stomach. Not to mention she held back when she fought me and Satellizer. Amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Creo, she was thinking the same thoughts you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man. I could feel that power coming through her. She's more powerful than I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile from above, Arnett and Attia were standing near a window looking down at the class. They had witnessed the fight as well and they were impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our little transfer student intriguing isn't she? It's just like what you said Attia,\" said Arnett.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that settles it then,\" said Attia. \"We'll wait till Creo gets back and then we'll proceed with the plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little later...</span></div></div>",

You were going to eat your lunch by yourself the same as usual, but then a certain someone called out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! (name)! There you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around and coming towards you was Kazuya. You were a little surprised to see him considering that he was at the infirmary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kazuya,\" you said. \" You're feeling better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Kazuya. \"I was just released a while ago. Now I'm feeling a lot better now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's good,\" you said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. Since we're here, you wanna eat lunch with me?\" asked Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Why not?\" you said. \"It has been a while since we've hung out together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you and Kazuya picked a table by the window and you two had a nice friendly chat. A few moments later, Kaho and Arthur came to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo Kazuya. How's it going?\" said Arthur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good,\" replied Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if we sit here?\" asked Kaho.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure by all means. Take a seat.\" said Kazuya as Kaho and Arthur sat in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a little awkward having them sit near you, so you tried not to pay any attention to them. Kaho and Arthur noticed this and whispered to Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kazuya. Can we talk to you without this guy around?\" asked Arthur. \"He's kinda...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paid no attention to Arthur. You just ate and drank your lunch in silence pretending not to notice. Kazuya looked at you and then he looked back at Arthur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" he said. \"He's a friend. He's just a little... anti-social.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say,\" said Arthur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So have your injuries healed?\" asked Kaho.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya nodded. \"Everything's good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More importantly, please tell me you changed your mind about becoming Satellizer's limiter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made you stop eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not this again,\" said Kazuya sounding slightly annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look. We're just worried about you okay?\" said Arthur. \"If you hadn't gotten involved with her, those girls wouldn't have beaten you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you guys drop it already?\" said Kazuya. \"and why is everyone calling her The Untouchable Queen? I mean where did that come from anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's something she did,\" said Arthur ominously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" asked Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She injured a limiter so badly, he'll never be able to recover.\" said Arthur. \"Truth is she went to East Genetics before she came here, but it wasn't a change of schools. She got kicked out for causing too much trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It happened around two years ago,\" continued Kaho. \"She's had a bad reputation for a pretty long time now. That's why people stay away from her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was new to you. You knew Satellizer had a pretty bad rep, but what you didn't know that it was due to everything Arthur and Kaho talked about. You kept quiet listening very closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was the limiter?\" asked Kazuya. \"What happened to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before Satellizer transferred schools, there was limiter in East Gentics named Brooks Levon,\" said Arthur. \" He was considered to be the best in his class and apparently good looking too which made him popular with the ladies. For some reason with all the choices out there, out of all the girls he could have picked, he decided to choose Satellizer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To put it simply, you might be making the same mistake he did,\" said Kaho with a grim expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it was a mistake that ended his life as a limiter. Thanks to her, he'll never recover,\" said Arthur. \"He was forced to give up and drop out even though he was a star student. After that Satellizer was suspended for a year and transferred here for a fresh start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She already was held back in her second year thanks to her suspension and at the rate she's going, history is gonna repeat itself I'm afraid.\" said Kaho.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to mention that she already injured a second year's limiter just by touching her by accident and she's attacking Pandora too. You've seen for yourself how quick she is to get into fights.It's pretty bad.\" said Arthur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya said nothing, but he looked a little distraught to everything that Arthur and Kaho just told him. At this point, you were feeling a little irritated as to what you just heard. You didn't know why, but you felt just irritated. So much, that you slammed your cup on the table and stood up causing the three to look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get something straight,\" you growled. \"You don't understand a damn thing about what happened in those fights. Satellizer didn't  do anything wrong, if anything she was defending herself. The only reason she was fighting those fights was because of two things. One, because that slut Miyabi wouldn't take no for answer and she publicly humiliated her. And two Ingrid was the one that started the fight by challenging Satellizer. So stop talking about Satellizer like she's the bad guy! Whatever happened to don't judge a book by it's cover huh? You two obviously don't know a damn thing about her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaho and Arthur stared at you surprised that you were standing up for Satellizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name). Calm down,\" said Kazuya placing a hand on your shoulder. \"It's fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" you began but you then you looked around and noticed that a couple of the students were staring at you. You then sat down and calmed yourself. Arthur and Kaho still stared at you as if they had finally just noticed that you were sitting at the table with them, but they quickly got out of their shock. Then Arthur spoke to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look. (name) right? It's nothing personal, but we're just looking out for Kazuya,\" said Arthur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were just thinking that it would be best for him to get out now before he gets hurt a second time,\" added Kaho.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe you should leave it up to him,\" you said, \"It is Kazuya's business, so maybe you should let him decide and stay out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief silence. Then...</span></div></div>",

She was wearing her school uniform and she had a happy grin on her face when she saw Kazua and you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Kazuya!\" she said. \"You look better. Is your body well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya smiled.\"Yes. My body is fine. Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRana turned to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Mr. (name). You're here as well. I wanted to thank you for that sparring match we had. You're a very good fighter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You give me too much credit,\" you said smiling politely.. \"If you were using your full power, you would have clobbered me in an instant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way,\" said Kazuya. \"That uniform looks good on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so? I'm most happy to hear it. To be perfectly honest, I really like it too.\" said Rana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. Must be a big change for you huh?\" asked Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it is, but thanks to Kunlun's tears, it allows me to store my old clothes as well. It was a little strange at first, but it's much more convenient than stripping nude,\" said Rana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was talking to Kazuya, for some reason she grew very close to him making Kazuya blush a little embarrassment. You on the other hand, paid no attention and pretended not to see. Then Kaho spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I forgot! Me and Arthur have a really important errand to do! She should get going. Right Arthur?\" she said winking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! That's right!\" said Arthur getting the hint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But guys... you're not leaving are you?\" said Kazuya who was now blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're just gonna let you two spend some time together,\" whispered Arthur in Kazuya's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya blushed even redder as Arthur and Kaho got up taking their trays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye! We'll see you later,\" said Kaho.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure you enjoy yourselves,' added Arthur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Arthur and Kaho left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will,\" called Rana after them. \"And best of luck to your errand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She actually bought that crap?\" you thought to yourself as you sat there watching this scene play out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.. by the way Ms. Rana,\" said Kazuya who gained his composure slightly. \"I forgot. You're a second year aren't you? Sorry if I was rude before. I'll address you as my senior if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no need to concern yourself with that!\" said Rana indignantly. \"In fact, I would like it better if you just call me Rana.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... I'm a first year,\" said Kazuya shyly. \"I don't wanna be rude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Rana grew close to Kazuya's face making him blush even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not rude! As your senior, I insist that you call me Rana.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am. I mean... Ms. Rana.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRana now was a little annoyed. She grew closer to Kazuya. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no need for the Ms. or ma'am!\" said Rana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you looked around you.  Everyone was now staring at your table watching the whole scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great,\" you thought. \"That's all we need. More attention.\" you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please understand Mr. Kazuya, you're a very special person to me, so it doesn't bother me at all.\" said Rana as she grew even closer to Kazuya making him back against the wall with her hand on his chest. Now you were getting a little embarrassed just watching them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... it bothers me though...\" said Kazuya blushing even more. \"And... what do you mean... I'm special?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'll tell you,\" said Rana seductively pressing her breasts against him. \"but you have to call me Rana first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! I get it!\" said Kazuya caving in. \"I'll call you... Rana...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRana shivered in delight upon hearing her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a sweet sound. I love it when you call me by my name,\" said Rana. \"Since you're calling me by my first name, I'll call you just plain Kazuya. If that's okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Sure...\" said Kazuya. \"It's not... against the rules or anything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point...</span></div></div>",

If she saw the two of them like this, she would be livid. You tapped Rana's shoulder getting her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Rana, don't you think you should back off a little bit?\" you said trying to get Rana off of Kazuya. \"You're getting too close to Kazuya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I?\" asked Rana. \"This is not a bad thing. It's only natural for a couple to be close like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, you're kinda causing a scene here.

Ma'am!\" Kazuya stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya and you were a little uneasy seeing Satellizer's expression. Rana on the other hand, was bright and cheerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there,\" she said. \"Kazuya and I were just enjoying our lunch break together, but if you would like to sit here with us I will not try and stop you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Rana completely dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this girl for real?\" you thought. \"Is she trying to piss Satellizer off? And is it just me, or did she just forget about me being here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer glared while Kazuya blushed with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't what it looks like I swear!\" Kazuya said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Kazuya and I being lovey-dovey doesn't sit with you, then find a seat elsewhere. Be my guest.\" said Rana as she wrapped her arms around Kazuya in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Cut it out Rana!\" Kazuya said now even more embarrassed than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rana?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer's eyes narrowed upon hearing Kazuya call Rana by her first name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy. He just stepped on a landmine,\" you thought pinching the bridge of your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Wait! She asked me to call her Rana when I wanted to call her Ms!\" said Kazuya. \"(name)! Say something to her! Help me out here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? Don't drag me into this!\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see, me and Kazuya have a very special relationship,\" said Rana with a sly grin on her face. \"We've even left silly formalities behind us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer said nothing. Then she turned around and started walking away, but then she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come with me Kazuya. I need to talk with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In case you haven't noticed, Kazuya is having his lunch,\" said Rana with a disapproving look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is more important,\" said Satellizer coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am! Sorry Ms... I mean Rana. Another time OK?\" said Kazuya immediately getting up and away from Rana and following Satellizer out of the cafeteria. You and Rana watched as the two left leaving you two by yourselves. Rana sighed a little disappointed about Kazuya leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well. I guess I did kinda rushed into things a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an understatement,\" you said. \"You know there are other ways of getting a guy yo like you know. For that matter, what makes you so sure that Kazuya's your 'special one?' \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is because of what happened the other day,\" replied Rana. \"When he was being attacked by those awful girls and activated his power, Kunlun's tears began to vibrate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kunlun's tears? Oh you mean your stigmata.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct,\" continued Rana. \"The elders back from my village told me  that the moment they vibrate, that is who I am destined to be with. That is why Kazuya is the one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" you said. \"But I should remind you that if you plan to keep going after Kazuya, you might want to keep the lovey dovey on the dl. Especially in front of Satellizer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fear not. I shall be fine,\" said Rana. \"I will make Kazuya mine and if I have to fight Satellizer to prove myself to him, then I shall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This girl...\" you thought facepalming your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you noticed someone coming towards your table.

And in that time all you have given them were half answers and shady explanations. You left the cafe in search of Creo, you weren't sure why she thought you were still keeping something, but whatever gave it away, the truth was affecting your friendship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou met up with Creo by a shady spot by one of the academy buildings, she was sitting by herself trying to piece your past together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creo?\", you said. She looked up at you, in her stoic fashion she acknowledged you. You tried sitting next to her but she moved away from you out of spite and to tell you she was quite angered with you. \"Creo what did I do wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I know what this whole thing is about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then are you going to spill it out? I don't see us acting as a team without you telling me everything. And I want ALL of it this time. And I know it has something to do with how you synced with Satelizer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creo....you don't want to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You opened up to me about your ex, whatever detail your keeping can't be as big. I am tired of this because your pushing me away the more you hide it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(NAME!)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both stared down each other. Creo walked away without saying a word, you wanted to say something but you were too upset and worried to speak.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back in your room, you sat on your bed with your face in your hand. Things were bad before, but now things have taken a turn for the bad. Arnett and Creo were for some reason upset at you because you wouldn't talk to them about the rest of your past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it. This sucks! Arnett and Creo are pissed off at me and all because of my secret! But I can't just tell them. If I did, they would hate me and treat me like everyone else did when it happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back at your desk and saw your photo with you and Makoto? You took it and look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(sigh). Oh Makoto, what should I do? If only you were here. You would know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the photo longingly before placing it back on your desk. You then stared up at the ceiling trying to figure out what to do. Eventually you felt sleepy and then you closed your eyes and fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile back with Rana, she was standing by herself by the pillars in the courtyard which was the site of where she saved Kazuya and his friends. Her happy expression was now changed into a grim frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>(name) sees Arnett.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Rana. I'll see you later okay? I'm gonna go see a friend of mine okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK then. Enjoy talking to your friend.\" said Rana as you left to go see Arnett leaving her by herself. Just then, Attia came to her table holding her lunch on a tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon me,\" she said. \"Sorry to bother you, but is this seat taken?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...no. Please sit.\" said Rana as Attia took her seat in front of Rana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be the new transfer student am I right?\" asked Attia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. My name is Rana Linchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Attia Simmons, a third year. A pleasure to meet you,\" said Attia. \"I welcome you. By the way that first year you were talking to,that was Kazuya Aoi right? I feel sorry for that poor boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel sorry for him?\" asked Rana a little puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Pay no attention to me,\" said Attia hastily. \"It's nothing. My goodness, when will I ever stop opening my big mouth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No please,\" said Rana with a serious and worried expression on her face. \"If there is anything I can do to help, you have to tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gleam flashed in Attia's eyes. Then she told her story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... if you must know... you know that his partner is Satellizer El Bridget right? Well, Satellizer is toying with him, denying his baptism and denying proof of their partnership. As it stands right now, he's nothing more but her servant. He's letting her take advantage of him just because that she's cute. Also about Kazuya Aoi, he isn't like other limiters. He can cast freezing areas even without a baptism. I think it's obvious that Satellizer wants him for nothing more, but his powers. She's just using him. Once his powers are gone, she'll drop him in a heartbeat. It's really quite a pity. Once he's tarnished, she'll find someone else and started the whole thing over again.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust remembering what Attia had told her made Rana's blood boil. Then she remembered what the elders had told her before she left her village in Tibet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Never forget child. The man who makes the Kunlun's tears vibrate within you is the man you must seek. He is your destined partner.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I finally meet the man of my destiny,\" Rana thought gritting her teeth. \"I can't let him go or forgive this. You disgrace the tears on your back. I won't allow this to continue Satellizer El Bridget.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she walked out of the courtyard and headed for a certain someone's room on the second year dorm.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kazuya had been walking through the school grounds with Satellizer explaining the misunderstanding they had earlier. The pair were slowly becoming more close in similar fashion to how you and Creo grew but without the recent set-backs it seemed. That was until Rana spotted them and intended to cross their path. Satellizer crossed her arms and looked away from Kazuya in shyness, \"Kazuya, does... does it bother you I refuse to perform-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It remains up to you, whether you want to or not. I don't want to rush you into anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just seems that, with (Name) and Creo being a strong pair and having them work along with us so close now, I feel maybe I can maybe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Satellizer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm considering to let us finally perform our baptism Kazuya. But I'm not ready, it's just I've been thinking if I were, it would be with you.\", her sincere words penetrated Kazuya's heart. Thinking that maybe the time was drawing nearer for them to become one it caused him to act nervous in the face of it. However it was met with equal amounts of attraction. Kazuya looked at Satellizer filled with some blush in his cheeks but not as much as would be expected, and he still looked at her with the same level head attitude. The moment was cut short however when Rana crossed their path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kazuya darling I would prefer to have a word with Ms. El Bridget.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rana what ever the case you may have against Satellizer is something I won't consider. I've heard it over and over now and you won't change my mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, you misread me, I want to speak to her alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kazuya lets go.\", Satellizer said with an undertone of disgust for Rana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Satellizer I would like to talk to you about two important matters, the first and most significant is about (Name) and your knowledge of his history.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer complied with her knowing your secret would be discussed in front of Kazuya if she kept persisting. She asked Kazuya to leave them, with afterward Rana discussed the topic at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) and you have some history together correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing personal, I was simply aware of his background but know he is merely a victim of circumstance. He is no murderer or faulty Limiter, he handles himself despite his handicap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I beg to differ as he showed this morning, his relationship with his partner is falling to pieces, AND how you are wrapped in not only his life but in Kazuya's too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I intend to answer, but depending on where things lead from, it would be better to discuss it in the arena.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer and Rana both entered the battle arena switching on the power to the lights. They faced each other on the opposite sides, Satellizer hoped that the prospect of battle was a vain attempt to intimidate her. But what she wasn't prepared for was a serious and impending duel between her and Rana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://youtu.be/16Awugjs8qY?t=1m40s\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/16Awugjs8qY?t=1m40s</a> (Music starts)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here is the deal leave Kazuya and (Name) alone. You have meddled with their lives long enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will do no such thing, whatever is happening between me and Kazuya is none of your business and there is nothing between me and (Name).\", Satellizer replied strongly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't formed a baptism on Kazuya and you continue to have nearly ruined (Name's) life here. It is best you leave them be for everyone else's sake.\", Rana persisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer walked away, \"I will not fight over this, Kazuya is my partner and he himself chooses to be mine of his own accord. What happens between him and I is of no concern to you.\", but Rana refused Satellizer's words of coerce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't turn your back on me, this isn't over!\", Rana held Satellizer in place mounting her hand on her shoulder causing Satellizer to glare and become battle ready at a moments notice. But the tension wore off when a new voice echoed across, \"Satellizer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRana and her looked in the middle of the arena to find Creo complete with her trademarked weapons already in arm. \"Prepare yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Music Ends)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pC15xL4cX3A\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pC15xL4c...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had taken a walk by yourself to try and sort between finally telling Creo and Arnett your secret but still the conflicting feelings between how they would be seen by everyone and your own reputation kept setting your choice into conflict. Creo was the closest thing since Makoto that you had a connection more profound by love than basic attraction. You thought back on what made you and her fail ultimately which lead to her death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto hesitance toward the baptism, she wasn't as passionate as you were. The platonic attitude she had on all the time with everyone was never different between only the two of you. She never showed any sincere interest beyond what was required by your partnership. And she never even kissed you, even once. You were too young to notice all of the hints but even still she was not cruel. She showed care during your trails in the field, she defended you, she cared. The only thing was you felt more beyond the shackles of the physical bonding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn comparison to Creo she knew what was expected, you both had better communicating despite hiding the truth, and the love without any doubt is present. Even if not requited there is nothing to prove between you two that neither have no romantic feelings. In all this time, in such a short amount, Creo surpassed Makoto in every way within nearly a month. You felt now it was time to come clean with Creo. She earned that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut quickly the pondering left your focus when you saw Kazuya. You headed over to him to see what he was doing. \"Hey, what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Music Ends)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. Rana is just talking to Satellizer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the same one from the cafeteria? Kazuya give it straight to that girl your taken! You have any idea how wrong things will go if you don't clear it up with Satellizer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gave Rana my stance on things, and...Satellizer. She is, thinking of moving things further.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Well then sorry for budging in then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be more forgiving if you were to be more gentleman like and said that to my face.\", you and Kazuya turned to see....Attia! \"Now then are you going to plead me not to beat you senseless?\", she mockingly threatened.</span></div></div>",

Elegant Destroyer!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in an instant a giant metal spiked ball with a chain appeared. She swung the giant ball around her head a few times and launched it straight towards you and Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kazuya move!\" you yelled as you ran towards Kazuya and you pushed him out of harms way while you jumped out of the way narrowly missing Attia's Elegant Destroyer. The ball crashed into the ground from where you were standing with a boom causing the ground to crack a little from the impact. Attia then pulled on the chain retracting her ball. You warily stood up and took a defensive stance while Kazuya looked at the two of you with a slight worry in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kazuya? You ok?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" said Kazuya getting to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may be fine, but your friend certainly won't be when I'm finished with him.\" Attia said her voice filled with venom towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then went on the attack and threw her ball at you again. You jumped up and dodged it again, but then Attia suddenly appeared coming at you at your right side and gave you a kick. You gasped from the impact caught off guard from the attack. You were sent rolling to the ground, but you quickly regained your footing and rolled to your feet in a kneeling position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn...she's really pissed at me...\" you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the rumors were true...\" you heard Attia say. \"You're not an ordinary limiter. You're one that actually knows how to take a hit. But that doesn't matter because you're still nothing, but a little second year. A second year that dared to cross a third year. And any second year do dares mess with us third years or steals a third year's friend will be taught a lesson...a lesson you and Satellizer will learn. A painful lesson!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up and saw Attia walking towards you, twirling her ball around her head with a angry yet somewhat sadistic look on her face. You thought that she hated you before, but now you were seeing Attia's true emotions. Pure hate. Which meant things were gonna get ugly quick. Then you thought about what Attia said just now. She mentioned Satellizer and said that everything will be back in order tonight. Which meant that she was pissed at Satellizer too and Satellizer might be caught up in this too. You turned to Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kazuya! Get out of here!\" you yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me! Get out of here and go find Satellizer! Something tells me that she might be in trouble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you?\" asked Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got some unfinished business here. I'll catch with you later!\" you said taking a fighting stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, are you seriously gonna fight her all by yourself?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine! Get going! Now!\" you yelled as Attia launched her volt weapon at you again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to side step it and ran straight at her and threw a punch at her, but Attia managed to block the attack using her chain. Kazuya just stood there unsure of what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you doing Kazuya?! Get the hell out of here right now! HURRY!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya flinched upon you yelling at him, then he broke into a run in search of Satellizer. Then Attia suddenly chuckled making you turn towards her glaring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just think it's cute the way that you pretend to be strong like this. Do you really think that a measly limiter like yourself can beat pandora?\" said Attia coolly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't underestimate me!\" you said. \"I may be a limiter, but I can fight and go toe to toe with you pandora! Take it from Ingrid and that slut Miyabi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All you did was bare your fangs at your superior! Not to mention you stole Creo and Arnett from me!\" Attia snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that's not true! You're just upset that Creo and Arnett are sick of you of being such an immature brat!\" you snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia growled and forced you back with her chain making you slide back a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? I think I've heard enough. I'm just gonna go ahead and beat the ever living shit out of you!!!\" Attia screamed as she came at you again with her Elegant Destroyer swinging over her head. You took a fight stance and let out a yell as you charged at Attia too.</span></div></div>",

Satellizer held her arm blades in defense hesitating to fight Creo, except Creo was not pulling her punches and at least twice went for serious blows.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Attia had you and Kazuya on the ropes since she was a skilled pandora while you two were only limiters so your options were very few. All you could do was evade her with help from your own limit fields causing enough slowdown for her to miss you two. Kazuya was the stronger limiter as he had no faults with his field, which meant he had a likelier chance at possibly stopping her. This gave you an idea, \"Kazuya I have an idea summon as much to your field on my mark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName came to support him as he charged up his power. Attia in confusion wondered what you planned since you had no real attacks. Soon as the power increased enough Kazuya's energy unleashed and then you used your field to surround the two of you in a small force field providing some extra defense. This was good since it protected you from Attia so you both stayed in the field. Attia shrugged believing she could easily destroy and tried to break through, but ultimately when she punched it instead of breaking through it, it flung them into the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the field dissipated from her blow you and Kazuya got up from the force of Attia's blow. \"She's frickn crazy!\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kidding! Where exactly are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh near the arena. A few halls from it but nobody-\", suddenly you heard fighting but not from outside where Attia would be making the noise but inside the arena. \"Is somebody training?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) I'll run over and get them to help. We can't do this on our own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll hide and buy you time.\", you said. You ran to hide near the locker rooms where you might have a chance to hide, Attai walked towards you enjoying the hunt of exacting her revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the arena both Rana and Arnett watched as Creo and Satellizer fought in a ferocious duel between pandoras. Creo wasn't letting up with Satellizer and it began to wear the untouchable queen down. Soon enough Kazuya ran to witness them fighting and he yelled out to them, \"Satellizer! Creo! (Name) is in trouble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that made Creo and Satellizer stop them from fighting. Creo ran to Kazuya and with anger and worry demanded to know what was wrong. \"Attia attacked us and is after him!\", Kazuya explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Attia wouldn't be that angry to outright harm him. Attacking limiters is something no pandora would stoop to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She attacked both of us I am not lying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe him Creo. If what he says is the truth I would make haste to aid (Name). Where are they now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Away from the Arena. I he went to find a place to hide from her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't what Attia would do? Arnett?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creo regardless of who it is, he's in danger and we can't let him get beaten by a pandora. C'mon we can sort out our issues with him later!\", Arnett ran with Satellizer, Kazuya, and Rana to find and investigate the commotion.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back in the locker rooms, you were hiding behind a row of lockers hiding from Attia trying not to make a sound. Suddenly, you instinctively sensed danger and quickly ran behind another row of lockers. Then from where you were standing the lockers buckled, tipped over and hit the ground with a mighty metal thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit,\" you thought. \"If I hadn't sensed that, I would've been crushed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard Attia's voice sweet and soaked with predatory hate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh (name)... Come out, come out wherever you are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice alone made you cringe a little. It reminded you of one of those moments in a horror movie when the killer was closing in on the poor defenseless damsel. Only in this case the roles were reversed. You were the damsel and Attia was the killer. She kept bashing one locker after another hoping that you were by or in one of them. At this rate, she would definitely find you for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit... Maybe the locker room wasn't the best place to hide... I gotta get out of here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully peeked out from behind a locker to see if you could find an escape route. The door out was a few feet away, but to you it seem very far. To make matters worse, Attia stood between you and the door twirling her Elegant Destroyer beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come out (name)!\" Attia called as she threw her weapon bashing another locker with it. \"If you show yourself now, I'll make it as painless as possible! You can't hide from me forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously you stayed hidden. You looked around trying to find an escape route or a hiding place. Then you saw an open locker. The door was wide open and it was completely empty. You looked around and you also saw a shoe lying on the ground. Then you made a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK... I'll distract her with the shoe, then I'll hide in the locker and wait till she passes by. After that, I'll make a break for the door and get out. It's pretty much my only plan at this point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia slowly walked around the lockers trying to find you with her weapon at the ready. Then she heard a loud thud. It came from the back of the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran towards where she heard the noise and threw her weapon at the lockers. The Elegant Destroyer bashed into the lockers with a mighty boom making the whole locker room tremble from the impact. Attia had a big grin on her face thinking she had finally exacted her revenge, but when the smoke pulled clear there was nothing but the lockers that she destroyed. Her grin quickly changed into a frown of frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit... Where are you coward?! I'm starting to grow tired with this game of cat and mouse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia walked to towards the back resuming her search. She wasn't aware of this, but you were hiding inside the lockers waiting for her to pass by. As she came closer and closer to the locker you were in, you held your breath covering your mouth trying not to make a sound. Attia looked around and came to a stop right in front of your locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn... please walk away. Please walk away. Please walk away!\" you screamed in your head praying that Attia wouldn't find you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Attia twirled the end of her chain and slammed it against the locker a few doors down from where you were hiding. Your heart was beating like a jackhammer and a drop of sweat trickled down your face. You mind screamed at you to get out of there before Attia had a chance to your hiding place along with you, but you kept still and didn't make a sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia seeing that you weren't in the lockers she bent, groaned in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)! Come out right now you coward! Do you really want to make me angry?\" she growled slapping her chain on the ground like a whip, Then she walked past your locker hoping to find you somewhere in the back of the locker room. As soon as you heard her footsteps quieten down, you slowly opened the door and looked out. Attia was nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She must have gone to look in the back,\" you thought. \"Now's my chance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully stepped out of the locker and hugged the lockers behind you. You tip-toed slowly towards the exit being careful not to make a sound. Then you heard another metallic boom meaning that Attia had bashed some more lockers. This made you tip-toe even faster. Soon you broke into a run heading straight for the exit. The exit grew closer and closer and you thought that you were home free, but suddenly just as you barely stepped one foot out of the exit, from the corner of your eye you saw the ball of the Elegant Destroyer coming straight at you! You jumped out of the way, but your reaction came too late. You were able to dodge the attack, but due to the explosion caused by impact of the Elegant Destroyer the force of it caused you to be sent sprawling to the ground. Attia then came walking towards you retracting her weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try, but that was the most predictable strategy you could have ever come up with,\" she chuckled. \"Did you really think you could get away from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\" you cursed under your breath as you tried to get up and run, but then you felt something wrap around your leg making you fall to the ground. You looked at your leg and saw The Elegant destroyers chain wrapped around it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you before,\" said Attia with a devilish grin on her face. \"You're not getting away. Not until I taught you a lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then began to pull on the chain drawing you towards her. You tried to get free, but the chain held you tight. Then you kicked at Attia trying to make her drop her weapon, but she dodged it easily and gave you a sharp stomp on your gut. You gasped and coughed tasting iron in your mouth and you held your stomach in pain. Attia stood over you bracing her Elegant Destroyer and getting it ready to bring down on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then... it's pay time (name). Get ready to be punished,\" Attia said with a scowl. \"This'll teach you not to steal my friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swung her chain down and the Elegant Destroyer's ball came hurling towards you. You closed your eyes and braced yourself for the blow, but then...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soon as you heard the sound of the ball make the sound of it making contact, you winced tightly and flinched in reaction. Then suddenly you realized once the adrenaline and fear of being demolished subsided, you weren't hit. Instead you opened your eyes to find Arnett had blocked the attack. Attia stood around shocked and afraid seeing the look on Arnett's face. \"Get away from him you @#$t.\", Arnett threw the ball back at Attia but purposefully missed. Attia let go of her weapon knowing the force of it would carry her but Attia in a flash tied her arm together with the chain and Attia went flying with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia along with her weapon smashed through the building walls and back outside. Attia's arms were on fire from the yanking force and weakly stood up. She vainly attempted to untie the chain binding her wrists but she stopped when she saw who was walking toward her in addition to you and Arnett. Rana, Kazuya, and Satellizer all stared daggers at her. The pandoras especially were ready to unleash their fury on her. \"Allow me to put her in her place. I owe you an apology for making an unjust judgement.\", Rana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! She 'was' my friend and betrayed me and Creo. I'm going to finish this!\", Arnett said. She walked up to her but Satellizer halted her, and pointed to her right. There everyone turned to see Creo. You had mixed feelings upon seeing her because of how you were wondering what she would do to Attia. Creo walked up to Attia and grabbed her by the collar. Attia began crying, terrified of Creo she cried out begging, \"Creo don't! Don't kill me! I only wanted you back and Arnett. He broke us apart. It's all his fault. Please don't kill me!\", Creo jerked her towards her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to kill you. Your a strong and skilled pandora and we can't do it because of our personal issues.\", Creo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OHHH thank you! Creo I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But understand Attia. If you ever try anything to my (Name), or if I think you did, or if you so much as touch him understand that I you will never be able to fight ever again. I will break you so badly and leave you in such a critical state you will be spending your days in a wheelchair being a disgrace to pandoras for the rest of your life. Just so you know he did break us up, and I'm glad he did. I realized what a cold manipulating cow you really are after seeing what you tried to do. We were friends but now I wish we never were.\", Creo let Attia go and broke off the chain binding her wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia sat on the ground crying looking away from Creo and Arnett. Creo walked away with Arnett making their way to you, Kazuya and Satellizer decided to let them be with Rana following suit to settle things between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo and Arnett kneeled down to you and hugged you very tightly, \"Are you ok (Name)?\", Arnett asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll live.\", you joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett made a shocking move, she grabbed your head and kissed you on the cheek real tightly. You bushed heavily and your eyes opened wide at the sudden and startling action. Then almost immediately you felt a second pair of lips hit you from the other side from Creo. You felt surprised but happy, actually ecstatic. You couldn't help but grin widely as they affectionately pressed their mouths onto your face. Arnett blushed herself, she was feeling the sweet feelings she had for you mount up into something purer and more fulfilling. This was a way to express her relief of your survival but also a gift for having been fooled by Attia. In Creo's head she did it out of similar feelings but it was less guided by them and more by impulse. She wasn't in any way jealous seeing Arnett kiss you. In fact it gave Creo the push to finally break the barrier between you and her. As she did it, her heart beated against her chest very hard like it wanted to be let out, her skin tingled, and her mind went blank except with the want to let it continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin about 15 seconds or so the girls gently pulled back. Arnett said, \"Were glad your ok (Name).\", she left you and Creo alone. Now it was just the two of you now. \"Creo-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My room. We'll talk.\", she forcefully got you up from the ground and lead the way.</span></div></div>",

You sat on Creo's bed with her still standing facing you with a stern look. \"Tell me who you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time. You were prepared to tell her now and after how you nearly broke apart and almost got smashed by Attia it was time to trust Creo. \"What I said before about my old partner was right. All of it. But I left out one thing,\" you paused still uneasy and hesitant to say it but you had the words formed in your head and just echoed them out loud, \"I have a limiting defect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo's face didn't change, she still remained exactly the same as she did beforehand. You knew she wanted more so you gave her the rest of your story, \"My field is weaker than most and because of that she partnered with me out of pity. I was able to sustain them much better when we were together just like any other limiter, but the range was always smaller. Except eventually as I was feeling closer to her it began to improve, until when I found out what she really felt about me. My synergy with her became so defunct that my field gave out and she got trapped in the Nova's freezing field and she died in front of me. I came here because of my infamous reputation, The Imperfect Limiter. I wanted no one to find out so they wouldn't feel handicapped. And it was why I wanted a mutal respect in our partnership so that no matter what I could sustain the field. But you and Arnett...I couldn't. I....fe...felt...I...I'm in love with you Creo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gasp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry but I am. What I feel is more than just a basic relationship. So I'll say it again, I love you and I won't change my mind about it. Sigh....if you want me to-\", Creo spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name)...\", silence lingered, \"Arnett and I learned who you are. I figured it out after this mornings practice and told her before we confronted Attia. I wanted to hear you say it. And you forced me into a partnership that will be risky because of how you feel about me. And keeping that from me despite your intentions was a selfish and cowardly thing to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down in shame. \"I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't forgive you for your deceit.\", you closed your eyes fighting back the urge to show weakness in front of her. \"But I will return your feelings.\" You were shocked, your mind only kept rewinding the last few seconds of dialogue from Creo. \"(Name) your compassionate, understanding, very strong against the odds, and a true limiter in my eyes. I'm still your partner, now and always. I battle and in life. I love you too (Name).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words caressed your heart with each sincere sentence being formed in your ears. The closer she came to finish her feelings her hands clasped on to your own and slowly climbed up to your chest and neck. When she said 'I love you' she gently moved your head to her face. After she said your name you moved in yourself closing your eyes, finally the both of your felt contact with the others skin and from the feeling knew that you were, kissing each other on the lips. At first the kiss was soft, innocent it was a quiet but emotional experience. Then Creo pulled back a bit looking at your eyes intently. Your hearts were racing and the passion was high. You kissed again but with your mouths opened. Creo pressed her tongue into your own, trying to wrap around yours but only stabbing at it. While she was making her move you felt you needed to respond in kind. You unbuttoned her uniform but then she pulled back contemplating how far this was going.</span></div></div>",

I do something I shouldn't have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Nothing like that!\" said Creo hastily blushing. \"It's just that... is this what you want? I mean... are you sure you want to? What we're doing... is basically an official baptism.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do,\" you replied. \"I mean... if it's that's okay with you I mean. Unless... you don't want to... If you don't it's OK. I understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo looked at you looking a little discouraged as well as flushed with embarrassment/emotion and her heart skipped a beat. She didn't know why, but she thought that you were being absolutely adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! It's OK! I really want do it with you, but... it's my first time... and I don't know if I'll do it well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cut Creo off by placing a finger on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK... I'm feeling nervous too. It's my first time as well and I also don't know what to do either, but... it's fine. This will be a great opportunity to learn more about us. Mentally and physically. I may not be good with baptisms and other stuff so... just do whatever you want to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled kindly and Creo looked at you while you were like an angel that descended on earth, Creo held your face in her hands and kissed you on the forehead tenderly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you (name). You're really sweet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just... be gentle OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you and Creo resumed kissing with your tongues swirling inside your mouths. You embraced each other tightly as you both lied down kissing each other not wanting to let go. You mind was racing as you experienced this new feeling racing in your mind and your body. You never wanted it to stop. Suddenly you felt Creo's hand tracing along your thigh which made you shudder and also making you gasp a little. You and Creo separated, both of you panting with passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. Did I make you uncomfortable?\" asked Creo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I'm OK,\" you replied. It just kinda tickled that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both paused not knowing what to do next. Then Creo sat up taking the initiative and started taking off her clothes starting with your shirt. You watched your eyes never leaving as she removed your shirt and then her skirt. Then she turned around her back facing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...um... could you help unhook this?\" asked Creo bending over a little since she was so tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure,\" you said gulping a little. You reached for Creo's bra hook and then unhooked it. Creo then turned around and slowly took off her bra setting her breasts free, After that she took of her last garment on her which was her underwear making her completely naked. You couldn't help, but stare at what you were seeing. You've seen a girl nude before, but nothing like Creo. She was not only athletic, but she was also curvy too. Her stomach, her breasts, her hips, everything about her was absolutely breathtaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.. is something wrong (name)?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... it's just... you look awesome...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you...\" said Creo her face reddening with embarrassment. \"Now... may I see you now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got up on your feet as Creo sat on the bed. Then you started to undress starting with your pants. You never really cared about your body much nor have you hardly shown it before, but for some reason you felt a little self conscious and embarrassed undressing in front of Creo. But it was alright. You took off your pants and then your shirt leaving you with only your boxers with a big tent in them. Creo watched intently never taking her eyes off of you. You slowly took off boxers feeling more and more nervous. Then you finally dropped them and your dude sprang up fully hard and pointing directly to the ceiling. Creo's jaw dropped, her eyes wide as saucers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" she murmured. \"You're... incredible (name)...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I mean... thank you,\" you said blushing a little as you sat on the bed next to Creo. \"So... what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo said nothing. You took your chin and gently lifted it upward and she kissed you once again. This time, the kiss was more deep and more passionate. In your mind you saw nothing, but pink and you felt pleasure run through your body. Both of your hands explored each other feeling each others body not wanting to stop. One of your hands on Creo's hip slowly crept up until it was on top of her breast. You gave it a gentle squeeze causing Creo to moan a little during the kiss. As the kiss continued, you brought your other hand to her other breast and started to massage them both. Creo moaned even more kissing you furiously. You tried to keep up, but you soon ran out of breath. You and Creo separated with your hands still on her breasts. Creo looked at your hands and blushed smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you like my breasts huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...yeah,\" you said shyly looking away. \"They're... really soft.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you felt Creo's hand wrap around your dude causing you to gasp and blush heavily as a shock of pleasure went through you. Creo quickly let go and hastily backed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! Did I hurt you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's OK. You just surprised me is all. Please continue. Just be gentle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo nodded and she resumed feeling your dude. As she did, your breathing began to get heavy and your body can to heat up feeling turned on. You felt the need to moan, but you didn't not wanting to look bad. Creo continued feeling your dude gently feeling your shaft and your base. As she did, she felt something wet come out from the tip which made her look at it with curiousity. She had never seen this before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)? What is this stuff? Is it some kind of pee?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no...\" you stuttered trying not to moan. \"It's... cowper's fluid... it means...I'm feeling good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" asked Creo feeling surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" she thought to herself. \"This is my first time doing this. Good thing I did my research in that book. OK.. now to make him feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)? I'm gonna try something. I don't know if I'll be good at it, so... make sure to tell me if it feels weird OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could ask what Creo was going to do, you felt something warm and a little slimy on your dude which a strong bolt of pleasure rocking through your body. Creo was now licking your dude. She lightly licked the tip experimenting to see what your reaction would be. It was so incredible, your body jolted and you let out a moan of surprise/pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)?!\" Creo gasped a little surprised from your moan. \"Are you OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't answer. You blushed a deep crimson and looked away in embarrassment, feeling a little ashamed of letting out a moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... the heck is this?\" you thought. \"Why... am I feeling this way? I... can't hold my moans in... and... I feel like I want more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, something lit up inside of Creo. Something that made her more turned on than she ever was before. She loved seeing you being defenseless and turned on like this. Normally she saw you as being mysterious, strong and a fighter, but this... this was a brand new side to you and she loved it. That's when she...</span></div></div>",

Her tongue explored everywhere on it not missing a single part. You covered your mouth blushing furiously desperately trying not to moan, but some slipped through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it...! What... the hell is wrong with me?\" you thought. \"Why is it... like this? My mind's telling me that I shouldn't be acting like this. It's completely embarrassing ... but at the same time I feel like want more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)? Are you feeling OK? Does it feel good?\" asked Creo looking up at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It... it... feels good...\" you breathed. \"It feels... awesome...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should... I do more then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes, looked away in embarrassment and answered with a silent nod. Then suddenly you felt the lower half of your body being lifted up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...! What the..!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you looked up to see why your lower half was being lifted, you eyes opened wide with shock. Creo had lifted up your legs bringing your knees over her shoulders in a bridge position. Everything was now completely exposed right in front of Creo's face. If your face wasn't any redder, it certainly was now. You tried to get off, but Creo held you in place holding your thighs with her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHA!?! Creo what are you doing?! Put me down! This is too embarrassing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo didn't say anything. She stared at your dude now being close to her face. It was still pointing up to the ceiling now harder than ever. Then Creo opened her mouth wide and took the head of your dude in her mouth. Your eyes snapped open and you let out a surprised and pleasured moan. Creo's lips closed firmly forming a tight seal around your head. She then moved her tongue around slowly around back and forth in broad strokes. She rubbed it all around covering it with her saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(moan)! Creo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never have felt so embarrassed before, but at the same time you never have experienced pleasure like this before either. It was almost hard to believe that Creo was a beginner. You gripped the sheets tightly trying to endure the pleasure as Creo continued to suck you off. She gently sucked you while swirling her tongue all over your dude. Then she slid her mouth of you and started licking along your dude with her tongue while looking at you watching your reaction. You saw Creo staring at you while she was licking and you looked away in embarrassment pouting a little. Creo smiled devilishly loving your reaction. Then she took your dude back in her mouth. This time she got deeper, taking about half of my length rubbing her tongue against it. She puckered her lips and started sucking while bobbing her head slowly making you moan again a little louder. Your eyes began to tear slightly and a trail of drool trailed out of your mouth. While she was sucking you Creo began to get wet which caused her to feel herself a little making herself feel good too. At this point you didn't care about feeling embarrassed. You wanted more. You wanted more and more pleasure. Creo saw this and began to bob her head faster and faster making dirty noises as she sucked you. The pleasure grew more and more intense and a strong feeling began to building up inside of you. It grew higher and higher and stronger and stronger until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CREO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moaned loudly as you reached the summit. Your body tensed up and a flood of cum that you've been holding back instantly spurted forth. Creo eyes snapped open in surprise and immediately removed her mouth from you making some cum get on her face. After a few more seconds, your body relaxed and your orgasm ended. Your bottom half slowly dropped down onto Creo's lap as you breathed heavily trying to catch your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I just orgasm?\" you thought. \"So...that's what it feels like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)?! Are you OK?\" asked Creo in a surprised and worried tone. \"Did I over do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Creo in a glare your face flushed and your body slightly sweaty from the pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell Creo?! I thought you said it was your first time!\" you said in a mixture of bewilderment, slight anger, and deliriousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is!\" said Creo blushing a little flustered. \"I just saw it in a magazine and figured I'd try it. If you didn't like it, you should've said so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a break! How can you say this was your first time after what you just did?! You're completely calm and you were skilled in sucking me and... it's like...you're a pro at this. Aww damn it! What the hell am I even saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou covered your face in your hands not wanting Creo to see you like this. To you, it was completely disgraceful. Creo stared at you surprised and completely entranced by you looking embarrassed like this. It made her heart skip a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's... so cute!\" she thought. \"It makes me want to tease him more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gently got off from underneath you and got on top of you. She pulled your hands away from your face and turned your head towards her. Then she placed another kiss on your lips and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what (name)? You're cute when you're like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou face flushed again with embarrassment. \"Stop teasing me. I'm not cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes you are,\" smirked Creo as she snatched another kiss from your lips. Then she sat up and positioned herself on top of you meaning one thing was coming next. Her heart was pounding and she was ready to lose her virginity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK then. I'm gonna put you inside of me. Are you ready? \" she asked a little seductive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instinctively gulped and nodded. Creo slowly lowered herself on top of you and your dude slowly went inside of her. When you were half way inside of her you tensed up and gripped the sheets again. It felt hot and really tight inside her and it felt really good. Creo also felt a jolt of pleasure go through her as she took more and more of you inside her. Finally she dropped down and took you completely inside her. You trembled and you shook feeling yourself completely inside of her your mouth agape and dizzy look in your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name) you look so cute right now being turned on like this,\" said Creo smiling from ear to ear. \"And you also feel so good inside of me. We really are perfect partners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop saying thing like that,\" you mumbled. \"It's embarr...mmph!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could protest, Creo then started to move grinding her butt against you. She once again stole another kiss inserting her tongue and twirling it around yours. The ecstasy from the pleasure overwhelmed your mind making you once again see pink. You also began thrusting your hips upward your reason thrown out the window. Creo moaned into the kiss pressing herself harder against you. Your hands snaked around Creo's waist eventually ending up on her butt and gave Creo a hard squeeze. Creo yelped stopping the kiss and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well. Looks like someone's being bold,\" she chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up...\" you mumbled. \"You started it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I did,\" said Creo. \"But now, we're gonna get serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat up and started to bounce up and down on top of you making your dude go in and out of her. You moaned feeling hot and sweet pleasure rock your body again, You instinctively reached for Creo's breasts and squeezed them both making Creo gasp. She then placed her hands on top of yours and pressed them on top of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it... just focus on my breasts. Just let me do the moving...\" she said huskily as she started going faster making you moan louder. You tried to massage her breasts, but Creo was moving so fast and wildly that you couldn't focus. Then Creo leaned over making her nipple over in front of you. You automatically took her nipple into your mouth and sucked on it hard. Creo moaned and hugged your head lying on top of you as she moved even faster. You now feeling incredibly turned on started thrusting upwards into Creo making the pleasure even more intense, Then you started getting the same overwhelming feeling again and Creo was feeling it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creo...I'm...I'm... gonna lose my mind again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok! I'm gonna lose it too! Let's lose it together!\" moaned Creo as she went even faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both continued thrusting at each other wildly until you both felt intense and shocking pleasure rock your bodies. You both let out a pleasured and loud scream at the same time as you both orgasmed. You pulled out and your cum spurt out and went everywhere. You flopped back on the bed completely exhausted and out of breath as the afterglow of the orgasm started settling in. Creo who was tired was well lied down on top of you and embraced you. You looked at her and she looked at you. Creo smiled and kissed you once more and you kissed her back. After a moment of silence Creo spoke breaking the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were very awesome (name),\" she said. \"You were also very cute too being all defenseless like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please forget about that,\" you said blushing again. \"It's unbecoming of a man. Not to mention embarrassing and disgraceful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's not,\" said Creo holding your cheek and making you look at her. \"It's cute. It's made me see a whole new side of you and I love seeing that side. It's made me fall in love with you even more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou face flushed again making Creo giggle. Then she gave you a kiss on your forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you (name).\" she whispered in your ear making you blush even redder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I love you too,\" you stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo smiled and hugged you once more your face buried in her breasts. They felt so soft like a pair pillows. You couldn't help, but feel comfortable from the sensation. Your eyes started to get heavy from exhaustion. Then they slowly closed as you went to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You woke up after falling dead asleep with Creo embracing you while the two of you were naked together. Creo was still asleep but instead of gently waking her up you decided to try and fall back to sleep thinking what is the rush? You snuggled up closer to her and gently wrapped your arm around her back moving her head closer to yours. You laid your head down listening to her breathing, it was heavy but not loud. You kissed her forehead and began whispering something to her, \"Creo, no matter what goes on between now and then.....you will always have my heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stirred a little she faintly said something, \"nnnnn......mmmmm....\", she didn't say anything else. You hugged her closer drifting off to sleep a little longer. A couple hours later you woke up again. Creo was yawning heavily suggesting she just woke up. She looked at the time and much to her shock was later than either of you realized. It was noon and neither of you were out of bed! \"Gahhhh damn! We missed more than half the day!\", she grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to frantically get dressed but soon as you were just about to get out Creo pulled you back in again. \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh...forget it. Today is a sick day for us. Come on back with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creo we can still make one practice.\", you protested although you didn't do so with much enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna have to escape from me to do so little limiter. Come here!\", Creo tugged you back under the covers and started tenderly kissing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! I'm too tired for another round! Mmmm! Sto-ah! Ok ok you win.\", you finally submitted. Creo didn't go a full round like last night but you two passionately made out interlocked with each others bodies. Another hour later and you two finally settled down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That....was...unforgettable.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was good. Better than I thought it might end up. Sigh....I never knew how much I would enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You took charge the whole time, I was surprised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was by how you different and shy you were. Being honest I imagined you would be taking the lead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never done this before remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like an excuse. But hey I think you handled good. Only thing though...I may have to check in with the pandora doctor. May need to check if what happened...you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind I'll get it solved later. Right now I need a shower, hairbrush, blow dryer, toothbrush, and a big bottle of mouth wash.\", Creo got out of bed and went to her bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only have half of those things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were in my dorm room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better have those things when I stop by your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait? We planning to do this again?\", you asked still feeling a little awkward about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know most partners don't do what we just did do it on a daily basis and I am not making that a thing. But we won't know when we will again. I certainly don't plan on making it a one time deal. Do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get in the shower with me, save some water.\", you got right out and got in. Creo had the water at the right heat and so you walked in with her eagerly waiting to be cleaned off from all of the fluids from last night. Your muscles relaxed as the warm water washed over your body. As Creo washed your body you were feeling very happy and relaxed. You got a sponge ready and covered it with soap and gently began scrubbing Creo's back. When you finished and she got to you, the both of you dried off once you got out of the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be with the pandora doctor ok.\", Creo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Creo. I'll go hang with the others.\", you replied. She gave you one last kiss before going. She walked off with a confident smile on her face while your smile was more 'I can't believe I just did that' look. You felt like a 1,000,000$ and couldn't be any happier than now.</span></div></div>",

You remembered how you let Creo dominate you and how you moaned just like a girl would and that made you feel embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On... second thought, maybe it would be better if I didn't give them the play by play,\" you said to yourself blushing, \"Ugh.

It was mandatory for a pandora to show whenever their limiter, during a baptism, had possibly impregnated them. Normal baptisms weren't mandatory but recommended but any such as the kind Creo had with you last night were no exceptions. Because of a pandora holding the responsibility of facing against Nova they were given extra classes on sex education more than limiters. So they were more able to understand whenever they were likely of being pregnant. Creo remembered your time together very well and got a bit 'excited' from reminiscing, but snapped back when she remained focuses of the details regarding the best part. To put it simply the chances were very high despite pulling out. You unloaded while still in her regardless of how long and even then, according to the doctor some of the fluid were making the trip despite only being outside the 'door'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is it doctor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good news and bad news. What sounds better to hear first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get the bad out of the way and end with the good.\", she said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well a significant number of sperm entered despite what you described. I recommend next time to use protection. Also the scans indicate they aren't quitting yet and they are getting halfway toward the point of no return before we can immediately act.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The good news is that it is common for them to not show signs of letting up yet. Specially when that amount broke through the barrier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barrier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't they ever teach you about the pandora barrier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bits and pieces by the time they began teaching it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there is always a bio-organic barrier in the vaginal system when a pandora has the implants installed. Because of how intimate baptisms can be and how young the partners are this measure is to decrease teen pregnancy in pandoras. If your partner didn't pull out at all then it is useless since it can't possibly keep out the number of sperm in an orgasm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is designed to keep out the number of sperm during a pre orgasm and as many as it can before it gets overwhelmed. So in a case such as yours it gave out, but the instant one gets by it releases a hormone that kills the sperm inside. At this point there will be signs of decay in the cells in a few minutes so one more scan will give us an answer miss Brand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if they continue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two options, first is a full vaccine which will take two days to be 100% certain of termination. Or you leave the academy for maternity leave until you are able bodied again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo sat around feeling conflicted and mixed. She could potentially have your baby or there won't be at all. \"Doctor one more question...can I ever have children?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. The barrier is unresponsive once it has given out so we can refuel it or you may choose not to. You have a future miss Brand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt relived yet still guilty feeling a little hopeful she won't be fertile, but mainly so she wouldn't deal with the pain of choosing between duty or life. She would rather let it be out of her hands than have be in them. But still the information dumped on to her head still shook her down and left her a bit used. Like something was taken away without knowing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were walking around looking for Arnett hoping she could shed some light on this Pandora Queen thing, but you couldn't find her. So you decided to head for the cafeteria to see if she was over there. When you got there, you looked around trying to find Arnett, but she was no where to be seen,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man. I was hoping that she would be over here at least.\" you said to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something caught your eye. Sitting a few feet away from you by a window was a pandora and her limiter drinking tea. She had curly, long, blonde hair that went past her eyes. Her eyes were a deep shade of blue that made them look like sapphires. She also saw that as she was drinking her tea, she drank it regally and with grace. Even the atmosphere around her was calm and regal. The qualities you see in a queen or princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. That girl over there. I gotta say, she certainly is different than any girl I've seen. Is she some kind of queen?\" you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you suddenly remembered. That girl looked just like the girl you saw on the poster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which means... she's Elizabeth Mably!\" you thought. \"She's the one I saw on the poster! Never thought I'd get to see her in person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you had an idea. Since you wanted to know what the Pandora Queen business was, what better way to find out than to ask the Pandora Queen herself. You walked over straight towards her and her limiter. Elizabeth who was enjoying her tea heard you coming toward her which drew her attention towards your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" you said. \"You're Elizabeth Mably am I correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's correct,\" said Elizabeth setting down her cup of tea. \"May I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I actually have a question to ask you. You're the one people call 'Pandora Queen' right? I was just wondering if you knew what this Pandora Queen was. If you do, can you please explain it to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth smiled. \"Of course I can. First off before I explain, are you aware of the prom that's taking place tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... no. It's news to me,\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then I'll explain that one first,\" said Elizabeth. \"This prom is an event that happens yearly where all the student come and dance till their hearts content. Third years and second years normally attend, but these days they're letting the first years attend as well. It's also a good opportunity for those who want to relax and have fun or find that special someone. It also helps strengthen the bond between limiters and pandoras alike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. That makes sense,\" you said nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now to answer your question,\" continued Elizabeth. \"The Pandora Queen is a beauty pageant that goes on in the evening. The winner of the pageant is determined by votes from the students.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And last year, my lady won the pageant last year thus giving her the title Pandora Queen,\" said her limiter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Well I can see why you won,\" you said. \"You definitely look and act like the part. Not to mention you have a knight in shining armor if you think about it. Pandora Queen definitely suits you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth chuckled. \"How kind of you say so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Thank you very much for kind words,\" her limiter replied bowing politely. \"You're quite a gentleman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... no problem,\" you said instinctively bowing back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Elizabeth and her limiter got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then Andr\u00e9, let's be on our way,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish,\" replied Andr\u00e9.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as Elizabeth and her limiter leave. Then Elizabeth turned to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, do you plan to join in and have your partner be in the pageant?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... to be honest, I'm not really sure. But it does sound like fun,\" you said. \"Maybe I'll go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I hope to see you then,\" said Elizabeth as she and her limiter left the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. A beauty pageant huh? It does sound interesting. Maybe I can ask Creo to with me? And maybe... maybe she can be the next pandora queen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to imagine Creo in a beautiful dress wearing a royal robe and a crown. You had to admit, she looked beautiful. The Creo in your fantasy looked at you and she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)... My sweet (name)...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehe....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirked with a goofy grin on your face. Then a voice calling your name snapped you out of your fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)? (name)?! Hello! Anyone there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally snapped out of your fantasy to see that the person who you called you was...</span></div></div>",

I could swing some votes your way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I don't care about a beauty contest, she is my #1 and nobody needs to know except me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wham! Look at you all rapid firing the charming one-liners.\", she gently punched your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was what I used to do back in the old days.\", then Creo came passing by hoping to speak with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Creo.\", she hugged her tightly, \"Hey whats up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) can we talk in private?\", Arnett immediately knew what that meant but couldn't know exactly what the news would be. She left you and Creo alone hoping whatever the news it didn't devastate anyone. \"(Name)......I'm.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creo?\", you cowered in fear of the anticipation yet you stood still thinking what she might say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm combat ready\", in other words the bio-organic wall did it's job. \"They said we were very lucky.

I should have been more careful. I'm sorry Creo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here.\", she smooched your cheek. You lit up and looked at her, she was still smiling. No sadness or anger, just plain joy. While the idea was certainly not one to be left behind, the fact of dodging that inevitability now was a relief on both your ends. You hugged her and kissed her neck lovingly. \"Hehehehehe. You can't reach up to my lips. Your struggling just with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then lower them down for me.\", you joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett heard enough before you and Creo started getting frisky that things were going to handle themselves just fine. The choice for family was taken away this time but when the time was right, and you were ready, it would come next time.</span></div></div>",

All you had to wear was your usual school uniform, but Creo on the other hand, she needed to get dressed and prepare a surprise for you. You didn't know what she had in mind, but you couldn't wait to find out. You walked to your dorm room wanting to get ready for the prom, but then you saw someone a few feet away from you. It was Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what's he's doing here in the 2nd year dorm?\" you wondered. \"Wait... could he be...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious as to what Kazuya was up to, you quietly followed him until he stopped in front of a certain someone's dorm room. You hid behind and You knew who it belonged to, but you were a little surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kazuya's planning to take Satellizer to the prom? I understand they're both partners and stuff, but... I would've figured that Satellizer would turn him down because of her being so anti-social.\" you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya knocked on the door and waited for Satellizer to come out. Then the door opened and Satellizer flying out in a bright red dress from which she tripped over. She landed right on top of Kazuya which made them both be in a compromising position with Satellizer's knee on Kazuya's crotch and Kazuya's hand on her breast. Both of them were also blushing a bright pink while you couldn't help, but be a little embarrassed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So um... how are you?\" asked Kazuya awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good,\" replied Satellizer who felt equally awkward. \"I'm... just a little nervous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are those two doing?!?\" you thought. \"Do they even realize the position they're in?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a firework went off outside the dorm room making you jump in surprise. Satellizer being the pandora with good instincts heard you and immediately looked in your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's there? Come out!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, easy!\" you said as you came out of hiding. \"It's just me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh (name). It's just you,\" said Satellizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she was relieved, but then her cheeks took a hint of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! (anme)?! What are you doing here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... well... I was curious as to what Kazuya was up to and so... I followed.him which led me to here.\" you said scratching your head. \"I take it the both of you are going to the prom right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Kazuya. \"I...was just going to pick her up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" you said. \"Also... How long are you going you two gonna stay like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya and Satellizer looked at the position they were in.

I came here for a different reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what reason is that?\" asked Satellizer narrowing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To put it plainly it's about you two,\" said Attia crossing her arms.  \"The third years excluding Arnett and Creo have decided that the punishment of Satellizer El Bridget and (name) will be suspended.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suspended?\" said you and Kazuya together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. Therefore, I'm not here as a representative my class, but merely a student acting on her own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why is that?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I've come to challenge her to a duel,\" said Attia pointing directly at Satellizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A duel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could say anything, Kazuya immediately stood in front of Satellizer with his arms spread out wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't do this!\" he said with a determined look on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer as well as you looked at Kazuya with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kazuya...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me Satellizer. I know you don't want me to butt in, but I have to do this even if it means you'll scold or yell at me for it,\" said Kazuya. \"I just can't stand by while you're being put in harms way. If I didn't feel that, I wouldn't be able to call myself your partner. That's just how I feel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kazuya...\" said Satellizer who felt touched by Kazuya's proclamation. You couldn't help, but feel a little moved yourself. Attia on the other hand sighed exasperatedly slightly annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh goodness. Aren't you both jumping the gun a little bit? You all have no idea what I'm talking about do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, Satellizer, and Kazuya now looked puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on a minute,\" Satellizer said. \"Didn't you just say that you were challenging me to a duel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I did, but not in the way you were thinking,\" said Attia. \"After all, I wouldn't want our prom being disrupted by bloodshed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what did you mean?\" you asked. \"Get to the point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I challenged Satellizer to a duel, I meant a duel for the crown,\" said Attia as she tore off her school clothes. What was underneath made yours and Kazuya's eyes widen with surprise. Even Satellizer couldn't believe what she saw. Attia was now standing before them wearing a maid uniform. She had black shoes with stockings with white bows on them. She was also wearing a short apron that revealed her white panties and she wore a black and white top that showed a lot of skin. You had to admit it, but it definitely suited her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen well Satellizer. Enter the Pandora Queen contest! The winner of the battle will be determined the votes received,\" continued Attia. \"If you're not up for it then you can always back out, but that would mean admitting your defeat and I would be the victor of the duel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's ridiculous!\" said Kazuya. \"There's no way that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kazuya could finish Satellizer cut in stopping him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine then. I will accept your challenge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kazuya looked at Satellizer in surprise. Even Attia looked at Satellizer not expecting her to respond to her challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Satellizer are you sure you want to do this?\" asked Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You don't have to this if you don't want to,\" you added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No matter what form a battle may take, I will never admit defeat!\" said Satellizer with a determined look on her face. Attia for some reason stepped back defensively covering her breasts as if she was intimidated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! I'll be looking forward to it!\" she said and started walking away. Then she turned around. \"And just so you know, you'll need more than big jugs to beat me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jugs?\" said Satellizer looking a little puzzled. She had no idea what Attia meant, but you and Kazuya sure did. You both instinctively looked at Satellizer and her breasts. Then you looked away feeling a little embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell am I doing? I got Creo!\" you thought to yourself. \"Besides, Creo's way bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And as for you (name),\" continued Attia. \"There's something I've been meaning to say to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's that?\" you asked defensively trying not to look flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia paused as she struggled trying to say something. Then she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen! I'm only saying this is because Chiffon told me to so listen okay?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then tell me already!\" you said. \" I ain't the suspense type.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for what happened!\" said Attia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you, Kazuya, and Satellizer weren't surprised enough, you were now. There was a long silence then you spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... what did you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I was sorry!\" said Attia. \"But don't get wrong idea! I still don't like the fact that you're chummy with Arnett and Creo and I especially don't like the fact that you and Creo are partners, but I'll damned if I'm gonna stand by while you look at other women besides Creo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I wasn't looking at...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter! If you make Creo cry, I'll make you regret it you hear me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone stared at Attia as if she became some kind of alien. Then Attia turned heel and walked away. Even after she left, you all couldn't believe what you had just transpired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the world was that all about?\" asked Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing that she was apologizing,\" said Satellizer. \"Although... she did have a funny way of showing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I guess so,\" you replied. \"\"However, I'm still gonna keep an eye out for her. Just to be safe.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way (name), I take it that you're gonna go to the prom as well?\" asked Satellizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I'm going with Creo,\" you replied. \"Oh crap! That reminds me! I gotta go get ready! I'll see you guys later! Meet you at the prom! Good luck Satellizer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, you hurried back to your dorm room to get ready for the prom.</span></div></div>",

Since you didn't have anything fancy like a tuxedo and such, you decided to wear your usual school uniform. You looked at yourself in the mirror and made sure you looked good and that everything was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK! My uniform looks good. I look good and I'm all set,\" you said to yourself. \"Man, normally I don't really care about my appearance, but in this case I'll make an exception. After all, I get to dance with Creo again... I can't wait to see her in a dress again. Wait...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to start fantasizing again, but you quickly stopped yourself,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck am I doing? Why the heck am I being such an idiot about this? I'm acting like an idiotic school girl. I'm just going to dance with Creo. It's not like it's my first time doing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you happened to look at your desk. There lying on top of it was the picture of you and Makoto lying face down. You went over to it and looked at it. Normally, whenever you looked at it, but now you felt different. You didn't feel neither depressed or angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that I think about it, it has been a while since I've felt this way before. I wonder if it's because of Creo,\" you thought. \"She certainly has changed my life for the better. Not to mention Arnett, Kazuya and the others. They made everything that I went through seem like a distant memory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the photo once again remembering all the times you went through with Creo and remembering the times you went through with Makoto. After staring at the photo, you then placed back on your desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I doing? There's no time for me to be thinking about this. I gotta go and meet Creo. The prom's probably already started by now. Well then, time to go.\"'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting on your uniform and checking yourself one more time, you left your dorm room and headed for the prom to meet Creo,</span></div></div>",

Couples and partners were slow-dancing and the mood was just plain romantic for the typical setting dances are fantasized over. You scanned the crowd for Creo yet she was nowhere to be found until you felt an arm wrap around your neck. Creo didn't waste anytime with words, she took you right on the dance floor and already began dancing. Her tall body towered over yours as she effortlessly had you in her hands and dipped you down more than once. She was so aggressive that it was out of character for her to be this passionate out in the open. During the slower moments during the music she brought herself down to face level teasing you with the desire to kiss her lovely face. But she always continued to pull right out of it teasing you, getting to get you to want more. Finally when the slow-dance was over she stopped taking charge and let you have control. You wanted to get closer to her pretty face but didn't let you yet. Now the music became more upbeat and now she expected you to take lead. You tripped up her leg and dipped her down and then reeled her near enough for you to suggest what they do. You both backed away for a second and with style mimicked your battle moves. They were done in a way where you looked like you were fighting but it looked more like choreographed ballet. You and her had no idea what you were doing or thinking you both just acted on impulse. For the big finish you grabbed Creo by the waist and then she lifted you up and left you hanging with only one arm. It was thrilling albeit surprising. After that you two noticed that you were among the other few who were the center of attention so it was a pleasant turnout from it all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo spoke and said, \"Think you wanna ditch the party now?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\", you answered. Just as you were about to leave though they announced the winner of the Pagent. \"And in first place is Satelizer el Bridget!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Creo clapped real hard happy to hear the news that she won. It only made you smile more so that Attia lost her 'duel' forcing you to chuckle softly. With the last thing that had gotten any serious interest in you two Creo left headed back to your room.</span></div></div>",

But that was okay. This was the perfect opportunity for you and Creo to be by yourselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the first time in a while I've been in a second year room,\" said Creo. \"It's a bit nostalgic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" you said. \"Anyway... I...had a lot of fun tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you did,\" said Creo smiling. \"I did too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You certainly surprised me on the dancing,\" you said. \"I never expected you to know how to dance like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha. Sorry about that,\" said Creo blushing. \"As soon as I saw you, I couldn't help, but show off some of my moves.I know you probably didn't like me taking the lead, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you interrupted Creo by hugging her from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I loved it,\" you whispered. \"In fact... when you dipped me like that, for some reason... my heart jumped like crazy. It... kinda...making me want to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to get the words to come out, but you trailed off because you felt too embarrassed to finish. Creo was a little surprised as well, but then she gently placed her hands on top of yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel the same way,\" she whispered. \"When you took control and dipped me, you surprised me too. Not to mention... I couldn't help but tease you because of how cute you were being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed a bright shade of pink and hugged Creo a little tighter while burying your face in her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that's not true. I'm not cute,\" you mumbled pouting a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo turned around and faced you. Then she bent down and placed a kiss right on your lips. You both kissed for a few seconds then you both separated. Creo cupped your face with her hands gently and looked into your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name). You do realize that when you deny it, it makes you not only cuter, but it makes me wanna tease you even more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed a bright pink and your heart leaped. You didn't want to admit, but having Creo tell you that made you want to do it, but at the same time you wanted to hold back for some reason. It was probably because you didn't want Creo to see you in a defenseless state when you did it the first time. You were teetering from wanting to do it to not wanting to do it. Then Creo whispered in your ear and said something that finally made your decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on... do you not want to? I understand if you don't want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing that you decide...</span></div></div>",

I don't want you to get pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotcha covered,\" said Creo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dug in her cleavage and pulled out a pack of condoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With these we're good,\" said Creo. \"Now let's do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you had a chance to react, Creo grabbed the back of your head and crashed her lips into yours into a lustful and passionate kiss. You both savored the flavor of each others lips, your tongues wrestling with each other seeking dominance. Creo had the advantage, but you weren't about to lose to her. You wrapped your arm around Creo's hip and gave her butt a squeeze. Creo moaned in the kiss and she started to falter. You pushed her tongue with yours thinking you had won in the dominance game, but Creo had other ideas. With a smirk on her face, she wrapped her arms around you and gave your butt a hard squeeze and using her strength Creo lifted you up and was now holding you off the ground while her lips were still locked with yours. The kiss never broke until you felt your lungs needed air. You both broke the kiss with a string of saliva connecting your mouths. You both gazed at each other with hazy and lustful filled eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell are you so strong?\" you asked looking at the position you were in. \"Aren't I heavy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not that heavy,\" said Creo. \"You're actually quite light.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is... that supposed to be a compliment?\" you asked blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't I let you decide that?\" said Creo coolly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dummy,\" you answered blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha. It's your fault for being so cute,\" said Creo giggling as she met your lips in another kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile carrying and kissing you, she walked over to your bed and set you down on it. You both wrestled with your lips once again. This time, Creo had complete dominance over you. You wrapped your arm around her and let pleasure of the kiss course through your body. Your body felt warm and your member felt rock hard. After a minute of kissing, you both separated once more. Creo then stood up from her bed and started to strip. You watched intently as removed her clothes. Soon Creo stood before you naked once more. This may have been the second or third time you've seen her naked, but you still felt that her body was incredible. You sat up and were about to take off your clothes, but Creo stopped you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on. I want to do it,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou being so turned on and not wanting to argue with her, nodded and didn't move. Creo then unbuttoned and took off your shirt and pulled off your pants as well as your boxers. You lied there on the bed naked anticipating for what Creo was going to do. She got on top of you, then got herself really close and started kissing your neck. She also traced her hand along your thigh making you feel a tickling and pleasurable sensation on your legs. You shivered as you felt these sensations throughout your body. Creo then went from your neck to nibbling your ear. You instinctively flinched let out a small gasp as she teased your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-creo! Stop it...\" you stuttered. \"It feels weird...when you do that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo smiled. \"You sure you want me to stop? Because it seems to me that you like this feeling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what makes you sure about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo stopped kissing your neck and looked in your eyes. Then she reached her hand down below and squeezed you now rock hard member enticing you to moan. Creo chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what makes me so sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're teasing me again aren't you?\" you answered sulkily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got me, but then again you like it when I tease you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you do. It's OK. I like it when you're like this. It makes me want to mess with you more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo then kissed you again while massaging your member making you moan in the kiss. Your tongues wrestled once again in lust seeking pleasure. Both of your body heat began to climb and your hearts were beating faster. In your mind, you saw nothing but pink and you could think of nothing but pleasure. You felt like you were gonna get swept away from the pleasure alone, but you did your very best to keep yourself in check. You didn't want to end up being submissive anymore than you already are, but the pleasure was making your member leak and making it even more pleasurable. You were feeling yourself getting close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creo... I..I'm getting close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pleasure started to get intense and you were about to come, but all of a sudden just when your limit was about to be broken, Creo stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...! Why did you stop....crap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were gonna go crazy, but you caught yourself and covered your mouth. Unfortunately for you, Creo caught on to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw. What's wrong (name)? Did you want to come?\" she asked teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I mean... no! I mean...Grrr! Stop teasing me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... OK. I'll stop teasing you. However... I want you to tell me. Tell me that you want to come,\" said Creo seductively in your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately blushed a deep shade of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! There's no way I would do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well. I guess I'm gonna have to keep teasing you then..\" said Creo as she went back to rubbing your member going slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now in a war with yourself. You wanted more pleasure and to cum, but you also didn't want to lose your pride as a man. It was getting hard to think because of Creo touching your member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK! I want to come! Please make me come Creo! I can't stand it anymore!\" you conceded giving in to your desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo smiled and gave you a kiss on your cheek. \"That's my (name). So cute when you're submissive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned your head away in embarrassment and in shame. \"Shut up... meanie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha. I'm sorry (name). I couldn't resist. You're just so cute when you're like this,\" said Creo smiling. \"Let me make it up to you. There's something I want to try that I read from a book and I think you'll like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo went down and put your member in between her breasts. A warm enveloped your member making you gasp in surprise. This was the legendary paizuri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is it?\" asked Creo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... amazing...\" you moaned. \"It's unlike anything I've felt before... It...feels so warm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo squeezed her breasts with your member between them. The sensation alone made your member twitch and leak out more fluid which made the gully more slick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa... it's leaking out more now and it's even moving?\" breathed Creo in amazement. \"I'm starting to love your body more and more (name).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then pressed her breasts together harder and started to move them up and down making your member pop up and down in the gully. You were feeling even more than you did before and you started thrusting your hips in time with Creo's pressing. Creo herself was feeling turned as well. So much so, that she started getting wet herself. She started to move even faster and made her breasts press harder. You breathing became even more ragged as you gripped the sheets trying to endure the pleasure. Creo seeing you trying to resist smiled and then took the head of your member in her mouth and started sucking. She bobbed her head as she also rubbed her breasts on the sides of your member. You moaned loudly and instinctively placed your hand of Creo's head and pushed it in time of her bobbing feeling absolutely incredible. The pleasure was so overwhelming that you were on the edge of coming. Hearing you moan, Creo went faster and sucked harder. You curled your toes and your muscles tensed as the feeling of coming grew more closer and closer. Soon you reached your limit and then you came inside Creo's mouth. During your orgasm, Creo sucked harder making the orgasm even more intense than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creo...!! If you keep doing that... you're gonna suck me dry...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo didn't listen. She continued to suck making sure that not a single drop was wasted. After a few seconds, your orgasm died down and you lied there on the bed exhausted by the intense pleasure. Creo who had taken your cum in her mouth swallowed it and lied down on top of you with a big grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how was it? Did I do good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...was...awesome...\" you breathed still feeling the afterglow of your orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad,\" said Creo. \"But it's not over yet. I'm ready for the best part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... come on...at least...let me...catch my breath..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...nope.\" said Creo smiling as she got on top ready to do more.</span></div></div>",

Creo moaned as she began to falter. You immediately started massaging her breast and also pinching her nipples. You also used your other hand to rub Creo's downstairs making her twice as more wet as she was before. Being under complete ecstasy, Creo surrendered to your attack and you were under complete control. After a while, you and Creo separated.

I wanna see that face more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, the fire of your lust started blazing inside you. You got close to Creo and whispered to her in a low and husky voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way Creo. It's time I get a little payback from before. Besides... I want to see that face your making more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo eyes widened in surprise and before she could object, you grabbed her hips and began to thrust inside her in quick and hard strokes. Your member went back and forth, scraping past various parts inside her. Creo moans grew a stage louder as everything twisted around inside her as you pounded her. Her ample breasts shook with every movement and glistened with sweat along with the rest of her body. The sight alone was incredibly stimulating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)! It's...too much! It feels so good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo instinctively wrapped her legs around you wanting more pleasure. You continued pounding her like mad not wanting to stop, but then you had an idea. A naughty idea. Then you stopped moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... come on don't stop now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want more Creo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please... keep going...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK then, I will, but only... if you beg for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Come on... don't make beg for it,\" Creo whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? You made me beg for it a while ago. Now you're telling me that you can't? OK then. Guess this is all you're gonna get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to move about to pull out, but Creo tightened her legs preventing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...come on (name)... please start moving again... I'm gonna go crazy if you don't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK then. You asked for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that Creo wanted you to go crazy on her, but you wanted her to beg for it. You wanted to see her face when she was defenseless like she did with you before. You did what Creo asked and started moving again, but you purposely moved slowly. The pleasure Creo was feeling slowly began to die down and she wasn't happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...! Come on! You can go faster than that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. You said to move, but I assumed you wanted me to move at this speed. You should be a little more clear,\" you said innocently. \"How do you want me to move?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I um... I...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo was trying to get the words to come out, but for some reason she was too embarrassed to say what she wanted. She let out a groan of frustration and started hitting you on your chest like a little kid. It didn't hurt, but it was very cute seeing her like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrr... you jerk! You're doing this on purpose aren't you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" you smirked with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo looked at you with a pouty expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now who's the one being mean dummy?\" she grumbled sulkily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider it payback from before. I'm willing to start moving again, but... I want to hear you tell me,\" you said in a low voice. \"I want you to tell me how I should move. Tell me that right now and I'll start moving how you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo's stared at you in shock and then she turned her face down not looking at you. At first you thought that you overdid it with the teasing, but then you saw Creo's mouth move, but you couldn't hear what she was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creo? I can't hear you. What are you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Creo looked at you with her face pink with embarrassment and her eyes dewy. She looked like she was on the brink of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please (name)... I want you to do me hard and fast... do it so fast and hard that you'll make me come! I'm begging you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face immediately turned a bright shade of red and your heart jumped and skipped a few beats. This was it! You were finally seeing Creo defenseless and submissive and you loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)? Did you hear me? I said I...mpphhh!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sealed Creo's mouth with a kiss once again and began pistoning your hips in her like crazy. Creo moaned loudly in the kiss and clung to you tight. Then separated from her lips and started sucking on one of her nipples while still moving. You sucked hard while pulling on it not letting go. Creo moans now became screams as she clung tighter to you feeling unbelievable amounts on pleasure. She wrapped her arms around your head and pressed you against her breast seeking more. You couldn't see anything and you were being practically smothered, but you didn't care. You were feeling way to good to care. You continued to suck and pound her lost in the pleasure. The pleasure mounted and mounted until you it was getting close to exploding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)! I'm... getting close! I'm getting close!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't say anything because of having Creo's nipple in your mouth, but anyone could tell that you were getting close as well. You answered by sucking Creo's nipple even harder. With a few more last thrusts, you went over the top. You gave one more last thrust before cumming, filling up the condom inside of Creo. Creo reached her orgasm as well, arching her back and letting out a pleasured and strangled scream. Her mouth hung open and her body bucked as she saw nothing but white. Eventually both of your orgasms ended and you finally let go out Creo's nipple. You both stayed like that breathing heavily and basking in the afterglow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh...(name)...I...never knew... that you could be such a beast...\" she sighed huskily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's fault...do you think that is...?\" you said catching your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha. Nonetheless... you were incredible... I even got a souvenir...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a look at my nipple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at Creo's nipple and you saw that it had an impressive hickey on it. When you saw it, you immediately blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap... I'm so sorry,\" you apologized. \"I didn't hurt you did I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" said Creo. \"It hurt, but at the same time it left really good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... In fact... I think I've fallen even more in love with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... yeah. Sure,\" you said embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nuzzled your face on Creo's breasts not wanting her to see your embarrassed face. Creo chuckled and wrapped her arms around you and embraced you in a hug. She also petted your head like you were a kitten or a dog. It made you feel very comfortable being with her like this. So much so, that you started to feel a little sleepy. Eventually you feel asleep.</span></div></div>",

You noticed the time but didn't care you moved around a bit to get back into your comfy position while spooning Creo. You rested your head back onto her chest but despite trying to be gentle your rustling woke up Creo. She exhaled a big yawn and petted your hair, stroking it like a pet's fur. \"Hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi to you too.\", you replied smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you (Name).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too. Nothing could ruin this.\", soon as you said that the door opened to have Kazuya holding a letter. He was looking down at the writing before he noticed you and Creo indecent. \"KAZUYA GET OUT!\", just as he heard that he snapped out of his focus on the letter and for a split-second noticed you and Creo naked in bed. He ran right back out and didn't see anything other than a blurred moment of the two of you without clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING! JUST NEEDED TO TELL YOU! I'll just leave, and this letter by your door. OK.....second time in 24 hours I had to see a naked lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Creo blushed feeling a bit shocked, \"Why is it we forgot to lock the room door?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We forgot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh well now I feel awake so c'mon lets go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't need to.

Get dressed, sweep it under the rug, we'll kiss and make up in 4 minutes.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,,,but lets skip to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET Dressed.\", she said insistently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'll read the letter and see what Kazuya wanted.\", as you put on your uniform you read the letter only to be met with emotions of distress.</span></div></div>",

It's a letter requesting you to come East Genetics,\" said Sister Margaret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't screw with me smartass!\" you said coldly. \"I mean why the hell am I being summoned to that place! Why there? Is this some kind of sick joke?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. It's not a joke at all,\" said Sister Margaret calmly. \"The reason being is that someone asked you to come to East Genetics so they can pay their respects to you and Mr. Kazuyza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paying respects my ass! How do I know this is isn't some lame ass prank to try and make me remember and feel like crap for what I did huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now (name). I promise you, this person isn't trying to 'prank' you or anything like that,\" said Sister Margaret. She simply wants to pay her respects to you and Kazuya. Nothing more and nothing less.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right. If they really wanted to pay respects, they should do it at my face. Until then, I'm out of here and I'm not going. Sorry, but I don't want to be seen over at there. Especially because of how they treated me. See ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned towards the door about to walk out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if the person who requested you to come happens to be a close friend of yours?\" asked Sister Margaret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped walking and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true that you were only close to Makoto, but you were close with someone else. You know her now and days as 'The Godspeed of the East' Cassie Lockhart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you heard that name, you felt a wave of surprise and nostalgia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassie? She's the one that wanted me to come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's correct, but if you don't want to come then I'll just tell her that you're busy and couldn't make it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stayed silent. Then you left the room, but not before saying...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. I'll go, but only because it's for Cassie. Don't forget that.<br>\r\n(flashback ends)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I said I would come, but still. I feel like I wanna crawl under a freaking rock right now. Well... I guess I should probably look at the bright side. Maybe it won't be so bad. And I'll at least get to see Cassie after a couple of years. Hopefully this visit won't go to hell.\"</span></div></div>",

Where is Ms. Lockhart?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''In the high gardens awaiting her guests. She preferred to speak in privet with each of her designated guests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you and the others walked with him to the high gardens.

Creo knew you hailed from here after she found out who you were but only now did she find out just how unnerved you were by just coming back here. You were shaking, your fists were so tight they were making marks inside your palms, you wanted to leave so badly. Creo took your arm and hugged it. She rubbed her hand over your back trying to comfort you and in respect she did. But only until when you saw for the first time in a while the face of your old friend, Cassie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was with her limiter, Kyoichi Minase, sitting together on a bench having lunch together enjoying each others company. She seemed very happy, she was smiling brightly and the mood seemed like it may not be so hard to get through. But when she noticed everyone arriving her smile went away snapping her back. \"Kazuya Aoi, Satellizer el Bridget, (Name). Thank you for coming upon my request.\", she bowed. You all bowed in respect for her. \"(Name) if you would be kind as to join me on a walk I would appreciate it to be allowed time alone with you first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be fine with that.\", Creo was a little shocked and deep down a bit jealous.

Sigh....she's wonderful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at the very least if she does reciprocate the feelings then I couldn't be any happier.\", she said feeling genuinely relieved to hear the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could say the same about you, you seemed to be having the time of your life back there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Kyoichi has been wonderful. Were planning on making it official soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm very happy for you Cassie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too. But still...did it feel terrible coming back here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassie I want to leave as soon as were finished here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would have come to you but when I heard you were friends with Aoi and Satellizer I figured having you all here would be simpler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. Btw does anyone here ever mention me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as bad as before. But whenever they slander you I stand up for you. Look whatever happened here that gave you that defect is something those bastards running the place will never admit screwing up. And Makoto should have been up front about how she felt about you so that what happened didn't happen and that you could let it go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd have gotten her killed every chance we were sent out there. I loved her too much to recover from that. Fact....\", you paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\", she inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. thanks for inviting me.

Then she asked...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think of (name)?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... he's a good friend and a strong ally I guess,\" said Satellizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think that he will become a strong limiter even after everything that has happened to him in the past?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer was puzzled. \"I... don't understand what you mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me explain. You are aware about (name)'s previous pandora Makoto correct? Including how she died?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. She died in battle because of (name) right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister Margaret sighed. \"As I thought, you don't know the full story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do mean? I heard from the sisters that (name)'s pandora died because they let an amateur like him out in battle. Isn't that what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but at the same time no. Makoto did indeed die on that day, but it wasn't because of (name). I feel that it was somehow my fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Satellizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Kazuya and Cassie they went in the gardens just like what you and she did a while ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what did you want to talk to me about Ms. Lockhart?\" asked Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please call me Cassie,\" she replied. \"And... I wanted to pay my respects to your sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you know my sister? How?\" gasped Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me explain. After the Eighth Nova Clash, the stigmata that came from her were considered Sacreds and given to select pandora. Including me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on. Does that mean... you have my sister's stigmata?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. As soon as I heard that you were Kazuha's brother and were at West Genetics, I had to have you come right away so I could thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... there's really no need to thank me. I really didn't do anything... Hey Cassie. Mind if I ask you something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... you know (name) right? I mean are both of you are friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I've known (name) for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then... can you tell me something? It might be just me, but... (name)'s been acting really strange. Ever since we came here... well in fact ever since we embarked on this trip, he's been acting... tense. And not just that, I noticed that the headmaster was looking at him the wrong way like he holds a grudge against him. So... do you know what's going on with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie looked at Kazuya before looking down at the ground solemnly. \"I guess he doesn't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"I know exactly what's going with (name). He's still feeling the emotional scars from back then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emotional scars? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Cassie turned to Kazuya looking serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kazuya. Listen to me closely. What I'm about to tell you is not only sensitive information, but (name) can't know that I told you. He'd be very upset with me if he found out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... OK. I won't tell,\" said Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK then. It all started about a year ago. Back when (name) was a first year and attending here in East Genetics. He was a very promising student. Smart, kind, and skilled in battle. He also was friends with most of the students including me and was popular with the third years, but there was one person that he cared about more than anyone else in the whole world. That was Makoto. Out of all the girls in the world, she was his whole world. There wasn't any moment where they would not be together. They were like two peas in a pod. They did everything together from talking, helping with schoolwork and even fighting together. They seemed to be the perfect pair and coupe, so one day (name) asked Makoto if he would become his limiter and Makoto agreed. (name) was so happy. He thought he had found his dream girl, but sadly... he didn't. You see (name) thought that when a limiter and pandora were baptized, they would be lovers and eternal partners. Unfortunately (name) found out the hard way that it wasn't true. You see one day, (name) confessed his feelings to Makoto. He assumed that Makoto would feel the same about him, but... she didn't. It turned out that Makoto was in love with someone else who was already in a partnership. She also told him that they could still be intimate together as friends with benefits. Disgusted and heart-broken, (name) went to his dorm and stayed in his room all day without ever coming out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen things took a turn for the worst. For the day after that, a powerful Nova attacked. The Nova wiped out everything in it's path intent on destruction. The main platoon was forced to retreat so reinforcements could be sent to help them. (name) and Makoto were among those reinforcements. When they got there, Makoto was the first to engage the Nova. (name) was still feeling the shocks from his heartbreak and that was causing problems with his freezing. It was so bad that his freezing grew weaker and weaker. He tried his best, but it was too much. His powers gave out and then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie paused cringing from remembering what happened next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" asked Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie took a deep breath and resumed her story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By then another platoon of reinforcements came and they were able to stop the Nova, but... it was too late. On that day, Makoto lost her life. I can still remember how (name) looked on that day. He was filled with so much grief and things kept getting worse from there. Because of what happened, the higher ups speculated that Makoto's death was caused by (name)'s 'flawed' stigmata. This caused everyone to blame him for what happened. He was bullied, ostracized in class, and was treated very horribly. Then the sisters decided that they would have (name) sent back to the academy in hopes of strengthening his stigmata. This gave birth to two things regarding (name). The first was his hatred from the system for what they did to him and Makoto and the second was his title; 'The Imperfect Limiter' .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya stared at Cassie in shock not believing what he had just heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassie... is all of this true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and what's really sad about it is that (name)'s heart has never fully recovered. In fact, he swore that he would never fall in love again or make friends which is why I find it a miracle that he's with Creo and is friends with me, you, and Satellizer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It also explains why he was such a loner back when I first met him.\" said Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It seems like no matter where he goes, (name)'s past will come back to haunt him and what really makes me upset that it wasn't even his fault. I just wish that I could've helped him. Some friend I was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie squeezed her hands in frustration, but Kazuya gently placed his hand over them to calm her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Cassie. If you think about it, you're already helping him by being his friend,\" he said gently. \"You stick up for him even when he's not around. I'd say you're a great friend and I'm sure (name) would tell you the same thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie frustrated frown turned into a smile. \"Thank you. That means a lot Kazuya. In fact, I feel a lot better knowing that (name) has a good friend like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya blushed. \"It's...no big deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any case, I guess we better head back. Satellizer and Sister Margaret are waiting. By the way Kazuya, how's Satellizer doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. She's doing well. Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no reason. Just curious,\" said Cassie and she and Kazuya left the garden.<br>\r\n___________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister Margaret had just finished telling the exact same story that Cassie told Kazuya and Satellizer was shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way... that's how (name)'s partner died? I... I had no idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. It really was tragic,\" said Sister Margaret as she stared into the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But there's one thing I don't get though,\" said Satellizer. \"If (name) was sent back to the academy then why have him at West Genetics?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I have hoped to mend his heart and have him find a partner that not only suits him, but loves him too. I also think that he has what it takes to become a strong limiter. He just needs time and love is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to Satellizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I want you to please keep what I told you a secret from (name). If he were to find out about it, then I'm afraid he would be very... agitated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer nodded in understanding swearing she would keep her word.Then Kazuya and Cassie came back. After saying goodbye to Cassie, the three made their way back to the chopper.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the chopper, you and Creo were sitting in their seats in waiting for the others. Neither one of them said a word. After a while, Creo spoke breaking the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)? Are you OK now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine. I... was just thinking. Creo? Let me ask you something. Do you have any regrets of becoming my limiter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo looked at you in surprise. \"Why would you ask me such a question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just that... I feel like it's something that I don't deserve. Even though it was an accident, people think it doesn't change the fact that Makoto died because of me. I can still remember what happened after the incident. The glares people gave me. How they treated me. Even the teachers including the Headmaster hated me. They all kept treating like a criminal, even calling me a murderer. At first I ignored them and endured it, but eventually I started to believe them. I felt like scum. Scum that didn't deserve to live. Someone who didn't deserve to have what we have right now, but... something changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was it?\" asked Creo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was when I talked to Kazuya the other day. Back when I first met him and Satellizer. I saw how he kept going to Satellizer even thought she was dangerous. I told him to get away from her if he wanted to live because I didn't want him to end up like me. Then... Kazuya said something that made me think. He told me that he kept going to her because he knew that she was good even though she was The Untouchable Queen. He wanted to be with her because he saw the good in her and he wanted me to see it too. That made me think and inspired at the same time. So I decided to try and see the good in Satellizer too and as chance had it, I saw the good in her. It gave me hope. Hope that someone would see the good in me too. And someone did. You. It didn't matter what I did. You accepted me without a second thought. You even became my partner and my lover and it wasn't just you. Arnet, Kazuya, and even Satellizer. You all became my friends. It made me feel...happy and it helped me ease the pain of Makoto's death. I still feel terrible about it when I'm here, but... I feel like I'm finally getting some closure on Makoto's death. And it's all thanks to you Creo. I know I'm probably just rambling, but... I want to thank you. For becoming my friend, becoming my partner, and most of all becoming my lover. Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, you planted a kiss right on Creo's lips. Creo was a bit startled, but she returned the kiss. When you both separated Creo couldn't help but smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well. Someone's being forward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who's fault is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo embraced you in a loving hug and squeezed you lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad I met you too (name). No matter what anyone says about you or what they think, my feelings for you will never change. I'll love you always and forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Sister Margaret, Kazuya, and Satellizer came back on the plane. When you saw them, you immediately separated from her and pretended that you weren't doing anything much Creo's disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Sorry about that Mr. (name). I guess we came at the wrong time. We were inruding?\" asked Sister Margaret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you weren't,\" you said. \"You're timing's perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" chuckled Sister Margaret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer and Kazuya couldn't help, but chuckle a little too. You looked away and pretended you didn't hear them. After that the chopper took off and took off enroute to West Genetics. </span></div></div>",

This message is for all Pandora and limiters currently on campus! Pandora, equip all Volt Textures and prepare volt weapons immediately! Limiters, change into battle uniforms and assemble in the auditorium!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" you said leaping to your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A level one alert?\" said Creo. \"That means...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's been a Nova sighting,\" said Sister Margaret. She quickly turned to the pilot. \"Quickly take us down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roger,\" said the pilot as he dropped the chopper back to the ground. Then they also heard a voice coming from the radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello! This is Yu-Mei from West Genetics calling Radar 1. Do you copy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister Marget immediately took the headphones and spoke with Yu-Mei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Sister Margaret and we copy. What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sister Margaret. We've detected Nova that are close to your vicinity,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heart immediately felt like it was frozen and even Sister Margaret showed signs of shock, but she remained calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? Over here in East Genetics?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Yu-Mei. \"The dimensional interference we picked up turned out to be the Nova.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it,\" you cursed under your breath. \"Not them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's more Sister,\" said Yu-Mei. \"I have a message for you and that is for you to return to West Genetics immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" said Sister Marget. \"Very well. I will head back as soon as possible. Make you have all third year Pandora and their limiters on standby Yu-Mei.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood. Over and out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the radio was cut making it emit nothing, but static, Then Sister Margaret turned to you and your friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up. I must return to West Genetics for I am needed there. I know that you're all from West Genetics, but I need you all to go and assist the East Pandora any way you can,\" said Sister Margaret. \"Do whatever it takes to stop the Nova.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood,\" you all answered as you all immediately left the chopper and went to prepare for battle. Sister Margaret watched as you all leave. Then the chopper took off and soared off into the distance back to West Genetics. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after you, Creo, Satellizer, and Kazuya along with the East Pandora and limiters were at the auditorium awaiting their orders. Then Milena Marius stood before them with grave news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is live footage,\" she began as a display of the outside appeared before them. What you saw made your eyes widen in horror and shock. Even Satellizer couldn't believe what she was seeing. There on the display wasn't one nor two nor three, but four Nova! And they're just your run of the mill Nova. All four of them were S class Nova.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four Nova?\" Cassie breathed not believing what she was seeing too. Everyone in the auditorium began murmuring to each other having the same reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is insane!\" you thought your fists trembling. \"As if one Nova wasn't bad enough! Now we got four of these damned things?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you are all aware,\" continued Milena. \"We are under attack from four Type S Nova. The defensive line is engaging them as we speak. We will receive out orders if all else fails.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen next to Milena on the podium, a phone rang next to her. Milena answered the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes? Milena here...\" she paused listening to the person on the other end. \"Understood.\" Then she hung up and turned to the Pandora and Limiters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have our orders now,\" she said. \"General Headquarters wants all students to move out to serve as back-up limiters and Pandora. All of you prepare to depart and get ready for battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone left the auditorium and boarded in the choppers. The choppers took off and flew towards to the location to where the Nova were seen. One thing was for sure. This was going to be one hell of a fight,</span></div></div>",

Everyone in the chopper was quiet. Not a single word was spoken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn,\" you thought. \"Even I gotta say, you can cut this kind of tension with a knife. Then again I can't blame them. After all, this might be our final battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around at all the other Pandoras and Limiters. They all wore neutral expressions. All except someone you didn't expect to be in the same chopper as you. Cassie. She on the other hand wore a worried expression on her face biting her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even Cassie looks scared. I guess even the strongest person has moments of weakness. Especially when you have to deal with Nova for real.\" you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemories of you and Makoto came into your mind. The moment where she and you were picked in a platoon and when she died right in front of you. Just remembering it made you squeeze your hands into fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it. I wish I didn't have to do this. I feel like I'm repeating the past all over again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a hand fell on top of yours causing you to look up. The owner of that hand belonged to Creo who could see that you were feeling stressed about the upcoming battle. She looked at you with reassuring eyes as if she telepathically telling you that everything would be okay. You looked at her and you gave her a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way. It's not gonna be like before. Not this time,\" you thought. \"Because now I have a partner that I care about and that loves me. I promise you, I'll make sure that nothing happens to you Creo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Creo whispered to you so no one could hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)? You OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" you whispered back. \"Just thinking about something. Listen Creo there's something I want to tell you before we enter to battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to stay close to me and not take any risks in fighting the Nova, Stay close to me as much as you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why?\" asked Creo looking a little annoyed. \"We've fought one of these things before and we beat it no problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was because it was a type R Nova. Not to mention that me getting activating my freezing was nothing short of a fluke. We're talking about S class Nova here. Four of them in fact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? We were trained to deal with them with simulators, so we would know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't a simulator Creo! This is for real! I can tell you right now that these Nova are nothing like the ones in the simulators! That's why I want you to play it safe and stay close to me!\" you whispered with a harsh tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo glared looking hurt. \"You make it sound like I can't defend myself. Is that it? Do you think that I'm so weak that I can't handle myself in a battle like this!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I just don't want you to end dying for risking your life for me!\" you snapped squeezing Creo's hand. \"Listen to me. I already lost someone because of these damned things and because I was naive. I don't wanna go through that again. So please... promise me... promise me that you'll play it safe and not take any risks. I don't wanna lose you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo look of anger subsided now understanding your feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" she said. \"I promise. I'll be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the pilot's voice broke the silence and made everyone snap into attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All Pandora and Limiters! Prepare to deploy! I repeat prepare to deploy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone immediately got ready to depart. The hangar doors slowly opened and pair by pair, everyone left the chopper. Soon only you and Creo were left.

You made it back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Sister Margaret. \"I was told that I was ordered to return here as soon as possible. Who was the one who gave the order?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Elize. \"He didn't say who he was. All he said was that he would be joining us shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. What's our current status?\" asked Sister Margaret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The targets have breached through the defensive line. Civilian evacuation on is on schedule and is currently 95% complete. We have a fleet of choppers about to intercept the targets in about a minute and thirty seconds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the monitor, the nova proceeded towards East Genetics not intending to stop. In the distance from them just as Elize said, a fleet of choppers came towards the nova. They zoomed straight at them and fired all their missiles. Smoke and explosions filled the air. When the smoke pulled clear, the nova could be seen without a single scratch on it. Then the nova began to glow and then suddenly it realized a giant force of energy. The whiteness of the light completely enveloped the screen. When the light dimmed, the screen regained it's picture. There was nothing left, but the nova themselves. The choppers were completely destroyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it,\" cursed Elize under her breath. \"All of them were destroyed? Should have known that would happen. We can't even slow these damned things down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The poor solders never stood a chance,\" said Yu-Mei clenching her fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Sister Margaret could do was watch the screen her eyes filed with worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\" asked Elize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now, We'll have to let the East Pandora handle it,\" said Yu-Mei. \" You there, Have they arrived on site yet?\" she asked a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am. Chevalier platoons 3, 7, and 8 and just completed deployment and are nearing the target as we speak. We'll make a full-force assault in a hundred and eighty seconds.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" said Yu-Mei. \"Prepare for the operation as soon as you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they prepared to get the operation underway, a phone began to ring. Elize went over and answered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Yu-Mei.....yes.....yes.......understood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she hung up and she turned to Sister Margaret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sister Margaret. There's someone that's coming to here to speak with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" asked Margaret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He wouldn't give me his name, but he's on his way here as we speak,\" the woman replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the middle of a nova attack?\" asked Elize. \"Now of all times? Wonder who could it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer answer came sooner than expected for right then, the door opened and someone walked in. When Sister Margaret saw who it was, for the first time in a long time, her face turned into a scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's you again,\" she said.</span></div></div>",

He is fine and he is with someone who won't break his heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the issue.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The nova continued on slowly heading for East Genetics, but lying in wait lurking in the shadows were all the East Pandora ready to attack. The plan was simple. A Decoy strategy, Pandora who were the decoys were assigned to distract the Nova and keep it busy so the strikers can attack. Then Pandora who were strikers had the job to attack the Nova and to expose it's core. Finally were the strikers. When the core was exposed, they had to attack the core and destroy the nova. You, Creo, Satellizer, and Kazuya were assigned to be decoys and were waiting for everything else to be ready. Cassie had the job as a finisher considering that she's is the top tanked third year in East Genetics it was a job fitting her. Soon everything was ready and Milena was ready to commence the operation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. Decoys and strikers are in place and it looks like the finishers are in place as well. Is everyone ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then. Get ready everyone. Operation will commence in thirty seconds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roger that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Creo were below behind a building while Kazuya and Satellizer were behind another a few feet away from you. Cassie and the finishers were at the end of the block ready to attack at the ready. You clenched your fist and took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. Let's do this!\" you thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then,\" said Milena. \"Operation will commence in ten seconds. Decoys get ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo, Satellizer, and all the other Pandora deployed their volt weapons. Then Milena through their earphone started the countdown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five... four... three... two... one! Decoys, spread out! Keep it busy so the strikers can attack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe decoys leaped into action and charged straight at the Nova. The Nova sensing the Pandora coming retaliated with it's tentacles. Some of the Pandora were able to dodge using acceleration. Others like Creo and Satellizer were able to deflect them by breaking through them. The Nova then released a freezing field immediately catching them off guard. You, Kazuya, and the other Pandora's limiters sprung into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freezing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all activated your freezing disabling the freezing area and set all the Pandora free. You tried your best using your freezing area, but after a few seconds it started to fail you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! Why now of all times?!\" you cursed as your freezing began to dim down. \"I can't... keep this up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a even powerful freezing overtook yours. You looked to right and saw Kazuya who amped up the power of his freezing to make up for yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK (name)! I got your back!\" he called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you! Don't push yourself too hard!\" you called back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strikers! Now's the time! Move in now! Expose the core!\" called Milena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt her command, more Pandora moved in and attacked the nova. Using their volt weapons, the striker Pandora attacked the nova until it's surface broke and the core was exposed shining brightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right finishers! Go! Get to the core and destroy it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe finisher Pandora leaped into action and went to the core. Cassie leaped into air and began to glow in a blue light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quadruple acceleration!\" she shouted as she shot towards the nova heading right for it's core like a rocket. You were amazed seeing Cassie use her acceleration for the first time,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incredible! I can't believe how fast she is! No wonder she's called the Godspeed of the East,\" you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilena watched as Cassie grew closer and closer to the Nova's core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Cassie... We're all counting on you!\" she thought clenching her fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will finish it!\" Cassie yelled as she prepared to strike the core, but suddenly before she could, she was struck down by the Nova's tentacle and sent to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" you thought. \"I knew that it's a Nova we're talking about, but how was it able to get Cassie during her acceleration?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie straightened up from the rubble. She wasn't hurt, but she was more surprised from what had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did... it time it's attack to intercept me?\" she wondered. \"The filthy monster knew my quadruple acceleration was coming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with you, Creo and Satellizer rushed to you and Kazuya's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)! Kazuya! Are you two okay?\" asked Creo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're fine Creo,\" you said. \"Thanks to Kazuya backing me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" asked Satellizer. \"The Nova was somehow able to predict Cassie's acceleration and stop her attack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" you said. \"One things for sure, this is definitely not like the Nova me and Creo fought before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... you and Creo fought  a Nova?\" gasped Kazuya. \"When was this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story, but back in the Ingrid incident, me and Creo fought a Nova and it was nothing like this one,\" you explained. \"These Nova are on a whole different level the one from before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Milena called out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Decoys! Time for round 2! You have to distract the Nova one more time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the Nova's core began to glow in a bright light. It grew brighter and brighter. You immediately jumped to Creo and tried to save her from the impending doom,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creo get down!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late. Before anyone had a chance to react, it fired a devastating beam of light. The beam ripped through the entire area destroying everything in sight.</span></div></div>",

(name) can you hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly opened your eyes the first you saw Creo's face hovering above yours. When she saw that you were waking up, she sighed with relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)! Thank god you're okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow... damn it. That hurt,\" you groaned as you slowly sat up. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Nova fired some kind of beam attack,\" said Creo. \"It's destroyed everything around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Wait, how is everyone else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Creo. \"Let's just hope that they aren't dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen when you and Creo got up, Creo let out a groan of pain and ended up on one knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creo?! Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached to Creo's trying to help her up, but when you touched her arm, you felt something warm and wet on your hand. You looked at it to find that there was blood on your hand and it wasn't your own. You immediately found the source of it all. Creo's right arm had a giant gash on it dripping with blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! Creo you're hurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine...\" hissed Creo applying pressure to stop the bleeding. \"It's just a scratch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is not a scratch!\" you cried. \"You need a doctor right now! Come on! I'll take to Milena so she can...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to help Creo to her feet, but then you finally noticed the battlefield around you. Everywhere you looked, rubble, debris, as well as fire was everywhere. Screams filled the air and what you saw made eyes widen in horror. Pandoras and Limiters laid everywhere. Their bodies were either bloody and charred or twisted in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone help me!\" one screamed a Pandora who's leg was burned completely off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm blind! I can't see!\" another said whose eyes were completely unfocused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get the medics out here now!\" Milena shouted to her radio. \"What do you mean how many?! Get them all here right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing of this destruction and panic in front of you frozen. Your skin felt cold and a cold sweat ran through your body. To make matters worse, your PTSD kicked in again seeing all of this horror. You mind recalled the last Nova battle you were in with Makoto. The battlefield was a lot similar to the one you were in right now. You were  all alone holding Makoto in your arms as the reinforcements had arrived and were engaging the nova. She was badly injured and was fading quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makoto! Please hold on! The medics are on the way!\" you cried tears running down your cheeks. \"Just please hold on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)... it's no use... I'm done for...\" said Makoto weakly. \"Leave me here... save yourself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I won't leave you!\" you said. \"It's my fault anyway! If my freezing hadn't given out, none of this wouldn't have happened! I'm so sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto weakly placed a hand on your cheek and wiped away the tears falling on the right side of your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay... It's not your fault. Don't blame yourself... (name)...listen...I'm...sorry...for everything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't talk. Save your strength and hang on,\" you begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)... I'm sorry...but I'm afraid this is... it for me...I just want... to say....that...I may not have...loved you the way...you loved me...but I was happy...that I was your Pandora... and I wish... that I could've... returned your feelings...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makoto...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour squeezed Makoto's hand not wanting to let go of her. Then Makoto's hand went limp as she took her last breath. You shook her trying to wake her up, but she didn't. Your eyes filled with tears once again and bit your lip almost drawing blood. You let out a sobbing scream that echoed throughout the battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)... (name)... !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard a voice snapping out of your PTSD. Creo was standing in front of you with a hand on your shoulder trying snap you out of your daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)? Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I'm fine. Sorry I just tuned out a little,\" you said. \"Come on, we gotta get you to Milena. Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to help Creo to her feet, but suddenly a tentacle zipped by right past you. It grabbed a Pandora that was a few feet from you and lifted it up into the sky. You watched as the Pandora was whisked away into the air and brought straight towards where it came from. The Nova. It also wasn't just her you saw. There were others too. The Nova collected all the Pandora in the area and the placed them on the surface of it's body. Then slowly one by one, the Pandora began to merge into the Nova's body disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?!\" you gasped. \"Is that thing...absorbing them?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god...\" gasped Creo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a huge burst of energy came from the Nova's surface. It was Cassie. She was trying to use her acceleration to break free from the Nova, but it didn't work. She couldn't move either. Then she too was absorbed into the Nova.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! It even got Cassie!\" you cried. \"Is this thing gonna absorb every Pandora here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly five more tentacles came out from the Nova and they were heading straight for Creo. You were already moving racing towards her desperate to get to her in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creo look out!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tackled Creo moving her out of the way making the tentacles get you instead. They wrapped around your arms and legs and lifted you up high into the air. You struggled to get free, but they held you tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! Let go! Let go of me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo who recovered from being tackled saw you being lifted into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)! Hang on! I'm coming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried using acceleration to try and save you, but a couple more tentacles attacked her making her dodge the attack. Soon you were placed on the Nova's body just like the other Pandora. You tried once again to get away, but you were stuck like a fly caught in a fly trap. Then you felt a prickling and numbing sensation from the tips of your fingers from the top to your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...?! It's like... the Nova's getting inside my head!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly your body began to melt into the Nova's flesh. You couldn't break free and you couldn't move. Your vision began to darken as you sank into the Nova more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone help me!\" you yelled. \"Creo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)! No!\" Creo cried as she tried again to save you, but then she was assaulted by the tentacles again. She dodged and she dodged not wanting to suffer the same fate while at the same time trying to get to you,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(NAME)!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth your eyes met one more time in a brief moment. Then you vision became darkness before you were sucked into the Nova for good.</span></div></div>",

I'll be damned if I let that thing take another friend.\", said Satellizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrrrrrrrr ragh! Let me go!

Kazuya give us an opening!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Kazuya enforced his field to allow the tendrils to slow enough for Satellizer to escape with Creo still refusing to leave.

They had just lost a dear friend and Creo was a mess. She was in the infirmary recovering but was given heavy sedatives to calm her due to her violent reaction. News already made its way to west-genetics of the current list of known casulties, Rana, Arnett, Elizibeth, even Attia mourned for you when news reached them. Arnett took it the hardest but she coun't imagine the grief she knew Creo was going through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya and Satellizer finally started to talk after the news finally settled in. \"Kazuya...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hes gone...hes gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He.....sniff......I never..........He saved her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Creo...what can she do?

He broke into tears, a mix of your loss and the reality he could have so easily lost her there at any moment. Satellizer couldn't hold her tears back but managed to contain her sorrow from overwhelming her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere sister Margret simply saw the report and with a cold silent reaction slowly sat in her chair and lowered her upper body.

Then a woman on the radio broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speed of targets remain unchanged. They're still en route to East Genetics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn these things,\" said Elize. \"As if having multiple Nova wasn't bad enough, but now they have beam attacks that are wiping us out and now they can absorb Pandora? I don't even know if the med team can help the Pandora that were absorbed as well as (name). Not to mention they've never targeted a specific location like this either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this is the new precedent then things are definitely not gonna be good for us,\" said Yu-Mei. \"We need a new plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well on the bright side, we have our support team heading to East Genetics as we speak,\" said Elize turning to Sister Margaret. \"Preparations are also being made to intercept the Nova as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We also have the problem of the Nova's ability to absorb the Pandora,\" added Yu-Mei. \"but I'm sure that West has obtained some data on it by now and is working on a countermeasure against it. There's no way the Nova won't beat us a second time. We'll make them pay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister Margaret who had kept quiet finally spoke. \"May God help us all if you're wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu-Mei and Elize looked at each other with worry from Sister's Margaret's response. Then there was more trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Targets lost! I repeat targets lost!\" A woman's voice shouted. \"Readings have disappeared from all tracking systems!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu-Mei, Elize, and Sister Margaret immediately snapped their heads toward the screen. Just as they heard, the Novas had completely disappeared from the map. Not a single one could be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what's going on?\" wondered Elize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly the alarm blared out again and then the Nova reappeared on the radar, but the location they reappeared made Yu-Mei, Elize, and even Sister Margaret's eyes go wide from shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This... this is impossible!!\" cried Yu-Mei. \"How can this be happening?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't be!\" said Elize. \"They just disappeared a few minutes ago and now this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey double checked their eyes to see of they were playing tricks on them, but they were seeing correctly. All four of the Nova had reappeared on the radar surrounding the location that any of them at least expected. West Genetics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! They're right at our front door and we're sitting ducks!\" cursed Elize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did they plan this or something? We're completely surrounded!\" said Yu-Mei. \"Order the fourth-years on standby from East Genetics to come back immediately!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't do any good,\" said Elize. \"There's no way they'll make it in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister Margaret stood there trying to make head or tails as to what was happening. Then she started to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It makes sense now,\" she said. \"The attack on East Genetics was may have been just a distraction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean Sister?\" asked Elize. \"If they did plan this then what are they after?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you recall the recent attacks before, the Nova moved around from place to place almost as if they were searching something,\" explained Sister Margaret. \"The longest time they remained was approximately 5 hours and 37 minutes. Any longer than that time and they undergo a dimensional compression which causes them to explode. The reason why is because mostly likely, they leaving marks like that to indicate that they searched that particular area.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So in other words... East Genetics wasn't their true target at all,\" said Elize. \"It was us the whole time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Sister Margaret. \"Which means that the Nova may have found what they've been looking for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu-Mei and Elize stared at Sister Margaret. Then Yu-Mei stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, please give us permission to mobilize ma'am,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll do whatever it takes to bring them down!\" added Elize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister Margaret nodded. \"Gather the students and have them meet you in the auditorium Yu-Mei,\" said Sister Margaret. \"I'll handle things from up here. Now go and good luck to the both you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am!\" said Yu-Mei and Elize as they both ran out of the control room and prepared for battle,</span></div></div>",

But the traumatic event of your death kept haunting her. She started to get up much to the nurses shock. Kazuya and Satellizer quickly went over to her side to calm her down knowing they were the only ones she'd listen to. \"Creo stop!\", Kazuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name)...\", she said faintly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's delirious. I'll give her another dose.\", one nurse suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could inject the needle into Creo, she knocked it out of the nurse's hand and tried getting off all of the medical equipment off her. \"(Name)...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creo stop!

No...\", Creo broke down into tears falling into Satellizer's arms. Satellizer embraced and comforted Creo with Kazuya joining in. They sat by Creo as she melted in grief unable to hold back her tears. After only half an hour an alarm went off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Defcon 4! Defcon 4!

Yu-Mei stood in front of them and gave them the run-down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For those of you that are not aware of what is going on, four Nova have appeared,\" she said. \"We have reason to think that they are the same Nova that attacked East Genetics and have absorbed their Pandora earlier. To make things more complicated, the fourth years we sent to help them have yet to return. Therefore, we have to assemble new platoons with the remaining one-third of our fourth years. It's pretty much our only option at this point. The third years will be our defense at each of our gates. Finally, the second years and their limiters will standby until further notice. For most of you, this will probably be the first time fighting the Nova I'm sure, but if you show the same strength that you always have shown every day here, then I'm sure that we will defeat the Nova. That is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the third years and the fourth years left to prepare for battle. The second years all went into the waiting to await further orders. Soon only Satellizer, Kazuya<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it. I hate having to be on stand by like this,\" she seethed. \"I'd rather fight than sit here and wait. Especially after what's been going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree. I personally want to destroy that Nova that took the life of (name)!\" said Rana clenching her fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but we don't have a choice in the matter. Seconds years are supposed to stay on standby,\" said Kazuya. \"But I agree with you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya looked back at the door where the third years had just went through. He was thinking about Creo and her condition after she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm especially worried about Creo. Especially in her current state,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you blame her? (name) was not only her limiter, he was her lover. Her one true partner,\" said Rana sadly. \"She just witnessed him get absorbed by the Nova in front of her eyes. He saved her life. I may have only talked to him for a short time, but even I know that he's was a good and brave man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true. I may have hated him at first because of what happened in the past, but... as time went on and I got to know him, he actually was a very kind person,\" said Satellizer. \"But... (name) is gone. And I want to believe that he's alive like Creo, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long pause. Then Kazuya spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think Creo will be in any condition to fight?\" said Kazuya. \"She'll be okay right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Kazuya,\" said Kazuya. \"All we can do right now is wait, hope, and pray.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meanwhile back outside, the other battle plan was put into motion. Four armored vehicles rumbled down the road tearing through the misty night. The plan was that four reformed platoons named 1 through 4 would each head for the gate and defeat the Nova before it would do any damage. Elize was chosen to lead Platoon 1 of the 4 and her platoon was en route to engage the Nova at the East Gate. Soon the Nova was in sight close to the east defensive gate and the trucks immediately came to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. The target is 400 meters to our north,\" said Elize as the door opened. \"We will engage the Nova in exactly 180 seconds... All Pandora to the mission area... Limiters get into position with their vehicles and make sure that the defensive line is secure. Now Platoon 1, let's move out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am!\" everyone shouted as every single Pandora and Limiter swarmed out of the vehicles. The Pandora immediately went straight for the Nova with Elize leading the way. Soon they were right behind it. They were ready to strike at any time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then. Volt Weapon Deploy, Doppelganger,\" said Elize as volt weapon appeared from both hands in the form of two daggers. \"Now then, let's take this thing down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just about to give the order to attack, but suddenly the Nova turned around. It also began to glow in a bright red light and it's flesh began to grow bumps all over it's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" murmured Elize. \"Is it evolving or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulges kept growing all over the body of the Nova and then, from the bumps on it's body, something began to come out of the Nova's flesh. At first, Elize couldn't make out what it was, but then as it came out more she could clearly see what it was. It was a girl! And there wasn't just one, more and more of them came out and rained down on the ground until the ground was littered of them. At first, Elize didn't know what these things were. That was until she took a look at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way...: she gasped. \"Those are the Pandora that the Nova absorbed back from East Genetics!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, one of the girls stood up which turned out to be Cassie. She began to glow a bright red and then a strange object shaped like a diamond appeared in the center of her chest and emitted a familiar blue light. The light dimmed down and clothes appeared on the girls body like she was doing a volt texture. The clothes were torn with blue pentagon like lines on it and strange protrusions jutting out from back on her body. The one thing that really gave Cassie's new form a frightening appearance was her eyes. They were cold, lifeless, and no human emotion. Soon after her, one by one the other Pandora awoke as well and took on the same appearance as Cassie did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are those things? Stigmata?\" wondered Elize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, one more body emerged from the Nova. This time unlike the others, the body came out, flipped in the air, and landed on it's feet making a small crater. Like the Pandora, the individual straightened up and a stigmata appeared in the center of it's chest, the protrusions appeared on it's back, and gained a torn up volt texture, but unlike the others, the uniform was for a male student. The individual straightened up and looked at Elize with it's zombie like eyes. Seeing it's face, Elize eyes filled with disbelief. For the person that stood in front of her was the last thing she of anyone else expected to be. You.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way... How... how is this even possible?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at Elize with your eyes cold and glossed over like robot. Then the stigmata in your chest began to glow and suddenly you disappeared a blinding flash of light and Cassie and the others followed suit. Before Elize and the other Pandora could react, dozens of flashes of light darted right past them, breaking though the defensive gate and heading straight to the campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it they're fast! It's gotta be acceleration!\" said Elize. \"Destroy every last one! We can't let them reach the campus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But ma'am, what about Target 1?\" asked a Pandora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take care of it myself!\" said Elzie. \"Now get going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am!\" shouted the Pandora as they all use acceleration in pursuit. Elize turned towards the Nova and readied her weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew this was going to happen eventually,\" she muttered. \"Oh well, might as well be now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen with a fierce cry, she charged at the Nova ready to take it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another part of Genetics, Yu-Mei who was leader of Platoon 3 was handling Nova problems of her own. She and her platoon were locked in a fierce fight with the Nova there and were getting nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! Why won't this damn thing die?!\" Yu-Mei growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she heard someone on the radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain Yu-Mei. Do you copy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Yu-Mei. Co ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a situation with Platoon 1. I don't know the specifics, but Captain Elize from Platoon 1 is engaging the Nova solo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" said Yu-Mei. \"You're telling me that Elize's fighting that thing alone!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am, Please provide backup to her platoon once Target 3 is destroyed,\" said the woman on the radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easier said than done!\" said Yu-Mei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Yu-Mei heard a loud crack and a noise. She looked up and she could the see the Nova's core right in the middle of it's chest completely exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! The strikers broke through! Alright, girls I'll take it from here! Volt Weapon Deploy, Getsur\u014d! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu-Mei took a great leap into the air and deployed her volt weapon which was a bladed lance. With a giant thrust, she stabbed at the Nova's core with all her strength. The core cracked and cracked some more until finally it exploded erupting beams of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elize, just hang on!\" thought Yu-Mei as she was swallowed up by the blinding light.</span></div></div>",

Most of them were feeling a little tense and nervous about fighting the Nova due to it being their first time. Although there were some that were ready to fight the Nova. One in particular was sitting alone with her head down. The sedatives had almost completely worn off at this point, but Creo was still feeling emotional from your demise. She felt angry for the Nova taking you away from her. She felt saddened that you were gone. Most of all, she felt really lonely without you. If she could have saved you when she had a chance...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it,\" she cursed squeezing her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett stood a few feet away watching Creo and she felt sorry for her. She wanted to help her. She wanted her to be her happy self again, but she didn't know how to. Just then, Attia and Ingrid came up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's she holding up?\" asked Attia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but from what I can see, not very good,\" said Arnett.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" said Attia. \"I heard that she had to have sedatives injected in her. A normal Pandora would have been knocked out for hours, but somehow she's still awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well women like us tend to be strong willed,\" said Ingrid. \"Especially when someone precious to them was taken away from them. I should know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just hate having to see her like this,\" said Arnett. \"I wish there was something I could do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing you can do for her,\" said a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three turned and Chiffon along with Ticy came up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what sucks in this world we live. No matter how many times we win and no matter how many times we save lives when we fight the Nova, we always end up losing people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chiffon. Let me ask you something,\" said Arnett. \"I know I shouldn't be asking, but shouldn't we just let Creo stay behind with the second years? I mean... wouldn't she be safer that way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid it's hard to say,\" replied Chiffon. \"It would be safer for Creo, but knowing her she would most likely ignore orders and join the battle. She's hellbent on getting back at that Nova and she isn't going to stop until she succeeds in getting her revenge. It would best for her to join the battle. We wouldn't want to her to cause a scene now if she was ordered to back out now would we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" protested Arnett.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" interrupted Chiffon. \"Besides I think Creo would tell you the same thing? Isn't that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Creo stood behind them making Arnett jump a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you overheard us?\" asked Chiffon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Starting from when Chiffon showed up at least,\" said Creo. Then she turned to Arnett. \"Listen Arnett. I'll be fine. Until I can avenge (name)'s death, I have no intention of backing out from this now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But.. how are you gonna be able to fight without a limiter?\" asked Arnett. \"If you get hit by a freezing field you won't stand a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll just have to avoid them and not get hit won't I?\" said Creo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creo I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arnett.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia cut her off before Arnett could say anything more. Then she went up to Creo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creo. I won't stop you for doing what you want to do, but... just promise me that you'll be careful and not do anything crazy. You're my friend and I... don't wanna lose you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo stared at Attia and then she gave her a small hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly at that moment, an alarm began to blare out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Level 3 alert! Level 3 alert!\" the automatic voice said on the pa system. \"Intruders have breached the East Gate! All third years, leave your posts and head there immediately!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what the hell is going on? Did the Nova break into the school now?\" asked Ingrid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be quiet Ingrid! Shut up and listen!\" hushed Chiffon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The intruders are enemy Pandora,\" continued the voice. \"They seem difficult to tell from enemy to ally. Look for the large stigmata on the center of their chest to distinguish them. Despite their appearance, these Pandora are the enemy and must be stopped at any cost. Repeat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds bad,\" said Ticy worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. Enemy Pandora?\" asked Attia. \"How can that be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe the Nova was able to produce Pandora somehow?\" pondered Arnett.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know,\" said Chiffon. \"Remember that Nova that absorbed the Pandora over there? I think that Nova is using the Pandora against us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone turned and stared at Chiffon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's true... then that means...\" began Ingrid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That the Pandora from East Genetics that were absorbed are alive including...\" said Arnett.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't need to finish that sentence to know what that meant and Creo knew it too. It meant that you there was possibility that you were alive, but there was a strong possibility that you were one of the enemies attacking the school. Upon that realization, Creo immediately began preparing herself for battle. The third years immediately began to move out following suit. Creo and other top ranked thirds prepared to move out as well. They suited up and were ready to go, most especially Creo who was eager to save you no matter the cost, but then Sister's Margaret's voice was heard from her ear piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention! Second year students, Ganessa Roland, Satellizer El Bridget and Rana Linchen, as well as third year student Creo Brand, report for duty at the Ravensborne Nucleochede immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Sister Margaret why do you want me there?\" demanded Creo, but as quickly as Sister Margaret's voice came through, it quickly disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Creo?\" asked Arnett.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For some reason, Sister Margaret wants me to head for The Ravensborne Nucleochede,\" replied Creo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you gonna do?\" asked Arnett. \"It's probably something important if Sister Margaret's calling you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can't just leave here!\" said Creo. \"Not when there's a chance that (name)'s still alive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you can't just disobey orders from Sister Margaret either,\" said Arnett. \"If you disobey orders, there's no doubt you'll be in deep shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo clenched her fists deciding on what she should do. After a brief pause of thinking, she decided...</span></div></div>",

I can't leave you alone!\", Arnett said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon as Creo and Arnett made it outside they could see the resurrected pandora and you headed to the main gate. Creo saw you with blue stigmata all over your body, your face looked lifeless and blank. She cried feeling both relieved yet horrified of your transformation. \"Creo we should head back to Ravenstone. We could bring back a status report.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If your limiter was possessed by the nova would you wait and pray?\", Creo asked wiping off her tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't tell you.

You are not fit to lead squat.\", Arnett said with disdain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We really need to stop planning to improvise cuz it'll get us killed.\", Arnett replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we survive I'll owe you a coke.\", Creo said trying to diffuse the tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A date with (Name).\", Arnett asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just kidding, but a coke is lame.

We all used to be.\", Arnett realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, then if we survive and we live through the whole planning to improvise,Attia is offered to come back to the group. If she behaves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll regret putting that in your head won't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, just her.\", Creo smirked.

Were ready for you!\", Creo shouted. Finally the pandora were in range and the broke through the eastern gate. Creo and Arnett faced them head on complete with every intention of stopping them. Creo ran faster than she ever had before when she was without a limiter or with you. She moved her legs like a machine and it felt like jumping from one limb to the next. As soon as she was close enough she didn't hesitate to attack as i what she was fighting was her enemy. She went straight for the gut, neck, arm, anything that her blades pierced was what showered the air in blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett with her scythe twirled it and moved across through the wave of pandora, her weapon felt like air being bent to her will as she directed it in every flawless motion. Never had she fought with such level of precision and focus. The pandora the were swept in its wake had gaping wounds and sent them all hobbled from the force of Arnett's might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like they were holding the line but the pandora were healing rapidly fast as if the Nova were granting them more power. But this was the cause of you, involuntarily you kept them fighting with your upgraded limiter skills. In a way you were the Nova's vessel while they stayed back and waited for their minions to deliver their prize. Creo and Arnett soon realized they were outmatched and with no hope for victory they knew they needed to fall back. But the least they could do was hold the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the pandora breaking past them, Arnett swung her scythe and cried out, \"NONE OF YOU ARE GETTING IN HERE!\", she cried out. She and Creo tried their best to hold the line. It was incredible for those who watched. Creo mowing every pandora stupid enough to get close and returning fire on every attack the possessed students shot. And Arnett did an excellent job at keeping them at bay for Creo to lunge in against the next one to come and try getting inside the academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut soon it proved fruitless as you activated your limiting field but this time it froze time for the pandoras not under the Nova control. Creo and Arnett stood still motionless. The pandora didn't waste time and finally broke inside the academy walls. You walked passed Creo and Arnett. Creo cried out to you in an attempt to snap you out. \"(Name) its me! CREO!\", her pleas fell on deaf ears as nothing she said made it into your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty soon the pandora broke through the schools first line of defense but unlike their recent battle against Creo and Arnett they ignored every limiter and pandora treating them as insignificant. \"What the? HEY don't ignore me!\", said a cocky pandora. Before she or any others could fight back your field reached them too and had them all stay in place like statues. \"Gah! What is this?! This can't be! I am Miyabi Kannazuki! You would dare use such a chep trick to best me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were walking past them all you lifted your arm making everyone within your field float in mid-air then when you slammed in straight down, they all crashed to the ground as if they fell three stories high. \"That can't be possible! No limiter has power like that?\", sister Margret exclaimed. Watching the footage of the developments this small display had her worried greatly. \"The Nova are trying to harness Stigmata. Therefore in (Name's) case, he manipulates the stigmata around himself and bends it however he can. Though this is only shrugging off the obstacles he faces, imagine if he gets to the first pandora!\", she thought. \"Where is our back up?!\", Margret yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you mean me...Isuzu Sawatari. Ready for combat.\"</span></div></div>",

Admittedly her curvaceous figure grew envy from Creo. Her curves, her hair, her lips, and bosom all were the most eye catching elements of her body. \"Who are you?\", Creo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a nova pandora if your concerned.

Cassie extended her blades and in a few quick swipes, she cut through the entrance door in an instant. You and the squad of Pandora raced through the entrance and towards the elevator. Sister Margaret and a few of the staff in the Command Center could only watch as the Pandora made their advance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Enemy has entered the Ravensborne Nucleotide!\" a staff member said. \"They're heading for the elevator!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie used her blades again and cut through the elevator and cut the cable. Making the elevator drop all the way down until it crashed at the bottom. You all jumped down the shaft and burst into the hallway at lightning speed. As you all ran, the barriers around you were closing one by one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the main doors are closing! Sectors 22 and 31 are now shut!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a barrier up up ahead was closing. It didn't stop you all though. You, Cassie, and the rest of the possessed Pandora ran past the barrier before it shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! Enemy has cleared Barrier 51!\" A staff member cursed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barrier 53 is closing now to stop them!\" another said. \"Have them rerouted to level 6 and proceed to the next phase!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood! Enemy advancing to Level 7 now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the possessed Pandora came across a couple barriers that were closed, but you quickly made your way taking a different route. Then you all came to a dead end. You tried going back the way you came, but the barrier that you came through was quickly shut trapping you all like rats. You looked around trying to find a way to escape, but there was no way out. Cassie used her blades to try and cut through the barrier, but this time her blade broke from the impact, but it quickly regenerated. The metal was a lot tougher than it was from before. Then you all heard a hissing noise. You looked up and you all saw vents on the ceiling above you emitting a strange white smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neutralization system activated! Filling area with non-lethal gas... neutralization level reached!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gas seemed to be working, but unfortunately it didn't. Your stigmata began to glow in the center of your chest and then letting out a fierce cry, you slammed your fist into the ground and unleashed a powerful shock wave bursting right through the barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impossible! The Barrier has been destroyed! Not to mention the gas was ineffective and that beam tore through the barrier like it was nothing!\" A staff member cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No doubt that stigmata has to be the cause,\" thought Sister Margaret. \"Not even our most powerful Pandora and Limiters don't have that kind of power and strength. I've never seen this before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now Sister Margaret?\" asked a staff member worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To start, what's our current status? As far as the Nova are concerned, the Third Platoon has just arrived is currently engaged with Target One along with Platoon One. All Platoons are also continuing their attacks. Regarding the enemy, they are moving towards level eight. We are having them rerouted to our primary defensive line. Stationed at that position we have Ingrid Bernstein and Attia Simmons prepared to engage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only those two? What happened to Arnett Mcmillan?\" asked Sister Margaret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Last time we heard from her, she was seen heading to the East Gate along with Creo Brand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should've known,\" thought Sister Margaret. \"Those two must have gone to try and save (name). Damn. Of all times...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she pressed a button patching her through to not only the third years, but also the second years on the lower floors who were defending the main door to the Holy Remains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have something important to say,\" she said. \"As you are all well aware rumor or not, the Ravensborne Nucleotide contains the body of the woman who gave birth to all Pandora. We stored it here to keep it safe. We don't know how the Nova were able to locate the remains or why they're after them, but I do know that if lose t remains to them, mankind if surely doomed. Therefore it's imperative that you protect them. No matter what. I'm counting on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the Pandora resumed your mission and dashed through the halls once more in search of the Holy Remains. It seemed that you would all make it there with no problem, but then a giant familiar looking spiked ball shot out from the darkness. You immediately jumped out of the way and looked at your attackers. There standing there were Attia and Ingrid with their limiters at the way blocking your path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but you're not getting any further!\" said Ingrid her tonfas raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Direct confrontation's not my usual thing,\" said Attia. \"But I guess I'll do what I can for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Typical Attia,\" said Ingrid. \"At least you're back to being yourself again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was at a stand off for a moment.

Here we go Mark!\" said Leo. \"Give it everything you have!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark and Leo both activated their Freezing area making a blue pentagon pattern appear all around the floor. The Pandora reappeared on the freezing area caught in it and unable to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you like that? Can't move any more, can you?\" smirked Attia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stigmata on your chest began to glow and you released a powerful freezing field not only canceling out Mark and Leo's freezing, but also catching them in your freezing too. You also raised your hand and using your new ability raised your arm and Leo and Mark began to float in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! I can't move!\" cried Leo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is this?!\" struggled Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the spikes on Cassies back began to glow and she unleashed a powerful beam of energy right at Leo and Mark. Unable to escape or dodge Leo and Mark were hit by the beam. The beam caused a huge explosion. When Attia and Ingrid could see again, they saw Leo and Mark on the floor unconscious and bloody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! Leo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gotta be kidding me,\" gasped Attia. \"You're telling me that (name) and all the other Pandora here have the same power as the Nova?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so,\" said Ingrid. \"But if that's true, then it makes sense that we should take them down like Nova.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia hearing what Ingrid said made her hesitate. She didn't to hurt you in anyway because you were not only Creo's lover, but also a comrade of hers. Then Ingrid's voice snapped Attia out of her hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attia. I understand that (name) is a comrade of yours, but we have to stay focused. We have to do whatever means necessary to stop him and the enemy. Even if it means we have to kill him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia's eyes widened and she gripped the chains to her weapon tighter. There was no way she could kill you much less hurt you. She wanted to hurt you before, but this time it was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way I could do that!\" she thought. \"If we had to resort to killing (name), Creo and Arnett would never forgive me. I... I can't do it! I won't do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a group Pandora went on the attack going straight to Attia from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attia! Above you!\" shouted Ingrid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia looked up and immediately swung her Morning Star and around and knocked back three Pandora, but one dodged her attack. She raised her blade and swung straight for Attia's left, but Attia was able to stop her by blocking with her chain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid was holding her own against a group of Pandora herself. Using her tonfas, she swung at any Pandora that tried to attack her. Some tried to get her from behind, but Ingrid was able to deflect them and sending them reeling back. Then from the corner of her eye, Ingrid saw you, Cassie, and Milena ahead of them before you three disappeared using your acceleration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! Get back here!\" shouted Ingrid hitting a Pandora out of the way about to pursue, but then she heard Sister Margaret's voice from her earpiece. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do not need to pursue Inrgid. You and Attia need to restrain your current targets. That is your top priority.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia was surprised to hear this too. \"But why Sister Margaret? We can't just let (name) and the other two get away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are other Pandora guarding the facility. They're at the Secondary Defensive line. Let them handle it. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! I hate being forced to hold back like this!\" growled Ingrid as she parried another attack from the attacking Pandora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia looked back towards the direction where you went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry (name). Guess I won't be able to save you, but... please don't die,\" she thought as she once again joined Ingrid in fighting the Pandora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, Cassie, and Milena continued on your mission to find the Holy Remains. You raced through the hall in blinding speed thanks to Acceleration. Then barriers closed to the right and in front of you. Having no other option, you were forced to go left. You continued on until you were close to the Secondary Defensive line. You were all about to use Acceleration to go faster, but then you suddenly sensed danger. You immediately jumped back and three beams of light shot out from the darkness. One narrowly missed you and Cassie was able to dodge it as well, but the beam hit Milena right on her left shoulder. It wasn't as serious wound, but blood oozed out from her shoulder. Then a Pandora stepped out from the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I missed did I? You're tougher than I expected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Elizabeth along with her limiter Andr\u00e9. She had her volt weapon which had the form of stigmata-like satellites at the ready ready to fire at the three of you once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry (name),\" she said. \"I'm happy to see you, but at the same time I can't help but feel sad for what the Nova has done to you. Even though you're a good friend of mine,  I'm afraid I have to take you down. You now face the 2nd ranked third year, Executor of Ingenious Schmes, Elizabeth Mably. Andr\u00e9, be on guard and watch out for the enemy's freezing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my lady,\" said Andr\u00e9. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie spikes began glowing once more and she activated her freezing, but Andr\u00e9 was able to counter and neutralize the freezing with a freezing of his own and froze you, Cassie, and Milena. You were raised your hand about to activate your ability once again, but Elizabeth immediately went on the offensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you don't! Stigma Satellite System!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her Volt Weapon, Elizabeth's satellites fired rapidly in a lightning fast and powerful speed. You and Cassie dodged the beams using acceleration, but one beam hit Milena right at the stigmata on the middle of her chest sending her to the ground unconscious. The stigmata on her chest glowed and then it died down. The blue lines on her face disappeared and her blade slowly turned back to human hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what do you know?\" grinned Elizabeth. \"It seems that if we destroy the stigmata in their chest, we'll be able to free the victims from the Nova's control. Andr\u00e9! Again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freezing!\" shouted Andr\u00e9 as he activated his freezing once more freezing you and Cassie. Elizabeth aimed her satellites and prepared to fire again, but this time you would not have it. Your stigmata began to glow brightly and you used your attack. You screamed releasing a powerful energy and slammed your fist into the ground releasing a massive shock wave sending cloud and dust everywhere. Elizabeth and Andr\u00e9 couldn't see anything. Then the smoke cleared and Elizabeth was shocked to see that you and Cassie had disappeared. There was nothing left, but a giant hole on the floor leading to the lower levels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit! They escaped!\" cursed Elizabeth. \"But I don't have to worry about that now. I have to let everyone else now about what I discovered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed a button on her earpiece contacting the third years and Sister Margaret to tell them what she discovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up. For all those engaging the enemy Pandora, aim for the stigmata on their chests. If you destroy that, we'll be able to save the people from the Nova's control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to her as she was talking to her ear piece, Milena was right behind her lying on the floor and her stigmata began to flash like a blinker.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meanwhile Satellizer, Ganessa, and Rana along with Arthur and Kazuya were standing outside the door to the Holy Remains standing guard. They received theb order from Sister Margaret and went to the center of the Ravensborne Nucleotide. Then Sister Margaret brought them up to speed about everything and told them to protect the Holy Remains from the enemy at any cost. Everything was quiet, but then they felt and heard the ceiling above them rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like there's a lot of fighting up there,\" said Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez. I should be up there fighting the enemy,\" growled Ganessa. \"But then again guarding an important artifact is the perfect assignment for me. I mean after all, I am the highest ranked second year. Also, I feel that including the number two student and some backwater hick is a bit unnecessary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Who are you calling a backwater hick?!\" snapped Rana clearly insulted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer ignoring Ganessa's comment stared up at the ceiling looking annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... the top ranked third years were assigned here as well,\" she said. \"This is nothing more but another \"safety zone.\" We're just like another group of second years on standby. The third years are protecting this place while we \"stand guard\" here. Damn it. I should be out there fighting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGanessa and Rana stared at Satellizer both having surprised looks on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  Is there a problem?\" asked Satellizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my question,\" said Ganessa. \"I've never seen or heard you talk so much before today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to admit, this does make you seem out of character,\" said Rana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could it be possible that this situation has your legendary nerve rattled?\" asked Ganessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... That's not it at all,\" said Satellizer. \"It's just that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about (name),\" said Kazuya. \"Those monsters took a good friend of ours. I just wish we could've been there to save him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" said Ganessa. \"I... had no idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But don't worry, we'll get them back for what they did to (name),\" said Rana. \"We're gonna win this for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the ceiling above began to glow with some kind of heat and started to melt. Then it suddenly exploded. Everyone immediately turned around. There standing in front of them was you and Cassie. Satellizer's, Kazuya's, and Rana's eyes went wide from shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way...\" gasped Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)... and Cassie?!\" said Satellizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're both alive!\" cried Rana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie went on the attack by extending her blades and impaling Rana on her left shoulder lifting her up and pinning her to the wall. Rana screamed in pain as the blade ripped through her flesh. Then Cassie retracted her blade drawing Rana to her and readied her blade to stab her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on country girl!\" cried Ganessa. \"I'll free you from that monster before you know it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for your kind words, but I'm not as helpless as you think I am!\" winced Rana. \"Four Mindsets!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe deployed her volt weapon and punched Cassie's blade not shattering it, but setting herself free and sending Cassie back tumbling on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice one!\" said Ganessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She had it coming!\" smirked Rana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie's blade regenerated and she stood up as if she wasn't fazed by the attack at all and went on the attack in an acceleration. Rana followed suit and then Satellizer jumped into the fray with an acceleration of her own. They clashed again and again causing the room to shake from the battle. All Ganessa could do was stand and watch due to her not being able to use acceleration, but that wasn't gonna stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may not be able to accelerate, but that doesn't mean I can't slow her down! Chains of Binding!\" she cried as she activated her volt weapon as well and combined them into one giant flail. As soon as she saw Cassie she flung the flail straight at her. It was about to hit the mark, but you suddenly appeared and punched the flail deflecting it. Everyone's eyes widened from what you just did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gotta be kidding! How was he able to deflect it!?\" cried Ganessa. \"And he can use acceleration too?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you used acceleration to disappear and reappear behind Ganessa and punched straight at her, but Rana saved Ganessa by using her acceleration to appear in front of her and stop your punch just in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ganessa! You have to get out of here!\" Rana shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I'd never run from a fight!\" said Ganessa stubbornly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know how to accelerate so you're just gonna get in the way!\" said Rana gripping tighter to your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou activated your freezing catching Rana, Ganessa, and Arthur inside it. Then using your free arm you used your other power. Rana, Ganessa, and Arthur all began to float as you raised your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on?!\" cried Ganessa. \"I can't move and I'm floating!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... had no idea that (name) had this kind of power!\" said Rana trying to break free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to bring your arm down to slam them to the ground, but then a blue freezing from Kazuya overtook yours neutralizing it and setting them all free. Cassie then activated a freezing of her own enabling her neutralize Kazuya's freezing halfway and went straight for him, but was quickly stopped by Satellizer deploying her volt weapon and stopping her. Satellizer and Cassie struggled their blade scrapping against each other, but you came at Satellizer using acceleration and punched her right in the middle of her chest. Satellizer recoiled skidding backwards, but was able to get her footing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you guys OK?\" Kazuya asked Rana, Ganessa, and Arthur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm OK,\" said Rana. \"Just a little flesh wound is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow that was terrifying,\" murmured Ganessa as she sat on her butt and fell to the floor fainting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ganessa! Are you OK?!\" asked Arthur urgently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's fine,\" said Rana. \"She just fainted from the freezing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya sighed in relief and then looked at you and Cassie. He couldn't believe it. You and Cassie were still alive, but unfortunately they were possessed. He tried to get through to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)! Cassie! It's us! Your friends! Why are you attacking us?!\" he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Cassie didn't answer. You both just stared at him with blank expressions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no use Kazuya. They can't hear us,\" said Satellizer. \"No matter how much you try to reach them, they under the control of the Nova.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to mention it's made them much more powerful,\" said Rana. \"Especially (name).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... there has to be something we can do!\" said Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's one thing we can do,\" said Satellizer. \"And you're not gonna like it Kazuya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Don't tell me that you're gonna fight them,\" said Kazuya worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have a choice,\" said Satellizer. \"I understand that (name)'s our friend Kazuya, but right now he's our enemy. If we don't stop them now, then the entire human race is doomed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case,\" said Rana cracking her knuckles. \"Mind if I take (name) Ms. Untouchable Queen? I owe him a little payback from that attack earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do whatever you like. Besides, me and Cassie have some unfinished business anyway. Just be careful with him,\" said Satellizer. \"Kazuya, you stay back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she turned to Cassie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up Cassie. I know that you're under the control of the Nova, but don't expect me to pull any punches. I've been waiting for this for a long time and I won't lose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRana had her own stand off with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name). You may be a friend of mine as well as a comrade, but I won't hold back either! Prepare yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie and Satellizer stared each other down while you and Rana did the same. Then all of you came at each other ready to fight.</span></div></div>",

They both zipped and zagged clashing at each other with their blades. Unfortunately Cassie was much faster than Satellizer. During her acceleration, she reappeared in Satellizer's blind spot to her right and slashed her on the back. After that using her incredible speed, she began slashing all around her overpowering her. She was so fast that even Satellizer couldn't keep up. The force of it all sent her to the wall and then falling to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Rana were launching punches and blows at each other. Rana threw a right punch at you, but you crossed and blocked it with the force sending you skidding back. Then you used acceleration and began zipping around the room in an incredible speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well ,well. This fight certainly isn't like the sparing session from before,\" said Rana. \"Fine then! If you want a fight between accelerations, then I'll be happy to oblige!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe disappeared in her own acceleration. Both you clashed again and again with great force and speed. Then Rana swung a roundhouse kick during her acceleration hit you smack in your face. You quickly recovered and retaliated by punching Rana right on her injured arm. Rana recoiled holding her arm in pain still hurt from Cassie's attack. You took advantage and attacked her with a flurry of blows. All Rana could do was take every attack. You kept on punching her until you gave her a powerful punch in the gut sending her slamming into the ground. Rana coughed out blood as she felt the force knocking the wind out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn... he's... stronger than I imagined,\" thought Rana. \"This... is completely different from before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Satellizer and Rana were now down for the count with you and Cassie standing tall. Kazuya stood there not sure what he should do. He knew that he had to stop you and Cassie, but he if made any sudden move, you and Cassie wouldn't hesitate to kill him. You and Cassie walked past the two fighters thinking that they were defeated, but Satellizer grabbed Cassie by the ankle stopping her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're no going anywhere... I'm not finished yet...\" she gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRana also not down and out, slowly struggled to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As am I... we're just... getting started...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie blades transformed into normal human limbs, but the blades were now on her arms. She raised her elbow with the blade pointing downwards and brought it down stabbing her in the back. Blood spurted out and Satellizer screamed in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Satellizer!!!\" cried Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRana tried to go to Satellizer to help her, but you cut her off by raising your hand and activating your freezing stopping her. Then you raised you hand making Rana levitate and brought your hand down. Rana was brought down and crashed into the ground. You kept your hand down using the force of your attack to keep her down. Rana screamed in agony as she felt herself being crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Rana!\" cried Kazuya. \"(name)! Cassie! Stop this! You're hurting them both!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Kazuya's words fell on death ears, as you both looked at him with blank expressions. Then Satellizer began to glow into a bright blue light once again. Incredibly, she started to get up and was able to push Cassie off of her and then two wings of light appeared on her back. Then she disappeared in an acceleration. This time, Satellizer was faster than she was before. She sped all around Cassie until she reappeared again. When she did, Kazuya couldn't believe his eyes. There was two of Satellizer! They went straight for Cassie before merging into one Satellizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she just do a Tempest turn...? No! That was an acceleration!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie crossed her blades in an attempt to block Satellizer, but Satellizer pierced straight through them and hit the stigmata in the center of her chest with her blade. The force of her attack sent Cassie flying and then slamming her into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right! You did it!\" said Kazuya. \"Cassie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to go to her, but Satellizer blocked his way using her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay back Kazuya. It's not over yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was prepared to attack Cassie again, but then suddenly Cassie spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening? Where am I?\" she wondered. \"What... was I just doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way. She spoke,\" said Satellizer. \"But how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she looked at the stigmata in the center of Cassie's chest. It was slightly cracked due to her attack, but it was still intact. It suddenly started to glow and Cassie began to scream in agony trying to keep her senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's it,\" thought Kazuya. \"The Stigmata in the center of her chest it's what's been controlling her. And I bet it's what's controlling (name) too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw Cassie trying to fight for control of her body. You prepared yourself to go and help her, but suddenly Rana stood up even with your abilities keeping her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't be worried about her (name), your opponent is me!\" she yelled as she began to glow like Satellizer was before. \"This time, I won't be holding back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up fully and a pair of wings appeared on her back. Then she launched herself right at you and punched you right in the face. You were reeled back dazed from the punch then you used acceleration and attacked Rana with a kick, but the Rana you saw was an afterimage. Rana reappeared behind you and gave you a powerful punch on your back. You gasped in pain as you were sent flying towards a wall. Just as when you were about to hit it, Rana reappeared and punched you smack in your gut hard. You coughed out blood were sent rolling to the ground in a heap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie still trying resist the Nova's control, eventually fell unconscious and was once more under the control of the Nova again. The blades that were shattered were reformed and she prepared herself to attack again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! I have to take her down now while I have a chance!\" thought Satellizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth fighters began to emitting powerful aura making the entire room feel like a typhoon. Satellizer then made the first move and went on the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Non-interval Double Acceleration!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie followed suit and both fighters clashed in another battle of accelerations, but once again Cassie proved to be Satellizer's better at speed and slash at her back once again. Satellizer stumbled, but she wasn't beat yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Triple Acceleration!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe split into three of herself in an incredible speed and went for Cassie again, but Cassie once more outdid her in speed by splitting into four of herself abling her to outspeed her and attack her in four different directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impossible! Quadriple Acceleration?!?!\" Satellizer thought as she slammed into the wall once more in a slump. \"I can't keep up with her speed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie immediatley went on Saetllizer stabbing her left into her left shoulder and pinning her to the wall. Satellizer screamed in pain as blood gushed out from her wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Satellizer!\" cried Rana. \"Don't worry! I'm coming to help you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRana ran towards Satellizer trying to lend her assistance, but then you stood up emitting a powerful aura making Rana turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! I thought that I'd beaten you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glared at Rana in anger and with a scream, you began releasing a freezing area spreading throughout the room catching Rana. Then you charged straight at Rana and split yourself into four copies of yourself. The four copies of you disappeared and suddenly Rana was barraged with a series of punishing blows. Blood spurted from Rana's mouth as she was pummeled having no choice but to take the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! He used Quadriple Acceleration too?!\" thought Rana as she fell to the ground face down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reappeared in front of her and walked towards her until you stood above her. You clenched your first and it began to glow with power. Cassie extended her other blade and pointed it directly at Satellizer. Kazuya's eyes widened in horror for what you and Cassie were about to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)!!! Cassie!!! Don't do it! You have to stop this right now!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Cassie didn't hear him. You raised your fist and Cassie brought back her blade. Both of you prepared to deal the final blow to both of your fighters. When...</span></div></div>",

Cassie's blade was inches away from Satellizer's neck and your fist was inches away from Rana's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassie! (name)! Listen to me! You two have to stop! You both don't want to do this!\" yelled Kazuya. \"Both of you snap out of it! Don't let this thing forget who you both are! Remember who you both are and what you have and want in your lives!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Cassie stared at Kazuya. Then suddenly Cassie's eyes regained focus and she looked like herself again, but her stigmata began to glow red again and she screamed in agony trying to regain control. You seeing this activated a freezing of your own overtaking Kazuya's freezing, but with a shout Kazuya amped up the power of his freezing and pushed your freezing back, but his head began to ooze blood due to the overusing of his stigmata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kazuya! Stop it! You'll die a this rate!\" yelled Satellizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too risky!\" added Rana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care!\" yelled Kazuya. \"I'm not gonna stop! Not until (name) and Cassie are free! If I can help my friends, then I'm willing to do whatever it takes to save them! Even if it means I have to die!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya's freezing grew even stronger making your freezing disappear and forcing you to the ground. Even Cassie couldn't get up from the pressure. It seemed that you two were stuck, but then Cassie let out another scream and released a powerful freezing once more overtaking Kazuya's and forcing back slamming him into the wall. You got up and slowly walked towards him ready to finish him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kazuya!\" cried Satellizer about to try and save him but Cassie stood in her way with her blade poised. She raised it about to kill her, but suddenly... she stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the... I thought the freezing field was neutralized,\" thought Satellizer. \"Why did she stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she heard Cassie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... stop it. Stop forcing me to kill my friends... I don't want to hurt anyone anymore... I....never wanted this... I wanted...to be a novelist...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stigmata glowed brighter, but Cassie still fought for control. She looked at Satellizer with tears streaming down her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Satellizer! You have to stop us! Do whatever it takes! I'm begging you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another scream, Cassie's hair turned white and her tears became tears of blood building up energy. At the rate that she was going, she was gonna release a powerful burst of energy and Satellizer wouldn't be able to dodge. You continued to walk towards Kazuya until you were standing above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...! Leave...him alone!\" grunted Rana as she struggled to try and get up, but she was still feeling hurt from your previous onslaught.

You turned to the owner of the hand and there was Creo holding your wrist tight in her hand. Also Cassie who was couldn't hold back on the nova's control, unleashed a massive nova explosion. Satellizer who still couldn't move shut her eyes and waited for the end. The explosion rocked the entire room. Satellizer was expecting the explosion to kill her, but it didn't. She was still alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... I'm...alive? But... how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up and she soon found out why. Isuzu stood in front of her her volt weapon raised. It seemed that she used it to block the explosion just before it hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who... who are you?\" asked Satellizer dumbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsuzu turned towards her and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An ally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are good tidings indeed,\" said Rana who had finally recovered and was able to get on her feet. \"I may not know who you are stranger, but thank you none the less.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should get back,\" said Isuzu who had her eyes focused on Cassie who was once more under the nova's control. \"We'll take care of these two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I'm talking to you!\" said Rana indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with you and Creo, you and her were having a glare down with Creo still holding to your fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)! What do you think you're doing?! Snap out of it!\" said Creo forcing your hand down trying to reason with you, but you bared your teeth forcing your hand up against Creo's. Then you broke free from Creo's grip and leaped away from her giving yourself some distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on (name)! Your under the control of the nova! Fight it!\" said Creo trying once more to reason with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at Creo giving her no response. Then you charged straight at her and attacked with a barrage of fast punches and blows. Creo having no choice activated her volt weapon and blocked each blow. You punched and Creo blocked until your fists collided forcing you both back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it...\" thought Creo. \"He's stronger than I imagined. If he wasn't being controlled like this, he'd actually make a worthy opponent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creo be careful!\" cried Kazuya who was struggling to get up. \"(name) can use Acceleration like a pandora now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He can do what!?\" gasped Creo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she had a chance to react, you came straight at Creo using Quadruple Acceleration. Creo could only look in time to see four of you coming straight at her. Then Isuzu suddenly appeared in front of Creo and intercepted you. You and Isuzu's attacks clashed in a blinding speed. After that, both of you landed back on the ground making Isuzu and Creo stand back to back with you standing on one side and Cassie on the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isuzu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get it together,\" said Isuzu. \"You can't hold back on them even for a moment. Otherwise, he'll kill you before you have a chance to think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that,\" said Creo clenching her fists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe straightened up and cracked her knuckles ready to fight again and Isuzu deployed her volt weapon preparing to fight as well. Her weapon looked just Satellizer's but it was more sleeker and thinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take care of him. You take care of the other one,\" said Isuzu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" said Creo. \"Make sure you don't kill him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four warriors stood staring down at one another.

You and Cassie turned your attention to where that attack came from, as the smoke cleared Creo and Isuzu emerged. Cassie pulled out her blade from Satellizer's shoulder causing her to collapse with Kazuya catching her. \"Kazuya...\", she uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Satellizer...\", he replied cradling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRana couldn't get up from having been beaten so badly and the others were either just as weak or unconscious. But everyone saw the last two who still stood against the two rogues. Creo activated her gauntlets, with Isuzu activating her own plasma weapon. It was like Satellizer's only sleeker and thinner but just as devastating. Despite Creo being drained from the initial attack the prospect of saving you was all she needed to light the fire of determination inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment nothing.........AND THEN BOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo used her gloves to summon another strike at you. This time you were prepared, so you went on the defensive. Isuzu ran right for you but Cassie attempted to intercept Isuzu. Creo ran as fast as she could trying to tackle Cassie so Isuzu could reach you. Cassie was too fast but Isuzu was by far faster than even a modified pandora! Creo only managed to land a heavy punch to Cassie's jaw on the fact Cassie underestimated Isuzu's speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsuzu thrusted her plasma weapon but you deflected it with your arm. The force was so great the weapon flew out of Isuzu's hands. You tried to use your telekinetic grip but Isuzu grabbed your arm and dislocated it before you could react. She took your wrist went behind and snapped it. Even with the Nova controlling you, it didn't make your body invincible. Isuzu wailed on you but it only lasted briefly. You managed to dodge an attack and you threw her away from you causing Isuzu to plant her body to the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo meanwhile used her strength to dwindle down Cassie's body hoping to render it useless. Creo didn't relent, she punched Cassie's anywhere she thought needed to be battered down. Cassie was trying to do something to fight back but she couldn't. It seemed all the pandora up till now finally managed to soften her up. You put an end to Creo though and telekineticly pulled her to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo tried resisting but to no avail. \"(Name) I know you're in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the briefest moment there was hesitation, but the Nova had complete control over your actions. Before you were going to snap Creo's neck, Isuzu threw her weapon at you. You tried stopping it with your arm but it couldn't move. The tip of the plasma weapon  hit the center of a crystal-like gem on the center of your chest. In an instant when it broke the Nova aura around you diminished, and a burst of energy sent Creo back a short distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsuzu came down over you grabbing her weapon. Just as she was about to raise it up to be certain you weren't getting up, \"Cr...eeee....ooooo?\", you spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsuzu was amazed and halted herself. You were coming around with your vision adjusting. When it did you were blown away by the sight of Isuzu. Beautiful, radiant, a total knockout. \"Who are....you....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isuzu. You're going to be fine.\", she reassured you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Cassie, still possessed, was getting up Rana smashed the same gem on her chest like you had assuring that she was alive and well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job, you noticed that was what controlled them too.\", Rana congratulated Isuzu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsuzu had no idea and was trying to kill you, but it ended up being coincidence you were brought back. Before anyone could recuperate the rest of the Nova pandoras were coming inside. Kazuya let up a shielding field by the entrance so they couldn't get in yet. \"Can't last long, somebody be ready before I give out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly...</span></div></div>",

The ceiling crashed causing Kazuya to lose control but caused significant damage inside sealing off the other infected pandora. At first it seemed as if they got lucky but it proved to be the opposite, the structure was breached by a Nova.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't be! Gah! The infected must have been beacons to pinpoint their location to the Nova!\", Sister Margret realized. \"Any limiters and pandora left who are still able to fight, destroy the Nova at all costs!\", she radioed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer, Kazuya, Arnett, Rana, got up first, they began surround the Nova. You got separated from everyone due to the debris, you were trapped but at least you weren't too injured. You just couldn't lift up the structural beams pinning you down. You still felt too weak, and you couldn't get out. You swore you could hear the fighting going on but you couldn't see anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noise just all blotted out, you felt tired, you were blacking out........then you heard your name being called out. \"(Name)!\", it was Creo, she found you. \"Hang on!\", Creo tried lifting up the beam but she just couldn't lift it high enough. Until Isuzu came by and helped her giving you the space to crawl out of it. \"(Name) oh my god! I love you I love you I love you!\", she kept repeating. She bombarded you with kisses all over your face like she was making up for lost time. Soon as she lost her momentum you noticed that she was crying, but still fighting back even more tears that she couldn't bear to show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hugged her back holding her in your arms softly feeling her warm body, inhaling her scent, feeling your heartbeat elevate. You just felt blessed to have your free -will again. \"I nearly lost you . God I swear I thought you were dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY LOVE BIRDS! YA MIND LENDING A HAND?!\", Arnett yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to get up but Creo stopped you. \"(Name) I'm not losing you again! Let's go, leave this, I can't go through that again and neither can you.\", Creo pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We...can't leave...we'll be dead now....or later....\", you rejected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) I can't see you die in front of me again.\", Creo would never have abandoned a mission in the past but this was different. Seeing how that Nova beaten the both of you before, and with a small group remaining after having a fierce battle while you were possessed, Creo was sure you would die this time. She would rather spend whatever time was left before the end rather than waste it on a battle that would lead to it much faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then get in front.....gah....so you can get a clear shot at that *&amp;^%ing thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Creo sucked it up and went right for the Nova. Her knuckles were sore and bruised, she exhausted herself from Cassie. Her effectiveness withered, but she could still draw the Nova's attention.</span></div></div>",

The only hope for the world to combat this species, is just mere inches from a single one. This would be one of, if not the most crucial battle yet in the fight against them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, Kazuya and all remaining limiters nearby remained back from the front line while every Pandora who could so much as stand or use their weapon surrounded the Nova. \"We can win everyone, just another Nova like the rest of them.\", Attia rallied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pandora all illuminated in their stigmata and started to advance on the Nova. You kept your eyes on Creo, you were dead centered on her with everything in field of view. So far the Nova hadn't made any moves, not a lash or anything trying to defend itself or move on the source of stigmata. Something was wrong, but not just from the Nova. Kazuya noticed a limiter gunning right for the girls. In a flash, a glow of red covered the area around the Nova and Pandora fighters. Before they could react they found that they had frozen in place!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Freezing field?! But how?!\", you yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(NAME!!) You're becoming a Nova!\", Kazuya exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't notice, you faded out for a moment. But you saw the other girls all around, the red energy coming from you, then you screamed in excruciating pain. You deduced you must still have had shards of the Nova crystals in your bloodstream, and thus have started morphing into a Human-Nova hybrid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo watched in horror as your own eyes turned pale, your shoulders began forming spikes, and all of your screams were the same messages of begging for someone to kill you. The Nova drew closer to the source, and its tendrils were surrounding the tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya ran to you, hoping to try and counter the effects. \"Hang on (Name)!\", he raised his arm trying to counter the effects but a burst of energy sent Kazuya back and all you could comprehend was the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I CAN'T STOP IT!\", you cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name)!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creo?\", you whispered. You turned your head to hear her lovely voice. But when you did, you found nothing but darkness. Then you heard your name being called again. \"(Name)\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makoto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've turned out so much better.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't real.\", you rejected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm only as real as you made my stigmata out to be. (Name)...you didn't let me die. I brought it on myself.\", those words however delusional or true, tore the anchors of guilt you lingered in the past. \"Protect her.\", she said before hugging you goodbye. You returned the hug with a firm but soft embrace. You couldn't explain but that somehow gave you the closure you desired after her death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tensed your body, and roared out with the aura of red changing to a soft shade of blue. The Pandora were free again, and could feel the raw emotion emanating from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This feeling, I've never felt about anyone...\", Isuzu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh (Name), you are truly blessed with something pure.\", Arnett complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name)...is this how strong you feel for your partner?\", Satellizer whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name), I'm yours.\", Creo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya amplified your energy, the Nova's movements were slowed by a couple fractions of a second. With the tide turned in your favor the Pandora got back up and mercilessly started annihilating the Nova. In just seconds the Nova was cut down bit by bit, with Satellizer and Creo delivering the final blow. With a simultaneous punch and slice in the Nova's head, it was completely destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle was won.</span></div></div>",

You could feel Creo's warm arms wrap over your upper body. Her soft skin and warming your body on contact as she enveloped herself around you. She couldn't let you go. You were all hers. Not a single being could rip her away from you at that specific moment. \"Creo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name)!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith only your names acknowledging the fact the other was safe at last, Creo kissed you fiercely. She just pressed her lips to yours and smoothly stroked the back of your head, savoring the feeling you had all scrapped by to earn. She pulled back only to catch her breath, she wanted to say so much but she could only speak through action. She dove into your mouth again, this time letting in more passion seep in. Each kiss was followed with more and more passion until Creo lustfully wanted nothing but to never let the moment end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis whole time you had no objections, you only returned what you were given. You could barley keep pace between the moments of gasping for air. But you just worked through the exhaustion. You have no clue how long you allowed it to let on but you finally noticed everyone was all right now, and you were having a few too many unwanted spectators. (Weirdos)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo helped you up and soon took you to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You idiot! You can't let me be the only Limiter in this group!\", Kazuya said poorly trying to guilt you for having sacrificed yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMMMMMMMWAH! (Name) you miracle worker you! I will never say another negative thing about you again for the rest of my life!\", Attia said giving you a hard peck on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett followed, but only resorted to hugging much to your appreciation, \"Oh thank goodness your safe. Never make us go through that again!\" Arnett squeezed you real tightly to the point you were nearly out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer came up to you, and extended a friendly hug but included getting lifted up in the air. \"I was wrong about you when I first met you. I cannot thank you enough.\", you weren't clear by what she meant but accepted it anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRana extended a firm handshake to you, \"You do this academy proud. I'd be honored to fight with your Pandora or beside her anytime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly Isuzu just stood by. \"Thanks again for helping us. You saved (Name's) life and I owe you so much that I can never repay.\", Creo said feeling sorely grateful to Isuzu. The shifty Pandora maintained her facade and replied with a typical, \"Don't mention it\", the two shook hands leaving you a bit flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? Your...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will be working with you alongside Ms. Brand. We will do such amazing things together.\", Isuzu said speaking to you in such a benevolent and soft manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo wasn't sure about the whole baptism formality that would be inevitably brought up at some point, but for now she just continued keeping you to herself and enjoying this victory that was well earned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe academy staff and other Pandora medics helped stabilize the formerly possessed Pandora. Much needed to be rebuilt, but the cost was worth it in the end as this boosted moral among the Pandora and Limiters. Complete with having saved the stigmata. You and everyone were sent back to your old dorms and were given time to celebrate and relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a large chapter for you, but this wouldn't be the last.

You've all been traveling across the globe earning a respectable reputation as the Spirit of Stigmata team, the name stemming from having protected the main source of it. Everyone at the final battle earned a high accounts of recognition and formed other teams that branched off of the same moral the victory was made from. Others, like Elizabeth and other fellow Pandora who participated in key roles of the battle, all were given special missions and privileges like yours. However your team was known by many as the A-Team that gave the Pandora a fighting chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this day you and Creo were still going strong as as duo but also as lovers. Despite initial concerns Isuzu wasn't drastically affecting your lives. In fact she was earning herself to be a trusted ally and friend between the three of you. Kazuya and the others grew to like her and she was very polite and social with everyone. Even though deep inside, this was all a rouse. But no matter how much Isuzu convinced herself she felt nothing about this, the truth is, something rattled her the day you unleashed your stigmata. And so far it has been affecting her judgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was not holding a mission, today it was the nine of you hanging out and enjoying each others company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's when you know that the only way to get a Nova to flinch, is to literally spread'em!

Arnett how can you ever hope to be a respectable woman with dirty jokes like that?\", Attia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, my tenacity in battle keeps the limiters guessing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, if you really think about it, a Nova is devoid of emotion that maybe if you try and confuse it, you may get it to pause. Then somebody can go in and kill it. Maybe all it knows is numbers and code. And emotion is new to them.\", Isuzu suggested jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say we seduce Nova? God never tell me what you think of at night.\", Creo replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no! I'm saying we could get it to experience real emotion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or lust. Really ladies, those outfits rip faster than wrapping paper in battle. I counted under a minute some excessive skin was exposed during the last 4 battles.\", you commented. You then were bombarded by eye daggers from all the women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name), I am punishing you when we get back.\", Creo said like a disappointed mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew Creo, could have whispered it.\", Satellizer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Creo's voice sounds too sexy when she whispers.\", Isuzu replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do any of you get off and saying how sexy my voice sounds when I whisper? And how can you tell if everything I say to my boyfriend is always sexy.\", Creo wrapped her arm around your neck playfully nudging you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets drop the subject. The poor guy has suffered enough.\", Kazuya stepped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way Kazuya, have you achieved a baptism with Satellizer or Rana?\", Attia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's none of your business!', Satellizer and Rana said at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that a yes?\", Creo joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up Creo.\", Rana replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just nice. Our biggest problems are our personal lives and not dying. Forget we have such a responsibility on our hands.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here here.\", Satellizer raised a glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys. Now?\", Arnett said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\", you asked wondering what was going on. All the girls huddled around and started taking something out of a bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok (Name) listen, since we owe it to you and Kazuya for giving us the strength to stop that Nova and form this team we each are giving you a special gift to thank you by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a photo of us together as a team after the battle and were having it hang on West Genetics starting tomorrow. Read the inscription.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Pandora is only as strong as the Limiter she puts their faith in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creo came up with the line. I think it's really sweet.\", Isuzu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same with me Kazuya.\", Rana replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And me.\", Satellizer followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys are the best.\", everyone group hugged you and Kazuya. Just as everyone got out of it you heard a deep whisper in your ear, \"Meet me in the bedroom in 20 minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that sound, that was your girl requesting some much wanted time alone with you. And seeing Creo was now nowhere to be seen, she was defiantly getting ready for some private time with her man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got a little flustered, but a little giddy. Time with Creo was never a dull moment, but soon as you went to get ready you got cornered by someone...</span></div></div>",

Could we-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's rude to just push me aside when I'm trying to talk to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you were me right this second, you'd understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For goodness sake I need to talk to you (Name)!\", she said very sternly. Reminded you of when she first met you in person and how anamostic she got the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then, fire away.\", you acted you were invested but you were just waiting for her to stop talking and greenlight you to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Kazuya and I have...well we've been taking it very slow. He has never put this much faith in someone except me. For a while, recently I wondered if it was because I was a living reminder of his sister. And maybe I never attacked him was because I was feeling his sister's feelings of family whenever he touched me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap. All of it went in one ear and out the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kept worrying if he would have his first baptism with Rana, and I would be his second choice. But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah yeah, taking it slow. Stuff you guys aren't sure of because this and that. Creo is probably topless in the bedroom now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kazuya just asked me the other night. He wanted to know if I would be fine if he, let me baptize with him. I was so scared. But then I remembered something. I remembered it so distinctly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo topless, nope how long has it been? Oh god she is expecting me now! Wait barley been 7 minutes, Ok maybe now listening to her is a good idea to kill the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you used your stigmata, and every pandora inside your field broke free of the Nova. (Name) all of the pandora felt that feeling that your stigmata just was fueled by. (Name), all of them could feel your devotion to saving Creo's life. They felt it in different ways but they felt it one way or another. I felt something particularly special in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were feeling touched and moved by Satellizer's confession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I felt the trust you had to Creo. The compliance you give her when she needs to fight your battles. You just surrender all of yourself to her, and without any regrets you give yourself to her. You don't just trust her, and not just a matter of her trusting you. You complete her and vice versa. Kazuya extended to me a level of trust that you give to Creo everyday now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sat, I...I'm starting to cry a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name). You helped me find the strength to start making Kazuya trust me. And, I don't just mean being partners-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. No. I get it. You don't have to tell me.\", you hugged Satellizer gently and she returned the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're wonderful. Just simply a wonderful person (Name).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were crying never thought Satellizer would be one for words to the point of tugging your heartstrings. Then you thought of what you loved, which lead to you thinking of you and Creo. Then the same thin minus some cloths, then added a bed, plus some ideas. Then you went back to giddy/excited mode. You thanked Satellizer for, just, everything she did right now and made an incredible pace back to your room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You power walked through the halls straight to Kurumu's room your boner once more raging in your pants. It had been a long time since you spent some time with Creo. Now ever since she said to meet her in her room, you've been raring to do her ever since. You made it to the front door of Creo's room and knocked on the door. The door opened and Creo stood in the doorway, but when you saw her your eyes went wide. Creo was wearing nothing but her underwear and bra and you didn't know if it was just you, but you felt your boner get even harder upon seeing her. Creo smiled when she saw you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" you replied gulping slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both stood there in silence not sure of what to say or what to do. Then Creo spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Are you gonna...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" you automatically said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed Creo's her face gently and smashed your lips with hers in a deep first time in a while kiss, Creo automatically returned the kiss with passion as she hugged you tightly while kissing you deeply. Both of your tongues swirled and wrestled in each others mouths savoring each others taste. Your hands went all over each other feeling each others bodies. Then you grabbed Creo by her butt and lifted her up while still kissing her. Creo yelped in surprise and smiled in the kiss as you carried her inside while shutting the door and then carried her to the bed setting her down. After a minute of making out, both of you separated and you took off your clothes until you were naked and you took off Creo's underwear and bra. You grabbed a condom, put it on, and before Creo could react, you inserted yourself inside of her making her moan loudly gripping the sheets. Not letting up, you began to move thrusting in and out of her. Creo bit her lip and gripped the sheets tighter and wrapped her legs around you looking at you with lustful eyes. Seeing those eyes made you go faster and harder making Creo's boobs wobble and bounce around. Creo moaned louder and you hissed in pleasure feeling Creo's insides tighten making the pleasure better. The pleasure grew better and better until finally Creo moaned louder than before holding you tightly making you stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creo? Did you just cum?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh,\" said Creo nodding her head. \"I guess... I must have been so long since we made love that my body's become more sensitive...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh has it?\" you asked smiling naughtily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou repositioned Creo so she was facing away from you and you started moving from behind also grabbing her breasts. Creo moaned even more squeezing the sheets trying to endure the overwhelming pleasure rocking her body. You turned her head and kissed her again while still moving inside her. Creo returned the kiss back her tongue wrestling with yours. You felt her insides getting hotter, tighter, and more wet making you move even more. You broke the kiss took a hold of Creo's butt squeezing it and moving inside pulling her towards you as you moved. Creo bit her lip as she groaned savoring every single bit of the pleasure she was feeling. This went on for a few minutes until Creo moaned loudly again signaling that she came again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man Creo,\" you chuckled. \"I didn't think that you missed me that much. You're such a naughty girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can... you blame me?\" panted Creo smiling. \"You... make me this way... because I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled and you kissed Creo on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... not convinced...\" said Creo huskily. \"Show me... show me how much you love me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled wider. \"All right... you asked for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed Creo by her hips and lied down while still inside her. You grabbed her breasts from behind with Creo sitting up and began moving once more. Creo moved her hips in time with yours moaning and overlaying her hands on yours squeezing her breasts. She moaned like she was in agony. You thrusted upwards and squeezed her breasts harder biting you lip feeling the impending orgasm coming on, but then Creo spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)! Wait a minute...! This... feels good...but... I... wanna... cum looking at you...\" she moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped and sat up looking at Creo. Then you kissed her passionately on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your wish is my command my love,\" you said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both repositioned and were both lying on the bed with you inside her. Then you held Creo's hand and started to move again. Creo panted huskily as you moved inside her. You looked at each other panting and once more smashed your lips together in a deep and passionate kiss. The kiss made both your hands tighten and the pleasure way better. You felt the familiar tightening of Creo's insides, but this time it was tighter than before. You moved harder and faster making Creo break the kiss and start to scream in pleasure signs showing that she was getting close to orgasm. You were also getting close as you moved as fast and hard as you could into Creo, burying your face in her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's coming...I'm....gonna...\" moaned Creo holding you tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me...too... me too!!!!\" you groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pleasure grew and grew until you both reached the summit together. You both screamed as you both reached orgasm at the same time. Creo's insides clamped down on your member shot right into her with the condom on. After you both calmed down, your face slightly red from exhaustion, you pulled out of Creo and lied on her using her breasts as makeshift pillows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man... I'll never get tired of this...\" you said nuzzling into her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... me either...\" said Creo petting your head. \"You certainly were aggressive. Even more so than usual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess you made me this way,\" you smiled. \"After all, you changed my life. You made me stronger, more happier, and most of all able to love again even with what I went through in the past.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at Creo and kissed her on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creo... I just wanna say two things. One, thank you for loving me and two... I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo smiled. \"I love you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both continued to lie down together naked, but keeping each other warm embracing each other. Then both of you fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

She hugged you in closer without waking you up, she was enjoying the warm feeling of your breath tickle her skin. Rhythmically receiving a steady beat of calming comfort from the intimacy. Creo was getting a little turned on by this, but encouraged herself not to let herself go off. But after another soft blow from your unconscious body, she got too excited and moaned an above average sound of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwn. Oh Morning. Aren't you a lovely sight to wake up to?\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time sleep next to me.

Arnett, Attia, as well as Rana, Satellizer, and Kazuya were already there busily training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you guys are,\" said Arnett. \"It's about time you two got here. What took you guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We... decided to sleep in some more,\" you said trying not to sound flustered. \"Anyway, let's get to training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dodging the subject huh?\" smirked Attia. \"You two must really have been going at last night huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Creo blushed a little and looked away both pretending they didn't hear. Kazuya and Satellizer looked at you and Creo and coudn't help but blush a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then, let's get some training done!\" said Arnett. \"Hey Creo! You wanna lift some weights to see who's gotten stronger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has been a while since we had a bit of a competition. Sure. Let's do it,\" smiled Creo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey (name)? You wanna have a sparring session with me?\" asked Kazuya. \"I've been brushing up on my close combat skills and I've been looking for a partner to test them out on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds interesting,\" you said. \"But wouldn't make sense to ask Satellizer or Rana to be your partner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... naturally I would, but.... they're not exactly good at holding back. And well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed to who Satellizer and Rana who were doing curl ups while glaring at each other at the same time. It seemed like both girls were having a bit of competition themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter with those two?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even know,\" sighed Kazuya. \"But I feel like it's got something to do with me for some reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they both kinda have a crush on you and they do wanna your Pandora, so that's to be expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Sigh). If that's the case, then I'd really wish those two would stop,\" sighed Kazuya. \"I mean seriously. Whenever those two start fighting, I feel like I'm getting a headache and I just get dizzy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like you got it rough,\" you said. \"It must be hard being the love interest of two girls huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. You're one to talk. You got three girls and they're all three years,\" said Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't go that far,\" you chuckled. \"Anyway, sure. I'll spar with you for a bit. And don't worry. I'll be sure to hold back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, you and Kazuya stood at opposite ends taking your fighting stances. Neither one of you made a move. Then as Attia was running on a tread mill, a bead of sweat dropped and hit the floor. The moment the droplet hit the floor, Kazuya immediately went on the attack. He threw a punch aimed right for your face, but you blocked the punch with ease and attacked back. Kazuya seeing the attack coming ducked and kicked at your legs hoping to knock you down, but you jumped dodging his kick and managed to gain some distance away from him. Then you took a boxing stance your right fist up and your left fist slightly down. You dashed toward Kazuya and attacked with a combo of punches. They weren't very strong, but they were pretty fast. Kazuya defended against your punches holding up his arms and when you punched again, he quickly closed the distance and attacked with a sharp uppercut. You barely dodged it Kazuya's knuckle grazing your chin making step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well. Guess you weren't kidding when you said you brushing up on your skills,\" you said. \"I'm impressed Kazuya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya smiled. \"Thanks. That means a lot coming from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you still need to improve on a couple things though,\" you said. \"When you attack, you're attacking slowly. Try to make your attacks a little faster, so that way you can get the drop on your opponent and strike quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. I got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now come at me again,\" you said beckoning Kazuya. With a shout, Kazuya attacked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Creo and Arnett, they both were bench pressing about 50 pounds focused on their competition. Attia had decided to take a break and watch the two of them do their competition. Both of them were neck and neck and then they both finished at the same time. They both stopped to catch their breath, their bodies dripping with sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it.. We tied...\" panted Creo,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I guess we did...\" wheezed Arnett. \"When... I catch my breath... I want... a rematch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you both take break,\" chuckled Attia throwing them both a bottle water. \"You don't wanna overwork yourselves,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett and Creo both caught their waters and gulped them down. Attia then opened the window across the room so a little air could get in. Then they happened to see you sparring with Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Look at that,\" said Arnett. \"Those two are really going at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, it's kinda refreshing to see them like this,\" said Creo. \"They may be sparring, but it looks like they're having fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Creo how has (name) been doing?\" asked Attia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's been doing fine,\" said Creo. \"Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... nothing much really. I was just wondering about his condition. That's all. I mean he has been though a lot,\" said Attia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true,\" said Arnett. \"I'll tell you this much, when he was possessed by that Nova before he sure packed a wallop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I'm worried about,\" said Attia. \"When (name) was possessed by that Nova, he somehow gained abilities like a Pandora. With the exception of that weird telekinesis thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Creo, has (name) used any of those powers ever since then?\" asked Arnett.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Well... to be honest, I don't think he's ever tried,\" said Creo. \"Wait... why are you asking this Attia? Is there something on your mind regarding that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... it may be just me, but... ever since I saw (name) almost become a Nova... I'm worried that.... it might happen again. I mean...\" Attia began but then Arnett cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww come Attia. You worry too much,\" she said. \"Besides, the Nova's dead and there's no way (name) will become a Nova. Well, not if Creo has anything to say about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe. She's right Attia,\" said Creo. \"I'm sure everything is fine. However, if (name) finds himself in the same situation as before, we'll all be there to help him, Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia smiled. \"Right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with your and Kazuya, you both worked up a sweat sparring with each other. Even though you were holding back, you were having fun sparring. It made you feel more relaxed and at ease. Kazuya was breathing heavily and wiping the sweat from his brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew... you sure are strong (name),\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not so bad yourself Kazuya,\" you said. \"Even though you're a rookie in fighting, you're pretty tough,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya came at you again with his fist raised, but you simply side stepped dodging it and then you gave Kazuya a sharp kick to his back. Kazuya stumbled, but he kept his footing. Then he swung at you again and again trying to land a hit, but you kept dodging them with ease. You both didn't see at the time, but you both were getting close to the open window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on (name)! Quit dodging!\" complained Kazuya getting a little annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a break. As if I would do that in a sparring match,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling more irritated, Kazuya swung wildly at you, but you sidestepped it and you tripped Kazuya by his leg causing him to stumble towards the open window. Kazuya waved his arms around trying to regain his balance, but he was gonna fall any minute. That's when...</span></div></div>",

They were about to jump and save Kazuya, but suddenly it happened. What happened next, you did on instinct. You shot forward in a blinding speed and before Kazuya could fall out the window you caught him by grabbing a hold of his shirt and pulling him back making him fall to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kazuya!? Are you OK?\" you asked. \"That was a close shave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuya didn't answer. He stared at you blankly at what you did and it wasn't just him. All of the girls were staring at you too like you had just did something crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong you guys?\" you asked. \"You're looking at me like I became a Nova or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... (name)... do you realize what you just did?\" asked Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... did I do?\" you asked a little puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)! You just accelerated!\" said Arnet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... I what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You accelerated!\" said Creo her eyes wide with surprise. \"How on earth you were you able to do that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't know...\" you said looking at your hands. \"I saw Kazuya was about to fall out from the window and... I just reacted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it? You just reacted?\" pondered Attia. \"Interesting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it that this is not normal for someone like (name) to use such an ability correct?\" asked Rana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Satellizer. \"Only the third year Pandora and me and are the only people who can use this ability and yet (name) was able to do it. How is it possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it obvious?\" said Attia. \"It has to be from when (name) was possessed by that Nova before. (name) must have retained some of his abilities back when he was possessed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... how can we know for sure?\" you asked. \"I mean what if it was just a fluke or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only one way to find out,\" said Arnett as she got up and stood across from you on the other side of the room. \"(name). You think you can do it again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can try,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to use Acceleration to get to where I'm standing. OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared intently at Arnett and focused. Then you ran forward attempting to accelerate, but you just ran normally. You tried again going back to where you stood, but nothing happened again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn. It didn't work. I guess it was just a fluke,\" you said a little disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on. Let me try something,\" said Arnett. \"Hey Creo? Could you come here for a minute? And Satellizer and Rana too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer, Rana, and Creo all went to Arnett and then Arnett whispered something to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what Arnett has in mind?\" wondered Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beats me,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett whispered her idea to the girls and needless to say, they were shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arnett! Are you crazy?!\" whispered Creo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well have you guys got any better ideas?\" asked Arnett. \"Besides, I'll hold back and make sure he sees it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the issue here!\" said Satellizer. \"What if you hurt (name) or Attia?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attia can handle herself,\" said Arnett. \"Besides I get the feeling (name) will pull it off. He just needs some motivation. I'm going for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I say go for it too!\" said Rana. \"I'm interested to see how this will turn out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rana!\" Creo and Satellizer whispered urgently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Arnett broke out of the huddle and then suddenly deployed her volt weapon and threw it straight at Attia like a giant boomerang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Attia! Think fast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia had barely time to look up to see Arnett's scythe coming straight at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit! Attia!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Attia could react, you immediately dashed for her in a blinding speed and tackled her out of the way just before Arnett's scythe pierced the wall from where Attia was standing before disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right! It worked!\" cheered Arnett.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)! Attia! Are you both OK?\" asked Creo feeling a little worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell Arnett?!\" you yelled sitting up. \"Why'd the hell you'd do a crazy stunt like that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it was the only way to get you to accelerate,\" said Arnett sheepishly scratching her cheek. \"I figured it would some extra motivation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry (name)! We tried to talk her out of it!\" said Creo sweatdropping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it was great,\" said Rana. \"At least you were able to accelerate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's beside the point!\" you snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you felt something soft and you heard a squeak. You looked down and you immediately blushed. When you tackled Attia while you were in acceleration, you had found yourself on top of Attia and found your hand squeezing her boob. The girls and including Kazuya all either blushed or looked shocked. Attia who had regained her senses saw that your hand was on her boob and she blushed a deep shade of red. She took a breath about to yell, but then Creo beat her to the punch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)! What are you doing?!\" cried Creo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reacted by Creo's shout and immediately got off of Attia who was still a little frozen from what had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to do that! It was an accident! I swear!!\" you said your ears and your face red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia said nothing. She simply got up and brushed off the dirt from her clothes. For a minute you thought that she was pissed. She was, but not at you. She took a deep breath...then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell Arnet?! Why the hell did you throw your scythe at me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To get (name) to use acceleration?\" said Arnett. \"Sorry I didn't tell you, but it kinda had to be a surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have given me a warning first!\" Attia snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttia was close to reaping Arnett a new one, but she quickly regained her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any case, it seems you can accelerate (name) which is good,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is this...good?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you learn to control it, you'll be an even greater asset to West Genetics and you and Creo will be even more incredible,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know... that sounds kinda cool,\" said Creo. \"It sounds interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I have been grinding my gears as to how can I go toe to toe with other Pandora here,\" you said thoughtfully. \"And I guess it would be a good thing to learn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's the case, why don't you take lessons from one of us?\" asked Rana. \"If one of us teaches you, you'll be able to pick it up in no time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds great!\" you said. \"But which one of you guys is gonna teach me? I mean all of you know how to accelerate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when...</span></div></div>",

And to put it bluntly, if he is still in some way possessed, you'd never be able to finish the job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnett and Satellizer took out their weapons in anger for hearing Isuzu make such a statement. But Creo tempered them, \"She's right. If it were to happen I'd hesitate. She needs to do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A wise policy. So what do you say we do now? Bring this up to the higher ups.\", Satellizer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, trust me they'd go ballistic. We need to show them when the time comes (Name) is capable and nonthreatening with this ability. We keep it under-wraps and we say nothing.\", Isuzu explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do we train then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know the best place, on the next scouting mission, you and me alone will head out for Nova for a few days. From there I'll teach you, and no witnesses, and no collateral damage. Perfect place to let loos is out in the snow where not many are going outside.\", Isuzu suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a great idea.\", Creo replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Lets all pack it in for today and pretend nothing happened. Everyone goes about things as usual.\", Kazuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all left the arena with you and Creo going back to your room. You both were about to get some rest but Creo wasn't feeling too good. You comforted her and hugged her, coddling her stomach with gentle rubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm worried. Are you sure you don't feel like your being possessed?\", Creo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Positive. I spend too much time with you to have any doubts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about when were not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your not making sense Creo. I'm only not with you where were in classes or on sperate assignments, and I'm always with people who would notice this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Ok OK! I'm just....god you know, how ripped apart I felt when you get swallowed up by that Nova (Name). Tell me you feel ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do. Come here.\", you inched your way to her mouth giving her a gentle kiss trying to soften her stress. Creo undressed all the way with literally nothing on. She spread herself and without words told you to follow suit. You did just that, and laid on top of her body. Neither of you were going at it, you just hugged each other while in the nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you were too tired and stressed to go too far off to have a full on go. But just having the ability to touch her in a way nobody else can, having your excitement build but forcing yourself to not to go beyond anything. Creo and you immediately flew asleep and slept, hoping maybe things would change tomorrow for the better. But you didn't know. You were never this worried about things in your entire life than what you just experienced today.</span></div></div>",

It was a hard road, but eventually thanks the teachings of Isuzu, you managed to get the hang of it. You were soon accelerating like any other basic third year. Eventually you and Isuzu made it back to West Genetics and finished the training there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day you and Isuzu were having a sparring session. You were trying to hit Isuzu with the acceleration skill you learned, but Isuzu dodged each and every blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on (name)! You can move faster than that!\" she said as she hit you with a roundhouse kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blocked the kick by crossing your arms, but the force of Isuzu's kick forced you back. Then you came at Isuzu and used your acceleration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Acceleration!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou disappeared in a flash of blue light and zipped around the room in an incredible speed. Then during your acceleration, you attacked Isuzu from her blind side with a powerful punch. It seemed that you were actually going to land a blow on her, but Isuzu turned around and blocked your punch with her bare fist. The force of it all sent a slight blast of wind through the training area. But you weren't done with your attack. You attacked once more with a flurry of punches. Isuzu blocked and dodged each and every blow. Then suddenly one of your blows hit Isuzu square in the cheek. Feeling that punch, Isuzu immediately reacted by punching you in the face hard and gave a powerful kick sending you sprawling to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap! (name)!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsuzu rushed to your side making sure you weren't hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch...! Isuzu! What'd you do that for?!\" you complained. \"You didn't need to hit me that hard!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies. I didn't mean to... besides you surprised me when you hit me. You've gotten the hang of acceleration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I'd say you're about as good as an average third year,\" said Isuzu. \"Not as good as Satellizer or Creo, but pretty good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks... I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey (name). Isuzu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Creo and the other girls along with Kazuya came in greeting the two of you. Creo came up to you and gave you a peck on the cheek along with a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how's the training coming along?\" asked Arnett. \"You two have been training for about a couple weeks now. Any results?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a look for yourself,\" you said as you crouched down. Then you took off in a blinding speed in a flash of light using acceleration. You appeared by the weights then disappeared. You reappeared by Arnett and then disappeared. Then you reappeared again from behind Creo and gave her a light squeeze on her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kya! What the...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo turned around to find that you had disappeared again. She then felt a tap on her shoulder. She turned and you gave her a kiss on the lips surprising her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...! (name)!\" Creo blushed giggling a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry babe. I couldn't resist,\" you chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad (name),\" said Attia. \"You mastered acceleration in in about a couple weeks. Normally it would have taken the average third year a year or so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because he's had an awesome teacher,\" said Rana looking at Isuzu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was nothing really,\" said Isuzu. \"All I did was teach him how to accelerate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I really appreciate it Isuzu,\" you said. \"I owe you big time. Thanks to you, I'll be an even bigger help to West Genetics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say,\" said Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anytime,\" said Isuzu. \"But just remember. Keep it a secret. Don't show it off needlessly. Only use acceleration unless you have to. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" you said. \"In any case, I'm gonna head to my dorm room and try to get some rest. I'm worn out and sore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" said Creo. \"I'll walk you to your room,\" said Creo as you and her started to head towards your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

Let's get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on,\" you said. \"Mind if I go change my clothes real quick? I feel all sweaty since I've been training and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then.

She looked back to where you headed and remembered the bruise she saw on your cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That bruise didn't look like an accident,\" she thought. \"That looked very recent too. Could Isuzu have done that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Satellizer. Are you alright?\" asked Kazuya who had noticed Satellizer pondering. \"You look so serious about something. Is everything OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" said Satellizer. \"Just thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with you, you had finished and were just on your way to join up with Creo and the others, but then you found someone waiting for you which turned out to be Isuzu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isuzu? Were you waiting up for me?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I wanted to talk to you,\" said Isuzu. \"Why did you cover for me when Satellizer pointed out your bruise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that,\" you said. \"I don't know why to be honest. Probably because I didn't want anyone getting on your case for being so rough with me. The last thing I want to have you guys start a fight over a bruise. Besides you're my friend right? Friends help each other after all. Even covering each others asses from time to time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsuzu stared at you. Then she smiled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... thank you. That was sweet and very considerate of you,\" she said. \"You're a good friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled. \"You're welcome. Anyway, I'll see you later Isuzu. Talk to you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK then. Bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you left the room leaving Isuzu by herself. Then...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning, you, Creo, Satellizer, Rana, and Kazuya were on a chopper enroute to Alaska. It took all day to get even close to the United States and was nightfall by the time you were reaching Alaska territory. It was starting to get a little chilly so you and Kazuya wore coats while girls however wore their regular clothes with nothing but a vest over them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brrr! The cold is almost overwhelming,\" shivered Rana. \"If only there was some way to keep warm.\" She looked at Kazuya smiling mischievously and scooted closer to him. \"Please Kazuya. Hold me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rana what are you doing?\" asked Kazuya slightly blushing a little. \"You're getting a little close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. Close proximity will engender warmth,\" said Rana. \"Aren't you cold?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... no I'm fine. I'm warm enough thanks to my coat. But it must be cold considering that you're wearing nothing, but your uniforms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the more reason for us to embrace each other,\" smiled Rana as grew closer to Kazuya making him blush even more. \"Come on... shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rana! Knock it off! You're suffocating me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Kazuya... I have to get rid of this frigidness otherwise I'll turn into popsicle! Here feel for yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took one of Kazuya's hands and tried to place it on her bosom, but Kazuya immediately pulled his hand back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the heck are you making me touch anyway?!\" he said now even more flushed than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it obvious?\" winked Rana squeezing her ample bosom in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK! That's enough of that! Cut it out Rana!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I beg you Kazuya, keep not the warmth of your flesh from me but instead, enfold your arms with mine so this chill will go away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRana glomped on Kazuya trying to seduce him from her advances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Rana! Let go of me!\" he said as he pushed her off him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRana pouted. \"Fine. I see that you'll leave me here to freeze to death!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rana. Surely you realize that your volt texture has hot and cold protection capabilities right?\" said Satellizer who was not amused by this at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes. It must have slipped my mind Satellizer,\" said Rana feigning ignorance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good grief,\" you said. \"So that's the reason Rana was so gung-ho about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just leave them be,\" said Creo. \"Besides it's actually pretty funny once you get used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt that,\" you said. \"So how are you feeling Creo? It's not too cold for you is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I'm fine,\" said Creo. \"Like Satellizer said, my volt texture has cold and heat protection. So I'm fine on my end. How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" you said. \"Just a little chilly on my hands that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathed on your hands trying to warm them up, but it wasn't exactly helping. Then Creo wrapped her hands around yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here (name). My hands are warm,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instantly felt your hands warm up. Then you and Creo looked at each other and you couldn't help your face warming up a little too. You squeezed Creo's hands and you snuggled up against her making Creo's eyes widen a little surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)! What are you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually... the rest of my body is still feeling a little cold,\" you said. \"Is... it OK if I do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo smiled and stroked your head and kissed it. \"Of course you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head on Creo's shoulder and savored her warmth which felt very pleasant. She felt just like a warm water bottle only softer. You hummed softly enjoying the warmth when...</span></div></div>",

We're changing course and heading towards the site.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A distress signal?\"you wondered. \"I wonder what that's all about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got me,\" said Kazuya. \"I'm just as clueless as you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me either,\" added Rana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well whatever it's about, I get the feeling we're gonna find out and it's probably not a good thing,\" said Creo as she fastened her seat belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat up and fastened your seatbelt as welll as did everyone else as the helicopter changed course. Soon the helicopter was hovering around the forest and you heard the pilots again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're closing in on the signal. It's right below us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The snow coming down like crazy. We have no visual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked out of the window trying to see what was going on. The helicopters lights searched around trying to see what was going on below. Then you saw something in the darkness. A giant dark shadow. You squinted your eyes trying to see what it was. Then... your eyes widened in shock and horror. You knew what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son of a bitch...\" you murmured. \"No... no it can't be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)? What's wrong?\" asked Satellizer. \"What do you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't answer her. Your body was stiff in shock. You couldn't move.because you wanted to have the helicopter's light confirm what you were seeing praying that you were wrong. Satellizer and Rana looked out another window so they could see what you were seeing. The helicopter's light slowly looked around until finally the dark figure was shown to the light and to your horror, you were might. Satellizer and Rana gasped in surprise for the figure turned out to be what you hoped it wouldn't be. A S class Nova. Creo and Kazuya also looked through another window and they saw the nova as well. You can still remember the recent trauma that you experienced a while back. It made you scared but at the same time angry as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't be...\" murmured Creo. \"An S class Nova?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a Nova doing all the way out here?!\" exclaimed Kazuya as he picked up a com from a radio to communicate with the pilots. \"This is Kazuya. When it appeared, did you pick up it's dimensional vibrations?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately we couldn't!\" said the pilot. \"This blizzard is causing all of our equipment to malfunction!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a female voice came through through the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. Leave this to me. I have an idea of what's going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's that?\" asked Kazuya. \"Is someone else on this line?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman on the other line, ignored Kazuya's question and continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About three kilometers from you, there's a Chevalier petroleum storage base. If the base is compromised, the enviromental impact could be disastrous. The petroleum spills would also result in wide spread seawater contamination. You all have to stop the Type S and defend the base at all costs. That's your top priority.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the whole thing, you grabbed the com from Kazuya and spoke to the unknown woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious right now?! There's only three Pandora here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the only ones who can stop that from happening,\" said the woman. \"Also reinforcements are on the way so calm down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They better be,\" you mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it easy (name),\" said Creo as she rested a hand on your shoulder.<br>\r\n\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" you said as you handed the com back to Kazuya. \"I guess I'm a little freaked out that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard the pilot again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The wind is too way choppy to make a safe landing!\" he said. \"All Pandora and Limiters prepare to depart! Once the hatch is open, commence combat operations immediately!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ex...cuse me, but couldn't translate for me please?\" asked Rana who was a little puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't obvious? When the hatch opens, we jump out and start fighting,\" said Satellizer who was more than ready to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRana and Kazuya looked at Satellizer like she said something foreign while you and Creo prepared yourselves.The helicopter eventually was close enough to the ground and the hatch door opened. Cold winds and snow were blasted in your face the door lowered. As you stared out to the ground below, you felt a hand touch yours which belonged to Creo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you OK?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" you said. \"I... was just freaked out for a moment. I'm OK. Don't worry. Let's just take out this Nova and call it a day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" said Creo. \"Make sure you got my back OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you guys ready?!\" called out Satellizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am!\" said Rana. \"But I don't really have a choice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do this!\" called Creo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right! Let's go!\" said Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer took a running start and she jumped off the door holding Kazuya's and hand both fell towards the ground below. You and Creo followed soon after with you jumping off first and Creo coming after and then Rana. All of you landed safely in the snow as the helicopter flew away.</span></div></div>",

A computerized voice rang out;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention all units. This is Mission Control. Proceed to the combat area. Target is in sight. I repeat, target is in sight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman then pressed on the button which activated an intercom on a speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about to start ladies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman respond from the speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be there right away doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mysterious woman pressed a couple of keys and a live feed appeared on the screen showing your group as well as the Nova.

This is a S class Nova we're talking about here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you all heard the whirling sound of helicopters. Sure enough, high above them a squad of military planes zipped past. One flew right above the Nova dropping flares all around it so it could be seen. The other air crafts that were gunners and bombers prepared to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck...?\" you murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reinforcements are here already?\" pondered Satellizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the bombers went on the offensive dropping multiple bombs right on the Nova. They hit the Nova exploding with mighty booms causing the ground to shake and snow dust flying everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right!\" cheered Rana. \"They did it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No they didn't,\" said Creo. \"Look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough when the dust cleared, the Nova still stood remaining untouched from the assault. The gunners took their turn next. They fired a salvo of rounds at the Nova giving it everything they got. Unfortunately, they couldn't do a thing either. TheNova deflected them all with ease. Then the Nova began to glow and then unleashed a freezing field. It expanded throughout the area heading right for your group's location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kazuya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kazuya immediately reacted by unleashing both of your freezing fields combining them and disabling the Nova's freezing field. However, the Nova immediately turned to your group's direction and was now heading right for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! It's coming straight at us!\" Rana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, two huge missiles shot right past your heads and hit the Nova with a mighty boom making snow dust fly all around once again. As soon as this happened, a thought struck you. Something about all of this seemed a little off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck...? They deployed cruise missiles? Something about this is strange. It's like they were too prepared for this,\" you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nova continued coming towards you all and the girls prepared to fight. They all deployed their volt weapons and stood their ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up! It's too risky to fight the Nova head on, so I have a plan!\" said Satellizer. \"There's a gully not too far from here! Me and Creo will keep the Nova distracted and draw it out! Once we do, Rana....?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bury that evil machine alive!\" finished Rana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan,\" said Creo. \"I'm with you Satellizer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If thing's get hairy, me and (name) will have your back!\" called Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful you two!\" you added. \"Give that thing what for!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer and Creo nodded and then they both dashed at the Nova while Rana headed towards the cliffs. As soon as they were close enough, they made a feint and darted to their the left with the Nova following in pursuit. The Nova attacked using it's tentacles, but Satellizer sliced and slashed them using her Nova Blood blade and Creo bashed and punched using her Infinity Fang Gauntlets. Then the Nova unleashed another freezing. You and Kazuya once more used your freezing fields to stop the Nova's freezing, but then your freezing field began to falter and soon weaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! Not now!\" you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kazuya's overtook yours and disabled the Nova's freezing enabling Satellizer and Creo to take off running again with the Nova in hot pursuit of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)? Are you OK?\" asked Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" you said. \"But... it seems that my freezing is still weak. Damn it. And I thought it was stronger this time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok,\" said Kazuya. \"Just don't push yourself too hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo and Satellizer were soon deep in the gully to spring their trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rana! Do it!\" yelled Creo as she and Satellizer used acceleration to get out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRana immediately jumped up from a cliff above springing wings of light upon her back as she released her stigmata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sacred extremities fist!!! Flame Fang!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slammed her fist into the ground making the ground crackle and break. The attack caused an avalanche causing rock and ice to fall upon the Nova. The Nova not expecting it was buried under all the rock and snow. When the avalanche stopped, the Nova was nowhere to be seen. The trap had worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was easy,\" said Rana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Way too easy,\" said Satellizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree. Compared with the other fights we had with the Nova, this was certainly different than the others,\" added Creo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you guys! Way to go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls turned and they saw you and Kazuya climbing up to them. Then just as you both managed to climb up, you saw a tentacle spring up from the ground and dart right towards Rana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rana! Watch out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even hesitating, you dashed forward using your acceleration, grabbed Rana and got her out of the way just in time. Then another appeared. This time right behind Kazuya. Satellizer dashed toward and pushed Kazuya out of the way just before it hit him, but she couldn't stop it from hitting her. The tentacle hit it's mark grazing Satellizer right in her midsection sending her rolling and tumbling to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Satellizer!\" cried Creo as she rushed to help her, but then another tentacle appeared and barred her way. \"Damn it! Move it!\" she growled as she punched it shattering it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry! I got her!\" you yelled as you dashed forward using acceleration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! (name)! There's another one!\" cried Rana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late. As you rushed toward Satellizer using acceleration, another tentacle sprung up and darted straight at you. You jumped to the right attempting to dodge, but the blade of the tentacle slashed right at your shoulder making you scream in pain as you fell to the ground holding your shoulder. You looked up trying to get back up only to look in time to see the tentacle aimed right at you. Just when you thought that the tentacle was gonna kill you...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Then suddenly at the last second someone came to your rescue. She used her giant pair of claws and crushed the tentacle just when it was about to hit you. At first you didn't know who it was, but then you saw her face. Your rescuer was a certain girl with short brown hair with a white ribbon and as soon as you saw her narrowed eyes and her smile, you immediately knew who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chiffon Fairchild!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you too (name),\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the Nova slowly came out of the snow still alive firing it's tendrils once more. Satellizer, Creo, and Rana prepared to fight once again, but then another girl joined the fray. She had long blonde hair and had her floating stigmata at the ready and fired at the tendrils destroying them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way...\" said Satellizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elizabeth Mably is here too?\" finished Creo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen two boys along with Kazuya appeared by your side. The first one you recognized immediately for he was Elizabeth's limiter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andr\u00e9!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you too (name)\" said Andr\u00e9.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)! Are you OK? You're hurt!\" said Kazuya worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at your shoulder and saw that you had a gash oozing blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry I'm fine. It's just a scratch,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen another boy appeared next to you. He looked a little like Kazuya, but he had darker hair and gray eyes. You had to assume that he was Chiffon's limiter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't be tough after taking a hit like that,\" said the boy. \"That's a pretty bad wound.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andr\u00e9. You and Eugene take good care of those two will ya?\" asked Elizabeth,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you saw milady,\" said Andre bowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Satellizer, Rana, and Creo, you're on decoy duty,\" said Chiffon. \"I'll serve as the striker and Elizabeth, you're the finisher. Let's put an end to this thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone then scattered using acceleration. The Nova went on the attack firing it's tendrils at Satellizer, Rana, and Creo, but they all dodged the attacks with ease. Chiffon used her acceleration and dive bombed right at the Nova.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eugene! Get ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ereinbar Set!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Chiffon and Eugene glowed in a blue light as they activated their Ereinbar Set. The Nova sensing Chiffon coming activated it's freezing and attempted to freeze her, but Eugene was ready and fired a freezing of his own allowing Chiffon to attack. With a mighty swing and shout, Chiffon used her giant claws to hit the Nova at it's surface exposing the core. As soon as Chiffon exposed the core, her eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This Nova...! I knew it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, Elizabeth fired her stigmata weapon right at the center of the Nova's core. The Nova exploded with a mighty boom as it was finally destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right!\" cheered Kazuya. \"We got it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second...\" you said. \"Something's not right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Creo as he came up to you. \"We beat the Nova didn't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't answer. You came up to the Chiffon and Elizabeth and walked past them. Then you saw it. There were pieces of the Nova scattered everywhere. Metal bits and some parts lay everywhere. As soon as you saw this, you came to a realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This Nova...it's a....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fake,\" finished Chiffon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... a fake Nova?\" wondered Satellizer. \"How is that possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows? Rumor has it that they've been developing these Nova fakes right here in Alaska,\" said Elizabeth. \"If you look at this from another point of view, it was like we were being tested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would explain why they were so overly prepared,\" said Kazuya. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is standard procedure,\" added Creo. \"But wait...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you meaning to tell us that they went through all this trouble to send us here, keep us in the dark, fake a distress call just to involve in a test run?\" said Satellizer who sounded a little angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually Elizabeth and I were told that this was related to disaster relief,\" said Chiffon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Disaster relief my ass!\" you snapped. \"They just practically used us! Plain and simple!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now. Calm down,\" said Creo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever the case, it would appear that were being tested,\" said Elizabeth. \"and this is only the beginning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, what a fucking load,\" you muttered. \"What do you think Kazuya? Kazuya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you noticed that Kazuya had a dumb smile on his face blushing a little. You looked to where he was look and blushed. Satellizer outfit was once again torn, exposing very much of her boobs. Satellizer noticed this and yelped in embarrassment covering herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kazuya! Avert your eyes!\" said Rana as she covered Kazuya's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)! You too!\" snapped Creo as she covered your eyes too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiffon chuckled. \"You do know you can use your volt texture to fix that. Unless you want these boys to look at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like that!\" snapped Satellizer.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a while, you were all picked up by a helicopter and were on a ship heading up the river. Needless to say that Satellizer and Creo both gave you and Kazuya a bit of a beating for catching a peep at her. You rubbed your head in pain trying to ease the large lump on you head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow... Creo you didn't need to hit me that hard you know,\" you complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you get for gawking at another girl's boobs,\" said Creo. \"Think of it as your punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kazuya are you in pain yourself?\" asked Rana. \"Satellizer also gave you quite the beating did she not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine Rana. You're overreacting,\" said Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am only concerned for your well being Kazuya,\" replied Rana who was now very close to Kazuya. \"Besides, is it not my duty given that you're my limiter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now wait just a minute! Who said that Kazuya's your limiter?!\" said Satellizer looking flabbergasted. \"He's already got me, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" said Rana coolly. \"I was under the impression that you and Kazuya haven't had a baptism yet therefore making your claim obsolete isn't that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate to say it, but she got you on that one Satellizer,\" you said. \"In fact she hit the hammer smack on the head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)! Who's side are you on anyway?!\" snapped Satellizer glaring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just calling it like I sees it,\" you replied shrugging your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's also conceited, prudish, and quite pious when it comes to physical contact,\" continued Rana talking right in Kazuya's ear. \"As a result, I think Satellizer would be better off being a helper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say what?! Helper!?! Get real! There's no way I would-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer walked over to Rana to about to get into another argument her when she stepped on a fish causing her to slip. With a yelp she fell flat on her face her glasses falling off. You and Chiffon seeing this couldn't help but giggle and snicker. Elizabeth and Creo however were a little more composed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you stop acting like children?!\" snapped Elizabeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Knock if off Rana. One of these days you fighting with Satellizer is gonna come back to bite you,\" added Creo as she bent down and picked up Satellizer's glasses giving them to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah this isn't the time to be joking around,\" said Kazuya. \"After all we're here to help the E-Pandora lab by providing them with data and info remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I suppose,\" said Rana. Then she looked puzzled. \"Wait... what is an E-Pandora?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Pandora are artificial Pandora,\" said Satellizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Artificial Pandora?\" you asked. \"Wait...how do you know that Satellizer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised you didn't know,\" said Chiffon. \"It was on the news. Because of all the Nova appearing frequently not to mention with the recent tenth Nova clash, the Chevalier General Command had announced a new Pandora plan; the E-Pandora project, spearheaded by a woman named Doctor Scarlet Ohara.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the purpose of the plan?\" asked Creo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me answer by asking you a question Creo,\" said Chiffon. \"How do girls normally become Pandora?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... first you have to wait till you're eleven years old to take the Pandora aptitude test,\" said Creo. \"Then if you're stigmata-compatible. you'll be able to become a Pandora right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct,\" said Chiffon. \"However there are some girls that are incompatible, but want to fight as Pandora. That's where the E-Pandora comes in. This project will allow those girls along with the ordinary to have a chance to become Pandora.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" you and Creo said simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" continued Chiffon. \"This will be made possible by implanting artificially-made stigmata. I know that it sounds crazy, but it's considered to be revolutionary breakthrough although there are some people that are against it because of it's unethical nature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah. I can't blame those people. It sounds crazy,\" you said. \"I mean... should those girls even be considered to be Pandora?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Artificial or not, a Pandora is a Pandora,\" said Elizabeth as she gazed into the water. \"However I'll assume that there will be volunteers who want to become E-Pandora only for the glory and status they get after the tour of duty. But as it is now, less than two percent of girls are verified to become Pandora anyway. After all it is a dangerous job and everyone knows it. Countless lives have been lost including the Pandora fighting against those Nova. We need all the help we can get. Given the circumstances, it would be a mistake to pass any Pandora volunteers only because they're artificial. There is a worldwide shortage of Pandora after all. This could be the answer to all of our problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at Elizabeth a little surprised. \"Wow... pardon me if this sounds rude Elizabeth, but I don't think I've ever heard you talk this much before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth turned to you and smiled. \"Shows how much you really know me,\" she said. \"You may not know this, but I can be quite the chatterbox if I wanted to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you guys! Look!\" called Rana pointing to a building close to the shore. \"The laboratory is straight ahead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after that, you all made it to shore and were riding on board military jeeps heading inside the lab. As they drove on, they passed by on what seemed to be the inside of a factory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems like this place used to be some kind of industrial plant,\" said Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the perfect place to keep a secret covered up,\" added Chiffon with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kazuya looked at Chiffon a bit irked, but Chiffon giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mind me. I'm just kidding,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jokes are supposed to be funny and that clearly wasn't funny,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Chiffon whispered something to you. \"By the way (name), there's something that I need to say before we get off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Another bad joke?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Look I'm serious. I need you to try to lie low alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised an eyebrow in confusion. \"Why do you say that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh! It's because of you. You're the Imperfect Limiter remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And? I thought we were over this already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. As far as everything in West Genetics yes,\" said Chiffon. \"But as far as this goes you're still pretty infamous. If people found out who are, you're gonna be knees deep in trouble. Especially with the other Pandora.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feh. I ain't scared of a couple Pandora,\" you said. \"If they have a problem with me, then I'll just fight em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name) I agree with Chiffon,\" said Creo. \"The last thing you should be doing is starting a fight with a bunch of Pandora. You're starting to sound like Satellizer. Just do what Chiffon says OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \"Oh alright, but if anyone picks a fight with me I have a right to defend myself and I won't hesitate to do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after the girls went to get their new volt textures and you all headed for the assembly hall,</span></div></div>",

Chiffon! Over here! Long time no see!\" said a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a young girl came up to Chiffon. She had a buxom figure, blue eyes, and had magenta hair which had the ends encircle her neck like pincers, while the rest framed her face, her bangs stop just above her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Roxanne!\" said Chiffon. \"Good to see you. I haven't seen you since the world carnival!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, When you kicked my butt from here to kingdom come,\" chuckled Roxanne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. Some proper introductions are in order,\" said Chiffon turning to you and your friends. \"This is Roxanne Elipton. A friend of mine from Genetics America, US. Roxanne, these are a few of my classmates. Satellizer, Rana, Creo, and their limiters (name) and Kazuya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet ya,\" said Roxanne. \"Just call me Roxanne The Immortal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Am I to believe that this young girl cannot be killed?\" asked Rana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're asking me? I don't know.\" said Creo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually she's more like a zombie,\" said another voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen another Pandora came up. She was short, had cream-coloured hair that was short at the back with side-bangs covering both sides of her cheeks, brown eyes, and had a set of headphones. Roxanne turned around clearly a little insulted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you're just as uncouth and sassy as ever,\" said the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who is that?\"asked Satellizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is the infamous Charles Bonaparte of Genetics France, LDT. Aka The Young Tempest Phoenix,\" said Chiffon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! (name)! Satellizer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you and Satellizer heard yet another voice. Only this one was all too familiar. You and Satellizer turned and when you saw her, your faces brightened in delight for it was none other than Cassie Lockhart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie ran up to you and gave you a big hug. \"It's so good to see you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassie! It's great to see you!\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too (name)!\" said Cassie. \"I was hoping I'd see you and Satellizer here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! It's her! The Godspeed of the East to fought us as the lesbian nude cheetah!\" said Rana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lesbian?\" questioned Cassie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just.... ignore her,\" you said sweatdropping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. She's not exactly on the bright side,\" added Satellizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the understatement of the year,\" muttered Creo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly another Pandora joined the party. She crept up behind Cassie and grabbed her breasts causing her to help in surprise. You and Satellizer blushed bright red from this sight and Creo covered your eyes not wanting to see blushing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... supple with a mix of firm and bounciness,\" she said. \"If I had to make a guess with size, I'd say she's a D cup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck are you? A boobologist or something?!\" cried Cassie defensively covering her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is the one and only Julia Munberk,\" said Chiffon. \"She's from Genetics Germany Panzer. She also goes by the title the Maverick of Walpurgis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man... so she's a big deal too huh?\" said Kazuya. \"I feel like I just walked into a celebrity's party or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a small crowd began to form around the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Check it out! They're the fabulous five!\" said a Pandora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I can't believe they're here!\" said another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Fabulous Five?\" wondered Satellizer. \"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know? Those girls along with Chiffon are five of the most third-year Genetics members in the entire world,\" said Elizabeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! You're kidding!\" you said. \"Wow Cassie, I didn't think you were such a celebrity much less that powerful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's no big deal,\" said Cassie. \"But I can safely say that I can hold my own in rankings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not the only one,\" said Chiffon. \"Elizabeth is just behind them in ranking. She could become one of the newest members of the five if she wanted to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Kazuya said. \"That's pretty amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth chuckled. \"Yeah. For the moment. I will be fighting a tough opponent pretty soon. Holly Rose of Genetics Britain UK. Speaking of which, I'm surprised she's not here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you mention it, it's not like her to miss a party like this,\" said Chiffon thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Creo. You think that you could get that high in ranking one of these days?\" you asked. \"I mean you're pretty strong yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way,\" said Creo. \"There's no way I'd stand a chance with those big shots. I could hardly even stand up to Chiffon. I'd get my ass kicked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't sell yourself short Creo,\" said Chiffon. \"You could get high in the ranks if you wanted to. Just keep working hard and you'll get there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a female voice came from a loudspeaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention all Pandora and Limiters. Please report to the Assembly Hall. Pandora are to first to test their Volt Textures in the fitting rooms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then that's our cue,\" said Chiffon as she and the other girls went to the fitting rooms while you and Kazuya waited for them outside.</span></div></div>",

On the stage, a young woman stepped out on the podium. She had mauve colored hair, had an average build of a woman and wore a white lab coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Scarlet Ohara and I'm the head of the E Pandora project,\" she said. \"The goal of this plan is pretty simple and that is to create artificially create stigmata-compatible subjects. However in order to successfully do this, I need all of you original Pandora to provide the data necessary. There is no doubt that this will be a game changer. Once the project gets underway and we get all the data necessary, we will no longer have to rely on the slim chance of natural Pandora compatibility. You will no longer have to share the burden by yourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused impressively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The time has come for every girl to share that responsibility!\" she finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the room applauded from her speech. However there were a couple of people who had a different reaction to this. Particularly your group and the Big Five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something feels off about this,\" you said. \"I don't know why, but something feels off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you think so too eh kid? I don't blame you,\" agreed Roxanne. \"Rumor has it that Doctor Gengo Aoi has been and still is opposed to this E-Pandora being pushed forward. Not to mention that they were already got it ready before they even got permission from the Chevalier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips then curled into a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks to me that someone's been doing quite a few human experiments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that you got to say?\" said a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of you turned around and there standing there were three girls none of you have seen before. One was dark-skinned with long black hair, the second had short purple hair, and the last one had long silver hair with a red band on her forehead. The three scowled at Roxanne as if she had insulted them, but Roxanne wasn't fazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I guess I would like to know who the hell you are,\" she said glaring at them back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Pandora,\" the silver haired girl replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the girls curiously upon hearing that word. \"E-Pandora?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... you're the result of what they got cooking down here,\" said Roxanne. \"Pretty interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl with silver hair's glare hardened and the two looked ready to start a fight. As much as you wanted to step in and break it up, you decided to stay quiet, but You couldn't help but stare at the girls. It was surprising to believe that they were the very E-Pandora that Scarlett Ohara was talking about. It made you interested to know if they were really the result of the project. Then the purple haired girl noticed that you were staring and gave you a dirty look. You looked away pretending not to notice not wanting to start a fight.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You, Creo, Satellizer, Kazuya, and Rana were walking through the hall finding your rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Pandora, the one that Charles called the zombie,\" said Rana. \"certainly is quite the straightforward person isn't she? I was afraid that her words with the E-Pandora would entice a fight, but luckily nothing happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rana. First of all her name is Roxanne,\" said Satellizer. \"And secondly that doesn't guarantee that there will be a fight later on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. No kidding,\" said Kazuya. \"So you make sure that you behave yourself alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continued to walk you couldn't help but think about the E-Pandora and especially the look that girl gave to you before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right about one thing about the fighting, but why do I get the feeling that somehow someway I'm gonna get dragged in the crossfire?\" you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(name)? Is something the matter?\" asked Creo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. It's nothing. I'm fine,\" you said. \"Just thinking that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they came to a room each one with a gold label on the side that had names on the side. Rana came up to one that had her name on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Here it is! I take it that this is the room I will be staying in,\" said Rana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen next to her room, Creo found one with hers and your names on the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We found ours too,\" said Creo. \"Guess we're gonna be neighbors then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. I wonder if ours is here too,\" wondered Kazuya as he and Satellizer walked past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough there was a door having his as well as Satellizer's names on it. Then Satellizer and Kazuya entered to check it out. As soon as they did...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did he mean our room?!\" cried Rana as she ran up to their door and looked at the plate. \"They're sharing one?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well duh Rana. They are partners after all,\" you said. \"What did you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I will not stand for this!\" cried Rana as she burst through the door. \"Such impure sexual relations are unforgivable! Why do you two get to share a room together?!? Kazuya's the man of my destiny not yours Satellizer! What foul trickery have pulled!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't blame me,\" said Satellizer innocently. \"The rooms here are always assigned to partners who have shared combat experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say what?! Partners!? The two of you haven't even had a proper baptism!\" cried Rana indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter,\" said Satellizer flipping her hair smugly. \"We are roommates now because the higher ups recognize us what you can't because we share a bond.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What bond is there?!\" snapped Rana getting up in Satellizer's face. \"Without a baptism that's nothing but nonsense so there is no doubt that you definitely pulled some strings with the higher ups out of jealously just so you can do who knows what with Kazuya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Like I told you the higher ups decided this!\" Satellizer shot back. \"I don't see what the big deal is here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's the case then switch rooms with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Don't be stupid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>will</i> be stupid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, Creo, and Kazuya looked at each other and sighed as the two continued to argue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like the two bulls are locking horns again,\" you deadpanned. \"Can't they ever stop being at each other's throats like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doubtful,\" said Kazuya pinching his nose. \"Once the two of them go at it like this, there's no stopping them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is getting annoying,\" said Creo as she walked towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you and Kazuya could ask what she was up to, Creo got in between them and pushed them apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough both you,\" she said. \"Rana you just need to accept that Satellizer and Kazuya will be sharing a room together. There's nothing you can do about it. Now go to your room and let this go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely you jest Ms.Creo! How can you tell me to let this go!?\" complained Rana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like this; Let. It. Go. All of this love triangle crap is getting on everybody's nerves and it needs to stop.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can claim that Kazuya's yours all you want, but it's obvious that Satellizer and him are partners regardless of baptism and you need to grow up and accept it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts! You will stop this behavior. Because if you don't I'll will have no choice but to beat you to a pulp and if you still continue to resist, I'll will force you to stay in your room. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo then gave Rana a dangerous look. A look what made her as well as you and Kazuya cringe in fear. Even Satellizer was sweating a little. Rana then hung her head in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right fine. I will return to my room,\" she said. \"But I won't give up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Rana bolted out of the room and into her own room. Everyone in the room looked at Creo in surprise as to what she had just did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creo... are you sure that wasn't a tad harsh?\" asked Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" said Creo. \"I think that she won't be bothering you for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remind me not to get on your bad side,\" said Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. That's my Creo,\" you said. \"Cute as she is fearsome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any case, thanks for getting her off my back,\" said Satellizer. \"I swear I had nothing to do with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you didn't,\" said Creo. \"Anyway, if Rana starts trouble again, feel free to call me. Come on (name). Let's go get settled in into our room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Sure thing Creo,\" you replied as the two of you left the room and entered into your own room.</span></div></div>",

For a minute, nothing, they didn't want to talk about what happened, but something was on their mind. Both of their actually, unknown to the other. Kazuya spoke first, \"Um. Satellizer?\", he asked very shyly. Normally he is fine with her but the subject he had on his mind made him feel nervous. \"Yes?\", she replied wondering what he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\", they sat together on Satellizer's bed. Their hands interlocked each other signifying their close relationship. \"What is wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing is. In fact its been the best. But Satellizer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Em hmm?\", she said slightly tightening her grip to try and coax him into speaking calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been thinking of performing the Baptism with you.\", he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer gasped, her mind rejected the thought as soon as she realized. But upon further reflection, she quickly gave it more thought. Kazuya has been there for her from the start. They've been closer than ever. Her feelings are present as night and day, and vice versa. Sure Rana bothers them but these two were partners first, and their connection has started evolving. With the way Creo and (Name) act so intimately without any worry, the idea seems more natural now by comparison. \"Do you want us? To do it here and now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't planning on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never said I agreed. But if I were to think about it, I would say yes. I care about you Kazuya-kun.\", she said hugging him, with the young lad returning it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not tonight but, maybe we can think of planning to, I feel like were at that point, and um I care about you where I trust you that much.\", Kazuya explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel the same, but I don't think I am ready for it. Even though you have showed great patience with me, I can't feel safe about it since.\", she cut herself off as if she starred into space for a split second. Kazuya nodded understanding her reason to wait, but his droll sign of disappointment reverted to joy as Satellizer gave Kazuya a big kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I didn't know how to end that conversation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine with me. Just, I feel happy we talked about it.\", Kazuya said relived. </span></div></div>",

I wanted to talk to you as soon as I had some free time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talk to me? For what? You have some business with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say that. You see I need your help with something. It's something that only you can do for me,\" explained Ohara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised a brow. \"Something that only I can do? Like what exactly?\" you asked with a hint of skepticism. \"If this is your way of asking me out on a date or something, you should now that I'm already taken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise you it's nothing like that,\" said Ohara. \"It has to do with the E-Pandora project. As you're well aware, the goal of this project is create Pandora at a faster pace without having to rely on natural compatibility. And so tomorrow morning, there will be some mock battles between the E-Pandora and the natural Pandora.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's this have to do with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me if this sounds a bit outlandish,\" said Ohara. \"But I want you to take part in one of the mock battles tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instinctively flinched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I know it sounds crazy,\" said Ohara. \"But I need you to participate in one of the mock battles that will be taking place. The purpose is to not only test the strength of the E-Pandora, but it's also for getting the necessary data needed for the project.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why do you need me to take part of this?\" you asked your skepticism showing more in your voice. \"Need I remind you that I'm a limiter not a Pandora.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOhara turned around and walked to the window looking out into the endless night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That may so, but I've heard stories that tell me otherwise,\" she said. \"Stories about you going toe to toe with Pandora and living to tell the tale. Not to mention you were in the recent Nova clash and you're well known for a certain incident that gave you the title The Imperfect Limiter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened at that. You then for the first time, you gave Scarlet a hardened glare piercing right at her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen lady. I don't care if you're the head of the project or anything like that, but you better watch yourself before you start pissing me off.\" you growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now. Take it easy,\" said Ohara not even turning around. \"I have no intention of starting a fight with you. I'm sorry if I touched a sensitive subject. I only came here to ask you for help. I just want you to take part in a mock battle tomorrow that's it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I don't want to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOhara then turned around and looked at you. Her eyes looked as if she was challenging you daring you to say no. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid that that isn't an option,\" she said. \"It's not just me who wants this to happen. The people in charge told me to ask you this specifically.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And let me guess; if I refuse to comply I'll arrested or some other bad crap like that correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You catch on pretty quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought so,\" you deadpanned. \"Damn it all. I hate dealing with these bastards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you mean, but look at it this way,\" said Ohara. \"Think of this as an opportunity. An opportunity to show everyone that limiters have the power to fight too. If things go well, there might be a project in place for limiters like you to become Pandora.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't go that far,\" you deadpanned. \"Anyway the mock battles are taking place tomorrow correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then... even though I don't like it, but I'll be there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then in that case, I'll see you tomorrow then,\" said Ohara. \"I'm looking forward to seeing what you got. Good night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Ohara walked away leaving you standing in the hallway by yourself. You couldn't help but let out an annoyed sigh. Then you went back into your room and went over to the bed. Creo was already fast asleep. Seeing her sleep like this made you think how cute she is. You got into bed and brushed aside a stray bang on her forehead. You then remembered what Chiffon and Creo told you before you arrived here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry guys. I guess I won't be able to lie low after all.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day, everyone was gathered in what appeared to a coliseum the original Pandora seating in the upper stands with their limiters. The goal was that the original Pandora would fight the E Pandora to gather data based on their battle and then Scarlet would then use that data to improve the E Pandora so they could be strong as their original counterparts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo, Satellizer, Kazuya, Rana, and Cassie all stood close together as they waited for the mock battles to start. As they waited Kazuya noticed that a certain someone was missing in their group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys. Has anyone seen (name) anywhere?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He told me that he had some business to take care of,\" said Creo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of business?\" asked Satellizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Creo shrugging her shoulders. \"He just told me go on ahead without him and that he would join us a little later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what kind of business he would have?\" pondered Rana. \"Maybe with something important?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows,\" said Cassie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was a loud buzzer and a female's voice spoke on the loudspeaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention please. The mock battles between the original Pandora and Evolution Pandora will now begin. First match contestants please approach the ring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut from the sides of the ring, two girls stepped forward and walked to the center. One girl wore the original Pandora uniform and had wavy brown brown that went to her shoulders curled upwards. The other was dark skinned with long black hair and wore a different battle suit entirely which comprised of a blue and white high cut tank top with blue compression arm sleeves as well has stockings and bottoms like a bikini's and over the heel combat shoes. She was also carrying a pair of circular bladed weapons called chakrams,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first match will now begin. Original Pandora from Genetics Britain, Anna Parker, versus Evolution Pandora, Rattle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the upper level cheered eager for the fights to get under way. Even Scarlet Ohara and her researchers were waiting in anticipation to get started with their jobs. Then the buzzer sounded again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Begin Battle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sound of the buzzer and the woman's voice, Anna raised her hands got ready to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Volt Weapon Deploy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt her command, two medium sized swords materialized from her hands and she took her stance. Upon seeing them, Rattle backed away from her gaining some distance from her. She then made the first move and attacked swinging her chakrams. Anna however blocked and dodged all of her attacks with ease. Rattle attacked again and again, but she couldn't get any hits in. Their weapons clashed and then broke away being pushed back. She panted looking to be winded from the fight already. Then with a determined grunt, she disappeared in a blinding flash of blue light as she circled around Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did she...\" Cassie gasped a little surprised from what she was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what do you know? I guess she can use Acceleration after all,\" said Roxanne. \"But she'll have to be faster that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna stood there not moving as Rattle dashed around her in her Acceleration. Then Anna dispersed her Volt Weapons, turned around and punched the air behind her. Her fist connected on Rattle who reappeared. The force of her punch sent her flying backwards until she hit the ground crumpled in a heap. She tried to get back up, but she couldn't. The first round was now over.<br>\r\nton<br>\r\n\"Match end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen shortly after that two more girls entered. A Pandora with a black ponytail and an E Pandora with short brown hair holding a pair of medium sized tonfas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you noticed that they can't use volt weapons?\" asked Rana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that they can't produce them,\" said Creo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Second Match,\" said the female voice. \"Original Pandora from Genetics Korea, Jung Ara, versus Evolution Pandora, Marline Shinko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Volt Weapon: Deploy!\" said Jung as a pair of gloves materialized on her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarline twirled her tonfas and took a fighting stance and Jung Ara took her stance as well. Then the two of them disappeared both of them using Acceleration. the twos afterimages flashing around the area. Maline then appeared from above and with a mighty yell swung her tonfas with the blades shining. Jung reappeared as well and intercepted the attack punched the blade causing the blade to break in two causing Marline's eyes to widen in shock. Before she had a chance to react, Jung gave a fast and powerful kick to her jaw sending her to the ground and then pounced on the girl getting in close and bringing her fist down to deliver the finishing blow. However her fist stopped just inches away from Marline's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Match end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet Ohara frowned in disappointment as she watched Marline rejoin the other E Pandora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that this might have been premature,\" said one of the aides next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't have any choice,\" replied Scarlet. \"The people in charge wanted a demonstration. For now, all the girls need to do is to continue performing to the best of their abilities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the fighting area from the E Pandora's side another girl stepped up. It was the same girl that was with the group of E Pandora from last night.</span></div></div>",

However her opponent came as a shock when it did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Third Match,\" said the female voice again. \"Evolution Pandora, Jina Purpleton ver....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female on the loudspeaker trailed off upon seeing Jina's opponent. Out from the shadows a lone figure walked his way to the center. He was a boy that wore a pair of gray shorts and a black tank top that had the logo of Gentics on it with a pair of silver gloves. As he walked to the center of the arena he stared at Jina with a neutral expression. The stands then erupted with whispers and talking from both Limiter and Pandora. Even Chiffon was in a state of shock. The woman on the loudspeaker then regained her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evolution Pandora, Jina Purpleton versus Japan's West Genetics, (name).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(NAME)?!?!\" cried Creo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!

This is most certainly a surprise,\" said Rana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this just took a turn for the crazy,\" said Roxanne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kidding,\" said Charles. \"I'm certainly am surprised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is this?\" asked Jina with anger in her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here to fight you,\" you said as you cracked your knuckles. \"Simple as that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? Fight with you?\" asked Jina narrowing her eyes. \"Why would they send a boy like you to fight me? Is this some kind of joke?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't ask me. You should asking the good doctor over there,\" you replied pointing at Scarlet Ohara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Dr Ohara put you up for this?\" asked Jina incredulously with anger as she turned towards her. \"This is true Dr. Ohara?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true,\" said Ohara. \"I specifically asked for this boy to fight you so that we may get the necessary data from your fight. You will fight him Jina. Remember what I said, do your best but don't hold back on his account just because he's a boy. Fight him with everything you got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see? You heard the lady,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With all due respect Doctor, I would strongly suggest that this boy back out from this fight,\" said Jina. \"If he goes through with it, I won't be responsible for what happens to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but feel a little insulted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen. Jina right? If you're concerned about my well being, then I would suggest you stop,\" you said. \"This isn't my first rodeo when it comes to fighting a Pandora. Besides, underestimating an opponent before the fight has even started can result straight to your downfall. Every Pandora should know this for a fact even a rookie like yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me? A rookie?!\" exclaimed Jina. \"Just what the hell do you know about being a Pandora? You're nothing but a limiter! You've got no chance of beating me. Well unless you can deploy a freezing field, but that hardly seems fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you clearly felt insulted. You clenched your fists, but you kept your cool. \"All right. Then how about I make things a little more interesting?\" you said. \"Since you seem to think that I need a freezing a field to beat you, I won't use my freezing field. Sound good? I do want to be fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the arena started to murmur even more now. Especially the E Pandora. Jina then smirked cockily as she pointed her staff at you taking a stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine by me,\" she said. \"I'll wipe that cocky smirk right off your face when I beat you. Don't come crying to me when I beat the snot out of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same to you,\" you said as you took a stance of your own earning a dirty look from Jina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Everyone else in the stands watched in anticipation as the countdown started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5... 4... 3... 2... 1...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Begin Battle.\"</span></div></div>",

She swung it around elegantly aiming for your side, but you jumped back with ease dodging the blow. Jina then rushed forward jumped up and brought down her staff making you cross your arms blocking the blow. The blow made your forearms hurt, but not to much. You then pushed Jina back causing her to backpedal a few steps. You then came at her with your fists raised and then threw some quick punches toward her aiming for her face, but Jina dodged them as well. Both of you came at each other trading blow after blow and blocking them too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Jina! You can do it!\" called Rattle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!

I've had it with you!\" she growled. \"I'll end this with a single blow!\" And then she suddenly disappeared in bright blue light as she used Acceleration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man... am I the only one who's disappointed here?\" asked Roxanne yawning a little. \"This fight's getting to be a bit boring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That may be so, but this fight is gonna be over an instant now,\" said Charles. \"That boy doesn't stand a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJina continued to zip all around you as she used her Acceleration with afterimages of her appearing now and again. Rather than do anything, you lowered your fists, closed your eyes, and stood there motionless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is doing just standing there?\" thought Cassie worriedly. \"If he doesn't do something, he's gonna get hurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Jina appeared right behind you from above bring her staff over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're done!\" she yelled as she brought her staff down with all of her strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued to stand there motionless until at the last second you calmly brought your hand up and caught Jina's staff with it making Jina's eyes widen in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell...\" she murmured. \"How did you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but your Acceleration was totally predictable,\" you said. \"Even a five year old could probably see that coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then pulled her staff making Jina come toward you and then you connected with your fist right on her cheek sending Jina crumbling to the floor with her staff falling out of her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you say that you were gonna wipe the smirk off of my face?\" you asked. \"If that's all you got then I'm a little disappointed. Even though you're a rookie I was hoping that you were a little stronger than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh-shut your mouth!\" she snarled. \"I'm not done yet I'm not gonna be beaten by a lousy little boy like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then used Acceleration again dashing all around you once more. You sighed as you cracked your knuckles and crouched down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. I'm getting tired of this,\" you said as your eyes glinted. \"Sorry bout this, but I really don't feel like dragging this out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then started to glow in a bright blue light and then you disappeared in a bright blue light using Acceleration as well. Everyone in the crowd was completely silent gaping in shock for what had just happened. Even third years were shocked for what they were just witnessing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! It can't be!\" cried Cassie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I seeing things right now?!\" cried Charles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not, but I believe it either,\" said Roxanne clearly baffled. \"That kid's using Acceleration!\" Her look of surprise then changed to big wide grin. \"Interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jina zipped around in your Accelerations until you went on the attack by giving Jina a powerful punch in her gut causing her to gasp in pain. Then you attacked again giving her a powerful kick to the chin sending her flying and sprawling to the ground once again. Jina then got to her feet  thin line of blood trickling from her mouth, but her eyes were wide in shock from what had just happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You.... you can accelerate!?!?\" she cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not all I can do!\" you said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took advantage of her shock by using Acceleration, but this time you were faster than before dashing around the area in a mass of Acceleration turns causing small purple ripples to appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Double Acceleration?!\" gasped Cassie. \"He can use that too?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on. Even I can do that,\" said Roxanne<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That may be, but this boy can use the technique flawlessly and he's not even a Pandora,\" said Charles. \"Just what the hell is that guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had no idea that (name) can use that,\" said Kazuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither did I,\" said Satellizer. \"I knew he was stronger when he came back from training, but I never imagined this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreo didn't respond, but her eyes never left you as you continued to fight. As you continued double accelerating, you reappeared in front of Jina and gave her a right cross, a left straight, and a punch to her stomach sending her skidding along the floor. She remained standing, but she was feeling dazed from the attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for the finish,\" you thought as you dashed straight toward her. As you did you split yourself into two and the two of you landed a powerful blow right to her face once more with more tremendous force. Then your selves merged back into one as you stood behind Jina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't take it personally,\" you said as you straightened up. \"But you're way to weak to take me on rookie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJina didn't answer. She fell down to the floor face down knocked out cold and defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Match end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe match having been declared over, you turned around and walked away out of the arena. As you did, you heard Jina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How... how can someone like you have those abilities...\" she groaned. \"What.... the hell are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then stopped and then looked back. \"I'm just a simple limiter who knows how to fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then walked away leaving Jina in the care of her E Pandora comrades.</span></div></div>",

I just want to go back to Creo soon as I'm out of here, that's all.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"(Name) I'm in favor of that idea, but that was some very intense skill. Maybe working with somebody other than Creo is a better idea. I mean nobody really knows whats going on with you. So learning it from more than one point of view is something you need to keep consistent.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"No. I just need Creo to do it. Then I'll be fine.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Isuzu is also there, and Rana, and Satellizer to name a few.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Kazuya I can't allow to work with others with something I'm not comfortable with.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"After a year, we aren't trustworthy?!\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"AHHHHHHGGGGGGHHHHHH!\", you screamed in sheer frustration to the point you slammed your fist in the wall. The empowerment from the new pandora-esque abilities kept your hand from being damaged. You took a second to realize what you did. \"Sorry. I'm.... scared. Like before I met Creo. Sigh... I'll stick with my group. For now at least.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Take a rest for the night. God knows you earned it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks buddy. Tell Creo I'll be in our room in a few.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nLater.... <br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou went to your room feeling refreshed from the shower you just had. No matter the mood, seeing Creo the way she was could switch your mood from pissed to zen in a blink of an eye. \"Hey, you did great today.\", Creo hugged you as you sat on your bed, she was wearing the bare essentials to her modesty. Her arms circulating around your chest wrapped your heart with relief. \"You know I will always be there for you right?\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I know. Seeing you reminds me you will be everyday.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I'm getting worried about you. This is something we are going in blind on.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I'm worried about me too. I'm getting more nervous the further we see I'm acting like a pandora. If they can isolate this condition. I could be a super soldier. Operating offensive and defensive. Corporate scum like Margret will love this.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Want to talk more about it?\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Not tonight hun. I've had my fill. Besides, I do not want to distract from the work your doing.\", you laid back with Creo next to you wrapped around you like an over-sized prize at a fair. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Want to cuddle for a while?\", Creo suggested wanting to lighten the mood.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Not feeling frisky?\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I have too much floating around in my own mind. Of course that comes next, but I need to be in the mood.\", she teased. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Movie?\", you asked.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Action.\", instant reply from her. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Your turn on top?\", you questioned again. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"My turn this time. Need to make sure I keep you in line, prevent you from doing something stupid.\", she smiled tracing her finger over your mouth.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am.\", you smiled. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I Love you.\", all you had left to say. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Love you too.\"</span></div></div>",

Satellizer, and Kazuya have all gathered in Sister Margaret's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you all for coming on such short notice,\" said Sister Margaret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save the pleasantries,\" you said. \"Why did you call us out here anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! (name) don't be rude,\" shushed Creo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine Ms. Brand,\" said Sister Margaret. \"I'm used to (name)'s banter by now. Anyway, I've called you all here because I have news. As I'm sure that you're all aware, the nova have been attacking more frequently. Due to these attacks, the numbers of Pandora have been dwindling. And so... the Chevalier have decided to start a project to help increase these numbers. This project... is known as The E-Pandora project.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The E-Pandora project?\" pondered Satellizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I don't know too much about it, but I do know that the leader of the project, a woman named Dr. Scarlett Ohara is summoning all of the highest ranking Pandora to Alaska to help with the project. That's the reason why I called you all here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To take part of this E-Pandora project?\" asked Rana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct,\" said Sister Margaret. \"You will all take a chopper tomorrow morning enroute to Alaska and will report there straight away. Any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one answered, but then you raised your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one,\" you said. \"Why us? I mean I don't doubt our skills or anything, but wouldn't some third years be more adequate? I mean like Chiffon or Elizabeth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A good question,\" said Sister Margaret. \"The answer is this. Satellizer, Rana, and Creo are all exceptional Pandora while you and Mr. Aoi are exceptional limiters. It's only natural that I would select you five to take part unless you would think otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... I guess not,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on (name). Don't be such a downer,\" said Rana. \"Besides it could be fun. We'd get to meet Pandora from the other parts of the globe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'll give you this much Rana, you sure are optimistic,\" said Kazuya. \"I must admit it does sound interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say about it Satellizer?\" asked Creo turning to her. \"Do you have any objections?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I suppose not,\" said Satellizer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I suppose you all accept then?\" asked Sister Margaret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone nodded and Sister Margaret smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then,\" said Sister Margaret. \"Make sure you're all ready by tomorrow. Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. You're all dismissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that all of you left Sister Margaret's office. As soon as you were far enough, you let out an exasperated sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez. Leave it to Ms. queen bee to give us another random task,\" you said. \"What a pain in the butt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you really shouldn't talk to and about Sister Margaret that way,\" said Kazuya. \"One of these days it's gonna come back to bite you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's right (name),\" said Creo. \"You really need to be a nicer to Sister Margaret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah... who cares?\" you scoffed. \"Besides she ticks me off every single time I look at her. I could care less how she feel...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Creo pinched your cheek hard and pulled it also snapping it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owowowow!!!! Creo! That hurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't have you talk about Sister Margaret like that,\" said Creo sternly. \"I know that you don't like her, but you need to learn to keep your trap shut if you got nothing nice to say to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But babe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts.If you do that again, I'll do a lot more than just pinch you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. OK. Geez.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" smiled Creo as she kissed you on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two definitely look like a married couple,\" said Rana. \"It's almost adorable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't go that far,\" you said. \"Anyway, I guess we all better prepare to go then. Alaska's gonna be pretty cold so let's pack warmly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Let us pack up and get ready to go!\" said Rana as she dashed away in very high spirits for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\" you murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up with Rana?\" asked Creo. \"She seems pretty amped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Kazuya. \"Do you Satellizer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatellizer shook her head in response. \"I have no idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, we'll see you guys tomorrow,\" you said. \"See you then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the five of you separated to get ready for your trip to Alaska.</span></div></div>",

You were quite enjoying this day, it had gone pretty well as your days went. You had been off from school on vacation, and spent pretty much all day relaxing and wishing that you didn't have to go right back to school tomorrow. Days like today, allowing yourself to casually lay in the warm beach sun with the surf at your feet as the sun slowly set into the distance, were not only nearly impossible to come by, but also your favorite moments in life. The only thing you wished you had more was someone to share them with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Ah... I wish this day would never end.\" You said, sighing as your head hit the beach. You'd have to bother cleaning the sand out of it later, but what did you care. Right now, you didn't think it would matter if the sand actually swallowed you up. On the bright side then, no more homework at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     But even as you thought about how perfect the day was, something happened that had a certain potential to make it even better. Off in front of you, further into the water, you saw something. It was a black circle, seeming to radiate waves of blackness off of it. Whatever the hell it was, it looked evil, and yet... inviting? You didn't know how it could look inviting, but that was the only way you could think to describe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"What the hell...\" You said to yourself, as you peered at the oddity. Not knowing entirely what you were doing, you slowly stood up, brushing sand off your back as you took a testing step into the water in front of you. You walked as though you were in a dream, not knowing entirely what you were doing. On one hand, you were going at an unknown object that had the potential to do just about anything to you. But... on the other hand, it wasn't like you had much to lose. You weren't particularly happy with your life as it was, and thinking about going back to school tomorrow was even more likely to make you leap headfirst into the circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     It was just then you realized what you had done. You were knee-deep in water, staring at this black circle. You thought you could almost see something through the other side, but it was hazy and you couldn't make out anything important. You could see, though, that the circle was beginning to shrink. You had to decide, and fast, what the hell you were going to do. And to you, the choice was pretty clear. School, or unknown and potentially deadly fate? Definitely the potentially fatal. Better to die quickly than die slowly from boredom. Without knowing what you were getting yourself into, you put first an arm, and then seeing that it wasn't harmed, the rest of your body through the portal.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     When you finally regained your senses, you found yourself in a room that looked to be made entirely of white. There was nothing in the room that wasn't white - in fact, there was even a plant, or plant sculpture, painted white in the corner of the room. As you slowly rubbed your head, you tried to figure out what had happened to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The last thing you remembered was seeing a circle of... dark energy at the beach. The only explanation for it was some kind of portal - what else could've appeared so suddenly and mysteriously at your innocent town? So, without really thinking anything through, you had then thrown yourself through the portal, and promptly passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Which left you... where? Here? And where exactly was here? How the hell did you managed to find a portal to here, and why the hell did a place like here, with a portal that shouldn't exist leading here, exist here? And why couldn't you stop saying here?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You were just calm enough to realize that you were having a mild panic attack, and sat down in the white couch in a corner of the room. Panting heavily, but trying to force yourself to slow down your breathing, you felt yourself sink into the rather comfortable cloth and padding. \"Where... where am I...\" You said to yourself again, this time out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Just as your heart rate finally began to slow down, you realized that you could hear something. Voices. Or rather, just one voice. \"...mission? I mean, that's four in the last three days. I thought getting assigned to this stupid castle meant that I wouldn't have to deal being sent off on missions every damn day. Talk about a waste of my time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You couldn't tell where they were, mostly because you were still too disoriented with the new surroundings to tell where the sound came from, but you could tell a few things. From the words, the person was likely alone and talking to herself, and from the sound of the voice it was a woman. Pretty young, from the sound of it. And also from the sound... headed your way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I mean, first they ship me away from home base just when those new guys were starting to get useful, and then they send me to this deserted, boring, useless... castle...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As the voice came closer, the figure the voice belonged to finally came into view, and you had to say, it was quite a view. A woman with blonde hair, two strands spiked up over her head with the rest hanging down just above shoulder level. She had a great figure, too, but you didn't get to notice much more, as you were busy staring at her, while she stared at you. The awkward silence went on for a good six or seven seconds before she finally spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Who are you, and what the hell are you doing in my room?\" She said, staring at you with a blank expression on her face. Better than anger, at least.</span></div></div>",

You don't belong here, and that's good enough for me.\" She said, shrugging as she pulled a knife out of her robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Err... what are you going to do with that...\" You stuttered, as you stumbled backwards and fell OVER the couch you had been sitting on, just as she began to laugh and twirl the knife on her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well, why don't you pretend you're me and get creative?\" She said, smirking quite a bit as she slowly moved closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Because I don't enjoy picturing myself in more than one piece?\" You said, flipping the couch back upright behind you and backing yourself up against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The woman just laughed at you. \"You're lucky. You've got a sense of humor, and I actually have a mission I'm supposed to be leaving for right now. That Keyblade master's starting to get annoying, and now I have to give him a new set of cards? Please, like I don't have better things to do than that...\" She said, then sighed and gestured, forming a black portal between the two of you like the one you had just arrived through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Now, don't go anywhere. If I find out you left while I was away, I just might have to get REALLY creative with the knives.\" She said, laughing one last time as she walked through the dark portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Meanwhile, you were too completely shocked to even begin comprehending what she had just said to you. As you thought about it, you couldn't believe you hadn't realized it earlier - you were in Kingdom Hearts! You didn't actually know how you had gotten there, but you knew without a doubt that the woman you just ran into was Larxene. And she was just as cold in here as she was in the games. This was unbelievable! You would get a chance to  meet Sora, and Kairi, and Namine if you were lucky!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     But... you were kind of trapped in a room with a homicidal maniac likely to be back in a few minutes.

Scared as you were of her imminent return, you were even more scared of what she might do to you if you disobeyed her and attempted to leave the room. And besides that, assuming that you were on the top floor of Castle Oblivion, Sora was only on the sixth floor... seventh? You couldn't remember nearly as much as you wanted to about Chain of Memories. Anyway, that meant there were about six levels between you and Sora - levels filled with Heartless, other Nobodies, and other horrors you didn't care to imagine. You might even run into the other members of the Organization before you could meet up with Sora and be saved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     So, with not much else to do, you lounged against the couch again and let yourself slowly slip into a half-conscious state. For some reason, you were unbelievably tired; maybe inter-dimensional travel was a lot more tiring than you thought. You almost couldn't stop yourself as you slowly drifted off through the folds of your mind into the unknown land of dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You didn't know how long you slept, but you knew one thing, and that was the reason why you woke up. There was a stabbing pain in your back...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"STABBING?!\" You half yelled, half mumbled as you jumped off of the couch, coming to the ground only a foot or two away, barely keeping yourself from smacking your face on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Aww, and things were just getting fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Looking up, you saw Larxene holding a knife at the place where you had been just moments before. It didn't look bloody, but you still placed a hand on your back to check for any wounds that might have been inflicted, but your hand came back dry, and no huge stains of red either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"What were you trying to do to me?!\" You asked, somehow still surprised by the fact that she had chosen to poke you in the back with one of her knives rather than, oh say, wake you up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I was just gonna have a little fun. I wanted to see if I could draw blood before you woke up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Your mouth dropped a little bit and you stared at her before you managed a response to that. \"What in the hell is wrong with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Not even offended by your question, she just shrugged and kicked back on the now empty couch. \"I'm a nobody. You can't really expect me to feel any sympathy for you, especially when you invaded my room like this without an invitation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     She did have a point. After all, you were trespassing in her territory, and you didn't even have a really good excuse for being there. 'I saw a portal, so I went through.' probably wouldn't hold up in a legal court, much less to an evil supervillain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well... maybe next time you could wake me up... without the sharp pointy objects?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"But that takes all the fun out of it.\" Larxene said, and you could swear she almost had a small tone of pouting in her voice, like a little kid being told not to wander around in a toy store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well, I suppose I could always turn you in to the bosses...\" Larxene said, almost immediately over her little childish episode and obviously thinking to herself. As she did, thoughts ran through your head of all the things that the OTHER members of the organization had - and would - do, you were even more afraid of what might happen to you with them than you were of what Larxene herself might do to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Uh... please don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"And why shouldn't I? For uncovering an intruder who might have valuable information, Xemnas might even give me a promotion if you know something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I don't know anything, you have to believe me. I don't even know how I got here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As if the thought was just occurring to her, Larxene swiveled on her heel to look at you. \"How exactly DID you come to arrive in this castle, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You thought on your feet, but considering where she was from, this might actually be surprisingly easy to explain. \"Well... I was standing on a beach out by my house, and all of a sudden this big black portal opened up in front of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"So... you just decided to enter the mysterious black portal that could've led to anywhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well... yeah. It was a lot better than just sitting around being normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Larxene looked thoughtful at that, though exactly what she was thinking you couldn't guess at. \"Well, I guess that sort of makes sense. Although, I have to give you credit kid, not a lot of people would have the guts to do something like that. The portal though... seems a bit weird for one to open up around you like that. I mean, normally that requires an organization member. So either you've got a bit of nobody in you, or someone else opened that portal for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You had to admit, it made sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"But, that still leaves the question of what to do with you... Wait! I think I have the PERFECT idea for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Whatever it was, you most certainly did NOT like the sound of it.</span></div></div>",

Things work differently in this castle than you think. Poor Sora down there will be trapped in his own memories right about now, wandering through the trappings of his mind. To him, it will probably only seem like a couple hours in each world, but to everyone else he might spend a day or two, maybe even more, in each world. It's one of the reasons we chose this castle, combining it with the cards allows us to draw him deeper in, floor by floor, giving us plenty of time to prepare. And because of the magic of the cards he won't rot or starve to death while he wanders aimlessly in his memories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Impressive. Even if you were supposed to be rooting for Sora, you had to admit that the members of the Organization were very, very prepared. In fact, you realized that there were probably even more levels to their planning that you never got to see in the games. This was, without a doubt, one of the coolest - if scariest - moments of your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Larxene seemed to interpret your silence in a different way than being impressed, though. \"Oh, right, I suppose if you're going to be staying here as my slave for a while then I should explain to you what's going on. But don't be surprised if you still don't understand anything - I can't give away the details of our little Organization here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You nodded your head, realizing that it would be good for her to explain things to you like this willingly - that way, hopefully, she would never have to find out how you knew so much about her world. \"Yeah, I think it would be nice to know more about this new world, and - WAIT, WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well, I'm saying now that you need to keep your voice down. We've got thick walls here at Castle Oblivion, but if you keep yelling like that you're just asking for Axel or, god forbid, Marluxia, to drop by and find out about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     In a quieter voice, you maintained your shock and outrage. \"But you just said I would be your slave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well, yeah. What, did you think you would be my guest or something? If I'm gonna be taking care of your room and board, then you are going to be earning your keep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"And what if I don't want to be your slave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Larxene purposefully twirled one of the knives she had in her right hand, probably the same one she had just stabbed you with while you slept. \"Well, I suppose I could think up something a little more creative for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"...God damnit, fine, I'll be your slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Good, I've got you for about two weeks then, at least until the keyblade master finishes sifting through his own memories. First things first though, you need to at least understand what I'm constantly going to be yelling at you for when it goes wrong...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Oh, lucky me.\" You said, sighing as you started to regret coming through that portal already.</span></div></div>",

And to top it off, this was a little less than one day into what Larxene had said would be about a two week stay with her. And to make things even worse than THAT...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in a butler outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you had no idea where Larxene got the outfit - and you sure as hell weren't stupid enough to ask her where with the mood she had been in later that day - but it made things about three times as humiliating as they should have been. Of course, that was undoubtedly the entire reason she made you wear it, but that was another story. This was, to put it mildly, utter bullshit. But, again, you weren't quite stupid enough to tell HER that. The thought of spitting in one of the drinks she made you bring to her did occur to you, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, something unexpected happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. It's like I was yelling about before. Keep my rants straight or I'll have to hurt you! Now, I have to go on a mission to another world. I still can't believe they're gonna make me babysit the Keyblade Master and still go on missions... anyway. While I'm gone you are not to enter my room, leave the suite, and definitely not touch any of my knives, as usual, but I also don't want you trying to contact any of the other Organization members. No funny ideas about escaping, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. No problem there; at least Larxene took less joy out of killing than she did just hurting. You doubted the other members of the Organization would've left you alive this long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I should be back in a few hours. Until then you can steal anything from the refrigerator or just sleep on the couch again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she turned around and walked into a newly formed dark portal, which promptly sealed itself behind her. You sighed with relief as you collapsed onto the couch. You weren't particularly tired, but your nerves had been on edge for the last couple of hours - ever since she decided to play a game of dodgeball with knives after you failed to bring her something to drink in under ten seconds. You had some hairs on top of your head that would never be quite the same again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite all that, you had an idea, and a crazy one at that. Even though you had obeyed her without question until now, perhaps it was time to change that... for some reason, Larxene didn't want you in her room. The whole place looked undecorated and inhospitable, so you had no ideas what she wouldn't want you to see. Although, now that you thought about it, back in 358/2 Days, Roxas was told to keep a diary...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat settled it. You were going into Larxene's room, and you were going to spy on her diary. Who knew, maybe you could even find out what she had planned for you.</span></div></div>",

In this house, why the hell wouldn't it be? She seemed to overreact to almost anything and everything that went wrong. Either way, you had made up your mind, and there was no going back now anyway. With conviction and fear both fighting for dominance, you pushed down on the handle and opened the door before you could have a change of heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Looking around, you saw that the room was much like you had pictured it. There was a white bed in one corner, with a plain white dresser next to it, and a white shelf on the other side of the room. Jeez, the Organization really needed to hire a decorator to put some color into their rooms. But what was more important was that you saw a notebook sitting on her headboard, and you had few doubts - that had to be her diary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     With a mischievous smile on your face, you tiptoed into the room and grabbed the book as quickly as you could. Flipping through the pages, you didn't even read it much, instead looking at the dates until you found the latest entry, and to your surprise it had been just from the night before - the night after you arrived. That HAD to have something interesting in it. You pressed on and read as fast as your eyes could go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Today was boring, as usual. Xemnas and Marluxia are being so mean. How am I supposed to stay in my room and be lazy if I have to take care of their little puppet Keyblade Master and do missions for the Organization at the same time? Oh well. On the bright side, some stupid kid found his way into my room today through a portal. I dunno how one got there, but at least I have something to keep me entertained. It's been a little-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You noticed something here - the word lonely had been written, but then it had two lines through it and underneath it the replacement word \"boring\" had been put in. You didn't think too much, just kept reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"-boring around here lately. Maybe I can get this kid to give me some fun times while I'm waiting to RTMC (Return To Main Castle, I made that up!). If he doesn't try anything stupid, I might even send him home after we're done here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Well, that was just fantastic. Especially since you were doing something stupid right then. Carefully, you put the diary back in as close to a normal position as you could and retraced your steps out of the room. You immediately ran back to the kitchen, grabbed the coldest drink you could find, and then collapsed onto the couch. You were glad that she might let you go, scared that she might discover what you did, and above the other two emotions you were very confused. Why would Larxene have written lonely, and then crossed it out? Nobodies didn't have emotions - that was something they had emphasized throughout the games. But, some of them did seem to show emotion on occasion; was it possible Larxene actually got lonely when she wasn't around the whole Organization?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Sipping on the soda, you just shook your head absently. There was very little for you to do now. It wasn't like Larxene had a Playstation for you to use; nothing to do now but rest your tensed nerves and sore muscles for a bit. You tried your best to sleep with one eye open, though. No telling what sharp instrument might be poking into your spine the next time you woke up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     You did end up falling asleep rather quickly, despite your nervousness at the situation, but when you awoke it was not because of a stabbing pain in your back. You didn't know how long it had been, but you actually got a decent sleep in - you woke up on your own, in other words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Looking around, you were mildly disappointed to see that yet again you had woken up in the castle. Some part of you was still hoping that all of this was some terrible nightmare that you might wake up from at any moment, but with every day your hopes grew fainter, and were now almost gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Before you could sink totally into depression you heard a sudden \"fwoom\" sound and a black portal appeared in front of you, and mere seconds later Larxene popped in as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Ugh, what a pain...\" She said, brushing her back behind her head and into position again, then looking at the couch. She had an evil look, but that faded as soon as she saw you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Oh, you're awake...\" Was she... disappointed?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yeah, I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well, I'm taking over the couch, so move it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You brushed some sleep out of your eyes and climbed off of the cushy seats as Larxene plopped down on it. You had an idea about that, though, especially with her in such a bad mood. Standing around and doing what she told you didn't seem to stop the pain, so why not take the initiative? Hell, if you did a really good job then she might let you go. You had no reason to disbelieve her diary, after all - why would she lie in something that nobody else was supposed to read?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     So, walking around behind the couch, you reached down and started massaging Larxene's shoulders gently. She jerked at your first touch, but as soon as you started massaging she relaxed slightly, not preparing to punch you in the face like she probably had been before. She still felt tense though, and even though some of it was probably from her mission you could tell this was something she hadn't been expecting. She had been so surprised that it took her almost a minute to come up with a witty comment on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Sucking up to me, eh? I don't know whether you're trying to hit on me or just trying not to get stabbed again, but you're not completely incompetent at this. Tell you what, you just keep doing that and we'll see about the not-stabbing part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     'Yeah, that sounds great.' You thought, but kept silent as you continued to massage her shoulder muscles. She eventually relaxed completely and - to a certain extent - even let her guard down. You wondered how someone like her could ever let her guard down with a stranger nearby, but when you looked closer you realized why. She had actually fallen asleep while you were doing your little massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Well, you couldn't blame her. Even though you had no sense of time in this place, since there were no windows or clocks to judge time by, she had just gotten back from a mission and was probably exhausted. The important thing was that you had managed to buy yourself at least a few hours of time without the imminent danger of having a knife in some part of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You began to walk to the room on the other side of the house to not wake her up, but as you did so you heard her moan and sigh, and the sound of her falling over. \"Well, that did it.\" You said, sighing as you turned around. But to your surprise, she hadn't woken up, and instead was laying across the couch as you had been only minutes before. She was also crossing her arms over her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Looking at her closely, you even saw that she was shivering slightly. She had probably been shipped out to somewhere cold, and it would take her awhile to warm back up. Nothing to do with you, but somehow you couldn't leave in good conscience. Sighing, you walked over to her closet and opened it. Extra pairs of your butler outfit were there, and then  above them were blankets. You weren't supposed to touch anything but your outfits, but somehow you thought she would make an exception this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You grabbed one of the blankets and flapped it out in the air, then went back into the living room. Larxene was still sleeping on the couch, and shivering every so slightly. Now that she had fallen asleep she couldn't hide her uncomfortable temperature. You gently laid the blanket over her, and almost immediately she grabbed onto it in her sleep, wrapping it tightly over her body and curling up into a small ball on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You smiled in spite of yourself. When she was asleep she could almost pass for a non-homicidal human being. Now that she was better taken care of, you could go into the other room without feeling so guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     And once you were in the other room, you could go without feeling so terrified. ...Even asleep, you had to admit she still scared the crap out of you.</span></div></div>",

Larxene was certainly proving to be a bit deeper than the psycho you had originally thought she was; she put on the facade of pretending that she wasn't even cold when she was obviously half-frozen, and she seemed genuinely thankful - in her own way - for your little massage treatment. But she was still pretty violent, and those knives of hers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Speaking of which, as you rested your hand on a desk next to the chair you were in you felt something cold. Looking over, you saw that Larxene had left one of her knives on the table. Picking it up, you absentmindedly twirled it in your hands. It was surprisingly light, and a test on your finger showed it to be unbelievably sharp as well. Definitely something to be afraid of in the hands of an expert, which she definitely was. With nothing else to really do around here besides eat and sleep you found yourself quickly engrossed with the blade, eventually flipping it between your fingers like a pro. You must have taken a while to master it, though, because when you next looked up from the blade you saw Larxene standing at the door, looking strangely at you and the knife. She looked surprised, but then she noticed you staring at her and her look turned to anger immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Just EXACTLY what did I say to you about touching my things, again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Sorry, I was... I just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     She reached over and slapped you on the side of the head, and her strength was pretty impressive. But not her typical style; last time you messed up, she'd just used you as a human target. This was much kinder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"You were just what? Not thinking, obviously. Give me that!\" She said as she grabbed the knife from you again, then slapped you upside the head again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Wait, what was that for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"That one was for messing with my laundry.\" With that, Larxene promptly walked out of the room, turning her back and heading into her bedroom; probably to get some real sleep instead of that uncomfortable couch. To your great surprise, however, there was no shriek of fury and indignation, which probably meant you had repositioned the diary well enough she didn't see a difference. You breathed a sigh of relief, and then headed back to the main room. You had just slept not that long ago, but you might as well entertain yourself until she woke up. Then it was back to your life of servitude.</span></div></div>",

And she was in one hell of a mood today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cI can\u2019t BELIEVE this! Double mission duty, after yesterday\u2019s mission?! I thought they were going to let me have a break for awhile!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Larxene was taking her frustration out on the couch, and you were glad to let her do so. At least it wasn\u2019t you. And, naturally, as soon as you thought that, she turned to you with an evil grin in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cHey, c\u2019mere!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You had little time, but managed to duck as a knife flew over your head and bounced off the wall behind you. You then hid around a corner as two more went right through the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cHey, it\u2019s no fun if you just hide!\u201d She yelled back, and for a second you heard footsteps leading towards you, but then she stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cOh well. I have to get going, anyway.\u201d Talking more to herself than you, she said that and then quickly turned around and formed a dark portal. You saw all this because you had peeked back around once the last two flew past you had cautiously peeked back around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     With her gone, and you still wide awake after your last sleep, you were yet again bored out of your mind. You sighed and walked to the kitchen, grabbing a soda and nursing it while you sat on the couch. You had to give one thing to the little episodes of knife dodging and servitude \u2013 at least they kept you entertained for a bit. When Larxene was gone, there was nothing to do but eat and sleep. Wait, hadn\u2019t you already thought of that a long time ago? Now your thoughts were even becoming repetitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cThat\u2019s all I do around here\u2026 eat, sleep, serve\u2026 read diary\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Hmm, now there was an interesting possibility. Although you had seen that she might let you go if you were good, and you didn\u2019t want to screw that up by getting caught with the diary, there was a lot to gain and only so much to lose. Hell, even if she did let you go she probably couldn\u2019t take you back to your world. And if you were stuck here you were probably as good as dead anyway. Okay, maybe not, but you needed to give yourself a pep talk. Whether it was for survival or not, peeking at her diary was just too fun for you to NOT do. Maybe it was because you never had a sister to spy on and use against her later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You quickly walked back towards her room, and then quickly opened and shut the door behind you. Fun or not, no sense taking chances with unnecessary delays. With that done, you turned and walked over to her bed, mentally memorizing the diary\u2019s new position on the headboard so that you could set it back perfectly. Then you picked it up quickly and opened to the latest entry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cHad this kid for about six days now.  The Keyblade master\u2019s getting close, but I still haven\u2019t decided whether to let him live or not. He really puzzled me today. First, when I got back from my mission today he actually gave me a massage \u2013 without me even asking! I had been thinking about ordering him to give me a foot massage, but the snow must have frozen my brain. He got me while I wasn\u2019t thinking. Won\u2019t happen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cAnd when I fell asleep \u2013 damn that massage was pretty good! \u2013 I guess the kid went into my closet and got a blanket. I was really cold after my mission. Damn Marluxia\u2026 but I guess that\u2019s beside the point. I don\u2019t know why he got in there, I mean he knew I was going to punish him. But I was so shocked I DIDN\u2019T! And when I went into the room to do something to him, I saw him playing with a knife I must have left out. He looked pretty good flipping it too. But why wasn\u2019t he doing anything with it? Maybe he just found it, but I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s my prisoner here, and I\u2019m nothing more than a nobody. He shouldn\u2019t be doing weird stuff like this. Ugh, I\u2019ll write later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Use it? Use the knife? What did she mean by that? Maybe you just found it\u2026 wait, did she\u2026 did she think you would have stabbed her in her sleep!? You put the diary back, careful not to so much as ruffle a page wrong.  Wait\u2026 this did sort of make sense. You numbly walked back through the house until you sat down on the couch. She was a nobody, after all, and the same emotionless behavior that made her a killer also meant she probably didn\u2019t understand normal human emotion. She looked at your actions practically \u2013 you should have killed her and then gotten the hell out of there. But you hadn\u2019t and that puzzled her. Admittedly, you were a little shocked at yourself for not having thought about that plan, but you wouldn\u2019t have gone through with it anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You kicked your legs over the end of the couch and laid back. Well, if that was the case, the reason she was so surprised when you acted nice towards her was probably because she would expect a knife in the back sooner than she would expect a friendly gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Man, all this thinking was making your head hurt. You suddenly realized you were also pretty tired. Maybe you just\u2026 needed a little time\u2026 to sleep on it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Either way, as soon as you awoke you were on guard. Usually when it felt like three or four hours Larxene was about to arrive home \u2013 or, more likely, already home. And that meant that it was time for you to be quick on your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when you looked around, Larxene was nowhere to be found. Confused, you lay there on your elbow for a minute as you tried to think of where she might be. But, then you remembered \u2013 she had double mission duty. Odds were, she wouldn\u2019t even be back for at least three or four more \u2013<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, a dark portal opened and Larxene stepped out from inside. \u201cI\u2019m back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- hours. Well, hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Larxene. Sorry, didn't expect you home so early. I'll get to dinner right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't bother. I already got some from the world I got assigned to today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was quite a surprise. \"You had time to eat dinner? Usually you barely get home from one mission in this time, and you're telling me you did two AND dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh oh. You must have said SOMETHING wrong, because the look Larxene shot you was one of shock, and perhaps a hint of anger. But then she composed herself, and scoffed off your question with an answer that was so typical of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since they decided that I should have to play 'card keeper' for the little brat when he needs it, and do missions - no, DOUBLE missions - at the same time, I decided I wasn't going to do all I could today. All I had to do was scout and then find some lame treasure chests to see if they had items anyway. I just decided to only find out what I had to for the scouting and not bother finding the rest of the chests after I got what I went for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTypical of her. She was strong, but also vindictive and short-tempered. She was probably worse about doing missions she hated than Demyx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, you can fix yourself something for supper. For now, I'm just glad to have that scum Marluxia-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what about-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet!\" Larxene yelled as she grabbed you, suddenly dragging you back along the hallway. When she got to the closet, she opened it and threw you into the small walk-in section, slamming the door hard enough to knock blankets off of the top shelves and onto your head. You wondered what this was all about, but then you got your answer as the familiar sound of a dark portal came through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Larxene. Home so soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly no thanks to you.\" Larxene said, and you could almost feel her cross her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm disappointed in you. Usually, you're so good about doing missions to their full extent. Today you barely did what we asked of you Something important to rush back here for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a touch of amusement in her voice as she replied, \"Please. Have you seen the rooms you provided for us? There's nothing of any worth in these rooms, and certainly nothing worth returning to. The least you could do is provide us with a television or something entertaining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew she would be biting back a giggle at her poking fun at you. You just sighed mentally at her comments of you not being of any worth, and then felt the hairs on the back of your neck prickle at Marluxia's next response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think you might have taken something from those treasure chests and decided to hide it. We can't have you taking an unfair cut of the rewards, can we? I think you should let me see inside that closet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't good. Not at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've already agreed to assist you in our plan to take over the Organization. Why the hell would I hide something from you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou agreed with her. Something was suspicious - you felt that this was nothing more than a plot for him to discover you. And it looked like he was going to succeed. Unless... those towels around your shoulders gave you an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not certain, but something about you has changed, Larxene. You seem a bit... off. I can't explain it. You've been acting more like that young boy Roxas than your usual self. I can't put anything past you until I figure out why you're so different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... fine. If you really have to invade a woman's privacy, go ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tucked yourself into as tight a corner as you could and listened as the door opened. For several seconds, nothing happened. But you could tell Marluxia was looking into the closet quite intently. Of course, you couldn't see him directly - you had climbed to the top of the closet and tucked yourself behind the towels. And unless he wanted a knife in the back, there was no way Marluxia would disturb Larxene's things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm... fine. No treasure in here, I suppose. Good, glad to see you're not so changed that you would betray me. Very good, I suppose I'll leave you alone now then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a dark portal opening followed almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, nice to see you too. Ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, you tried to climb back down from the top of the closet. Unfortunately, you overestimated how much space there was between you and the ceiling, and when you tried to crawl over you got stuck, and when you wiggled free you rolled right off the top, falling all the way to the floor. You hit with a loud bang, landing right on your shoulder, and seriously hurting yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarxene bent down to see you, but your vision was blurred for a moment and you couldn't catch what she was doing until you felt her hands clutching your shoulder. You groaned in pain, but did nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shut up you baby. It's not even broken. You would've been in much worse shape if Marluxia had caught you. Now, go ahead and fix me supper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you weren't hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stress makes me hungry. NOW GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am!\" You said, crawling up against the pain of your shoulder and running off to the kitchen. On cue, a knife flew behind you and almost took off your ear. Ah... the return to things being normal.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You frankly felt a strong atraction towards her for some reason but didn't know why but you didn't mind. She semmed like a sister to you though you were a only child your whole life. You talked to her and just loved to hear her talk even her giggle made you smile. You looked at your digital alarm clock and saw it was way past your bed time, you saved your game and went to sleep with your dsi next to you as you fall into a deep sleep. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden light emited from your dsi as you lay asleep on your bed, the dsi flips open to reveal a white screen which bathed the room in a glow of pitch white. You opened one eye and leaned up to see your dsi laying on your life. \"Huh*yawn* what's this\" you look at the screen to see a message writen in gold <i>\"Help me...please...\" </i>and under it was the choices \"yes or no?\" A sudden voice shouted out of the dsi as a static began to emit nearly blocking the voice <i>\"Ple...s... H...p m...\" </i>you could pick out and the voice was very framiliar \"Wait it can't be...Namine!\" you nearly shouted and quickly clicked the A button to except the message. The light enveloped you and you were suddenly digitized and sent into the dsi as did the game card.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh what happened\" you said as you stood up to find yourself lying on a white colored couch \"Huh how'd i get here\" you said softly as no realizing you were no long home. You got off the couch to find you were shirtless and felt a tad hollow inside. You walked around a pitch white room until you found a door with a wooden sigh labled Namine's room. You slowly opened the door to find it compleatly dark but managed to make out a body on the bed of the room. You slipped inside and found a table that had a drawing on it, you picked up the picture and noticed a figure that looked strangly like you though it was too dark to make sure. You say a small black devise in the man's left hand and holding a card like item in his right hand. You felt some connection to this but didn't know why. \"Hm roxas what are you doing in here this is my room\" said a calm and tired voice. You thought up a excuse and used it in your calmest voice ever \"Sorry Namine i just thought i left something in here my bad\" you walked over to her and combed her hair back \"good night\" you said then left the room. After you left the room Namine slowly got up and noticed the drawing you were holding in your hands that you put back after she had awoken. \"What did he want with this picture i wonder\" she thought to herself before going back to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wait i don't remeber my name! Why is that so\" you asked on the verge of panic? A gentle hand grabbed you shoulder as you started to freak out \"Hey calm down\" said Namine in a calm tone \"Don't worry i'm sure your name will return to you in time but first can you tell me how you ended up in my room without letting anyone know or even got past them for that matter?\" \"I.. don't remeber how exactly, I just woke up here and found myself beside your room lying on this coach\" you answered calming down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock came at the door then a voice \"Namine are you okay i thought i heard someone\" said the voice. Namine grabbed your and threw you into her room \"Keep quit until i come back for you\" she whispered to you then shut the door. You put your ear up to the door and managed to hear the conversasion between Namine and the visiter. \"Okay you can come in\" said Namine.<br>\r\n(Switiching to third person view)<br>\r\nA man in a blakc cloak with spiky red hair entered the room caring a box full of ice pops \"Hey Namine who were you talking to\" he asked curiously? \"Oh uh no one Axel\" she said with a chuckle backing up towards the her bedroom door. \"What are you hiding in there\" Axle asked even more curious of what Namine was hiding. \"Uh nothing\" she said nervously. \"Oh come on i won't tell anyone, promise\" he reached out his pinky. \"Okay pinky promise you won't tell anybody\" asked Namine pinky promising him \"I promise no show me\" Axle said smiling. \"Okay but please don't get mad\" she slowly opened the door and told you to come out.<br>\r\n(Back to you) <br>\r\nYou did as you were told and walked back out to see a very framilair red haired face \"Wait a human but hwy are you here\" he jumped back and summoned his chakrams and readied a fire ball aimed at you. You cut him off when a pitch black blade appears in our hands that was the shape of a key and instintively slashed the blades out of his hands. \"What the hell are you\" Axel cursed noticing a newly yellow glow in your eyes. \"It would be wise if you didn't try that again\" you say in a dark toned voice that wasn't your own \"Now never attack Namine again or i'll\" \"You idiot i wasn't attacking her i was attacking you\" Axel replied back. \"Wait you weren't but i thought...*thud*\" you collapsed on the spot uncounsious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awaken (Your name)... you must wake up to compleat your destiny\" said a booming voice. \"Huh who are you\" you asked? \"That is of no importance\" it said back in a harsh tone \"You must protect Namine at Alll cost no matter what happens to you. It is your duty and your destiny to be Namine's protector\" the voice said back. \"Wait what do you mean protect her? Protect her from what exactly\" you yell back but to no reply or answer. \"Dam it answer me\" you yelled as the world turned black... </span></div></div>",

Luckily the Ferret's earth bender Bolin was still around and was the team leader. You all barley survived the last match and hoped that this one would be different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we all know that last match was garbage, terrible, even Paabu could have done better.

No offense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou packed up your gear and was on your way home when you bumped back into Bolin. \"Oh hey (Name). Look sorry for costing you a whole season of pro-bending.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it. Though how could anyone replace the Avatar or your brother in Pro-bending? Which...you wouldn't happen to have a way to introduce me to her?\", you asked slyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wellllll maybe I could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I got a call from my bro, who you can also meet and he just said Korra is inviting us to her Water Tribe's Glacier Spirits festival.

So uh, ready to meet the Avatar, I mean we are like best friends so anything you want her sign, do, I can hook you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bolin I have no idea how to even come close to thanking you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to thank me.

Problem is I don't have a job or place to get you work.\", you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me how have you been making a living?\", Bolin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just have my old man who pays the bills and keeps a roof over our heads.\", you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee is it that bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, were not in a poor house and he barley makes ends meet. We have an apartment and a nice one to boot, thing is he works he bum to give both of us a decent life. He just works an awful load to do that so I joined the Ferrets to earn the prize money and help him. But now were back to square one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, your lucky.\", Bolin replied with a downer expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm how so?\", you inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah never mind I don't wanna be depressed on the way there. Now c'mon and I'll introduce you to Korra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that chat the ship left and made it's way to the South, outside the ship you and Bolin noticed a huge polar bear dog by the ship where you saw non other than Mako and Avatar Korra lying beside it. \"(Name) I present to you in person Avatar Korra, Korra (Name).\", Bolin introduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were ecstatic and smiled your largest grin you could possibly make. \"HI I AM (NAME)!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bolin did you bring a fanboy with us to Korra's Water Tribe festival?\", Mako asked annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I brought your replacement on the team who happens to be a fanboy with us to Korra's Water Tribe festival. Difference being, replacement on the team, Mako.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I told you I have a job now. I'm sorry I couldn't stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEEEEEEEE! Mako it is a honor to meet Bolin's brother.

You saved his life during an assassination attempt on Fire Lord Zuko. My family wouldn't be here today if not for you.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra felt embarrassed since she didn't feel like she deserved your praise, \"Thank you but Aang saved your grandfather's life. Not me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but your still the Avatar and I appreciate you for what you did for my family. Different life, same immortal spirit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra bowed down in response, \"I appreciate your kind words and appreciation.\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bolin thank you so much for this, I am glad to meet you.\", you left with Bolin to your cabin and waited to arrive in the South Pole.</span></div></div>",

The lights across the festival lit the starry night with laughter breaking the silence in the cold freezing air. You didn't attend the main feast since fancy dinner parties weren't where you felt you fit in, so you settled in by your tent until the festival began and met up with Bolin and his brother Mako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing! I would totally visit the coldest place on earth for this again, I've never been to a festival before!\", you commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaand I've been scoping out the scenery. If you catch my drift, wink, wink.\", Bolin smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bolin remember the last water tribe girl you tried to date?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Mako that was one time and I am telling you this will be different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was the last water tribe girl you tried hooking with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's better you NOT know and save everyone the awkwardness.\", Mako replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm with my bro on this one so yeah, keeping my relationship with Korra on the down looowww.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dated Korra?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops!

I'm as quiet as mouse-rat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were left curious as to the details you noticed the chief's children walking around. \"Hey Bolin, I'll be back. I'll find you later.\" You wanted to avoid them knowing they seemed to be a little off. Remembering what they said sounded like they would hunt you down. You quietly walk through the crowds of people and waited for a turn to ride the Ferris-wheel hoping it would elude you from them. You had to wait for only one more person but suddenly you noticed someone getting through all the people in line behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out it was the twins getting special privilege to cut through any line being royals of the chief of the water tribe. \"We will take the next one with this one.\", said Eska to the one overseeing the ride. You wanted to leave but knew now it was pointless to try and escape from them now. Soon as the next box car stopped and let others out you went in with the twins. You sat across from both while mildly strapped in by your legs on a metal bar. Ounce the wheel rotated they final broke the silence and began to talk to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was it you were trying to accomplish earlier today?\", Desna inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just said hi. You're Korra's cousins I heard and I though it would be polite to introduce myself.\", you answered nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one ever introduces themselves to us unless they are bowing. I didn't see the point with you seeking our attention for now reason.\", Eska replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just being nice, I wasn't trying to offend you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems he had no ulterior motive. Let's get off sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, this one's answers are blunt, he is uncultured, and I find his fear of his to be funny. You amuse me, I will make you mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat? She wanted you to be hers? Did she mean that as a romantic gesture? \"Uhhhhh you mean as a boyfriend or a slave?\", you asked stupidly. The ride had finally ended and Eska took you by your coat collar and dragged you along the festival making you try and win her prizes for her.</span></div></div>",

She ordered you around like she was your boss, much to both your fear and disdain. While winning most of the games you were forced to enter was fun, Eska swiped every prize away ounce you had earned them. \"You are quite skilled to have won me so many. But they were just practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were terrified, what did she have in mind that was a big test? Darts, water guns, throwing the ring on bottles? She pointed to the worst one of all history. The claw. The most insidious contraption to have ever been conceived by human thought. People already were trying left and right wasting their money to win a single prize, but it always never stuck or even if it did it fell too soon. \"That one?\", you asked her. She nodded. \"THAT ONE?!\", she nodded again. \"THAT one right over there, is what you want me to try and win you a prize in?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not try. You WILL.\", she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sister even I find it to be far fetched, I find this to be far too humiliating for an uncultured rat like him to best that horrid contraption.\", Desna said both as a reply to make her stop while also insulting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO. You will win something and you will succeed. Don't fail me boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waterbent the other people out of the way to make sure you could have the next go at it. You were scared and deep down you were almost begging whatever powers that be to make sure you win the claw. But realistically winning anything on the first go is a million to one. Eska and Desna watched from behind watching you. You started it up, let it rest in center and looked for the easiest prize to grab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne was sticking out that looked like you could scoop it up from the body, it was a plush of an air bison, it's big stuffed animal body looked like if you grabbed it firmly enough it would stay inside the claw until it released. You aimed it as best as you could, the claw was right above it, you steadied it a bit to make sure it was dead center, then you lowered it. From there it was all luckbased, you sweated from the sheer fear of what Eska would do if you failed. Another try? Was she expecting it? Was she expecting you to do it in one shot? Time froze as the claw fully gripped the bison. It looked good, the claw grabbed most of the body but there was too much space around it to feel comfortable. It didn't help as soon as it raised up all the way it shook free the perfectly placed grip on the bison. You saw it begin to fall off, only mere inches from the chute, falling off, wait, wait waiiiiiitt! It dropped before the claw relased, but it landed within the edge of the chute and leaned all the way into it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSS\", you yelled. Everyone who played was amazed, Desna raised his brows in surprise, Eska was the only one to remain stoic and without another thought she went to swipe the stuffed animal bison out of your hand. But just before she could you presented it her, \"Here! Enjoy it because I am never playing that thing again! EVER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEska smirked, \"I am pleased. Now you may be treated as how my boyfriend should be treated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh does that mean-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may now order you around as I please. You have earned the right to be my boyfriend.\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sister I believe it is time for us to return to father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed, as for you boyfriend I shall see you again tomorrow.\", she walked away with her brother leaving him to carry all the prizes you won for her. She was controlling with a capital C. She might have been nice to look at but the person within proved she was a dark spirit! You went back to your tent prepared to get a good nights rest. However the things were only now beginning...</span></div></div>",

You wrapped yourself in every extra layer of blanket you had in your bed and sealed yourself up. It was still too cold you felt. You knew it was only going to get worse so you wore your winter coat and tried to go to sleep but even then you couldn't sleep. Now you heard howling from outside, Korra's polarbear dog was waking everyone who had gone to sleep. At this point you decided you couldn't take it anymore and went outside to shut it up. Just as soon as you went to vent out your frustration you saw the others staring out to the festival. You turned your head to know what was going on, to your shock it was a dark spirit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were terrified. You knew in full the cruelty of the spirits and knew that whatever it wanted it wouldn't rest until it got what it came for. The spirit zoomed fast in the blink of an eye and dove at Korra. Mako and Bolin went to help her while you followed. The spirit tried to eat her whole but Bolin lifted the earth under the spirits' footing, then you and Mako combined your fire and blasted it mid-air. The spirit was knocked down, then Tonraq surrounded it in ice. \"I think we got it!\", Bolin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no we don't!\", you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMako looked at you with a inquisitive look, soon after the dark spirit broke out and grabbed all four of you, throwing Tonraq, Mako, and Bolin. But it pulled you in starring into your very soul it felt. When Korra struck back with a gust of air, it threw you into the snow, you lost consciousness as you landed from the throw. When you finally came to, the dark spirit was gone. You got up to find that everyone was already going back to their tents. Meant that the spirit was gone and that everything was safe for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't easy for you, to learn that dark spirits were around meant a great deal of trouble and pain. You never told anyone but you had some bad blood between your family and the spirits. And you knew they haven't forgotten as evident by that spirit singling you out. Mako paused to see you enter your tent. He noticed something relating to you and the dark spirit. You were too paranoid that you didn't notice and just tried getting back to bed.</span></div></div>",

Of course after last night you though it best to remain in the southern tribe. \"Hey (Name) were going to the south pole. This guy called Varrick, a business friend of Asami's, he's fixing me with some state of the art gear! Said to meet him by his yacht. I could put in a good word for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll pass. Spirits and me don't mix.\", soon as you said that Bolin stepped aside for none other than Eska and Desna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boyfriend, we are journeying to the south.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I told Bolin-\", she grabbed you by the collar and dragged you along, literally, on her arctic camel. Hogtied by your wrists on the saddle you knew that this wasn't going to be a fun trip. \"I guess I changed my mind.\", you replied to Bolin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later you all started marching to the south pole, Bolin everyone except Bolin rode on their arctic camel, with him riding in a single cared snow speeder. As everyone headed there you thought to try and polity ask your 'girlfriend' to let her remove the knot. \"Uh say Eska could I move my wrists now? I promise not to run, since I won't last on my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It stays until we make camp. Don't ask again.\", she coldly and quickly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Desna back me up please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't involve me with your lover quarrels I am not the person for this sort of thing.\", he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least we could talk about...uhhhh.....the sky. And how it makes you feel. Maybe start some conversation?\", you thought by maybe getting either of them to like you while you tried to act more friendly to them they would cut the rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never look at the sky. It is empty as is most of the world.\", Eska answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I looked at it once. I liked how the stars covered the darkness. But it bored me so I never looked at it again.\", Desna answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that is interesting. Tell me what interests you guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boyfriend I would like to ask you something.\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?! Uh I mean what Eska?\", you got excited that maybe you got through to her in some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you considered your attempts to try and change my mind about keeping you tied up are feeble?\", she asked having a snarky tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned and turned away from her in frustration. Eska chuckled finding your reaction amusing, and thought you looked cute when you were angry.</span></div></div>",

But now things were getting worse when it dawned on everyone they were being followed by dark spirits. Your strained relationship with them because of your family made you urge the idea to make camp for the night, to which Tonraq and Bolin agreed to. You all settled in a small shelter clear from the blistering winds. Finally feeling like the time is now to receive some much wanted rest you buckled down in every layer of blanket and coat you had and found a comforting spot to lay close to the fire. After that you immediately dozed off, but later you heard faintly what seemed to be arguing by the fire. But you figured if it wasn't involved with you it wasn't your place to say anything. A bit afterward though you were woken up by a hard poke on your shoulder, as you expected, Eska.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be better to sleep in our sleeping bags.\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the suggestion but I'm really ok with where I'm sleeping now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. We will sleep in front of you so that we are not far.\", she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well wait....uh? Nevermind it was a dumb idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Answer me when I ask you something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez I am really sick of you ordering me around! So I won't say.\", you lower your hood in defiance shrugging your arms. And Eska responded with tugging it back and grabbing you by the collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I find your words of defiance very unwise and hurtful. I would seek an apology if I valued my life out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still I fire bender and I can last long to walk all the way back. Heh find them hurtful I think that may be the first time you said you felt something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesna raised his arm and in the snow formed an icicle defending his sister. \"I'd advise you to not speak ill of my sister or else I will have to kill you for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Desna. Do not treat him rudely, I enjoy his honesty.\", Desna backed off. The twins got into their bags and were ready to sleep. But Eska still felt curious about what you meant to say to her. \"(Name)?\", she asked more softly opposed to her monotone attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\", you replied still angry but with less of it in direction to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to know what you were going to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will be the judge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to humor her and say it, \"If you wanted to you could sleep next to me if you wanted to keep me safer from the dark spirits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEska paused momentarily, \"You were right.\", she turned away and went to sleep as did you and the others. However later that night Eska woke up groggily finding the cold to be very harsh. She turned to you where you were cold, the fire gone, the heatsource wasn't enough to keep you from freezing to death. Eska looked at her brother, but knew you need some level of warmth. So she quietly got out of her bag and right beside you slept next to you. She wrapped her arm around your waist, but did it like she didn't know if it was the right way being done. Eska thought to herself, \"This one is doing something that I am sure I want happen to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the sun cracked over the ice, and was time to move.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The following morning you woke up to a surprising feeling around your back, Eska's arm wrapped alongside you. \"She actually did it?! I only meant it as a joke, but last night it got more tense than it needed to. She's crazy! Still there is something about her that's sincere.\", Eska began to wake up. She got up and stretched out her arms yawning, but nonchalantly packed up her essentials and didn't bother greeting you with a good morning. You were puzzled by it but assumed it was among the list of eccentricities she had among people. You followed suit along with Desna and the others and in no time got back to heading to the South Pole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours had passed with the group crossing through an endless wind of snow. The sky was getting darker indicating you have spent the whole day trekking through the arctic storm. But things began getting worse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to keep moving.'', Unalaq said. The storm began getting more intense even for a water bender to handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh man I don't like this.\", Bolin said cowering over the thought of dark spirits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bolin calm down there's no reason to-\", suddenly a dark spirit popped out of the snow, \"PANIC!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark spirits tore through the supplies everyone had and knocking everybody off their mounts. One managed to get you but Eska and Desna jumped out of the way in time. The dark spirit got right in your face and suddenly its neck began to pulse rapidly like a rattle snake tail. It's neck began to expand until the twins shot a blast of water at it freeing you from its grasp. \"Thanks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't reply back but instead chose to focus on the battle. Another one came lunging at you but this time you were ready. You fired a couple of slashes of fire against it managing to land a hit on it. With that the rest either retreated or were dealt with by the others. Leaving you all in a precarious position. Without your supplies you needed to go back. You didn't know what to do so you went along with whatever was best for the mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you all managed to make it to the south pole where at the center was a forest covered entirely in ice. \"Whew, I'd never want to go on a camping trip in there.\", you joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe!\", Bolin laughed. Everyone kinda starred at the both of you at the thought of how you seemed to not be taking this matter seriously. \"What it was funny.\", Bolin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inside that forest is the portal to the spirit world. From there Korra, you must go alone.\", Unalaq explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on were not going without her.\", Mako replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah if she goes we go too!\", Bolin followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm here for moral support so I say that they go with her as well!\", you interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Avatar must go alone.\", Unalaq insisted. With reluctance from Korra and Bolin and Mako she went in thanks to Unalaq's encouragement. It felt quite nerve-racking as you were worried things would go south. (pun not intended I swear!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope she'll be ok.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah me too. I mean every time she risks her neck by herself it never gets any easier.\", Bolin replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly a large beam of light shot upward into the sky. You had no idea what it was but the sheer sight of it was breath taking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of all the awe from the portal Korra managed to come out of it fine. \"Hey Korra's back!\", you yelled in excitement. Then you felt a block of ice forming around you and you were moved right in front of Eska. \"Why are showing emotional interest in another woman?!\", she said with a sneer yet her face remained the same blank look as always. You didn't say anything as you feared whatever answer you gave would infuriate her more.</span></div></div>",

The Northern Water Tribe had occupied the South and it seemed more like an invasion rather than an occupation. It only made things between you and Eska only more complicated with you being \"together\" with the person marching in on the Avatar's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile as things throughout the tribe was growing more tense you and Bolin were getting into a heated argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) I for one don't get it.\", Bolin reacted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's to get exactly? It makes sense to me.\", you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you are being brainwashed by your girlfriend bud. And I can't in good faith let that happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since when did she get roped into the discussion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello! Your taking the side of the guy who is causing a lot of tension around here. Might you reconsider your tastes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not! The food here beats the water tribe food they make in Republic City I've been there 15 times and I'm telling you this place beats it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But were both city boys! Why can't you play for the home team?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bolin, Eska isn't even here to boss me around, this is coming from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. Jeez this can't be any worse. So you were saying Korra?\", Bolin said finishing your discussion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what else can I say. I'm trying to maintain balance here but nobody is going along with the program.\", Korra replied with much frustration emanating from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Korra stuff like this ticks everyone off. But the fact that everything has come to a total halt because your uncle moved in, makes me beg the question why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because he's trying to bring balance to the Water Tribe. So the dark spirits stop attacking.\", she tried to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hate to instigate more conflict but his idea of balance is absolute stupidity.\", you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you truly believe your gravely mistaken perspective of my father boyfriend?\", in just one moment you went from your usual blunt and honest self, to calculate every response so she doesn't freeze me mode. You turned to see Eska and Desna together, they sat right next to you forcefully, squeezing Bolin a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No of course not. I was being hypothetical.\", you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. If you have any intention on making this work, you will love my family whether you really do or not. Frankly I almost laughed at that remark. Nobody would be so ignorant to blatantly call my father such descriptions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI detest his ignorance. But I find the interactions from you two very entertaining.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok Desna, he will grow to become more dignified and intellectual.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI happen to be very intelligent in terms of emotional intelligence.\u201d, you stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting. What am I feeling now?\u201d, Eska asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEska stared at you, almost as if she was gazing into your very soul. She had the same cold face she gave nearly all the time. You grew increasingly nervous and awkward at this whole thing, but you still tried anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re feeling like you should get some food since were sitting at a dinner table.\u201d, you said it as if you were certain but you were hiding it as a total shot in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. I think I just grew a tiny bit more tolerating of his faults. Stay here boyfriend we will return.\u201d, Eska replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa. You really can read peoples feelings. So tell me what am I feeling?\u2019\u2019, Bolin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to leave with Korra?\u201d, you guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, except I think she already left.\u201d, the two of you turned to notice Korra\u2019s seat was empty. \u201cI was going to leave too except scooching over those two made me feel like a fourth wheel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s the third?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDesna right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI honestly believe he\u2019s part of the other wheel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Bolin left and Eska and Desna returned with some food. You stood still not sure what to say or do next. \u201cWere you expecting us to provide you with your own meal?\u201d, Eska asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, already ate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. So I hope you have money left over for our meal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it customary for the man to provide the finances for the date?\u201d, she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned internally and luckily had just enough to pay for the meal. Though you were now officially broke until you got back home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still sat next to Eska and figured trying to continue to make conversation might lighten things. \u201cSo how do you feel about this whole North coming into the South business?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPolitical affairs are boring. I refuse to discuss them with you while I am eating.\u201d, Eska replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWonderful. Soooo what about your cousin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like her.\u201d, the twins both answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is not your concern.\u201d, they said.</span></div></div>",

Any one of those problems is worth breaking up.\u201d, Mako explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but the pros weight enough to balance the cons. She\u2019s insightful and blunt, a strong bender, sweet though coming off as deadpan, has a wonderful sense of humor, and yes she looks very pretty.

Boyfriend, bow to me when I exit.\u201d, Eska ordered you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy doctor said I can\u2019t bend my legs like that for six days.\u201d, you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine. But we will discuss this behavior tonight.\u201d, she said leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t let her treat you like that.\u201d, Mako said still grasping why you were even considering being with her at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I\u2019m convinced she won\u2019t improve then I\u2019ll consider breaking up with her. Trust me I have no interest in that stuff either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) let me make this clear and simple. She is not for you. You two make a horrible couple. She in no way makes a good partner for a relationship, break-up with her as soon as you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I get the feeling you don't approve?\", you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMako and Bolin simply face palmed very hard to the point they just fell to the ground with utter groaning.</span></div></div>",

You were new to the area and had seen them playing in the cul de sac. You went outside to join them hoping to make some new friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check it out, new dude in town.\", a punk kid with a hat called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm (Name).\", you introduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Names Kevin. The blond is Nazz, red head Sarah and her friend Jimmy, and the guy with the plank is Johnny and the plank is literally named Plank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet everyone.\", you said politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, not everyone. There are these three dorks called the Ed's. They all have the same name just spelled differently. I'd stay away from those dorks at all costs.\", he warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all of the general residents?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the dorks are harmless for the most part. But wherever you go, stay away from the trailer park. And especially, avoid-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THE KANKERS!\", you heard people screaming coming from the woods. Three guys were running for their lives when they ran past everyone. You turned to see what they were running from, three girls. One with red curly hair that covered her eyes, another with blonde hair with buck teeth, and lastly a brunette with a goth look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude follow our lead and- RUN FOR IT!\", everyone in the cul de sac ran straight into their homes or making a b-line away from them. You didn't know what all the fuss was about. After all they were just girls, they weren't going to be evil. Sure they looked tough but nothing is set and stone from appearances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.\", you waved to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls stopped in their tracks noticing your friendly gesture. \"Well what have we here girls? A new face in town. And cute one at that.\", the red head acknowledged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawwww! He looks sooooooo adorable! Can we keep him for a while?\", the blonde girl pinched your cheek and moved it around very violently. You pushed her hand away leaving you to rub off some of the pain she caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe. Well I am game to give him a try. I vote we take him home.\", the brunette agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I second that. So kid, how would you like to spend some quality time with some lovely ladies?\", the red head asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought they looked kind of cute but lovely stretched it a little. But you thought since they were extending to invite you over, maybe they wanted to hang out. No harm in that. \"Uhh sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls giggled all the way back to their home. The other kids watched in horror too afraid to warn you, but it was too late. A couple minutes passed and you entered their trailer home. \"Huh nice place.\", you complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\", the red head replied giving a pat on the back so strong it sent you slamming into the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhhh...\", you said letting out a painful moan. \"That hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't mind our sister, she loves to rough house. Anyway I'm Marie.\", the brunette introduced herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm May!\", the blonde one followed, leaving the red head to introduce herself last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Lee. Were the Kanker Sisters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, so what we you planning we do for fun? I'm new so is there something around that is cool to see or do around?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gnehehehehhehehe. Oh we have plenty of ways to entertain our guests.\", the other girls giggled again. You didn't pay much thought since girls giggle all the time. They were thinking about weird stuff that you wouldn't understand maybe, except you had yet to realize their laughter was coming from malicious intent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, what's your name?\", Lee asked she said laying on the floor with her hands holding up her head in a relaxed position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name) huh? Well then, how do you feel about cooties?\", Lee asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that is just a myth. Dumb thing boys say to avoid girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about hugs from girls?\", May asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They aren't bad at all. If they're alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how do you feel about, kissing?\", Marie asked blinking rapidly at you. You felt a little nervous the way she looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That! I think is something I would be happy to answer tomorrow, I just remembered I have to take out the trash. See ya!\", you tried getting out of there, but May blocked the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww don't go so soon. We haven't started having fun. And I think the fun has just started. GIRLS! Roundup our guest! Ehehehhehee!\", the others surrounded you. You were terrified by what they were going to do. You shut your eyes wondering what they were planning.

The kind that requires a ton of lip on lip contact.\", Lee explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewww! You three only try to kiss people. Yuck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not ALL the time numbskull. And not everyone.

Ok (Name). We have a game we like to play I know you have heard of. Spin the bottle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried wiggling out of the chair but it was no use. They placed the bottle under your chair and spun it, \"Rules for this are simple, who ever it lands on gets the first smooch. Pucker up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't see who it was landing on. All you did see was the trio putting on some makeup and lipstick over their lips. They were ready for action. You sat and wondered who would be your first kiss.</span></div></div>",

She sat on your lap dabbing a little more lipstick before finally getting ready to seal the deal. \"I'd start making like a fish now. Mmwah! Mmwah! Mmwha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breath smelled like she hadn't brushed since the last two days which made it hard to like. You leaned back trying to avoid her lips. But Lee held the chair in place so you wouldn't tip over and had her other hand locking your head in place. No escape. May kept doing that loud kissing sound all the way toward you, it was like a ticking time bomb. Her last one held on the \"mmm\" sound as if to let you savor your last moments of freedom. Finally May's lips touched your own. Her strong forceful press made this feel weird. It felt hot, ticklish, sticky, a tad tight on the mouth. May wrapped her arms over your neck holding in your first kiss. The entire time she almost seemed to try making her loud noises audible through the kiss. As if to let everyone know she was liking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a solid 20 seconds she held it in until she ended it with a loud pop after squeezing your lips together like popping a zit. Gross. \"Bleeeehhhh! That was gross.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not over yet! Our rules say I have 40 extra seconds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they could kiss you for a full minute? What is wrong with them?! Now May started giving your shorter but still hard kisses all over your face. Continuing with her annoying sounds and sloppy kisses. This happened for the remaining minute.

Let me help.\" You said as you bend down to get her stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" The girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you give her her books, you blushed and you're heart starts pounding fast as you see a girl with green emerald eyes and long red hair. You recognized her as Samantha Simpson, the smartest girl in school. You always admire Sam for her brains and other talents. But among other things, you also like her for her kindness and selflessness. You would see her with her friends, Clover and Alex, but you never got the chance to meet her. Until now, that is. You get up and hand her her stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. You're a real gentleman.\" Sam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, Sam.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know my name?\" Sam asked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen you here a couple of times. Though, I never got a chance to say hello.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam then leans in and examines you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I think I know you too. You're Joseph, right? You're one of the top 5 male students here.\" Sam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. That's me.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. I must say, you look better up close in person.\" Sam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can say the same about you.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam blushed and giggled at your comment and the bell rung.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I have to go. It was nice meeting you.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too. Say, how about we hang out at lunch together? If you want.\" Sam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like that. See ya, Sam.\" You said before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye, Joseph.\" Sam said as she goes off to tell Clover and Alex about you.</span></div></div>",

You get your meal and you turned to see Sam with Clover and Alex at their table. Sam notices you and she waves at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joseph!\" Sam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Sam! How are you doing so far?\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\"Sam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So wait. This is the Joseph you mentioned before?\" Clover wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The very same!\" Sam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he does look interesting.\" Alex said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting isn't the word I would describe him. Sammy, I think you just hit the mother load.\" Clover said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clover!\" Sam blushed as she knows that Clover is teasing her while you just chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's just kidding around, Sammy.\" Ales said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right. I'm sure she's just pushing you buttons. Anyway, mind if I join you girls?\" You asked nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Come and sit with us.\" Alex said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit with the girls and you had made funny conversations while you eat with them. You were gonna start another one until someone stopped that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look who it is. The three little ugly pigs. Did you losers finally decided to get a sense of looks?\" A girl said meanly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did longer than you'll ever know, Mandy. Unlike your sense of smell because you reek of stink.\" Clover mocking Mandy while holding her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha. You're so not funny, Clover.\" Mandy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never liked Mandy to begin with because she's a spoiled, loudmoth, selfish, egotistic, evil bully who wants things to always go her way. You always thought that her big mouth will get her into big trouble and maybe the death of her one day, but she'll never learn. Mandy turns to see you and she has a wicked smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there. You seem like a big boy, aren't you? Why don't you leave the loser train and come hop on the royal express?\" Mandy said as if she's trying to bribe you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls don't like that too much, Sam mostly. She tightens her fist so hard that she'll break Mandy's face if she wanted to. Before Sam could do anything about this,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Mandy said in shock while the girls giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the deal, I don't date bullies. You go around saying that you're better than everyone else at everthing. You made sound like you're invincible. Maybe in you're own eyes. To me, you're nothing but another loudmouth, egotistic, spoiled brat. You asked that you want me to hop on the 'royal express'? Well, you can take my ticket and shove it. Now, get out.\" You demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy was fuming and she left in a fit of rage. The girls were really happy that some guy told her to take a hike. She needs to be taught a lesson every now and then. You calmed down and sit back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! I never seem a guy flip Mandy off like that before.\" Alex said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say. You are one if a kind, Joseph.\" Clover said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I swear, that ego of hers is gonna get her into big trouble.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's just-huh?\" Sam stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tables appeared to open on it's own and you got sucked in with the girls </span></div></div>",

Maybe you can join our team.\" Sam suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if he's perfectly prepared for the job, Sam. You three do your mission and I'll have him up and running.\" Jerry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls nodded and they transformed into their suits. You blushed at Sam in her green suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It matches your eyes, Sam.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Sam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got their gadgets and left you to begin training.</span></div></div>",

From the first time you heard about L you wanted to work together with him and know who he is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are hanging around in the park. It is a warm sunny day so you wear a red sundress with sunflowers on it. You are watching the birds and the flowers. Your hair was flowing around your head in the wind. After an hour you noticed a message on your cell phone which was in your black purse. You looked on the screen and read the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello [..].<br>\r\nI know you but you only know me as L.<br>\r\nI heard a lot about you and I want YOU in my team.<br>\r\nI need your help to catch Kira.<br>\r\nWe are going to meet each other in front of the mall in 2 hours.<br>\r\nDon't be late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finished to read it you noticed that you got only 30 minutes left to get to the mall.

You drive as fast as you can to get there in time. You look on the clock and notice that you managed to get there in time. \"Phew. That was close. Two minutes left.\" You sigh in relief and wait in front of the mall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two minutes a limousine arrived. \"Please get in. We have to hurry,\" a man with a deep voice friendly say. You don't know what is going on now but you trust the man and get into the car. \"Who are you? I thought I was going to meet L?\", you ask the curious man but he don't answer and start the limousine. \"Hey! Answer!\", you angrily say to him. You want to know what is going on. \"Where is L?!\", \"Please don't get so loud. We will drive to him. Where he works.\", the man answers now. \"But why?\", you ask, \"because L don't go so often outside. And this is safer then the meeting in front of the mall. It would be too dangerous.\", the man answers again friendly. \"Ok. I understand. Sorry for getting loud.\", you apologize to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know exactly how long you two drove but after a long time you get there. \"Follow me.\", the man say and go advance. Now you see how the man look like. It is an older man with white hair and a white mustache. His eyes are really small. It looks like they are closed. You follow him. \"Excuse me. What is your name?\", you ask him now. \"My name is Watari.\", the man answers quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside an unknown big building you are looking around. There aren't so many people but they are working hard. You look to a guy who sit on a chair in a tailor seat and he isn't wearing shoes. Is this L? Watari go to this guy and you follow. \"Ryuuzaki this is the girl.\", Watari says to the guy, \"Thank you Watari.\", Ryuuzaki says and turn around to look in your eyes. \"So you really come. I'm the guy who contacted you. I'm L. But please call me Ryuuzaki.\", the curious guy says to you and his eyes wander from your head to your feet. \"You are L? Ok. Then why did you choose ME?\", you ask him and do the same. \"Because I've heard much about you. You are intelligent and the best in your private school. Your parents are really famous. But before you can join our team you must pass a test.\", L explains to you and turn away again. \"What?! And what sort of test?\", you ask angry. \"Here. Take this and answer some questions. Light will ask you in another room. Now go. I have to work.\", he says and doesn't look on you again. You look to the guy who is called Light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a lot of him. His name is Light Yagami. He is always the best of his age-group. You don't really like him. He has brown hair and brown eyes. He looks friendly but you still don't like him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Light. I'm [..].\", you say and smile friendly. \"Hey. Follow me.\", he says, turns around and goes upstairs. You follow him. \"Sit down please.\", Light says and you sit on the sofa. \"First question...\"<br>\r\nWhat could this sentence mean?<br>\r\n\"L. You know?

Your deck is The Agent Fairy deck with Master Hyperion as your ace monster. You look at your deck because everything you've done up until now is all for one purpose and one purpose only. To get stronger to defeat the man that once took two of your brothers away. He's a man named Mavric. A long time ago, you and him were once the best of friends and did everything together as friends and a dueling tag team. But then one day, he found a card that you hate so much. The Seal of Orichalcos. When you saw him use that card to seal the soul of your two younger brothers after defeated them in a duel, you asked Tyler on why he's doing it. He said that the people of the world is evil and he was chosen to seal all the souls of the people he deemed evil to save the world. You challenged him to a duel in order to save him from this evil card. But, he defeated you in that duel. Luckily for you, he didn't active the Seal of Orichalcos to seal your soul. You then vowed to him that you'll get stronger to defeat him so you can stop him and the Orichalcos. You ran off after grabbing one of the Egyptian God Cards, The Winged Dragon Of Ra. You've trained for 3 years so you can have the strength to beat the man that was once your best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After all these years, I'm finally ready to face you again. And this time, I will defeat you. Just you wait.\" You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look through your entire deck from Master Hyperion to Ra. You then turn to see a man wearing a black cloak all over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At last, I finally found you.\" The man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Not again.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hand over the Egyptian God Card and I will spare your soul from being sealed.\" The man orderd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never!\" You said in defiance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ran away from your promise, my friend. Your promise to save your little brothers.\" The man said very evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't strong enough to save them that day. But, now I am.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Well, prove it to me then.\" The man said as he activated his duel disk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! I will!\" You said with pride as you activated your duel disk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou: 8000<br>\r\nMystery Man: 8000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go first.\" You said as you look at the 5 cards in your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I set a monster in face down defense position.\" You said as the card is in the monster card zone facing down side ways. \"And I'll end my turn by placing three more cards face down. Your move.\" You said as three cards in your Spell/Trap card zones are placed face down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man then drew a card from his deck to start his first turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll start off by summoning Dawn Knight in attack mode.\" He said as a knight in shining armor come to the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn Knight: 1400 Atk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're using a LIGHT deck? Interesting.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just for starters. But, now I'll activate the card that will be your doom. The Seal of Orichalcos.\" The man said as he placed the field spell in the field spell zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Que Seal of Orichalcos theme.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see the green circle surrounding the man before expanding and creating the triangles in the middle. You growled a little as you know that you've hated this card since it took away your best friend and little brothers. The symbol of the seal then appeared on his forehead and he smile evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am no stranger to this kind of magic.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me to refresh your memory. The Seal of Orichalcos increases all of my monster attack power by 500 points. And when you lose, your soul will belong to Master Mavric with your brothers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seal then appeared on Dawn Knight's forehead as its power surges through him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn Knight: 1400-1900 Atk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Dawn Knight, attack his face down monster.\" The man ordered his monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight then slashed the card in half. But, the monster was not destroyed and was revealed to be a monster who looks like a marshmallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've attacked my Marshmallon. He cannot be destroyed by battle and since you've attack him while he was face down, you take 1000 points of direct damage. Sick him!\" You ordered you monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshmallow then bite the man as he loses life points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMystery Man: 7000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then. I'll place two cards face down and that will end my turn.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou draw your card and place it on your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I reveal my face down card. Jar of Greed. This let's me draw again.\" You drew another card and smirked at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate my field spell. The Sanctuary in the Sky.\" You said as you placed your ace spell card in your field spell zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge Sanctuary then came down from the heavens and it shines brightly over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, if you attack one of my Fairy monsters, this field spell will make sure that I won't take any Battle Damage. Next, I'll summon The Agent of Wisdom: Mercury in attack mode.\" You said as a green fairy with tattoos on him came flying down to the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, I'll activate the Equip spell card, Synchro Boost. This will give Marshmallon an additional level and 500 attack points.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshmallon: Lvl 4, 300-800 Atk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, with Marshmallon and Mercury, I now construct the Overlay Network and XYZ summon Fairy Cheer Girl.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercury and Marshmallon then overlapped each other and a cheerleader with butterfly wings appears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFairy Cheer Girl: 1900 Atk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate her effect. By using one of her XYZ materials, I can draw on card.\" You explained as you draw your card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll set this face down and end my turn.\" You said as you set another card in your spell/trap card zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man draws his next card to start his next turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I summon Armageddon Knight in attack mode.\" The man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA darker version of Dawn Knight appears on the field and the seal appears on his head as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmageddon Knight: 1400-1900 Atk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DARK monsters too? He must be running a Chaos deck.\" You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With Armageddon Knight's effect. Since I summoned him, I can send a DARK monster from my deck to my graveyard. I choose Plaguespreader Zombie.\" The man said as he sender his monster to the graveyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Dawn Knight, attack his Fairy Cheer Girl.\" The man ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn Knight launches to destroy Fairy Cheer Girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so. Activating Magic Cylinder! This trap card will deal you damage equal to your own monster's attack points.\" You explained as the cylinders redirect the attack right back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMystery Man: 5100<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because of that trap card, it's now pointless to attack with Armageddon Knight. Fine! I end my turn.\" The man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou draw you card to make your next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I use Fairy Cheer Girl's effect once again.\" You said as you draw your card which then interests you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is it. I activate Foolish Burial. This let's me send a monster from deck to my graveyard. I choose Athena.\" You said as you send the monster to the grave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, I'll play Call of the Haunted to bring her back to the field.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn amazon like warrior rises to the battlefield to confront her enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena: 2600 Atk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next, I banished Mercury from the graveyard. So, I can Special Summon.... .\" You keep on saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Not him!\" The man said as he now knows what you're about to summon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Come forth my greatest ally! MASTER HYPERION!!!\" You yelled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun then gotten brighter as a gold and black robe wearing fairy with flaming wings comes down to finish off his enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaster Hyperion: 2700 Atk<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man starts shaking in fear as he knows what this monster's capable of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now with Athena's effect, since a Fairy-type monster was summoned, you automatically lose 600 life points.\" You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena then took her staff and fires at the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMystery Man: 4500<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I use Master Hyperion'so effect. By banishing one LIGHT Fairy-type monster from graveyard, I can destroy your Dawn Knight.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not possible. I activate the Fiendish Chain trap card. This will make sure Master Hyperion can't use its effects and make an attack.\" The man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luckily, I've got this. Divine Punishment. This trap card will negate a card effect that you've just activated as long as The Sanctuary in the Sky is on the field.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! NO!!!\" The man said in fear as his trap card and monster are both destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Athena! Attack his Armageddon Knight!\" You ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena attacked and then destroys the dark knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMystery Man: 3800<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fairy Cheer Girl! Attack him directly!\" You ordered her to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFairy Cheer Girl flies and hit the man dead center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMystery Man: 1900<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This duel's over. Alright Master Hyperion. Finish him off!\" You declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaster Hyperion makes the final attack and you've just won the duel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMystery Man: 0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This- this isn't over yet. Not by a long shot. Master Mavric's plans will be realized. Just you wait!\" The man said as the seal took his soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before you can celebrate your victory, a card in your deck glowed. You picked it up and it's your Egyptian God Card, Ra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then see a portal opening up and you're about to pulled right into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on Earth?!\" You thought as you are pulled into the vortex and it closes on you and takes to who knows where.</span></div></div>",

Afterwards, your Egyptian God card, The Winged Dragon of Ra, started glowing and a portal opened and taking you in it. You seemed to pass out during the travel to wherever you are. You look to see that you're in a room. You get up and walked out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man. Where am I?\" You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked out of the place and see a bearded bald man with an arrow tattoo on his head and wearing some ancient clothing. The man sees you coming out and he goes to check to see if you're alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that you're finally awake, young man.\" The man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I am. Thank you uhhh?\" You said in wonder who this man is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tenzin. I am Tenzin. And you are?\" The man named Tenzin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm (name). How long was I out for?\" You asked while rubbing your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A couple of hours actually. I found you lying unconscious on the ground. So, I took you in. How are feeling by the way?\" Tenzin wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little better. Thank you Tenzin.\" You said politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My pleasure. Now tell me. What happened to you before I found you?\" Tenzin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, someone challenged me to a duel and I manged to win. But then, this portal came out of no where and I guess it brought me here. Where exactly is here by the way?\" You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are on Air Temple Island. Part of Republic City.\" Tenzin explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAir Temple Island? Republic City? You never heard of places like those before. This means only one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That portal must've sent me to another world. Because, I never heard of places like those before.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenzin looks at you with surprise. But, it could make sense now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that explains things. Well if you want, you can-.\" Tenzin stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bbbboooooooommmmmm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap! What was that?!\" You asked in panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be Korra.\" Tenzin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me. I'll introduce you to her.\" Tenzin suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Tenzin go to see where the explosion came from. You two see the area in smoke and ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sorry Tenzin.\" A female voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned and blushed madly as you see a dark-skinned girl with light blue eyes and a pony tail on the back and two more on the side of her head. She wears a light blue sleeveless shirt with armbands on her. She also wears dark blue saggy pants and brown boots. You feel your heart beat fast as you never seen a girl so beautiful before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this. What did you do now?\" Tenzin asked in disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kinda over did myself in that training session. Again, sorry.\" Korra said in embarrassment until she sees you. \"Hey Tenzin, who's this guy?\" Korra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I'm uh (name). Pleasure to meet you.\" You said as you took you hand out to Korra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you too. I'm Korra.\" Korra greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already told him your name. Now, why don't you take a break? I'll clean this up.\" Tenzin suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I'm gonna go meet up with Mako, Bolin and Asami. (Name). How about you come with me?\" Korra asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Korra left to go see her friends. Tenzin notices the reaction you made when you first saw Korra. Tenzin smiled at what he thinks is going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that someone is in love with the Avatar.\" Tenzin thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Korra walked around Republic City and you like the views of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is amazing.\" You said amusingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never been here before?\" Korra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No not really.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Korra!\" Someone called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then see a boy with black hair, golden eyes and brown clothing with a red scarf. There's another boy with also black hair but with green eyes and dark green clothing. You finally see a girl with dark hair, lime eyes, a black and red dress and dark red lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mako! Bolin! Asami! What's up?\" Korea greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. Just waiting for you.\" Asami said as she then sees you. \"Who's your new friend?\" Asami wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right! (Name), this is Asami, Mako and Bolin.\" Korra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there.\" Mako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the group.\" Bolin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasure to meet you.\" Asami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Korea went with Mako, Bolin and Asami around the city. You then thought back on your duel with the man that used the Seal of Orichalcos on you before. You pushed that thought behind you for now and just hang out for a while. You and the others went to a local store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's grab some snacks while we're here.\" Korra suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing.\" Bolin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you went in with the others, you see a man in a hood walking into a alleyway. You don't have good feeling about that guy. So, you decided to check it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys! You go on without me. There's something I gotta see first. I'll be right back.\" You said before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Korra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned into the alleyway and found the hooded man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you! What are you doing in here? And why do you have that familiar feeling that I'm sensing?\" You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha! I was hoping you would show up.\" The man said evilly as he took out his duel disk, thus shocking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a duelist? Here?\" You asked in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. And now, I've got you where I want you.\" The man said putting a card the field spell zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA green beam came around him and expanded towards you. You then see green symbols around it and lines starts forming a big green glowing star in the middle. You were shocked as you know what this is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Seal of Orichalcos?! That means your working for Mavric.\" You suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct (name). And now your fate is sealed. Now, let's duel.\" The man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, I don't have my duel disk with me.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen your arm started to glow and your duel disk just appeared on your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how that happened. But, I don't care right now. Let's duel Freak.\" You said as you activated you duel disk.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Alright, so this story is meant for anyone looking for an actual story and less of a simple pornography in writing form. This is more about the story than the actual adult content; meant to embrace and pull readers into the story with their favorite characters rather than throwing them into bed for no readily apparent reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, even if you do this, you should realize that you can't show it *points to PG-13 rating*. Now, hugs, kisses, cuddling, everything like that I will be including and is, of course, perfectly acceptable. Not much of a romance if there isn't some heartfelt touching going on is there? The same don't over do it rules apply, not as much though since this isn't a big deal at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, here are some basic rules:<br>\r\n-Put your chapters in the appropriate section.<br>\r\n-Do not disobey the choices from the previous chapter. If you don't like them, maybe you should've written that chapter.<br>\r\n-Keep the chapters a decent length. Minimum 2 paragraphs, aside from the ones that simply involve making a choice as to what character/world/etc... at the very beginning.<br>\r\n-Use grammar for god's sake. Poor quality additions will be deleted without a second thought. Seriously. Its called SPELL CHECK.<br>\r\n-No fetishes in this one. This means NO: *Feet fetish *Fart fetish *Feces fetish *Fish fetish (Okay, now I'm just making up more F-word fetishes. Let's move on)<br>\r\n-Unless it fits in the world the characters are from (obviously) you cannot gain supernatural powers. For example, don't pick a character from, say, Star Fox and start flying around like you're from Dragonball Z. That aside, the stories would be semi-dull and very cliche if you were a damsel in distress the entire way through the story so... don't be afraid to have the reader actually, you know, do things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, that should be about it. Follow those rules and we'll have no problems. As a side note, if you find a chapter that violates one of these rules, tell me and I'll be sure to get on it right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>UPDATE 9/13/14</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm back bitches. That is all. I'd say more, but words mean nothing after years of absence. I'll simply say these three things:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-New chapters are about to surge all over this thing over the coming weeks<br>\r\n-The culling of poorly-written chapters begins now<br>\r\n-This thing is gonna be the best story on Writing.com before I'm done.</td>",
