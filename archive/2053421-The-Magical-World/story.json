He had conquered Hungary, Poland, Austria, Serbia, Croatia, Pomerania, Masovia and Lithuania. Through loyal lieutenants, diplomacy and treachery; the man they called the Silver King was on the verge of victory. The city of Aachen stood before him. He was so close to the day he had waited for all his life. He had reformed the Teutonic Knights into a new force, the Premyslid Knights. He had instituted new laws, granting membership to the Premyslid Knights to all monks, illegitimate sons and youngest sons of men inside his Empire. Wenceslaus had enjoyed 10 coronations to formalise his rule in each conquered land. He wore an Imperial crown, that was recognised neither by Rome nor Constantinople. But once Emperor Louis fell, Wenceslaus would call the Imperial Diet and have himself installed Emperor. He would reform matters by adding electors from the lands he conquered, both temporal and spiritual. From then onwards, he would be the true Emperor. The rebels, who had defied him, were now part of Louis's army. Louis alone, stood him and conquest. But Louis wasn't fighting alone. His great enemy Philip of France was fighting with him, the Dauphin John and Lord Kent of England.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWenceslaus was pleased to see so many enemies gathered here. His army was one of the largest assembled on the continent for some time. Fourty Five Thousand men, comprised of 5,000 men from 9 lands, confronting the Imperial\u2010French\u2010Anglo Alliance of only Twelve Thousand. Wenceslaus had brought siege weapons with him, if necessary. Aachen would soon fall. The thought pleased the elderly man as he called his men to war. Leading the army was his heir, Premsyl Otakar, Prince of Pest. Once Aachen fell, Premsyl Otakar would be made King of Hungary. Premsyl was the greatest of his sons (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenceslaus_II_of_Bohemia\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenceslaus...</a>). He had 3 other sons, Wenceslaus the Worthless, John the Brave and Boleslau the Brilliant. John and Boleslau were also commanders in his army. John led the Polish division, while Boleslau led the Masovian. Prince Wenceslaus had been too scared to come. He would rather try to usurp the founding university rights of John who built the universities of Prague, Krakow, Pest, Warsaw and Pozsony. Premsyl smiled to his father \"Victory awaits, my Emperor!\" \"Then make it so, young King!\" replied Wenceslaus. It had always been a private joke between them as Wenceslaus fathered him before his 21st birthday (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/2054376-The-Czech-Ascendancy\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/ite...</a>).</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wenceslaus entered Aachen. Louis and Phillip had fled like cowards. He had taken Duke John of Normandy and Lord Kent of England captive. But the battle had been bloody and worse of all, his 3 sons had died. Wenceslaus felt an impotent rage at the turn in fortune. His eldest Premysl had one adult son : Ottokar from his late wife Elizabeth of Toss. Wenceslaus knew that he would have to be succeeded by Ottokar. He hoped the young scion of the Arpads would have his son's strength. But Ottokar was not always in the best of health. It was the reason why he was not in this campaign. Wenceslaus debated with himself as he rode through the streets how he should deal with this situation. And what he should do to the Duke, the heir to Phillip's throne? The Duke was a man of honour. He would be an invaluable ally as the new King of France (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_II_of_France\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_II_of...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Wenceslaus didn't see him willingly betraying his father. He could offer to ransom him for land and money. On the other hand, he could remove a great enemy here and now. With Phillip's heir gone, there was an opportunity for King Edward to continue his battle for France. He wanted to hurt Dauphin John, Duke of Normandy. After Sluys and Saint-Omer (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Saint-Omer\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_...</a>) were decisive victories for England, Wenceslaus was prepare to recognise Edward as King of France and England. Instead a truce was held, thus the King's unpopular uncle Edmund was sent to help the French. Edmund had to fake his own death to give King Edward the motivation to murder his supposedly magical stepfather Roger Mortimer, Earl of March. But Lord Kent was not the issue as present. It was Duke John, whose fate King Wenceslaus had to decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn of Normandy chafed under his bonds. What right did the Bohemian King have to do this? \"You are married to my granddaughter!\" He turned to face the would-be Emperor. \"My granddaughter is pregnant, back in Normandy! Your son will soon be born. Consider your own importance!\" observed Wenceslaus. \"I will not betray my father!\" he responded. \"And what about your wife, my granddaughter? What about my great-grandsons Charles and Louis? Do you not owe them your honour, love and protection? Phillip is called the Fortunate. He is indeed fortunate to have a second son in the Duke of Orleans. Because if you don't consider my offer, he will name Phillip of Orleans as the next King of France. Think about it, while I consider whether to ransom you!\" replied Wenceslaus. \"You will never be Emperor!\" declared John. \"And you will never be King of France if you keep speaking like this!\" retorted Wenceslaus as he departed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWenceslaus left the room, debating how to proceed. The intransigence of John was infuriating. More to the point, he appeared to be an implacable enemy. Should he try to ransom the heir to the throne of France? He decided that it was probably best to get some assistance with this. He opened a guest room, where Lord Kent was held. Uncle of King Edward and son of two boys and one girl, he was a powerful, yet unwanted member of the Royal Family. How he was able to fake his death remained unknown, but somehow it had happened, allowing King Edward to overthrow Lord March, his mother's lover and resume personal rule of his Kingdom. Edmund Crouchback watched the Emperor with semi-opened eyes. He wasn't sure what to make of the elderly man.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lionel shook his head as he went over the finances. Lionel had never been one for extravagance and nothing had changed. The death of his father\u2010in\u2010law Galleazzo and the injuries sustained by Galleazzo's brother Bernabo had in effect made him the Duke of both Clarenceand Milan. Or rather it did since he paid the ridiculous sum of 150,000 florins from that muggle Emperor Karl. Gian was still a teenager and incapable of ruling. The della Scala who ruled Verona and Vicenza had fled to Ravenna, the ancient capital of Rome. Lionel was still occupied in rebuilding the new Duchy. His son Matteo was still being watched by his child mother Violante. Violante was a pretty and stupid girl. Using the Confudus and Memory Charms, combined with a curse he created called the Imperius Curse; Violante remained unaware of his true nature. Unlike the rest of his brothers Lionel had learned to master his power. Edward, John, Edmund and Thomas were all Squibs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot an ounce of magic in any of them. To his disappointment, his daughter Phillippa was as powerless as anyone. Violante's successful pregnancy was due to Lionel's great magic. Lionel had sent word that he was dead to his father King Edward to ensure that he was not exposed. Somehow his older brother Edward of Cornwall knew about him. Prince Edward already had two blasted sons. Yet another Edward and Richard. Richard named after the Lionheart. Of course, many people knew he still lived; but it meant nothing. Between the two Edwards and Richard, there were too many claimants for the throne. Or at least there was right now. Lionel was not concerned at the moment. He was determined to make himself King of Italy. With his formidable power and with a powerful army, he could see himself taking advantage of several situations to become the new Emperor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, who knew how far he would travel?. \"What is it, Gian?\" he asked in Gian's native tongue. \"Leo, my uncle Bernabo is unwell!\" he declared. \"And what of it?\" repeated Leo, still going through his notes. \"You have such knowledge of healing, I was hoping that...\" Lionel rose, catching the boy by surprise. \"Young Gian, you must learn now how our world works. Bernabo's illness allows our power to grow. Let him continue to rut offspring and stay out of our way to accomplish our ambitions of power. His weakness is not our concern! One day, this city will be under your stewardship. Your father understood how power worked, you must do the same!\" he declared. \"But...\" \"Either you learn or one day Bernabo will destroy you. Go Gian!\" he declared. Lionel watch Gian leave in disgust. The boy's sentimentality was blinding him the power that awaited him. \"Be careful, Lionel! Your lust of power may unhinge you!\" warned an old man, entering the room. \"Another lecture, Cadmus?<br>\r\nYour uncles died in foolishness, so I should be cautious so I can die like your dead Daddy; Ignotus? Bah!\" he responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am 125 years old, Lionel! I have seen many great wizards rise and fall! If you fly to close to the sun, you will be signed and inflamed to death!\" he continued. \"Do you have it?\" demanded Lionel. Cadmus Peverell sighed and nodded, limped with his cane towards the English Duke. \"Here!\" he offered. Lionel beamed as he looked at it. The key to his victory in Italy. Floo Powder! Using this device, Lionel was certain that he could transport an army to Corsica. Once Corsica was taken, he could take Sardinia. Before the arrogant Aragonese were aware, he would take Sicily. The remaining cities would fall and he would compel the Pope by magical force to make him the new King of Italy. As the King of Italy, he would build his power, until it was uncontested. After that, France and the Empire would bow before his power. Then England would follow.</span></div></div>",

The Boleyns had always hated her, because her father Thomas was<br>\r\nadopted by Sir William when he was a boy. Her father Thomas Boleyn, the squib. The Earl of Wiltshire\u2019s true name was Thomas Gaunt,<br>\r\ngiven to Sir William at birth, when it was discovered he was a Squib. Ironically, two of Sir William\u2019s sons John and Anthony had to<br>\r\nfake their deaths as children, when it was discovered the Boleyn boys were wizards. Nicholas Potter adopted them and later his<br>\r\ndaughters married them. She had always felt like an outsider. Her vapid older siblings Mary and George always seemed so happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough George was born after her, he still treated her like she was younger, following her accident. It still galled her that she<br>\r\nlost 6 years of her life due to her father\u2019s foolishness. She deeply missed her late parents. The Gaunts wanted nothing to do with her,<br>\r\ndue to her half\u2010blood status. They had only taken her in, due to the promise of gold, which her father gave out of obligation more than<br>\r\nanything else. She was able to buy a wand from Olivander\u2019s. And despite no actual training, she soon surpassed the Gaunts in ability.<br>\r\nShe took a position at Olivander\u2019s; despite the horror of her father. She enjoyed making wands, it allowed her to focus and accelerate<br>\r\nher skills. She could honestly say the only good thing about being with the Gaunts was being with her sons. Henry and Richard were<br>\r\ngrowing into formidable young wizards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth were currently at Hogwarts. Henry was in his third year, Richard in his second year. It was hard for them as both boys were born<br>\r\npremature and only 5 months apart. Richard desperately wanted to go to Hogwarts early, but Anne wouldn't have it. She remember having<br>\r\nto endure the memory that Henry was miscarried. She was still a little mad at Jarleth Hobart, who used a Memory Charm to make her think <br>\r\nthat she miscarried Henry and that Richard was stillborn. The unusual nature of their births had led her friend Druella Potter,<br>\r\nNicholas' daughter, to suggest that her magic had traveled into her womb to make the boys. She didn't know if it was true but it<br>\r\ndidn't really matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you want to do this? I mean, my father knows Dominic Rosier, the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot. He is looking for any<br>\r\nreason to go after the Gaunts. They made a big deal of his mother being a half\u2010blood. Casting such a powerful transfiguration spell on<br>\r\na Muggle King is...\" \"He is dying, Druella! He murdered my best friend! He would have murdered me if I didn't somehow cast a Gemino<br>\r\nCurse and disapparated out of my prison! And I did it without a wand! So if I can do that, I can cast this transfiguration spell on<br>\r\nhim!\" she responded. \"Anne Boleyn, I'm your best friend! If you do this, the Wizengamot could assemble a gathering to get you! Think<br>\r\nabout the boys!\" she pleaded. \"I have thought about them. And I must do this!\" declared Anne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Druella could say anything else, Anne was gone. Walking through the Palace of Whitehall was difficult as the two Charms weaved<br>\r\naround her would not prevent a Muggle from touching her. If she was touched, the Concealment and Disillusionment Charms would likely<br>\r\ncount for nothing. She remembered the book she read on the Confuding Charm. She waved her wand, watching as a number of servants seemed<br>\r\nconfused. She decided to practise a charm she had been working on. \"Opturbo\" she thought in her mind. To her amazement, a few of the<br>\r\nservant girls looked nervous. One of the males scratched his hand nervously. A few began sweating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne moved quickly as the servants seemed distracted by something around them. A number of them wondered around confused. She held her<br>\r\nmirror in her right hand, her wand in her left as she made her way to the King's Chambers. She opened the door, waving a terrible curse<br>\r\non the men and women inside. \"Leave!\" she commanded. As one, the attendants moved away. Anne began casting a number of charm, hexes,<br>\r\njinxes and curses to keep away anyone who would enter. She approached the man, engorging and fat as he was. \"Oh Henry! What have you<br>\r\ndone to yourself? You were once so glorious! Truly our Lord and Saviour has indeed, inflected upon thee a most terrible affliction. I<br>\r\nwill now continue it in a different form!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne took a breath, waving her wand against the mirror. Isabel Carew was sleeping, recovering from a brief bout of fever. Isabel Carew<br>\r\nwas the daughter of former favourite Sir Nicholas Carew. Unbenownst to many, all of Carew's children were Henry's. Isabel was the twin<br>\r\nof Francis Carew, an energetic young knight. Sir Francis wanted her to marry the son of a MP of the Commons, Nicholas Saunders. Isabel<br>\r\nwanted to be a nun, impossible since the dissolution of the monasteries. She wanted to leave for the Continent and serve God. Her<br>\r\nbrother would never allow that to happen. Anne waved her wand and the pensieve left her Chanerie and went through the mirror. She<br>\r\nfocused on the mind of Isabel and weaved the spell. Her memories flowed into the Pensieve. \"Choose!\" she whispered. Isabel stated in<br>\r\nher sleep. \"I want to serve God, in this life or the next!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne waited until the Pensieve was full before summoning it back. She focused first on Isabel then on Henry. \"Res Verto!\" she cried.<br>\r\nThe light filled both rooms. Anne weaved a Shield Charm around her as a loud bang threw her back. She rose quickly, seeing her wand and<br>\r\nhearing voices. She leapt on the wand, swiftly casting her spells. She twirled the wand around her, removing all traces of what had<br>\r\nhappened. With a quick snap, she was gone. She found herself in Bedgebury Forest, not far from the estates of the Carews. She took a<br>\r\nmoment to breathe before she fortified herself. She checked the pensieve was there. To her relief, it was there and intact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe disapparated back into Isabel's chambers. She focused her wand, chanting \"Legilimens!\" She was delighted by what she saw. She<br>\r\npulled out before she saw what she feared. \"This is for you Jane, my faithful friend!\" she declared. She grabbed Isabel's hand and they<br>\r\nfound themselves in Bedgebury. Isabel was still asleep, Anne was relieved that a Memory Charm and Stunning Spell was not required. She<br>\r\nwas not as proficient at Stunning as she would like. It was one of the two more basic spells she struggled with, Disarming being the<br>\r\nother. She turned to Isabel still sleeping and whispering \"Caldor Corpus\" followed by \"Nudo Corpus!\" She paused to watch as Isabel<br>\r\nglowed blue as her clothes removed themselves from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was traditional for Muggle women to sleep without clothes. It struck her as indecent that Isabel wore nightgowns which were highly<br>\r\nimmoral. Perhaps this was to be expected of a young nun? Anne was not a Papist and was not clear if this was expected now of those who<br>\r\nfollowed Rome. Regardless she took a moment to examine the young 18 year old. Isabel had celebrated her the anniversary of her 18th<br>\r\nyear, two weeks earlier. Anne sighed, drinking in her beauty. \"I still love you, Henry. Even after what you did to me and Jane! Sweet<br>\r\ndreams, my King!\" she declared as she left Isabel Carew formerly Henry the Eighth King of England, France and Wales and Lord of Ireland<br>\r\nto rest, exposed under a tree.</span></div></div>",

She examined the Pensieve. The memories of two people lay within. She could examine what happened between Henry and Jane. But she was terrified of what she would see. She shook her head, looking for her chanerie. It was a gift that Henry gave her after Elizabeth was. Born. Anne still shook at the thought of her precious girl calling Parr mother. Jane would have taken care of her, she didn't trust Catherine Parr to do that. Jane, cousin Catherine and Parr; wives 2, 4 and 5 of Henry. She somehow didn't think about Cleves. Poor girl never had a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could imagine the conversation between herself and Cromwell about it. Poor Cromwell, for all that he did, he paid a high price. Was he Wolsey's son? She suspected something like that. She heard him say Wolsey's name as he gave his final speech. He was unafraid when his time came. He even saw her as he knelt down. He wasn't even surprised. Maybe old Cromwell knew the truth all along. Knowing the old devil that didn't surprise her in the slightest. But reminiscing about old foes was pointless. Today was all about the beautiful Isabel Carew. She felt a stab of anger as she contemplated removing the protective charms that kept her safe from men. But she wanted justice not revenge. At least for now. So she ate swiftly before disapparating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe forest was beautiful and green, it seemed to Anne. She brought a second wand, should she need it. Isabel was still dozing and for a brief moment, Anne felt a powerful urge to take her home and make love all day long. She forced herself to think of Jane, her dearest friend. Abused by her father and brothers, murdered by their husband so he could marry Cousin Howard, though he married that poor German princess. Jane; who unlike Cromwell, uncle Norfolk and her lecherous family; didn't work with Henry to obliterate her. Anne's name was so black that their goal was heartily accomplished. She might not be able to touch the late Earl of Essex or Uncle Norfolk, but Henry and the Seymour brothers she could. And she would. A tremor went through her. She knew that King Henry's body inhabited by Isabel Carew had stopped working. Isabel Carew could now serve as a nun in the next life. Now Henry would learn about having sons. She took out her wand and cast the necessary charms, jinxes, hexes, enchantments and curses. She was ready now to see Isabel Carew in her full, luscious glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe King opened her eyes, adjusting to the light poorly. She shifted and lifted her hand above her forehead. \"Is....is this paradise?\" He wondered. He gasped when he heard his own voice before staring at his hands. He groped at her face, seeking his old fat visage, instead she was greeted by softer, effeminate features. She looked down, but her view was obstructed by large, perfectly formed mounds emanating from her chest.She rose swiftly, backing against a tree that made her yelp.\"I can walk? What is happening?\" she gasped, almost shrilly. She ran, wincing as her bare feet hit the ground, acorns and sticks stabbing her soles. She fell near a brook. She looked down as recoiled. A beautiful tall blonde looked back at her. \"C\u2010Catherine?\" She stammered. \"My, my! What a naughty girl you are, Isabel! Running around as bare as a strumpet!\" remarked a cold voice behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the iciness of that remark, Henry recognised that intoxicating voice. The woman he had lusted over for some years. The woman who couldn't bare him a son. That snarky b**** Anne Boleyn. She spun around, shocked to see Anne again. She wore the same dress she had when they married. Her jewels were the same. It was her. \"Isabel, it seems terribly unbecoming of so goodly a woman to go for such a public display. Especially one that hopes to wear the veil of a wife?\" she observed. \"Anne? Is it truly you?\" she gasped, unable to process what transpired. \"It is, Isabel. And what will your brother say, you running around the forest like a harlot selling her wares? Sir Nicholas would spin around oft in his grave, to see such things from his youngest daughter, Isabel Carew!\" she observed. Henry almost recoiled into the brook. Isabel Carew...his ex\u2010lover Catherine Carew's daughter and one of the many bastards he didn't acknowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isabel, you truly are acting less like a lady and more like a wanton harlot. Should not a girl of your education show respect towards a Sovereign? Perhaps your future husband can assault some sense into you!\" declared Anne, using her most imperial tone. Henry reacted as a former King would. \"How dare you speak to me like this? I am King Henry, son of....\" But she was cut off by Anne's hysterical laughter. \"Y\u2010You AHAHAHAHA a Kingggg! HAHAHAHAHA! With s\u2010so large a bust AHAHAHAHA!\" she exclaimed, stuttering in amusement, her laughter chilling Isabel to the core. \"What if no one believes me? She said future husband! No; no this won't happen!\" thought Isabel, her fury began to overwhelm her fear again. Anne wiped away a few tears from her own eyes, still giggling as she faced Isabel. \"Clearly the air against your head and womanhood has impacted on your mental acumen! My late husband left his world a few hours ago! And though I perceived him to be quite small despite that I had no other visual upon which to make the comparison; he was larger than you!\" She remarked, pointing between Isabel's young thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabel quickly moved a hand to shield it from Anne's sight, glaring hatefully at the ex Squib. \"That won't protect it from your husband embrace! After all, he was need sons before he takes a Mistress. I imagine you will mother many sons for him as is your want!\" she observed. \"Anne return me to my true form! With speed!\" She demanded. Anne paused, her eyes lacking warmth, before she erupted with laughter. Unable to endure the taunting, Isabel rushed the former Queen. It was to no avail as Isabel rolled on the ground, laughing and clutching her ribs. Anne watched Isabel as the Tickling Charm ran through her. Druella had been the willing recipient of her practicing the Charm. With Druella, it was as if Jane had returned to her. Jane Seymour remained her great, late friend; who this blonde hysterical madwoman had murdered for an ugly German princess and cousin Catherine. Catherine Howard had always seemed contrary even as a child. She could recite Papist chapters in Latin, converse in French and Greek and could write great poetry. But she could appear foolish and unable to understand basic things. Perhaps it had been a clever act, but Henry eventually saw through it. To the detriment of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabel finally stopped laughing, her ribs still in her hands. \"Your brother will be here soon. He will have found your clothes. He will find a piece of writing that will confirm your defiance. He will be truly mad. Enjoy your fate, 'Henry, King of England, Wales and France, Lord of Ireland'\" she mocked as she disapparated. She had no desire to see Isabel punished by her brother. Her Isabel memories would soon return, driving her mad. Jane Seymour was avenged.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>19 January, 1549<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas Seymour cursed his luck again as he waited for the axe. He had tried for glory and failed. If only he could have married the pretty Princess. But all the tickling and spanking he imparted, did not lead Elizabeth to yield. His attempt to take her by force was thwarted by that insipid Kat Ashley. His final grasp of power has resulted in dismal failure. If only, that stupid dog had been quiet, King Edward would have been his. \"Luck has been against you, Baron Suddeley!\" remarked a voice. Thomas gasped, looking around for the source of the voice. It couldn't be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't see the dead, Thomas. You will learnt that, tomorrow!\" taunted the voice. \"You can't hurt me! You're dead!\" cried Thomas, his voice full of fear. \"Nor can you hurt my daughter or her brother, Thomas. The oven is waiting for you!\" Thomas was by his own admission, a headstrong, confident man filled with prideful arrogance. But the day before your execution, the ghost of a dead Queen you helped kill, threatens you with hell; that would terrify any man. \"There is a way to escape Death, Thomas. But you must accept it without explanation. How confident are you, that you can rise again?\" asked the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it is in your power, Queen Anne than make it so! Otherwise, you are...\" The words never left Thomas' throat as he was on fire. The flames were burning each part of his body as he flew away. Terror surrounded him as he past a traven brawl in progress. \"Fight!\" he told himself as he waited for hell. A beautiful woman lay on the bed before him, Thomas wished he could indulge before he realised that he was indeed, headed for her. \"HEUH!\" gasped Thomas as he stood up, wearily. He soon fell down, unable to keep up. He look at the ceiling, it was very low. He look around, it seemed familiar. \"Get up, Thomas!\" he told himself, before he shrieked. This wasn't his voice. He forced himself up, almost collapsing again. His hands..they were daintier, but more coarse. He...had growths out of his chest! He stumbled a little, realising he wore a dress until he spied a small mirror. Then he screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne beamed as she said \"Goodbye, Estella!\" \"Goodbye my Queen! I only hope Baron Suddeley enjoys his new life. I am just glad I can die so heroically.\" exclaimed Estella. Anne beamed at the now ex-prostitute. \"Redeemed in full!\" she declared as she disappeared. Anne felt a little guilty that Estella had to die. But it was needed, so that Seymour could suffer. When his brother fell, he too would endure the pain of his actions. At least Estella was free, poor girl. And she would die, believing that she was saving a life, which was true. Even if Death would have been preferable to Thomas Seymour. She reappeared at Catherine Willoughby, Dowager Duchess of Suffolk's home (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://irishpost.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/rebekah-wainwright-n.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://irishpost.co.uk/wp-content/upload...</a>). The Duchess was busy preparing a letter. \"Why am I stuck with this child? I never wanted guardianship of the Queen Dowager's baby!\" wrote an indignant Duchess, before throwing the letter away. Anne was shocked, both that the lady Suffolk was rejecting a baby and that she was actually writing a letter. She cast a Memory Charm on Lady Suffolk, before heading to thw nursery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't she beautiful?\" exclaimed Anne as she showed the beautiful baby to her dear friend Druella. \"She is! Who is she?\" asked Druella. \"She's my daughter Mary Boleyn, named after my sister and stepdaughter!\" exclaimed Anne. Druella watched her friend, aware of some of her propensity. \"What was her birth name?\" \"It is Mary!\" expressed Anne, wearily. \"Like Mary Seymour?\" opined Driella, her expression stony. \"Willoughby didn't want her! I lost my daughter who Parr nearly allowed to be raped by that cod, Seymour! For all I know, she tried to do so with my Elizabeth! I will be a good mother to Mary! Look she feeds from me, already!\" noted Anne. Druella's face remained pursed before she nodded. \"Beware of Hobart!\" she warned as she made them all milk. Anne had barely had the chance to feed Elizabeth. There were wet nurses for that. Feeding baby Mary and seeing that look in her eye, made Anne happier than she had been in a while. It was draining for Anne, so she used the Replenishing Charm. Soon Mary felt asleep. \"You are playing with fire, Anne.\" Anne turned to see her closest friend, Druella still showing her displeasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't she beautiful?\" cooed Anne. \"Anne, you need to think about what you are doing! It's one thing to punish a dying King and a condemned man. But to kidnap a baby! That is something that...\" \"Willoughby will receive money for her trouble. And she is in trouble. She is in incredible financial duress! I have made Galleons at my wand shop! I even have a philosopher's stone! This child will die in Willoughby's care, I know it! I lost my Elizabeth, can't I have my baby?\" interrupted Anne, tears flowing from her face. Druella sighed, wrapping her arms around the former Queen. \"Be careful Anne! I won't tell anyone. But you will have a hard time, explaining this to Henry and Richard!\" pointed out Druella.</span></div></div>",

Despite the relatively short period between each's other's birth; Henry was already a year ahead in Ravenclaw House. He had come to loathe the Headmistress Elizabeth Burke, who openly celebrated the Slytherin victory in the House Cup. He was a beater in Ravenclaw's Quidditch team and had silently cursed the Gryffindor Seeker who won victory for them in the Quidditch Cup. Henry had become protective of his younger brother, who was a more studious type. Richard had developed a tendency to use more aggressive tactics when dealing with bullies. Henry had to use several Memory Charms when Richard used the Reductor curse to shatter part of a wall, which splintered into the faces of several bullies. Fortunately, Ravenclaw's Head of House Marcus Vulpus was able to correct the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry liked Professor Vulpus, the Charms professor, greatly. Despite being 15 years older than the Slytherin Headmistress; he showed loyalty to the younger woman and admonished anyone who disrespected the Head Teacher. He suspected that Professor Vulpus knew that Richard was responsible, but allowed him the benefit of doubt. \"Now don't forget Richard, that Mama has a new baby, Mary! And Mary is less than a year old. So be nice to our new sister!\" warned Henry. \"I am not a dolt, big brother. I won't mistreat the new \"Elizabeth\"!\" responded Richard. \"Brother, I know that you miss the sister we never knew. But Mama loves this new baby and so should we! Aren't you glad, Mama didn't meet us like you wanted her not to!\" noted Henry. \"You didn't wish her to greet us either, brother. Besides, we got to meet those two beautiful Parkinson sisters, Charlotte and Matilda!\" observed Richard, smiling. Henry beamed in reply, before shaking his head. \"We are half-bloods, brother! We could never land girls like that!\" he pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard scowled at the word. \"The wizard Jovan Ekrizdis was half-blood! Look what he accomplished!\" Henry turned on his brother, who recoiled a little. \"Brother. do not mention that name again! He was amongst the worst of wizards! The descendant of the insane Herpo the Foul Ekrizdis and Merwyn the Malicious Gaunt; he was infamous for breeding Dementors and having no less than 5 Horcruxes! They say he even killed Uncle Arthur! You must never mention that name again! Surely there will never be a more Dark wizard than he!\" exclaimed Henry. \"Ok, brother, peace! I am just saying that being half-blood shouldn't be a terrible thing! As much as it pains me, we are the grandsons of a muggle King!\" Both Henry and Richard had come to an agreement, never to mention their father in public. Both held him in the highest contempt for his attempt to murder their mother. Both boys longed though, to see their younger brother Edward and their sister Elizabeth. Their older half-brother Henry Fitzroy, Duke of Richmond and Somerset worked at Hogwarts as the Head of Slytherin House and Professor of Transfiguration, the only vampire at Hogwarts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Henry! Richard! How much you have both grown, my darlings!\" expressed Anne, holding their new sister. Both boys greeted their Mother, neither enjoying the embrace. Henry turned to his new sister. \"May I hold her, Mama?\" he asked. \"Of course, my dear!\" replied Anne, handing him the baby. Richard observed the child, thinking there is no way this is Mama's baby. Richard wondered who this baby actually was. And more importantly, how it could benefit him? Richard had been working steadily on developing his knowledge base. He had recently been an expert with Fudio or the Stinging Jinx. He was also learning how to perform a Blasting Curse. Richard was determined to rise despite his half-blood status. He knew that he could never be Chief Warlock of the Wizemgamot, but there were other positions available. Like Headmaster of Hogwarts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry held the beautiful baby, thrilled to have a new sister. It was obvious that she was a Squib. But that hardly mattered. Henry was determined to be the best brother he could be. But lately he worried about Richard and Edward. Richard had developed an unhealthy interest in power and the Dark Arts. He didn't like how few friends, Richard had. Henry resolved to spend more time with his siblings while he was here. He noted how happy Mama was. Then become aware of the light in her eyes when Druella appeared. Henry knew that his mother's feelings for Jane Seymour never really left her. But he did wonder if she realised that she was falling for Druella. He noticed her diary and move quickly to hide it. He worried about what was in there and how Richard would react to it.</span></div></div>",

He could see the line of his grandfather, ending with Elizabeth. Whatever else, he couldn't allow that to happen. He pondered how he could stop it. And could it have something to do with what was in his mother's diary. He was determined to learn what the contents of the diary was. He took his wand and focused his mind. Though many had yet to master disapparition, he had been able to do it since he was 12. He opened his eyes and spotted the diary, hidden behind the book. \"Accio Mama's diary!\" he whispered. The diary flew into his hands. His eyes widened as he read what his mother had been doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard re-read the diary again, just to be sure. So he knew the truth now. His mother's power was greater than even she realised. That led to another question. Specifically about Edward. Could his illness have been an inversion of his natural power? He read about things like that. But could Mama have accidentally created him to protect Jane Seymour from Papa? Richard left his sleeping family as he prepared for his great journey. He looked at the potions he had with him. They would do the trick. The only question remained was who should he visit?</span></div></div>",

Would the true religion ever return to England? Why did Edward insist on being a Pope-King? Didn't what happened to their father show what happened when you became mad with power? But Edward was stubborn and sent another demand on her conversion to heathenism, even offering to move Elizabeth behind her on the line of succession. Her father had rightly made her second to her brother in the line, and soon if rumours of Edward's health remained the same, she would be Queen. But Mary would rather have a nation of the true faith than succeed on the back of her darling, little brother's corpse. It ate at her that her mother and Jane Seymour were gone. And her dear stepmother Catherine. Why did everyone she love, die? Even her great enemy Anne Boleyn loved Jane Seymour. How could so much pain have happen to the nation of the Lionheart?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa is to blame!\" Mary turned around, screaming silently. Her voice was gone. What had happened? And who...could her father have returned from the dead? \"Hello Mary. You know who I am. I am Richard Tudor, your brother. I died a few months before Papa killed my mother, Anne Boleyn. Or so you thought!\" he declared. Mary stared at the boy. He looked so much like her father. Could he be Anne Boleyn's bastard son? \"My parents were married, sister. But our father has failed us! Now he rots in Hell for his hatred!\" declared Richard. Mary stared at him, not sure to understand any of this. \"He killed my mother to take Jane Seymour. Then killed Jane Seymour to have Catherine Howard. He is a devil from Hell! Now he is there! Mary...you must resist any pressure Edward puts on you! Both he and Elizabeth can be brought back to the Faith. But not with Somerset, Warwick, Dorset, Southhampton and Lord St John in charge! You must not allow this, Mary! The Holy See needs reform, but not like this! This faith was done to increase the powers of the King unnaturally. Whatever happens next, you must save England! Please Mary!\" pleaded Richard, before he disapparated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard smiled as he held his Time- Turner. Everything was going as it had to. He appeared in the chambers of John Dudley, Lord Warwick. Dudley slept peacefully as Richard cast the Imperius Curse on him. Dudley stirred before going back to sleep. Richard weave memories and thoughts into his mind. Sweat fell down Richard's face. This was critical for the future, Richard understood what was needed. It was the only way to save his family. He smiled as it was done. He clicked on the Time Turner and he disappeared. Jane Seymour's brother, Edward Seymour, Lord Somerset was also at rest, no doubt pleased to be without his siblings. Richard felt intense hate towards Edward Seymour. Now he weaved the same curse and implanted new memories in Seymour's mind. Warwick and Somerset would fight each other for control of Edward. When it was over, both would be destroyed and Mary would be the new Queen of England. Richard had little time for Faith. But he would change the history of the Tudors, one way or another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard had little time for the elder sisters of Mary Grey. Not an inch of rational thought in either of them. Jane was all learning and Catherine was all charm. He was disappointed to see the little girl (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Mary_Grey\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Mary_...</a>) was ugly, slight deformed and possibility a dullard. Richard paused before casting a few charms on her. He focused on the Beauty Charm, Engorgement Charm on her brain and body and Enlargement Charm. These Charms were not intended to be taught to children his age. That did not change the importance of the spell. Mary Grey needed a husband. And Richard had the perfect husband in mind. It had to be something that would give the Tudor's the advantage. Young John Edward Seymour was less than a year old. Marriage between them would cause great anger in Warwick. And that was all that was needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was about to disapparate, he realised that Catherine Grey was sleeping close by. Another thought occurred to him. He could intensify the hatred by arranging a marriage between the heir of Somerset and Catherine. A series of spells entered the minds of Lord Dorset, Henry Grey and his 3 daughters: Jane, Catherine and Mary. He could imagine the anger of both Somerset and Warwick, if Dorset played them against each other. Between all this fighting between 3 of the strongest lords of Somerset, Warwick and Dorset would ensure that Southhampton and St John would seek a protector. Lady Mary Tudor would fit the bill. And Mary would ensure that the Tudor line went on. Feeling weary, he took his Time-Turner and returned to his room. He took a moment to wonder, should he visit someone else or rest? </span></div></div>",

Anne saw an opportunity to help him and punish Isabel at the same time. With a proper dowry, he would finally be able to marry his sister off. He kicked a rock in his path, annoyed at his lot. He knew he was a royal bastard, but unlike The late Duke of Richmond, he had no title. And he was stuck with his idiot sister, who only wanted to be a nun. He had to discipline her far more in recent times. Almost from the time of their Royal father's death. He still remembered, finding her nude in a forest. He had cane her severely for that. He then had two maids finish up for him. She was such a burden. He walked on....before spying a chest. Unable to believe it, he ran towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was half buried, it looked like a fox had tried to eat it. He used his sword, releasing its contents to his eyes. Gold coins to the value of who knows how much. His troubles were over as he loaded the chest unto the cart, straining with all his might, pushing his sinews to the limit. He encountered no thieves as he rode home. Isabel loved these sensations. Even as a woman, maids fell over her. And why shouldn't they? As Isabel, she was even better looking and still had the blood of a King. That soothed the shame of womanhood as the girls pushed her towards another climax. \"Isabel!!!!\" roared her brother/son after she almost experienced relief.</span></div></div>",
