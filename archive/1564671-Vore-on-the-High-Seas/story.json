            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Another wave rocks your boat, and you crouch low as you glance around, trying to see what's causing these waves. You start to wish you hadn't, as an enormous tentacle erupts from the water off the starboard side. You stare in shock--it's bigger than it has any right to be. As you stare, you feel more waves rock the boat and turn all around to see more tentacles rising, surrounding your boat and sending off waves. You hang on to the side for dear life, terrified at what's going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, one of the tentacles moves towards your boat, and you stumble back away from it as it flops down heavily on top of the boat. You watch as it quickly coils around, wrapping around the whole boat, going underwater, and looping around to the top again. Your boat is small, but it's still surprising to see this tentacle coil all around it. You stare at the appendage. It must be at least a foot wide... And this is it's thinnest point, as it gets thicker farther away from the tip! While you stare at the tentacle, another tentacle moves in and wraps around the other side of the boat. You look back and forth at them, scared. This tentacled beast has a good grip on your boat, and that means you are in big trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the boat is lifted off the water. You fall over, but get up quickly as the boat is lifted up by the two tentacles. You can't help but peer over the edge, seeing that you're about a dozen feet above the water. Then, to your horror, and enormous eye with a golden iris opens from underwater, glaring at you. The eye rises, and the whole body of the massive tentacled monster surfaces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gaze at it. It's a massive squid, the size of the myical kraken. The creature is floating like a boat, its body lying on the surface to expose half of its body and both eyes so it can look at its catch. Meanwhile, the many other tentacles rise up on the opposite side of your boat... And you don't notice as one approaches you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foot-wide appendage reaches you and deftly wraps around you, suction cups sticking to your bare torso as it wraps around you from chest to waist. You stare in shock at first, but then begin to scream and struggle, pounding the tentacle with your free fists. The giant squid doesn't care, though, and easily plucks you off the boat, bringing you under its hull and around to its eye. It holds you parallel to the water's surface, right in front of the enormous eye, far bigger than your head, and you stare at it as if hypnotized. You would be panicking now, but the eye looks quite beautiful...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally, this whole creature has a certain impressive beauty to it, with it's huge scale and its skill with its tentacles. It is strong enough to lift a boat but gentle enough to snatch and manipulate a human without hurting him. Still, you'd enjoy it more if you weren't being coiled up by its enormous tentacles and held inches from its giant eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kraken continues to stare at you, its eyes revealing no emotions. You don't struggle anymore, knowing that your life is in is giant monster's hands--or rather, tentacles. And so you remain coiled up in its grasp, awaiting its decision of what to do with you...</span></div></div>",
