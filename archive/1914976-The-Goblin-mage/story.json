She didn't care either, Citrine was <i>so</i> beyond this magical training thing. She had been learning magic for a year and was something of a prodigy, and once she learned about the only kind of magic she liked (stink magic!) she could care less about any other kind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCitrine had also become somewhat of a rebel lately, cutting classes and using magically enhanced farts to torture her peers. The little goblin was on her last lifeline with the magical dean, so she decided she was gonna get out before she got thrown out. That's the reason she was in the library, so she could take what really mattered when she left: books!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had loaded up her backpack with her favorite books about stinks and now she was fleeing school! It was easier than you'd think: the guards were notoriously lazy and Citrine was able to easily sneak past them while they slept. The smelly little goblin ran out into the enchanted woods and kept running until she couldn't see the woods on the horizon. Tired and sweaty, she sat down on a stump and emptied out her backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see, a bag of trail mix, some stinky regents, and magical encyclopedias including <i>The magic of BO</i>, <i>Smelly plants, fungi and minerals for potions, summoning and other magical uses!</i>, <i>The magical, stinking gases inside YOU</i>, and of course my favorite: <i>The Raunchy Monster's Compendium</i>!

And that shouldn't be too hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty soon Citrine would have her own stink-demon minion that she could use to amplify her spells and her smells, the power of a demon would make her strong enough to rule the school with her mighty stink magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!

Dumb blond hair, glowing auras, and dumb dresses made of leaves, gossamer and dewdrops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hated them, and quickly picked up a stick to waive them away while she was looking for the fungus.

Citrine made to move closer, but suddenly found herself tied to the grass by her shoelaces with some enchanced teathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fairies...\" Citirne grumbled.

Citrine glanced downwards to see all the flowers around her shedding their petals. The fairies retreated away from her with their obnoxious giggles as the flowers began to bloom miniature skunk tails. They'd conjured skunk blossoms! She should've known what those fairies were up to. A thick, musky stink wafted from the flowers up to Citrine's nose as she struggled with all her might to pull her feet from the magical tethers, but it was no use! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flowers began to menacingly lean in her direction. Citrine looked up pleadingly at the fairy ringleader, who met her gaze with a saucy wink while mockingly pinching her nose. Citrine whine of despair was met with a chorus of wet squeaks and a hot, pungent mist that soaked her from every angle. Her hair stiffened, her eyes watered, and she violently gagged from the skunk blossoms' exhaust, which her text described as a potent chemical with a stench like a dozen bloated skunks' rumps after a strict diet of blackberries. \"Gassy skunks were a pretty apt description,\" thought Citrine, who (in between heaves) detected a current of eggy flatulence in the mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the yellowish mist cleared, Citrine peered out to see...</span></div></div>",

With her luck, and the amount of rotting trees in the glade, she could be in and out in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later, Citrine was exhausted from checking various trees' nooks and crannies, but to no avail. It was as if someone had picked them all off! Frustrated (and lost), Citrine began to stumble around the glade recklessly, not retracing her steps back home, but going deeper into the glade. All she could think about was getting that fungus. She'd spend the whole night here if she had to. She didn't care, or at least not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it appeared to her from afar. A thick corridor of bushes lead to a tree with an open hollow, and she could see from afar the unmistakable notch of the Devil's Toe Fungus. Citrine made a dead sprint to the tree, but her dash was interrupted when she felt her foot get caught. The trap swung her foot up and pulled the goblin nearly 4 feet off the ground as she screamed in surprise. Hanging upside down with her prize so close, she heard some giggles from behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the fastest one yet! I didn't think you'd get her.\"<br>\r\n\"New record?\"<br>\r\n\"New record.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of satyr girls then crossed in front of her and eyed her up and down. Citrine could already smell the heavy, musky scent of their bodies wafting around. \"See if she's got anything good in that bag.\" The blonde satyr took Citrine's bag off of her and began rummaging through it. \"Hey Izzy!\" she called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" asked the brunette satyr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got ourselves a stinkmage!\" she laughed, as Citrine's fear turned to anger upon seeing the satyr get her grubby hands on her spellbook. The other satyr gave an exaggerated gasp and began to jokingly cower from the immobilized goblin. \"Have mercy on us, oh pungent one, we know not what we do,\" she cackled. \"That's why she wants the fungus, you know,\" Izzy muttered, while her friend looked to the sky in thought. \"Essa?\" The brunette turned back to Izzy with a grin that couldn't bode well for Citrine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's 'enchant' some of her things,\" murmured Essa as she took off Citrine's robe. Izzy laughed and joined in, stripping Citrine's shoes off as well. Citrine was about to protest until Essa leaned over and planted Citrine's nose in her wet tuft of her armpit hair. Essa's ripe B.O. came from months of disregarding the satyr taboo of bathing, and it disabled Citrine nearly instantly. \"You wanna smell like me?\" Essa inquired, while balling up Citrine's robe. She let Citrine's face fall out of her pit before taking the robe and rubbing it all over her chest, soaking up its thin layer of perspiration. Dragging the goblin's robe farther up, she pulled it over to her left armpit and scrubbed it as hard as she could, and then did the same to the right armpit.  Soon, her robe was saturated in odorous satyr sweat and stained with mud and who knows what else. Essa unballed the robe and began to admire her work, drawing her nose down to take a deep whiff of the funky aftermath. \"Mmm... perfect.\"</span></div></div>",

Essa rubbed Citrine's shoes between her sweaty buttcrack while Izzy scrubbed her crotch with Citrine's extra pairs of underpants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo, look at this!\" Essa said, pulling out a gleaming ivory wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Citrine immediately started kicking and shouting, \"That's my wand! Don't you dare use that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooo, her wand!\" Izzy said, \"Best be careful with it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two started prancing around, tossing her wand between them and waving it around in their best mock spellcaster way. Citrine nearly had a heart attack every time they threw it; she was certain that one of them would drop it on a rock and split it in two. Izzy caught it and sauntered over to Citrine and waved it in front of her. The goblin made a grab at it, but she quickly had her head stuffed in Essa's armpit and was subdued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, this thing IS fun,\" Izzy said, \"But I think I'm done with it. Oh! Wait, I've got one more thing to do!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe satyr smirked an evil smirk, then stuffed the wide, blunt end of the wand into her musky belly button, her tongue lolling out in delight as she probed her belly button with it. When she pulled it out, it had a wad of sweaty fur and lint stuck to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want it again Essa?\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, actually seeing you use it I just got an idea!\" Essa said. She grabbed the wand and stuck it in her ear, fishing out her smelly, nasty earwax. She pulled it out and it now had filth on both ends. She dropped it back into Citrine's bag, then threw it away. \"Okay, let's finish her off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you were fun!\" Said Izzy,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were real!\" Said Essa<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you weren't real fun!\" The two said in unison, then spun around and put both their butts in Citrine's face. They didn't fart, or poop, but their asscrack sweat was so pungent that it quickly K.O'd her. She had a nasty nightmare about Satyr armpits, but when she came to she was back on the ground with her violated wand in her hand. It would still be serviceable, but to have her wand disrespected was a great dishonor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on top of that, all her stuff had been stolen! Everything but her clothing(Now \"Enchanted\" with satyr sweat.) was gone: Her food, her money and most of all her magic regeants!

Citrine had already gotten it partially assembled, using a standard longstaff from the school's supply, imbuing it with skunk-oil gems she crafted herself, putting a used toilet plunger head on the end and dipping it in foul smelling devil brew to really empower it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now all it needs,\" Citrine said, waving her stinking staff around, \"Is a headpiece.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the bulbous, spike-covered and most of all smelly \"Devil's Toe Fungus\" would fit the plunger holder and make the perfect tool to channel her stink magic through. With a staff like that, she'd be able to project smells directly into someone's nose, overfill toilets with nasty gunk or hex others with permastink curses. Needless to say, the young goblin wouldn't be a very nice Stinkmagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First thing I'd do is go back to school and make everyone kiss my butt!\" Citrine cackled, waving her stinkstaff around. \"Then I'd fart on them until the whole school stunk like my butt!<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe goblin spun around and fired a blast of stinking energy at a nearby bird. The poor avian caught wind of the intense stink of rotten eggs and quickly passed out. Citrine would've been proud of her magical stinks, but since her staff was missing a channeling head most of the spell hit her in the face and made her gag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah! The sooner I get that Devil's Toe Fungus the better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCitrine put on her backpack and stomped off. The fungus was known to grow in caves, and the nearest one was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But I guess nothing good comes without breaking a little sweat. And I could practice my \"Sweat amplification\" spell on the way up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCitrine lifted her arms and pointed at her armpits, blasting them with a bit of her magic. They were already dripping with sweat from the powerful magic, stinking of onions and garlic. By the time she got up the mountain they'd be soaked through her robes and stinking like a landfill full of old pizza and rotten vegetables. Citrine smirked at the idea, put her staff in her backpack and started climbing the sheer rock of the mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe further Citrine climbed, the more she started to smell something rotten. And it wasn't her armpits(Well, not <i>just</i> her armpits, anyway), it stunk like brimstone and sulfur, like something evil or... maybe? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, it couldn't be.\" Citrine laughed, \"Dragons would never go this far north from their natural habitats...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Grraaaaoooorrr.....</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer calm confidence when she heard that growling rumble. Citrine quickly resolved to climb the mountain as fast as she could, get the fungus and jump if she had to, rather than face a dragon. But when she got to the top, dripping with her own magically induced sweat, the dragon waiting for her wasn't quite what she was expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a half-dragon! Standing eight feet easily, a few hundred pounds at least, and covered in scales save for her humanoid belly, breast and face, she looked down at the goblin and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there little one,\" She hissed, spewing more disgusting sulfur-scented breath on Citrine, \"And just what are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCitrine sidled to the left, trying to get past the half-dragon to the inner cave where the fungus would be growing, \"I just needed to- AH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was hoisted up into the air by the half-dragon's tail and brought around to her giant, scaly butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I asked you a question!\" Said the half-dragon, then she grunted and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>FRRAAAAAART!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlasted a huge, stinking fart right in Citrine's face! The little goblin choked and gagged on the awful stink. Dragon farts were the worst!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now answer,\" Growled the half-dragon again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I need fungus! There's a special fungus here that I need. In your cave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well too bad. Anything in this cave is mine. And it's gonna stay that way.\" The half-dragon said, farting again and blowing back Citrine's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! Anything! I'm so close!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm....\" The dragon tapped a claw on her chin, \"Well maybe. I'll let you have it if you can...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She tried to scramble backwards, but the dragon grunted and blasted a titanic fart that was like being under a stinking hair-dryer the size of a car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're ready for the \"Might\" of a dragon!\" Said the half dragon. She dropped with her full force, butt-first, onto Citrine, squashing her like a cartoon character, smushing her against the scaly, smelly, gassy lizard butt, \"After an hour of this you're gonna wish I just breathed fire on you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a giant, stinking fart that reeked of brimstone and sulfur, making Citrine cry out in sinus pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong goblin?

Wonder if you'll survive this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted her butt a bit and blew out a horrifically noxious, wet fart that covered poor Citrine in foul moisture. The dragon laughed out loud as she ripped farts of every size and smell over the course of a horrific hour. She let out one more, horribly rotten fart that stunk of meat and rotten eggs, then stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well, still alive Goblin?\" She looked down, Citrine was still breathing at least, \"Ha!
