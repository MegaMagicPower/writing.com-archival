She walked over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Madison what are you doing?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison lifted a cigarette to her lips and takes a drag and smiles. \u201cMy sister got me to try smoking and I love it!\u201d Madison said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMadison that\u2019s disgusting, you're like the biggest anti smoker I know - what\u2019s happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison laughs \u201cI guess I'm just getting older.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to go meet Abigail, quit that shit would you? You're scaring me.\u201d Olivia said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever. Have fun with the nerds.\u201d Madison laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia arrived at Abigail\u2019s and met her whole crew. Every week Abigail had a study session with the top students in her university class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys I want to talk to you all about something\u2026\u201d Abigail said. \u201cI am doing a research paper with the top scientists in the country and have discovered something scary\u201d. The girls listened with interest. \u201cIt seems that cigarette companies have enhanced the chemical nicotine to a parasitic like form. A cigarette now has the ability of infecting a host and taking control of its mental thought pattern\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere's no way that\u2019s true.\u201d said Olivia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm afraid it is and soon I\u2019ll have enough research to expose all of this and then find a cure\u201d said Abigail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls seemed hesitant to believe such a crazy conspiracy but being as they all hated smoking they decided to help Abigail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAm I supposed to believe that all smokers are under some type of mind control just because you talked to some people?\u201d Their friend Riley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo - just people whom you know that have started recently.  Look until I know more, just be careful OK.\u201d Abigail warned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbigail is the smartest person out of all of us I doubt she\u2019d lead us on\u2026this sounds serious\u201d Chloe spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls continued to talk and until it was time leave. Olivia was walking home when she heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up nerd?\u201d said Madison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK enough Madison you're being a jerk.\u201d Olivia said annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry I'm just kidding, how was your study session?\u201d asked Madison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was OK didn't study though because Abigail spent the whole time trying to get us to join some anti smoking cause\u201d said Olivia <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds nerdy\u201d Madison laughs \u201cI'm kidding but really what did she say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia explained everything to Madison she\u2019d learned, knowing Madison was her best friend and always kept a secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow you actually believe that shit?\u201d Madison said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't know why she would make it up\u201d said Olivia<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably to be controlling and get you to be lame like her.\u201d Madison said \u201cbesides I smoke now and I'm not walking around like some zombie or any different than before am I?\u201d said Madison <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I guess you're right. I'd still like you to quit until I know more for certain.\u201d Olivia said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I love smoking but I love you more so I'll make a deal I'm going to smoke one last cigarette right now then I stop until we know your friend is crazy.\u201d Madison laughed as she pulled out a cigarette and placed it to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia nodded in agreement and watched her friend light up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook out Olivia!  The ciggy is gonna get you\u201d Madison said, taunting Olivia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia laughed and began to think maybe Abigail was wrong, it did sound crazy after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison then took a large drag of her cigarette and exhaled a huge drag of smoke into Olivia's face. Olivia began to cough. \"Madison, what the fuck?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry I thought it would be funny.\u201d said Madison <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo its gross and now I stink!\u201d moaned Olivia<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Olivia you will learn to love it\u201d Madison smirked, with a hint of menace in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia began to feel weird and light headed. \u201cMadison what did you do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look like you want to try this cigarette, Olivia\u2026\u201d Madison held out her cigarette to Olivia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 I\u2026 yes maybe\u2026 wait what is happening to me?\u201d said Olivia<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't fight it Olivia let go and take a drag.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nOlivia took the cigarette, her mind kept screaming not to do it but it seemed something in her body was compelling her to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut it to your lips.\u201d Madison instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia began to resist. \u201cNo Abigail was right.\u201d as she threw down the cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison picked up the cigarette from the ground. \u201cSo then we do this the hard way\u2026\u201d Madison grabbed Olivia's cheek while taking a drag and forced open her lips, breathing out the whole drag into Olivia's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia fell to the ground coughing and spitting from the toxic smoke. She gasped as her eyes glazed over. She could feel the nicotine flowing through her veins as she brought herself back to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison smiled and placed her cigarette between Olivia's lips.  For a moment, Olivia stood with the cigarette dangling between her lips.  Looking at her friend, she sucked deeply on the filter.  The ember glowed red as Olivia inhaled her first actual drag, cheeks caving in.  The nicotine continued to probe her pink lungs as the buzz surged through her body.  Reluctantly, Olivia tilted her head back and pursed her lips, watching as a neat cone of smoke ascended skywards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d asked Madison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmazing\u2026\u201d Olivia beamed as she took another deep drag, basking in the glow of nicotine.  Madison removed her pack and lit up another cigarette, content that Olivia was now fully enslaved, addicted and willing to help advance their cause.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls finished their cigarettes together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want you to keep your smoking a secret from the others. We need to know what Abigail is planning.\u201d Madison said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill do, but when its time I will be the one to turn Abigail into one of us.\u201d Olivia said as she took the last drag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
