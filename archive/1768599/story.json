While teachers worked as they could make sure that students leaned everything they needed to become successful in later life. Overall a very typical day for a high school however unknown everyone watching from a distance, on a branch of a might oak tree sat a fairy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer name was Lucy, right now she had the appearance of a bug sizes woman with peach pink hair. She could choose to any sizes but been small was useful when observing humans. At this moment she was very bored that happened when your fellow fairies had exiled you for been a \"bothersome terror.\" It didn't help that these humans were so dull!!! Just watching was not going to be fun, but luckily Lucy with her magic would be able to have a blast playing with them, all she need was the right target. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her tiny wings she flew down into the building, Lucy began looking for victims for her mischief.

Geoffrey yelled as a quick nasty jolt of pain went through his right shoulder. He muttered and looked up to see a most unwelcome sight, local bad boy and jerk Jack Hedge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys were complete opposites of each other while Geoffrey was a short; slightly pudgy boy who was a socially awkward, shy, meek, introvert with no real friends. His cloths were reflection of that plain brown slip on shoes, a pair of ugly looking grey trouser and a blue and white stripped shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was a big athletic guy who was lively, strong and popular. But been one of the most popular people around wasn\u2019t enough for Jack, no sometimes he wanted punching bag and today Geoffrey was the one who got stuck with that unfortunate, 'honour .\u2019           <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, weirdo!\u201d Jack yelled in a threatening manner, \u201cI forgot my lunch money and I need a donation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was bold face lie; Jack was never short on money. It was just an excuse to be a jerk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoffrey reluctantly reached into his pocket and pulled two five dollar bills, Jack gave him an annoyed before snatching the money out of his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you later loser!\u201d Jack then shoved Geoffrey to the ground and walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Geoffrey feeling very humiliated pulled, he pulled himself up and started heading to class, visual angry. This sort of crap kept happing to him, every day Jack was there dish out some kind of abuse mostly physical, sometimes verbal always petty, at some point, it had become more of an annoying than hurtful. That fact didn\u2019t make Geoffrey any less angry. It didn't help that no one was willing to help him because he was just the quite moody kid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his delay, Geoffrey got to class before any of the other students. The only person other in the room was the teacher Mr Green who was busy checking some homework. That gave Geoffrey about five minutes to kill before class started, so he pulled out a book he brought with him and tried to read it. Sadly he was too angry to focus on the text so he gave up and slammed the book shut in frustration. He was fed up of been a punching bag! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile unknown to Geoffrey, Lucy the fairy was floating above invisible to human eyes. Oh boy, angry humans were one of her favourite things in the world, because it let her play one of her favourite games, Wish Granting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this game, a mortal would make a wish and then Lucy would try to grant it but she would always do it in a way that they didn\u2019t except, oh the amount of fun this could provide sent a chill through Lucy\u2019s body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy's finger glowed bright purple as she fired a tiny blot of magic into the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoffrey suddenly felt the sudden urge to yell something to release all of pent of frustration, when it finally become too much for him he opened his mouth and cried\u2026\u2026..    <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With a second cast, Geoffrey's transformation begins to take place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Geoffrey opens his locker, Geoffrey loses his overweightness and gains a more petite and toned figure. Filled with energy, Geoffrey quickly removes his clothing and puts on his swim suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, his suit stretches around his body to its more feminine counterpart. Two mounds of soft flesh begin to push out from Geoffrey's chest as his hair lengthes, softens, and shades to a nice red color. As his hair stops just above his lower back, his new breasts finish athe a bountiful D-cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Geoffrey runs to the door, but can not open it for some reason. Then he loses his balance as his waist caves in and his hips flare out. His ass rounds into a delicate bubble butt. His penis is pulled inward forming a new vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia (formerly Geoffrey) feels a wave of tingles across her face as it changes to a softer, more feminine look. With the transformation complete, Olivia stands very carefully, still adjusting to her new center of gravity.

Without a note of hesitation, she shouts a tiny beam of purple magic out of finger into Geoffrey\u2019s body.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nGeoffrey's body suddenly felt icy cold as his body jerked uncontrollably. He would have fallen face first onto the floor. If he hadn\u2019t used the sink to support himself. He tried to pull himself up but was forced to knees when suddenly every single muscle in his body felt like each one had been injected with a tonne of lead.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAround the same time, Geoffrey\u2019s vision started to become so messy that everything in view became a blur of grey. His chest felt extremely tight, as the boy\u2019s temperate flipped from icy cold to burning hot.  The pressure of this bizarre illness becomes too much for Geoffrey and he collapsed.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLater Geoffrey returned to the land of the living, his head spinning as pulled himself up and was immediately dumbstruck by the sight of the most beautiful girl he had ever seen. Her hair was red as autumn, along with slick mane that reached past her shoulders, her eyes were a majestic sapphire blue and her nose was of the pin button variety and which looked great alongside her large perky lips. Her skin was flawless, perfectly smooth and healthy. Her hands had long delicate fingers with long well-manicured nails. She was wearing a light green tight camisole which seemed designed to emphasise her impressive chest and black skirt with a white belt around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018What is a pretty girl like doing in the boy's bathroom\u2019 Geoffrey thought as the skin his face became warm with an uncomfortable feeling, the girl's face turned red, not surprising he if had accidentally walked into the wrong in the bathroom he would feel embarrassed too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoffrey raised his hand to greet the girl, who did the same. It took  him about a second to notice that hand in view wasn\u2019t his when he did look of uneasy appeared on the girl's face. He looked down to see that she now large boobs on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly sh\u2026\u201d Geoffrey covered her mouth as the voice that came out it was completely different from her normal one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk this had to be some kind of weird dream, all she had to was pinch herself and Geoffrey would wake up in bed as his normal self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held out her arm and pinched it as hard she could, there was a tiny sharp pain and\u2026... Geoffrey didn\u2019t wake up and was still a girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on?!\u201d Geoffrey yelled while shaking.

The tiny beam hit its target dead on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark\u2019s body began jolting and shaking as it was changed. His short black hair began stretching into a long thick mane of  silky locks that went far past his shoulders, then its colour shifted to a light brown. His legs grew in length becoming thinner and fitter while her waist grew in size. At the same time, her face changes into much pretty one complete with a button nose and blue eyes. Her arms then started undergoing a transformation similar to her legs becoming finer, while her hands became more delicate and her fingernails grew longer. Finally, a large pair of breasts pushed out from her chest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her body changed, her clothing transformed to fit her new body. Her simple white sneakers morphed into a pair of brown leather, her baggy trouser mega red together and shortened until they were a mini skirt, which changes from an ugly light grey to a snow white colour, with a  brown leather with golden buckle added for extra flourish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer blue t-shirt tightened and turned the same white as the skirt. A dark brown jacket unzipped, popped into existence creating a perfect colour balance. To complete the picture a pair of silver hooped earrings appeared on her earlobes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark looked down at her transformed body, her mouth wide open, her big eyes filled with terror. Then all signs of fear melted away, her expression became completely blank for a few seconds, then life returned to her. A bubbly energetic smile appeared on her face while her blue partially sparkled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLiz, what you doing in the boy's bathroom?\u201d The girl\u2019s voice was completely different from Mark\u2019s, a cute happy one perfectly reflected her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoffrey started in shock, confusion and horror, \u201cMark you o\u2026.Wait who the hell is Liz?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark our whoever she was now, ignored Geoffrey question and grabbed her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe, don\u2019t have time to talk!

For a moment the redhead looked around bracing herself for inevitable hopeful looks of the guys and subtle jealous starts of the girls every time a new pretty girl showed up. This was always followed by rapid rumours, various clicks trying to recruit the pretty girl and the part that Geoffrey dread the most guys would start lining up to hit on her. The very thought of being asked out by one of the jerks that picked on her made Geoffrey cringe, suddenly felt a less ashamed about never having the courage to ask a girl out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut strangely, that wasn\u2019t what happened. Instead, no one noticed Geoffrey or Mark enter the room. The answer as to why became clear when Geoffrey turned looks in the same direction as everyone else. Jake was sitting at a table with a smile on his face while Clare Gale the beautiful and popular head of the gymnastics club was whispering into his ear. She combed her ebony black hair while smirking arrogantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Geoffrey felt a surge of something powerful erupted within her. It was jealousy, a hot intense jealousy that overtook everything else. The fact that she was supposed to be a guy, Jake treating Geoffrey like garbage, the fact she had bigger things to worry about. All become trivial by the scene unfolding in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing that mattered to Elizabeth Keep was that some bitch was putting the moves on her man! Well, she wasn\u2019t going to stand for that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth turned to her \u2018friend\u2019 Madison Walker and smirked. Madison returned the smirk and the two girls marched to confront their opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Clare,\u201d Elizabeth said a sugar sweet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare looked away from Jake with annoyed expression, that was quickly switched out for a false smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, Elizabeth it is nice to see you.\u201d The fact that everyone recognised her girl form had no effect on Elizabeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Lucy was feeling absolutely giddy.

Down at the hallway is a middle age woman of sixty with black and white hair done up in a bun, a think and lanky body, and had elegant glasses on her wrinkled face.  She was also wearing a professional suit with a consecutive blouse and gray vest, gray skirt that goes all the way down to her feet, and a pair of comfy three inch heel shoes.  Her name is Veronica Winchester, but the students always call her Principal Veronica because of the strict respect they have for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery morning, she surveys the hallway to make sure the students are going to class on time.  Walking down the hall, she spotted a group of girls that looked too skimpy for school and called them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You three!\" she said in a stern tone, \"What is the meaning of this?  Dressing up like that is against school policy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the girls wearing a tube tank top and a short skirt that goes up near her upper thigh turned to her and said, \"Oh please, Principal Veronica.  We are only wearing this because all the young pop stars are today.  Maybe you should ease up a little be and be what it's like to be a student.  Then maybe you won't have to be a stick in the mud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe principal scrounged her face a bit and said, \"Ease up a bit?  I have an obligation in making sure these students have a refine future ahead of them, and not act like a bunch of sluts.  Perhaps you three should ease up on your own, in Detention for a week.  That sounds fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three were silent as the girl in the tube tank top slouched and said, \"Fine...  Whatevs...  C'mon girls, let's ditch this place and head to the locker room.  There's something I want to show you.\"  The two girls nodded as they left the principle on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they are gone, Veronica sighed and said, \"These kids, always thinking less on studies and college and more of these, celebrities and doing on these wasteful social media crap.  I miss those days were students are more behaved and less rebellious.  If only I can understand what it's like to be them, or what it's like to live in their world, then maybe I can understand them better and know what needs to be done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that, Lucy looked on in the distance and heard every word from this principal.  It sounded like she can't stand the students behavior and is overworked and stressed out on the whole thing.  If Veronica can be like these students or live in the world they do, then maybe she could make some changes.  Hearing all of this, Lucy gave a light giggle and said, \"So the principal wants to help the student body out, eh?  Well, I'll give her all the help she needs.  I just need to figure out what to do with her.\"  So she thought of a way to give the principal a chance to help the student body of the school.  She had so many options, she doesn't know which one is best.  What can she choose?</span></div></div>",

See, faeries not only offer powers and gifts, they would also place curses to those that are bad.  Sometimes the curses are for bad luck, accidents, or something worse.  But Lucy likes to use curses as a way to have fun at the expense of others.  It is one of the reason why she was kicked out of the forest in the first place.  Placing a curse on Veronica is no exception.  Giving that this principal is very strict with her students and tried to teach them a little lesson.  \"If this principal wants to treat her students like that,\" she said with glee, \"Then she would be like them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick wave of her wand, a red piece of energy came out of it and whispered an incantations.  That magic soon came out of the want and flew to the principal where students and teachers don't notice it.  When the magic spiral around her, it came into contact and caught her by surprise.  She felt a tingle for a few seconds before it could stop, as she wondered what happened.  \"Whoa!  What was that?\" she asked after feeling that tingle.  After a few seconds, she shrugged it off and said, \"Must be the air conditioning.  They always act up like that.  I have to speak to maintenance to fix it.  I swear, those air conditioners just give me chills every time I pass by them.\"  She soon walked away to moved on with her business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Lucy looked on and was pleased with what she has planned.  See, the curse she placed on Veronica is a day and night curse.  By day, she will be a pricipal of the school.  But by night, when the sun sets and the moon is high, she will change into a teenage girl and gets to spend a full night as one until the morning comes.  This will teach her what happens when you treat students like their nothing.  She will live in their shoes and get use to it all night.  Now she needs to see if her curse works.  The question is, where will the curse starts?</span></div></div>",

Since coming to Redhill things had improved for her, at least now Erika was left along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she still had to join a group, so Erika basically moved up to the group closest to her and inserted herself into that group no one noticed. The other members of the group were Lacy Smith leather girl with a thing for fashion and photography, Jess Grey a rebel bag girl who wore a stereotypical black leather jacket and Bill Stable an average guy who really hated history as a subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince each group was allowed to explore the museum at their own pace Erika's group decide to go to....... </span></div></div>",

The Mill family were in the latter group with one expectation. Naturally, the Mills were among the first to visit the Wonder Mall on its grand opening. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nMills were made up of four people plus the family pet a black cat with green eye called Lance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirstly there was Matthew Mills a successful lawyer that liked to always keep up appearance even outside of work. As such he went out today wearing his smart black business suit, equal smart black trousers, a pair of skinny black shoes complete with an emerald green tie. His brown hair was neatly combed, his face well shaven and he had a nice tall body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew\u2019s wife Jan Mills was secretary of a to some big shot at a company in the big city, which made clothing. She was a pretty woman with green eyes, long curly blond hair, big lips and fairly long neck. She was wearing a white blouse, a long black skirt and black high heeled shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe youngest human member of the family was Kimberlee, a cute seven-year-old and girly girl. She had the appearance of one to, with her blond hair styled into a cute ponytail and a long sleeved pink shirt with a blue heart on it, a pink skirt and cute little mary jane shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Kimberlee\u2019s older brother James, thirteen years old with brown hair and green eyes, wearing a dark green t-shirt, a pair of jeans and white velcro sneakers. James was the one person in the family who was happy to be here. There was simply nothing more born in the youngs lads mind than work around shops and wasting hours of time looking at boring mundane items, like clothes or shaves or golf clubs or dolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his protests were ignored and now he was forced to come along on this stupid trip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMills walked through the huge automatic glass doors. The Wonder Mall was truly massive four floors tall, connected by many escalators. The white tile floors were shiny, fresh and clean. Shops could be seen far as the eye could see. Every store boastfully displayed their wares in glass window displays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, everyone,\u201d Jan said cheerfully, \u201cIt\u2019s time decide where we should go first!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         <br>\r\nJames rolled his eyes did they really needed to have \u2018a group talk\u2019 about this they were just walking around a mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the Mill\u2019s decide to\u2026...        </span></div></div>",

However, as he did, he paused when he heard something like shifting behind him. Instantly, he turned around, only to see nothing out of ordinary. Great, now this place was messing with his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, this whole mall is weird,\" he mumbled to himself. It really would have been better had he just stayed home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around to keep walking, when he heard shifting and clanking again. He turned around again, once again seeing nothing odd. He groaned a bit, deciding to just pick up the pace and get out before anything else happened. However, right as he did, he tripped, yelling a bit as he hit the ground hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW! What the....\" he groaned, turning back at his feet....only to gasp out in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was cloth grabbing his legs, and it kind of looked familiar. Before James could ask what was happening, he happened to look back up at the mannequin. Wait, where were its clothes?! The emotionless statue was completely bare, and with what seemed like the skirt judging from the color around his legs. Now James was really worried about what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is this?!\" he groaned out loud, struggling to get up and pull the skirt off him. However, when he looked back up, something else stood out. \"Wait, where is the wig?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as that happened, something aggressively lopped on to James's head, making him yell out and struggle as he pulled at it, feeling long hair. Getting an eye on it, he could see it was the long red hair that the statue had, a length that went past his own shoulders and down his back. It was almost like dealing with a wild animal as he pulled and pulled at it, the thing fighting back like it had a will of its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get the hell of me-OW!\" he cried out as he gave the wig one big tug at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as this happened though, he could see the skirt flying around him, wrapping around his waist and over his jeans. It pressed tighter and tighter, as he tried to use one hand to pull at it. Like the wig, it didn't let up though, snugging around him. However, what happened next was even weirder, Almost as if by some supernatural force, his jeans became undone and slid down his legs, causing him to pull his feet out of them and leaving the skirt as his only legwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?! Did this thing just...take my pants off?\" he spoke out, still dealing with the wig and barely being able to deal with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, right at that moment, another thing tacked him, apparently the grey suit jacket just wrapped around him, pulling his arms away from his head forcibly. He groaned as his his arms were held out as the jacket slid itself up his arms, going around him until it was snug on his torso. The front lightly wrapped around, the golden buttons fastening themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, he was wrapped in the female business suit, still with his velcro shoes and what he had on underneath the suit, his jeans laying on the floor. What in the world just happened? He was left more or less silent, letting the red hair just flow down uninterrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happened?\" he asked himself incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it didn't seem to be done. After he asked that, he felt a shifting underneath the jacket, he looked down, seeing his dark green shirt shifting on his body. He brought a hand to it, wondering what was happening, until he felt how soft it was now. The color was shifting to a shade of bright blue, while also splitting down the middle and buttoning itself back up in what could only be described as a blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow James was really confused. Just what were these clothes? And this hair...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!\" he yelped again as he grabbed at it. It felt like....pulling his own hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, what happened to his old hair? He pulled at the hair again, feeling no resistance like before. Instead it was like his old hair never existed and that this red hair was real.....</span></div></div>",

Because it was trendy, maybe back when she was dirty commoner boy, but now James had become elegant lady she needed clothing that would fit a lady of her status.

Unlike Mike was Sarah didn't care much for the out door, she perfected she would rather staying in doors and things like cooking or play video games. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think this is good idea,\" Lucy said nervously, she really didn't want to come here, (which was pretty reasonable in this case given that castle was crumbling,) but she always had trouble expressing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh come on Lucy, it is just some dust old building, there is no need to be scary cat,\" Tom said while rubbing Lucy's head. Tom was big for his age and could be a bit of bully at times but when things really got serious he was loyal friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy crossed her arms in annoyance, \"I'm not scared,\" She mumbled while kicking the ground.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough, lets us head inside and begin exploring!\" Mike practically jumped through the massive hole in the ruined gate, his friends followed soon after.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main hall was dark fording, what was once a place fill with life was now ghostly quite, the once might stone wall were now falling away. The bright tapestry's and carpets that decorated the room were now covered in dirt, had many small holes and their colour was fading away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust above the main stare case was huge grand dusty painting of noblewoman. She was beautiful with golden hair tied into four ringlets, she wore a elegant dark blue ball gown.

Yet, with summer vacation up and rolling, Mike really wanted everyone to come with him to check the castle out while they had the chance. Tom obviously jumped on board immediately, while Sarah was more nonchalant about it. For Lucy, it took a bit of convincing, given how easy it was to scare her. Not that such fears were unfounded. The castle looked like the kind of place you should stay the hell away from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man...I wonder just how many rooms there are,\" Tom said in awe, hands on his hips all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably way too many,\" Sarah sighed. \"Please don't tell me we're going to explore all of them. I don't have all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it'll take that long,\" Mike replied. \"Sure, the place is big, but I don't think exploring it will take hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather not be here for hours...\" Lucy shivered. \"Seriously, this gives me the creeps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be fine. Superstitions just exaggerate everything, right?\" Tom chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy wasn't too convinced, but she didn't argue any further. The group of four continued to move forward on the ground floor, The hallways certainly did their job of making the place seem bigger on the inside than on the outside, even though it all looked as decrepit as everything else. Matt and Tom certainly didn't lose their enthusiasm, while Sarah was kind of playing with her phone all the while. Apparently she still got phone service in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Lucy was lagging behind. Seriously, every creak of the castle made her heart jump a bit. In fact, she was focusing so much on the sounds around her that she didn't notice when the others took a turn to the left while she continued to move forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...I really want to go back guys......guys?\" Lucy stopped when she heard no reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked in front of her and behind. The others were nowhere to be seen. Concluding that she somehow lost them while she wasn't paying attention, it only made her panic more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...guys!\" she called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around, trying to find where exactly she separated from them. There were so many more hallways and rooms than she thought there would be. Perhaps she would have to start looking from room to room. Not a good sign. Groaning, she began looking for everyone, since she heard no reply from her call. Soon enough, she came across a room with an opened door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, did they go in there?\" Lucy wondered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving it a try, she slowly opened the door further and went inside. It...looked like a room for maids and other such servants you'd find in a castle. Guess this was where such people would go to rest and such. Heck, there were even outfits and whatnot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...that's not weird at all....\" Lucy said, not really feeling any better here.</span></div></div>",
