That brought her back into orbit. She looked around at the people waiting for her to blow the candles and wondered again how she had pulled such a crowd for her birthday. Taking in a deep breath, she blew all the twenty-two candles off.<br>\r\nAs the clapping and well- wishing subsided, she drifted away from the massive dinner table and wandered back towards the dance hall. <br>\r\nA Nigerian by birth, she had arrived in Canada, to study in St. Mary\u2019s University, some seven years before and chose the Home Stay option (which is to stay with a family instead of in the halls). She was given the Fidel family. When she made it through the first session without giving in to the antics of her new siblings, or moving out (after all they put her through.), she was accepted into the family. It was at Thanksgiving that she realized she had not been adopted into a family of six as she thought, but a family of, at rough count, fifty. She enjoyed having so many cousins though, as she had one brother for a sibling while growing up in Nigeria. Life was never dull.<br>\r\nHow they had given out the invitations without her finding out, or even planned the whole surprise party she didn\u2019t know. She had woken up that morning to find that all her twenty-six Fidel cousins, her four Fidel siblings, her three Fidel nephews and her only Adetunji brother, Ope, were around for her birthday. She looked around her again and shook her head slightly at the turnout. She herself didn\u2019t even know she knew so many people.<br>\r\nThen SHE saw him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was tall, well built and wide at the shoulders. The turtleneck sweater he wore made him look more self-assured and confident than he would have been, she figured, wearing a casual shirt and trousers like every other male in the party. His hair was left a bit long, but it shaped his face, making him look primitive. Now, why that word had come to her mind she had no idea. She was sure that within minutes, Sheila, a boy-crazy friend of hers would zoom in on the mystery guy, and couldn\u2019t help but smile when she noticed Sheila on the other side of the room, making her way to him. But then he raised his eyes to hers as her glance fell back on him and her smile froze on her face. There was something familiar about those eyes, yet she couldn\u2019t place the face. For about twenty-seconds, she was transfixed to the spot. It was as if an electric force shot across the room from him and held her captive, she couldn\u2019t move a muscle.<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you staring at with such longing in your eyes, coz?\u201d Travis asked as he stopped at her side. That broke it. She turned to Travis as she answered,<br>\r\n\u201cNo one in particular,\u201d and then added, \u201cHow are you?\u201d<br>\r\nBut Travis, never one to lose a scent, continued roaming the crowd.<br>\r\n\u201cSo you have met him already?\u201d he asked, and she didn\u2019t need to look up to see whom he meant.<br>\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d she asked innocently.<br>\r\n\u201cRyan of course,\u201d Travis replied. \u201cWhat do you think of him?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI asked you a question, Travis,\u201d she persisted instead.<br>\r\nNow Travis was a devious matchmaker, and he had actually had several triumphs though he admitted to finding her case, his current major project, and his most difficult so far. She was very careful about what she said about any male that she knew when she spoke with Travis. He always wound up everything to suit his plans.<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s actually someone I would like you to meet, Coz,\u201d he said.<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t they all,\u201d she muttered to herself.<br>\r\n\u201cHe came with me as a matter of fact,\u201d he continued, his slight smile the only indication that he had heard her little comment.<br>\r\n\u201cIn case you didn\u2019t hear me, Travis, I asked how you were,\u201d she kept on.<br>\r\n\u201cI could introduce you right this minute,\u201d Travis continued, his smile widening as he saw his friend approaching. She followed Travis\u2019 gaze and tried not to show her irritation. How she was going to get out of this one she didn\u2019t know. Then her cell phone began to vibrate.<br>\r\nShe smiled as she looked up at Travis and excused herself. \u201cSorry Travis, not this time,\u201d she said sweetly. \u201cI have a phone call.\u201d And walked towards the quietest corner she could find before picking the call \u2013 under one side of the arch leading up to the next floor.<br>\r\n\u201cHello\u201d she said tentatively into the phone.<br>\r\n\u201cHappy Birthday my baby, how are you?\u201d It was her mother from Nigeria. Both families spent her first three years in St. Mary\u2019s University corresponding across the globe, then the next three visiting each other as often as they could manage. Now she had two sets of parents, Papafi and Mamafi, and Papa and Mum.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine Mum,\u201d she replied. \u201cHow\u2019s Papa?\u201d<br>\r\n \u201cHe\u2019s snoring beside me right now. So, how\u2019s the party?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n\u201cGoing quite well, at the moment,\u201d she replied. \u201cSo you were part of the game, Mum.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I was,\u201d she agreed heartily. \u201cHow else did you think Ope was allowed to come over? I was the one that sent his luggage from here so he could cross over to Canada smoothly.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for everything, Mum,\u201d she muttered.<br>\r\n\u201cYou deserve the best, my dear, that\u2019s why I am so furious with you right now.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d she couldn\u2019t help asking.<br>\r\n\u201cYou should be thankful for the ten thousand miles between us right now,\u201d she continued.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked again.<br>\r\n\u201cBecause yesterday was Femi\u2019s wedding,\u201d she replied.<br>\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d she asked, wondering where the connection was between Femi and her.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you remember Femi Adelana? My friend Tosin Adelana\u2019s last son?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes I do, Mum.\u201d She replied. So that was it. Another wedding. \u201cHe got married?\u201d she asked, pretending ignorance of the fact.<br>\r\n\u201cOf course he did,\u201d exclaimed her mother. \u201cHe could not wait forever, you know.\u201d<br>\r\nShe decided that it wasn\u2019t wise to point out at that moment to her mother that Femi and she had been no more than friends back then and still communicated often.<br>\r\n\u201cMum, I hope you didn\u2019t accuse him of letting me down,\u201d she already had images of her standing up in the church to give a reason why the couple should not be joined in holy matrimony. Mum could do that sort of thing if she thought it necessary.<br>\r\n\u201cI did no such thing,\u201d she replied quickly. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is how long you want to continue to lead that independent lady life, or when it would hit you that it was time you settled down.\u201d<br>\r\nShe sighed in resignation. It was time for the lecture that was gradually becoming hand \u2013 in \u2013 hand with her birthdays since she turned twenty.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to be at the ripe old age of thirty when you give birth to your first child, Banke,\u201d she kept on, switching to her Nigerian name. \u201cWhy you won\u2019t come to Nigeria for a visit is beyond me. Your Fidel parents have been here twice already but you have not returned since you left seven years ago. Why?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d she began looking for a reasonable excuse as usual.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that visa story again, Banke,\u201d she interrupted her, calling her by her native name. \u201cI know you are a citizen now and have been for the last two years at least. Mamafi told me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou are right Mum, its just that I cannot seem to find the time to plan my visit,\u201d she knew it was a feeble excuse.<br>\r\n\u201cYet you can plan your Fidel parents\u2019 own and even Fiona\u2019s without a hitch,\u201d she replied. \u201cYou even planned your eldest Fidel brother\u2019s family vacation, or am I wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d she replied in a small voice. Knowing her Fidel family, she was sure they would have given her the information she sought without even knowing it. She sighed again.<br>\r\n\u201cIs there something you are hiding from us, Banke?\u201d she suddenly asked. \u201cDid you get pregnant in school? Or do you have a child you don\u2019t want us to know about?\u201d<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t have even thought of that. \u201cNo, of course not, Mum.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThen why do you insist on not returning to Nigeria if you have nothing to hide?\u201d<br>\r\nHer mother let her think about that question for a few seconds, before asking another.<br>\r\n\u201cHow long have you been working for that firm?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThree years,\u201d she replied quickly, wondering again where her mind was going.<br>\r\n\u201cHave you ever taken a leave of absence?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\nNow she knew where she was heading.<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d she replied. \u201cIt seems pointless as it is about a week at my level.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut a week times three is three weeks my dear,\u201d she stated.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can be allowed to go for that long,\u201d she protested.<br>\r\n\u201cNever think yourself indispensable even if you own the company, Banke,\u201d she advised.<br>\r\n\u201cOk Mum. But I cannot pull myself away just now.\u201d She had told her exactly what she wanted to pass across.<br>\r\n\u201cBut taking time off is essential for your well-being,\u201d she declared. \u201cIts because you don\u2019t give yourself time that you don\u2019t have a husband by now. I would have thought that with all your Fidel cousins in that country and abroad, you would have found one by now. I see it is because there is no time. That has to change immediately.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI will see what I can do Mother,\u201d she replied in a tight tone. It seemed everyone wanted her hitched as soon as possible.<br>\r\n\u201cThat means you won\u2019t do anything,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n\u201cMum\u201d she gasped, but didn\u2019t deny it.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the \u2018Mother\u2019 means I have annoyed you,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt is for your own good. If I don\u2019t hear anything promising in the next three months, I\u2019ll come personally to help you plan your vacation.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat wont be necessary,\u201d she quickly assured her, as she searched the crowd for her brother Ope. She needed an escape route before she got her to commit to anything. She located Ope then a thought occurred to her: Ope was still with Fiona and had been since the big \u2018Surprise\u2019 she had gotten in the morning. Both were shy creatures so it was either they were taking refuge in each other, or something was going on. She filed that away for rumination later.<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you actually have not met any interesting man this year, Banke,\u201d continued her mother. \u201cDon\u2019t give me a yes, I know that isn\u2019t entirely true.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo comment, Mum,\u201d was all she would say in reply as she cut across the crowd towards Ope.<br>\r\n\u201cEven if you say anything it still does not wipe out the fact that you have no boyfriend. Why don\u2019t you come over to Lagos and meet some very nice young men? God knows the choices are endless, from our old gardener\u2019s son, who\u2019s now a Lawyer, to Chief Teco Benson\u2019s grandson, the one you went to school with, now what\u2019s his name again?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cRichard, Mum,\u201d she quickly added. \u201cOpe would like to speak to you.\u201d Then thrust the phone into her brother\u2019s right hand as she told him the same thing, \u201cMum wants to speak to you.\u201d She was about to compliment Fiona on her lovely red dress when she heard her name behind her at the same time that Mamafi caught her eye and beckoned on her with a frantic wave of her hand.<br>\r\n\u201cAdel! I had almost given up hope of locating you before this show was over. I didn\u2019t know you were this famous.\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before she had turned completely she knew who the person was. Kola Olateju. For a second she wondered who would have invited the odious snob, then it hit her: Travis. She drew in a deep breath as She saw Travis had magically appeared on the other side of the blonde on Kola\u2019s arm.<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll assist my cousin in finishing the pleasantries,\u201d he said, \u201cLike how are you doing and thank you so much for coming.\u201d<br>\r\nShe smiled at him and his face froze at the message he got from her eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry for the lapse,\u201d she apologized. \u201cIt\u2019s been happening all evening as I find out that virtually everyone knew about this party except me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been a surprise if you had known,\u201d the blonde said as she assessed Adel from head to toe. Adel was used to this, as she had endured all that in school, as almost all her friends were guys with girlfriends most of the time. By the time she had turned nineteen, there was no stare, racist, leery, hostile or assuasive that could lower her self \u2013 esteem anymore, no matter what she was wearing.<br>\r\n\u201cYou are quite right,\u201d she agreed, adding as she offered the blonde her hand, \u201cI\u2019m Adel Fidel.\u201d who took it and replied, \u201cI\u2019m Alison Fairbanks.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe same Alison Fairbanks the model?\u201d she asked, pretending it wasn\u2019t obvious.<br>\r\n\u201cYes. The same.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMy,\u201d Adel exclaimed, noting that she had annoyed Kola again. \u201cYou look even better in the flesh!\u201d<br>\r\nAlison laughed self-consciously and muttered a \u2018Thank you\u2019. Obviously Kola thought to make her jealous, or even regretful, by bringing a model to her birthday party, but she had acted impressed and indifferent instead. She saw Mamafi, in the archway she had vacated, trying to get her attention so she excused herself and made her way back towards the elegant woman.<br>\r\nWhy Travis had invited him Adel could not imagine, but she would wring it out later, when it was payback time. Adel was sure she had told Travis about the wife and children Kola had deserted in Nigeria three years ago, before meeting her and trying to tag her and him as an item. What he didn\u2019t know, couldn\u2019t know, was that his wife, her long \u2013 lost childhood friend, had asked Adel to keep being the unknown spy on her wandering husband. Adel wasn\u2019t about to let the Press or anyone else tell the wife that she had taken over from her as Kola\u2019s wife instead. The fact that Adel rejected his advances put her on the wrong side with him however. Adel didn\u2019t care.<br>\r\n\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Adel asked, as she got within earshot of Mamafi. She just smiled back. Mamafi was five feet eleven inches tall but didn\u2019t reach her husband\u2019s chin. How she had retained her slim figure after four children was not so much of a mystery. Adel had seen Mamafi\u2019s side of the family and knew that they were all like that. The woman\u2019s brown eyes were looking Adel over with approval. She had had the purple ball gown Adel was wearing handmade from Greece and was responsible for the hairdo and make up as well.<br>\r\n\u201cI just wanted to ask how you were faring,\u201d she replied.<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know who I just greeted?\u201d Adel asked heatedly. With Mamafi she was truly herself.<br>\r\n\u201cLet me guess. Kola\u201d Mamafi replied, with the \u2018Kola\u2019 coming out as \u2018Cola\u2019.<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Adel muttered fiercely. \u201cAnd someone will have to pay for that!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPlease promise me the next ceremony wont be Travis\u2019 funeral,\u201d the woman pleaded.<br>\r\n\u201cI will try,\u201d Adel replied, keeping a straight face for about three seconds before she grinned back at her.<br>\r\n\u201cHas Mum called?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n\u201cYes she has,\u201d Adel replied. \u201cShe went into her \u2018You must be married before your next birthday\u2019 speech again.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd?\u201d Mamafi prompted.<br>\r\n\u201cI escaped,\u201d Adel assured her.<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you escape?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI gave Ope the phone and told him Mum wanted to speak to him,\u201d she replied. \u201cThen I told Mum Ope wanted to speak to her.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou cannot run forever, you know,\u201d Mamafi said quietly. \u201cAt your age I was carrying Charlie.\u201d Charlie was the last boy before Fiona. The others were Finn Junior, and Frankie. Mamafi always said that after Charlie, who was the biggest of them, she had to take a rest before continuing her search for a daughter. Charlie was about six years older than Fiona was.<br>\r\n\u201cI will not be forced into marriage until I feel I am ready,\u201d Adel said quietly.<br>\r\n\u201cNo one is trying to force you into marriage,\u201d stated Mamafi. \u201cWe all love you too much for that. Its just that we think its time you settled down with a human being, instead of the career you seem so comfortable with. If you don\u2019t watch out, the other joys of life will pass you by before you know it.\u201d<br>\r\nShe glanced at Mamafi to make sure she was serious. She was. She didn\u2019t know what to say in reply.<br>\r\n\u201cTony said to tell you to come to the stage, everyone\u2019s waiting for you,\u201d Jamie, one of her Fidel cousins said, as he hugged Mamafi from behind, making her squeal. He was so tall, even Mamafi was looking, no, straining up to look at him.<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Jamie,\u201d she replied, the added. \u201cThank you, Mamafi. I know you mean well.\u201d<br>\r\nShe walked to the entrance, surveyed the crowd, drew in a deep breath and began walking the path that the crowd had created in the middle. She glanced around and smiled brightly. What Mamafi had said, and the way she had said it was threatening to make her squeeze her brow in deep thought. Had it really gotten to that stage? Did she look so contented with her job? Is that what everybody thought?<br>\r\n\u201cLets give a hand of applause to the celebrant!\u201d declared her Fidel cousin, Tony, who was the M. C. of the occasion. If she had wanted anyone to be the master of ceremonies at her birthday, it would have been Tony. He possessed an aura of liveliness that never failed to carry everybody along.<br>\r\nAfter the clapping subsided, she looked around at the crowd and smiled brighter. Talking into the microphone Tony had placed into her hand, she thanked everybody again for coming.<br>\r\n\u201cThank you all for attending this girlfriend\u2019s birthday party. Your presence alone is enough to assure me I\u2019m not an island. You all make up a giant jigsaw puzzle that remains just one piece in the middle to be complete right now.\u201d<br>\r\nThen she paused for effect before asking, \u201cWon\u2019t anyone ask me what that piece is?\u201d Several people obliged her and asked.<br>\r\n\u201cThe piece is me!\u201d laughing anyway at her feeble attempt at a joke. \u201cThank you again. I wish all the things you wish me!\u201d<br>\r\nShe turned to give Tony back the mike, and he said quickly, \u201cThat\u2019s funny, coz, I thought the missing piece was your boyfriend.\u201d And she watched as the crowd exploded with laughter. She kept her smile in place, and turned to leave the stage, when he added, \u201cNot so fast, Adel, we haven\u2019t given you your surprise yet,\u201d adding as he turned to the crowd, \u201cHave we?\u201d and he got his answer \u2013 shouted \u2018No\u2019 from them.<br>\r\nShe turned around in resignation. Whatever it was, she wanted it over with so the people could start dancing and then she\u2019d be able to escape to her apartment and put her feet up, or even, soak up in a good bath for at least three hours.<br>\r\n\u201cFiona,\u201d called Tony. \u201cCould you help us blindfold Adel? Thank you.\u201d<br>\r\nShe stood rigid as her little sister tied a black handkerchief around her eyes. If Tony went too far she was going to get him.<br>\r\n\u201cAdel\u2019s surprise, could you please step out for everyone to see?\u201d Tony said.<br>\r\nThe surprise was human.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And Ope knows him? Who could it be? She wondered.<br>\r\n\u201cDoes everyone know him?\u201d Adel asked the crowd. Maybe it was the student Dean from school. Ope had seen enough pictures from her school to recognize anyone he saw in the hall.<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u201d came the reply.<br>\r\n\u201cDid he go to St. Mary\u2019s?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u201d was shouted back at her with such intensity, she became flustered as to the identity of the mystery guy.<br>\r\n\u201cHow many questions left, Tony?\u201d she asked, about ready to give up.<br>\r\n\u201cFourteen, coz\u201d Tony replied.<br>\r\n\u201cIs he a black Canadian?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u201d was chanted in reply, and she took that to mean he wasn\u2019t black or Canadian.<br>\r\n\u201cIs he an American?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\nA resounding \u2018Yes\u2019 was given to her.<br>\r\n\u201cIs he a model?\u201d she asked, remembering the only American she had met recently. The guy had talked so much about his \u2018career\u2019 just rising off the ground, he had reminded her of Joey in Friends, acting career that never ever happened.<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u201d came the reply.<br>\r\n\u201cA musician then?\u201d she asked jokingly, and was surprised she got an affirmative answer.<br>\r\nNo it could not be Daniel Belfield. They could never go that far! Could they? They could not even reach him.<br>\r\n\u201cDoes he sing rock?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u201d came the reply.<br>\r\n\u201cBlues?\u201d she added, and smiled when she got another affirmative response.<br>\r\n\u201cIs it Daniel Belfield?\u201d she asked in a hushed tone. Only Tony heard her and replied, \u201cIs that your first guess?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u201d she replied.<br>\r\nTony repeated her question to the crowd and watched her smile as the crowd shouted a \u201cYes\u201d to it.<br>\r\n\u201cThe very first guess and she is lucky!\u201d proclaimed Tony. \u201cDan, could you help her with the blindfold?\u201d<br>\r\nAs he removed the covering from her eyes, she blinked at the bright light surrounding his face. She just stared at the superstar before her. He was the only musician that she bought everything he published. His was the only celebrity life she followed with diligence. She had often been teased that she must be waiting in vain for Daniel Belfield to find her.<br>\r\n\u201cHi,\u201d was all she could manage.<br>\r\nHis smile grew wider as he bent to her face and planted a kiss fully on her lips. Her eyes widened. He stood by her side and smiled at the crowd, which was still hooting with pleasure at his gesture.<br>\r\n\u201cThe charming Prince has just awakened the sleeping beauty,\u201d shouted Tony above the din. \u201cDon\u2019t you agree?\u201d<br>\r\nThe noise increased. Adel looked everywhere but at the man beside her. She was sure she\u2019d wake up from the dream soon but was hesitant to pinch herself to prove otherwise.<br>\r\n\u201cYou may leave now, Adel,\u201d Said Tony, as the din began to lessen. \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget your present. Try to keep it to yourself too, for the rest of the night.\u201d<br>\r\nAdel didn\u2019t know whether that was a good idea. Now that I\u2019ve gotten my wish, how do I act? Was the question bugging her at the moment.<br>\r\nShe led him into the garden at the back of the hall. It was well lit and already sweet scents had begun to rise into the air.<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d she began, on reaching the beautifully carved fountain in the middle of the garden.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you a look alike or dress up? Or are you for real?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI bet you\u2019ve been ruminating on how to ask me that question without hurting my feelings,\u201d came his reply. She knew her answer instantly, recognizing his voice. He was the real thing after all, though how her family had managed it she didn\u2019t know.<br>\r\n\u201cHow did they find you? How did they kidnap you? Did they blackmail you? Or how much are they paying you?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d he replied, his voice sounding incredulous at her insinuation. \u201cYou thought I couldn\u2019t have come except I was paid?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I know your time is money, Daniel\u201d she answered.<br>\r\n\u201cActually one of your friends is my cousin,\u201d he stated.<br>\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTrevor Dallas\u201d he replied.<br>\r\nAn image of the shy, quiet Treve, who no one really noticed, appeared in Adel\u2019s mind.<br>\r\n\u201cYou are Treve\u2019s cousin?\u201d she exclaimed in disbelief.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he replied. \u201cIs something wrong with that?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo. No\u201d she replied. \u201cIt\u2019s just that it could never have occurred to me that Treve was Daniel Belfield\u2019s cousin.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost an impossibility, I know,\u201d he said wryly.<br>\r\nWondering what he meant by the statement, she quickly added,<br>\r\n\u201cTreve\u2019s one of my very good friends and its just that he has never mentioned the fact that Daniel Belfield was his cousin in the whole six years we\u2019ve known each other. Not even by accident.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI understand. I\u2019m sure you would not too, if you were in his shoes\u201d he responded. \u201cMost people usually preferred others liking them for themselves, and not because they were related to some celebrity.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI get your point.\u201d She muttered.<br>\r\n\u201cSo he not only talked you into attending my birthday party, he also convinced you somehow to be my \u2018present\u2019.\u201d She stated.<br>\r\n\u201cThat was the mystery part, which I didn\u2019t know until five minutes before I was called on to the stage.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo both of us had no idea what they were up to, up till the last minute, right?\u201d she stated.<br>\r\n\u201cExactly\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHope you weren\u2019t annoyed,\u201d she muttered. \u201cMy cousins can be very irritating sometimes.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt was all fun, Adel,\u201d saying her name for the first time \u2013 she had been almost sure he could not remember. \u201cI enjoyed it because for once the press didn\u2019t have any idea where I was and what I was doing.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that.\u201d She stated.<br>\r\n\u201cIf I had any doubts as to going along with their plan, when I saw you, it all melted away,\u201d he whispered, leaning closer so she alone could hear.<br>\r\nHis behavior didn\u2019t surprise her. She smiled. If she had needed any more confirmation that it really was Daniel Belfield before her, she had it now. He was a renowned flirt.<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for going along with it anyway,\u201d she replied, taking a little step back from him. \u201cThis is the best birthday I have ever had, so far.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I was part of it,\u201d he said moving closer as she inched further away.<br>\r\nShe walked towards the rose bushes and bent down to admire the closed blooms as she asked, \u201cIs Isabelle also in the party then?\u201d<br>\r\nThat stopped him in his tracks, as he was about to get to her side. Isabelle Chowdin was his Swedish girlfriend of two weeks. He had flown to Alberta with the Supermodel a few minutes after he broke up with his girlfriend of two years, Sandra Eaton. Adel had not yet forgiven him for that crime.<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d he confessed. \u201cShe\u2019s visiting with some friends in Quebec at the moment.\u201d<br>\r\nShe noted the little quiver in his voice and decided the balance was in her favor.<br>\r\n\u201cWhen will she be back?\u201d Adel asked sweetly as she straightened. \u201cI would so much love to meet the dumb blonde that you thought was better than Sandra.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo you are one of those who feel I should not have ended my relationship with Sandra,\u201d he said, ignoring her insult.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you want to end it after so long. Two years is the standard courtship time before marriage and I was saving up to attending the wedding, wherever it might be. Then in comes Barbie doll, spoiling everything!\u201d she said vehemently.<br>\r\nWhen he didn\u2019t say anything in reply, she turned to really look at him. She could not read his expression.<br>\r\n\u201cDaniel, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she apologized. \u201cI know its none of my business and I\u2019m not the best person to ask about relationships. Forgive \u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou are wrong.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?,\u201d she asked, confused.<br>\r\n\u201cYou are the best person to ask about relationships. Trevor told me\u201d he stated.<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big compliment but I still feel \u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHe told me about Ron and Jess.\u201d He interrupted again.<br>\r\n\u201cHe did?\u201d she muttered. \u201cWell that was just nothing. Anybody could have done tha\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd David and Cynthia.\u201d He added.<br>\r\n\u201cHe did?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd Mr. and Mrs. Fidel.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHe must have added his own ingredients to the pot, Daniel,\u201d she declared. \u201cAll I did was listen to both of them, most times not without pestering them first. And I made them see what they were missing. That\u2019s all I did. There was no magic to it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I want, no, need your help. Do whatever you do but please help me get her back.\u201d He said vehemently.<br>\r\n\u201cWho do you want back? I must warn you that I am the wrong person for the job as I am biased towards Isabelle. I could not possibly help you patch things up with her if things have gone awry because I cannot let \u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI want Sandy back,\u201d he said hoarsely.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The hall they had rented was a former old house that had been renovated to accommodate big parties and conferences. Travis, Tony, Charlie and Adel had stayed behind to ensure the place was cleaned up properly by the crew they\u2019d hired, and locked up.<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019m falling asleep on my feet,\u201d murmured Adel. Charlie glanced at her, then bent down and grabbed her, slinging her onto his shoulders with ease.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you comfortable?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not!\u201d she shouted, outraged. \u201cHow can you expect me to fall asleep upside down?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, but didn\u2019t put her down or let her get down. \u201cI didn\u2019t think of that.\u201d<br>\r\nShe gave up struggling a few seconds later, when he began to walk. It was no use trying to jump down from a six foot ten height.<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d she asked, as her head swayed behind him with his gait.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you scared?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\nIt was a trick question, one of the first that she had quickly learnt soon after moving in with them all those years ago. If she said no, he\u2019d do something fractious. If she said yes, he\u2019d still do something wild, so the best thing was to keep mum.<br>\r\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to answer are you?\u201d he chuckled. Suddenly, she was swung up into the air. She held her breath as she fell back into his arms. He was grinning.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll sure hate the day I won\u2019t be able to swing you up in the air again,\u201d he said, as he put her down slowly.<br>\r\n\u201cThe way you can\u2019t swing Fiona again?\u201d she asked. Their little sister was not so little anymore. Her legs had elongated rapidly and at sixteen Fiona was six feet. Adel had stopped measuring herself beside her when she passed her five feet three at age twelve.<br>\r\nCharlie ignored her question and waited for her to look up at him.<br>\r\n\u201cGet into the car, Adel.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, incredulous. It had been a while that Charlie bossed her around.<br>\r\n\u201cI said get in. I want to talk to you,\u201d he repeated.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about my car? Or you didn\u2019t think of that too\u201d she asked sweetly.<br>\r\n\u201cTony\u2019s driving it to your apartment,\u201d he replied in a more serious tone. \u201cI just want a few words with you alone.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d she agreed as she walked up to the passenger door of his Jeep. He was there before her, opening the door and closing it after she\u2019d \u2018climbed\u2019 in. she settled back and let him drive, waiting for him to bring up whatever it was that he wanted to talk to her about. But she was curious although she tried hard not to let it show.</span></div></div>",
