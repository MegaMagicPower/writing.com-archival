The one feeling you try to shake, but don't know how.\u201d A female guilmon thought to herself as she made her way to the nearest forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was walking, an odd berry fell from the tree above her. Bouncing off her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \u201cOof, what the,?\u201d She exclaimed, \u201cWhere did that come from?\u201d She focused her attention on the fruit that had fallen onto her head. It was round and shapely like an orange, but a deep blue in color unlike one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held it up to her nose and took a deep whiff. It smelt of vanilla. \u201cHm, interesting.\u201d she thought. Her curiousity peaked, she took a bite. It tasted like mint. \u201cPleh. Ugh. Not what I was expecting.\u201d She said, spitting the fruit out. Strangely, the taste of mint did not last long, changing into a tart, strawberry esque taste. \u201cOk, that's better.\u201d She said, taking the new taste in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the taste began to disapate, the back of her throat began to tingle. It sent a shiver down her spine. \u201cOh,\u201d she said in a slightly aroused tone \u201c,What was that?\u201d She finished, raising her hand to her head, resting her black nailed fingers on her forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, she didn't have any fingers, just paws. She jolted her hands into her field of view.\u201dAH!\u201d she yelled, falling onto her backside. Her new fingers were long and slender, like a human females. It took her a little while to take in the situation. Suddenly feeling the tingle again although it focused on her head and below. Feeling the base of her head with the hand she wasn't inspecting and realized her neck had elongated a couple of inches if not more. It wasn't only on her hands and neck now, her legs, feet and arms were starting to grow longer and bigger too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does she react?</span></div></div>",

They were only C cup at the moment but we're continuing to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female Guilmon was just standing in shock, the only thing fighting back her arousal being true terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the tingling had stopped. Having grown five feet taller, she now stood at ten and a half feet tall. Her new breasts have expanded exponentially, being extremely soft and bouncy EE cups. And when I say bouncy, I mean just her breathing gave them a good shake. Her rump was not spared from the transformation, being 25% larger, five times as firm, and twice as bouncy compared to her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female guilmon sat up against a tree, waiting for the panic to die down. But once it did. She looked up at the tree the fruit had come from, only to find that it wasn't there, in fact, there weren't any trees anymore. \u201cWait what?!?\u201d She boomed. \u201cWhere did it do?!? How did it go?!? And why did it's fruit do this to me?!?\u201d She looked down to see the trees, now at eye level with her. \u201cOh.\u201d She said, feeling dumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the curious type, she takes another fruit and\u2026</span></div></div>",
