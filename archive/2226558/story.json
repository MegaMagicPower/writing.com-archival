With all that completed James, then fixes his hair and heads out of his small home that he was able to purchase because of his job which he gets in his vehicle and drives off to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything goes on as normal at his job, doing all the usual things he normally does and is told to do. Not much happened during that day at work which bummed out James, but at least it wasn't all bad, because he's taking home a huge pay check for the week with a total of 40 hours plus 10 hours of overtime which totaling a large sum of money. Anyways, the day at comes to close and James finally heads home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakes the boring drive home, pulls in the drive way and walks in where he basically kicks his shoes off, loosens his tie, pulls his suit jacket, vest and shirt hanging them up, then pulls off his suit pants and hangs them on the back of chair leaving him in just his underclothes. Letting out a sigh of relief that he's finally able to relax for a few days, \"finally.\" James says to himself as he walks into the kitchen, grabs a six pack of his favorites beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen walks into his living room, reclines on his big comfy recliner, turns on his TV on to one of his favorite shows. Where was just about crack open his first beer when he hears his phone start going off, beep after beep after beep, James finally gets up to check it to see what the noise is all about. Reluctantly he gets off his comfy recliner and pulls his phone out of his suit jacket pocket to see that he has multiple texts from his bets buddy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrance:<br>\r\n<div align=\"right\"><div align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Sup, you know how you need partner.

Getting dressed and fixing his hair again, he heads out of his house again. Get some in his vehicle and makes the long drive down into the city. Which took an hour to begin with until of the 30 minutes it took him to get the ready. Leaving him a half hour to find a park spot, which is always hard to do around this time, but James managed after 10 minutes. Where he then walked down to the restaurant, walked in and luckily Terrance set up a reservation under your name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening sir. What name do you have for a reservation?\" The greeter asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping Terrance had set one up James answers, \"ahh....James Turner.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good...I'll have her take you to your table.\" The greeter tells James and the waitress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me sir.\" The waitress tells you and leads you to your table which is near the back corner of the restaurant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a seat she asks, \"just you tonight or will someone be joining you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh...umm, my friend set up a blind date for me that's suppose to meet here soon.\" James replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like fun, so here's the menus and what will you be having to drink?\" She asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a water with lemon for now.\" James tells her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get right on that.\" The waitress answers and walks off leaving you to wait as you look at the entrance waiting for your blind date to show up.

However, what they didn't tell you is that there is something odd, strange, weird about your date that you'll soon find out when you they meet you at the restaurant you choose, named <span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\">SEASON 53</span>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there you can choose how things play from then on, wether it be she has a different head, different body, has two heads, etc.... You know head swap, body part swap type of stuff. Things can be simple or really wild like my chapters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>The Characters:</b></u><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I'll start out with a few main characters to help get things started and if you want, you are more than welcome to add more characters of your liking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMain Characters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- James Turner: <br>\r\nA young adult who has things going mostly in the right direction. Has a steady paying job, but is now starting to look for a girlfriend or a boyfriend if that's what it comes down to. Anyways, he's a decent looking young 6'4\" athletic built man with short black hair that's combed to one side, has green eyes, wears glasses, tries his best to keep clean shaven and mostly wears suits because of his job and likes to let loose once in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Emily Johnson:<br>\r\nA pretty young adult who has things going mostly her way like her job as a receptionist except for trying to get a boyfriend or a girlfriend. Anyways, she's a pretty young looking 5'9\" woman with long straight brown hair that she wears in a ponytail most of the time, has brown eyes, does her best to keep herself looking pretty and neat because of her job. Which requires her to look her best, but likes to let loose once in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story is loosely inspired by an interactive that was in here called something like More Than a Pretty Face. Loved it much that I just wanted to try and make something similar. It probably won't be as good, but I'm sure it will work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, have fun!!!</td>",
