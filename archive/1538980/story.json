Surprisingly, you did this with the help of only your blaziken, Chica. She was a shy weakling as a torchic, but as you trained with her, the bond increased as well as her attitude, now being as energetic as you were. She was rarely ever in her ball the further you two went, now barely using the pokeball in general. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You were walking with Chica behind you toward the next city, it having a steel type gym and a multitude of labs and factories. You got in and decided to look around before attempting the gym. Instead of the boring tours of the manufacturing of bikes or the metal durability building you decide to go to the admittedly still boring museum of inventions. Due to the Pokemon restriction notice at the door, any Pokemon too big or dangerous in groups would be thrown out with their trainers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Not wanting to ball your blaziken, you instead do something you two did plenty of times, plan Surgical mask and overcoat. It was a classic that worked multiple times including now. Treating the red feathers as a skin condition, you walk in and have as much fun as anyone would have in a museum. There was a couple interesting machines, but the most interesting piece was Bill's teleportation machine rumored to have fused him and a Pokemon together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You could actually examine the inside of the machine, which you did, of course. Many buttons and levers were inside. Chica cooed to herself while pressing most of them while you were in the other pod, both of which connected by a tube. After a lot of heavy pressing, a loose panel falls with a single wire frayed inside amongst a knot of multiple others. She pokes the frayed wire a bit before letting it swing and touch the other end, making a spark, revving the engine and closing the doors. You only noticed the doors shut before a light filled the pods. The surrounding crowd watched as both pods open only to see a...</span></div></div>",

A twist of fate that would change your life permanently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat afternoon when you arrived home from school, it was just like any other day: get up, go to school, come back, and sleep.<br>\r\nBut however, you did always manage squeeze a little free-time each day into your favorite thing- pokemon.<br>\r\nTruth was, you weren't even sure WHY you liked pokemon. It was just something about those strange little animals that always drew you towards them.<br>\r\nThey always seemed to be filled with happiness and excitement, unlike your boring life. They went on adventures and performed awesome moves and abilities while you sat at school and took notes on random crap you couldn't care less about. And you always had a fascination with animals.<br>\r\nBut no other pokemon drew your attention so much as the the most famous one of all, Pikachu.<br>\r\nFor crying out loud, he was the star of the whole franchise!<br>\r\nHe was a cute little mouse with electric powers, and everybody loved him. <br>\r\nWhich, in a way, is why you envied him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo tell the truth, you always thought it would be kinda cool to BE a pokemon.<br>\r\nJust imagine, a life full of adventure, excitement, and awesome abilities! It would be so cool! Most of all, you deeply wished you could be that cute little electric mouse, Pikachu.<br>\r\nBut a long time ago, gave up those dreams, for you knew they were absolutely rediculous.<br>\r\nBecoming a pokemon? Hah! Why would you even consider the possibility! But deep down inside, you still thought it would be kinda cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you came home after school that afternoon, as I've explained before, you popped in your old 'Pokemon: Yellow Version' into your nearly broken old gameboy color.<br>\r\nYou used to play the game for hours on end, and never got tired of playing the game over and over again, trying to max out your pokemons' potential.<br>\r\nSure blue and red version were pretty much exactly the same as yellow, but there was one crucial thing that was missing form the other two: that cute little pixelated pikachu that followed you everywhere.<br>\r\nYou used to be in love with that pikachu, and would check its mood about every two minutes.<br>\r\nFor crying out loud, you probably maxed out its stats at least a million times!<br>\r\nYep, those were the good times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou you turn on your gameboy, and you already feel noglastica hitting on the head when a nidorina and a gengar duke it out in a cheap battle, followed by the title screen.<br>\r\nYou also see the familiar mug of pikachu on the front the screen as a small message at the bottom insists that you hit the start button.<br>\r\nSo of course, you hit the start button.<br>\r\nWhen you first start the game, you start a new file and see familiar old Proffessor Oak as he explains about the world of pokemon, followed by him having a hard time remembering your name.<br>\r\nWhen he asks you what your name is though, something different happens.<br>\r\nThe name choices get messed up.<br>\r\nInstead of there being the normal \"Ash\" and \"Yellow\" name choices, it gives you the names \"Lopn\", \"Mysi\", and \"Haun\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyebrow lifts slightly in confusuion, but you decide to choose a name anyway.<br>\r\nWhich one do you choose?</span></div></div>",

Maybe becuase you liked how it sounded.<br>\r\nEither way, it didnt matter now- your pokemon adventure was about to start!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of beggining, you did exactly what the game wanted you to do- you know, pick your rivals name and and talk to your mom, etc.<br>\r\nIn your last file you had named your rival \"Mr. Poophead\", but that was back when you were eight. Now you were more mature.<br>\r\nYou named your rival \"Captain Fail\".<br>\r\nWhen the game began, you ran out into the fields, just like you weren't supposed to.<br>\r\nBut of course, that was the only way to proceed in the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you expected, the professor came rushing up and tried to stop you, but it was too late- a wild pokemon battle ensued.<br>\r\nThe thing that happened next is probably one of the most mysterious things that has happened in man-kind.<br>\r\nYou see, the screen spun from white to black, like it always does when a pokemon battle happens. But then it spun back from black to black to white again.<br>\r\nAt first you don't notice this, but then it starts repeating itself over and over again, spinning back and forth from black and white.<br>\r\nYou get a little angry right then. Had your game frozen up? Was it broken? If it was, you would have to try to find a whole other game. And as far as you knew, no one was gonna sell it for a cheap price.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to throw a fit, but then the spinning starts to catch your eye. Was it just you, or was it getting brighter?<br>\r\nIndeed, it was getting brighter- and it kept shinging brighter and brighter by the second.<br>\r\nFirst you notice that the screen starts to light up as if it were a DS or something.<br>\r\nNext, it starts to become as bright as a flashlight. But that doesn't stop it's increase in brightness. Soon it becomes as bright as a street light, and then a car light!<br>\r\nThe spinning keeps on getting faster, and the screen keeps on getting brighter and brighter.<br>\r\nAt this point, you start getting scared. Is your game gonna blow up or something? What the heck is going on!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the game becomes brighter than you could possibly imagine. Infact, you start having a hard time seeing the room!<br>\r\nEverything seems to be getting taken over by this swirling combination of brightness.<br>\r\nYou try to run away, but it's no use- by the time you turn around, the door has faded into the light.<br>\r\nSoon the whole room becomes engulfed in a mad swirl of black and white, and all you can do is scream. But your scream is cut short by the blinding light, which soon even takes over the sound in the room itself. You black out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat seems like hours later, you wake up.<br>\r\nYou grab your head and moan, but something doesn't feel right- everything on your body feels out of place or bent weird. Maybe you got a bump on your head?<br>\r\nYou slowly crack your eyes open to see if you can find the problem, but ti's no use- everything is still covered in a brilliant white light.<br>\r\nYou have to admit though, the light actaully seems kind of............... well, peacefull now.<br>\r\nStill, it prevents you form seeing, so you try to get up and walk. But when you do you trip over your feet and clumsily fall over!<br>\r\nYou try to say 'ow', but your voice seems to be sore form that strange experience, preventing you form talking.<br>\r\nJust as your about to give up, the light starts to fade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiddily, you stand up again.<br>\r\nFinally, now you can see again! A certain energy comes over you, and you suddenly feel ready for anything.<br>\r\nIt's like some sort of lightining bolt has hit you and filled you up with energy!<br>\r\nDespite all of the energy though, you wait patiently for the light to fade away. And that's when you notice something- you're not in your room anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the light fades, you see everything around you.<br>\r\nYou're outside, standing in a bunch tall grass, but there's something that's very wrong.<br>\r\nEither you got smaller, or everthing else got bigger!<br>\r\nYou start to look around in panic, and try to absorb in everything. Normally at this point you would have made some wise crack such as \"I don't think we're in Kansas anymore\", but due to your fear, confusuion, and lack of ability to speak, you don't.<br>\r\nYou notice a strange twitching sensation just above your butt, and just as you're about to turn around to see what it is, you hear a strange old man in the distance yell \"Go pokeball!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou focus on where the voice came from, only to find  familiar white and red ball come flying at you at high speeds.<br>\r\nQuick, what do you do!?</span></div></div>",

Why did you feel so weird? And most of all.............. why were you on all fours?!<br>\r\nQucikly, your mind forces you to forget these thoughts, and disregard them as normal. Your mind only wanted to focus on one thing now............. attacking the old man that had attacked you!<br>\r\nSomeone had just thrown a pokeball at you! <br>\r\nAnd you just dodged it by jumping several feet through the air! Were you gonna sit there and take that?! No way!<br>\r\nA foreign instinct bubbles up inside you, and on all fours, you rush at the old man. 'Destroy the evil man!' your mind cries, 'Or else he will destroy you!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rush through the tall grass, watching it brush by you in a blur. <br>\r\nYour breathing becomes fast, and as you sprint towards the man on all fours, you feel a strange energy take over your whole body.<br>\r\nA very, very dangerous energy.<br>\r\nApproaching the man, you get a better look at his appearance. You don't know why, but he seems very familiar...........<br>\r\nNo time to worry about that now though. You are just about to hit the man,, and destroy his threatening prescence!<br>\r\nYou would've normally laughed at him when you saw him frantically searching for another pokeball when you were a few yards away from him, but you didn't.<br>\r\nYou didn't have time to laugh now- your whole body was focused on pure instinct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approached the man, that strange, powerful energy in your body increased.<br>\r\nAnd just as you jumped at the man, ready to slam him into the ground, the energy EXPLODED out of your body, and into................. electricity?!?!?!<br>\r\nYour whole body becomes paralyzed with shock (no pun intended), your instincts lose control, and you drop straight out of the air.<br>\r\nElectricity!? How in the world did electricity start form out of your body?!<br>\r\nWere you gonna die now? Was the energy the source of the electricity? What the heck was going on?!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hit the ground with a soft THUD, and lay there, lost in your own thoughts for a few seconds.<br>\r\nAnd that was all of the time the man needed to retaliate.<br>\r\nQuickly, he pulled out another pokeball and chucked it at your head, causing a bruise form there.<br>\r\nThe pokeball bounced straight up into the air, and popped open.<br>\r\nBoth you and the man stare nervously at the pokeball, and suddenly you see a sight that was more terrifying than the spinning in your room- with a single PSEW! sound, a translucent red lazer flies towards you, and engulfs your whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freak out and try to get up, but it's too late- in a split second, you feel your whole body dissolve into the lazer and be sucked into the pokeball.<br>\r\nYou try to scream, but you can't, for obvious reasons.<br>\r\nSoon, you're greeted by pitch black darkness.<br>\r\nYou try to struggle, and almost break free of the pokeball's iron grip, but you eventually fail. <br>\r\nYou hear the sickening click of the pokeball's hatch next to you, and realize that you've been captured- there's no way out now.<br>\r\nAll you are are floating red lazer data fragments, trapped inside of a complex ball. <br>\r\nYou can't move or anthing- just wait for the old man that captured you to determine your fate.<br>\r\nEventually, you fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat feels like a few days later, you start to go insane.<br>\r\nYou know you've only been in the pokeball for a few days, but still................ you can never tell when you're trapped in darkness.<br>\r\nYou constantly wish you could go back home, and even start having pretend conversations with your mother- you know, just for when you escape this horrible machine.<br>\r\nThat is, IF you ever escape this horrible machine.<br>\r\nThe darkness slowly starts getting to you- driving you insane with greif and misery. Soon, it feels as if it's eating you alive.<br>\r\nBut one day, you hear what could possibly be one of the most satisfying sounds you've ever heard- the familiar click of the the pokeball.<br>\r\nThe pokeball pops open again, and you try to cry with joy when you feel your red lazer data fragments begin to materialize into a solid body again.<br>\r\nSlowly you sense light in your prescence, and as the red lazer wears off, you gain physical consciousness again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, your first reaction is to look around and see what the heck is going on.<br>\r\nThat's why you nearly jump 20 feet into the air, as the first thing you see is the old man's face right in front of yours.<br>\r\n\"Hello there little critter!\" he exclaims warmly. \"I know you may be a little scared or angry, but soon I'll find a nice trainer for you!\"<br>\r\nYou give him a weird look, as if he were talking a foreign language. What the heck was he calling you 'little critter' for!<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" you exclaim. \"I don't want any crap from you, just let me go!\"<br>\r\nOr at least that's what you WOULD have said, but all that came out was<br>\r\n\"Pika! Pika pika, pika-chu!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze in terror, and feel as if you had just been puched in the guts.<br>\r\nDid you just say................ what you THOUGHT you said?<br>\r\n\"Whoa, calm down little guy!\" the old man proclaims heartily, as if nothing were wrong. \"No need to get so angry! I'll just fix you up some pika-chow and call in a trainer to take care of you. Then you'll feel much better!\"<br>\r\nPika-chow?<br>\r\nA trainer to take care of me?<br>\r\nBy the sound of it, it sounded like he thought you were a.............................<br>\r\nYou look down at your self, and notice why you had gotten that funny feeling above your butt earlier. You had a pikachu tail!<br>\r\nYou also had those stubby pikachu arms, those large pikachu feet, and that bright yellow pikachu torso.................<br>\r\nYou......... you had been turned into a pikachu!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!!\" you screamed, which, in human language, is about the equivalant of \"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!\"<br>\r\nThe professor quickly turned to you with a confused look and asked \"What's the matter little guy? You don't like pika-chow?\"<br>\r\nThat wasn't the problem at all though- no you knew who this man was!<br>\r\nHe was professor Oak, from the world of pokemon!<br>\r\nAnd he had just recently caught you, a wild pikachu, to give to a knew trainer! This was horrible! Horrible, horrible, horrible!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may have been recently turned into a pikachu, but that didn't mean that, just like every other creature on this earth, you couldn't experience extreme emotions when you were upset.<br>\r\nThe first one was fear- you couldn't think straight, and mentally, you completely broke down.<br>\r\nThe second one was anger, which you were experiencing right now.<br>\r\n\"Stupid professor Oak!\" you screamed in a forced language. \"Stupid gameboy! Stupid pokemon! Stupid everything!\"<br>\r\nYou were completley blind with rage. And that's what caused you to do what you did next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, professor Oak had just left the room to get some pika-chow.<br>\r\nAnd now you were in the labratory, a pikachu on a blind rage, all alone. The results would be disastorous.<br>\r\nImmediately, you started destroying everything in sight. Books, computers, test tubes, you name it!<br>\r\nEverything was being completely and utterly destroyed.<br>\r\nThen you came across two test tubes- a blue one, and a red one.<br>\r\nFilled with rage, you smashed one against the white wall, while you dumped the other one's contents into your newly formed mouth, swished it around on your newly formed taste buds, and finally gulped it into your pikachu-sized stomach.<br>\r\nWhich one did you drink?</span></div></div>",

Until, the anger has worn off, I'm gonna have to put you on lock down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you didn't blame him for putting special guard around you- you had just destroyed his lab.<br>\r\nBut when you saw what 'lockdown' meant, your rage suddenly returned- it was another pokeball, with a thunder insignia on the top!<br>\r\n\"Pika!!\" you cried, trying to break free. <br>\r\nBut it was no use.<br>\r\nProfessor Oak sighed and captured you with the pokeball, you struggling to get out thtough the whole process of your body degrading into data again.<br>\r\nlittle did you know that you would remain as data for the next week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week later, you were finally released from your pokeball.<br>\r\nYou were still angry, but not to the point that you were willing to do physical harm to anything.<br>\r\nAs you slowly regained your vision, you saw that professor oak was standing there in his newly rebuilt lab, next to a young kid wearing pajamas with spiked, black hair.<br>\r\n\"Pikachu?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"This is pikachu, the electric mouse pokemon.\" the professor explained to the kid.<br>\r\n\"Remember to take good care of it Ash- this one will need it. It has a bad temper, but is more powerful than your average pikachu.\"<br>\r\n\"Great!\" he exclaimed, picking me up and squeezing me in a bear hug. \"I finally get my first pokemon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow this kid could think whatever he liked about you, but one thing that wouldn't change was the fact that you wouldn't let him touch you.<br>\r\nEver.<br>\r\n\"AAAAAHHH!!\" Ash screamed as you dished out an electrical attack right into him. The kid fell to the ground, temporarily paralyzed.<br>\r\n\"Next time use your rubber gloves, Ash\" the professor laughed at his expense.<br>\r\n\"I..........I'm ok................\" he said weakily, getting up.<br>\r\n\"Let's get out of here, pikachu\" Ash said, slowly treading out of the lab and expecting me to follow. For once, this 'Ash' kid had a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the future, you befriend Ash. He becomes one of the world's most famous pokemon trainers, and you become his best friend.<br>\r\nYou two have many adventures together as well- unlocking ancient secrets, helping citizens, destroying team rocket, etc.<br>\r\nYou don't know why, but maybe this was the natural thing to do, you being a pikachu and all. Becoming stronger than the rest with a trainer slowly became the ultimate goal.<br>\r\nOne thing though- you ALWAYS refused to get inside pokeballs. they made you scared, and you felt walking was so much funner.<br>\r\nAh well, after all of these years, being a human seems like nothing but a distant dream.<br>\r\ni mean, it's not like you can find a way back............ right?</span></div></div>",

But what happens next even suprises YOU.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" you cry in pika-language, staring at the machine.<br>\r\nMore electricity than you thought was even possible had been shot out of your body and into the electrical cable, causing the machine to set off like a box of fireworks.<br>\r\nFlames and meters and elcetrical wires went flying everywhere!<br>\r\nIt takes several minutes for the spontanious combustions of the obliterated machine to stop going off, leaving a melting heap of metal laying on the floor.<br>\r\nAll you can do is stare in shock, your draw dropping all of the way down.<br>\r\nWas it just you, or had the potion made you............ stronger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at your foreign body in awe, you begin to realize what this meant.<br>\r\nIf you drunk enough of that red chemical, you truly WOULD be unstoppable!!<br>\r\nEvil thoughts of revenge against the world already clouding your mind, you turn around and start searching frantically for another bottle of red chemicals.<br>\r\n\"Pi!\" you cry, falling over in pain.

But it doesn't help.<br>\r\n\"Piiiiiiiii!!!\" you cry, as you feel a wave of unforgiving pain smash into the insides of your stomach. You felt like you were going to barf!<br>\r\nBut suddenly, with one last, churn, your stomach instantly feels better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pika pi, chu.............\" you say, which translates to \"Well that was weird..........\"<br>\r\nYou stand up, look around. <br>\r\nJust as fast as it had came, the pain was gone.<br>\r\nDismissing what had just happened as a side-effect of the chemical, you start to run towards the counter again, only to be stopped a second time.<br>\r\nJust as you were about to jump up, you felt something churn and thrash around in your stomach AGAIN.<br>\r\nBut this time it didn't hurt.<br>\r\nLooking down at your stomach, you hear it gurgle again, and then suddenly fill up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne second your stomach had felt woozy and empty, and the next second your stomach was bursting full, as if you had just eaten at a buffet!<br>\r\nYou look down to see your belly protruding a little, and then see it gurgle again.<br>\r\n\"Piiiiii...........\" you mutter, \"Pika pika pi, pikachu..........\" (at this point in the story I won't type pika-text anymore, just normal text)<br>\r\nThis translates to \"Oooohhh.....

Then bolts. And then.................<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piiiiiiikaaaaaaaaa!!!!\" you scream, and release a devastating thunder attack!<br>\r\nThe chair next becomes no longer a chair, but a puddle of melted plastic and leather.<br>\r\nYou, a simple pikachu, had just released one of the most powerful Thunders ever recorded! And you weren't even supposed to know that move for a long time!<br>\r\nYou smile in victory. This was gonna be easier than you thought.<br>\r\nBut suddenly, against all beleif, your electric energy begins to increase more and more! Your body burns and your veins pulse rapidly at the sheer amounts of electrical energy being pumped through your body!<br>\r\n\"What......?\" you say in a scared tone of voice. <br>\r\nNow the electrcitiy was starting to fly uncontroablly out of your body in powerful blasts that knocked over heavy-duty tools.<br>\r\nAn almost invisible sphere of electricity was even starting to form around you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body begins to shake and twitch in severe degrees as electrical energy seems to start seeping through every pore in your body.<br>\r\n\"To........ much........ power!!!!\" you scream, as your body begins to become an uncontrollable rag-doll to the intense amounts of electricity that was pouring out of it.<br>\r\n\"Please........\" you beg to no one in particular, \"help..........\"<br>\r\nYou start to black out at this point, as electricity starts tearing through your body like tissue, and your body gets thrown in random directions in the room.<br>\r\nThe brightness of the sphere of electricity coming out of your body becomes an intense, searing hot white, and soon your vision goes blank.<br>\r\nYou are a prisoner to your own, uncontrollable power. And if the power kept increasing, you would die.<br>\r\n\"PIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" you scream in one last final attempt to get some attention, but it's no use.<br>\r\nOak was at the store buying food, and if someone had looked into the window right then, all they would have saw was a giant ball of electricty zipping around the room, destroying the foundation of the building itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, just as you became sure that you would explode with electricity, something completely unexpected happens- you gain a little bit of control in your stomach!<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you barely mutter. How did you do that?<br>\r\nSlowly, you start to get the control that you got in your stomach all over your body.<br>\r\nNow that you can think clearly, you squint through the light of your own electricity and spot something that makes you gasp.<br>\r\nYou had gotten a little chubbier!<br>\r\n\"The fat.....\" you say, squeezing your stomach flab with your thick hands. \"It must absorb the electricity! It's like storage space!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow everything made sense!<br>\r\nLast time you drank the chemical you had gotten a little stronger, so you had gotten a little bit of fat on your stomach to store it!<br>\r\nNow this time you had obtained an insane amount of electricity, so to counter-act it..................<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh\" you say, looking downwards. Your stomach was bulging out more than it had a minute ago! \"Oh crap!\" you yell.<br>\r\nYou were about to become a giant, fat pikachu!<br>\r\nYou start grabbing at your body frantically, but it's no use- your stomach starts to droop downwards, and your arms and legs start to thicken. The fat was spreading like wildfire! Everytime you grabbed at a body part, the skin would stretch your hand out until you had to re-grip it. This was terrible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon your butt begins to expand, and your stomach becomes like a inflated exercise ball now. It starts to take up your entire torso, even your chest.<br>\r\nNext your legs thicken up towards the point that they touch eachother. Weak and exhausted, you fall over, letting your entire body bounce, and then shake like jello.<br>\r\nYour arms thicken up next to your sides, as well as your hips, and your arms start to bend into a 45-degree angle.<br>\r\nThe whole time you look at your body in amazement and think \"This is pretty awful, but atleast I'm not exploding into electrical particles right now........\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the rest of your body thickens out.<br>\r\nYour checks become large and filled with fat, as long as your feet and arms. Even your tail has a little bit of fat on it! Everywhere you look it's the exact same thing- large, round, rubbery fat!<br>\r\n\"Ugh.........\" you moan to yourself. You are now a giant, fat pikachu, that can hardly even move. You can stand up, but you feel your strength drain right out of you. There was so much fat you had to carry around- at least a hundred pounds of it. And pikachus normally only weigh 13 pounds!<br>\r\nYou grunt, and your entire body jiggles. There's just so much fat!<br>\r\nYou stare at your body, and just drop your jaw in amazement. There must be AT LEAST twice as much of you now! It was like you had gained a limb!<br>\r\nSurely you had to be the biggest, fattest pikachu in the world! Your stomach was like a vast hill off rubbery yellow fat in front of your eyes............ that definitely wasn't natural!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter checking out your body for while, you learn more about what fat feels like on the body. <br>\r\nBut you still can't get used to it.<br>\r\nThen you get a thought- if you had all of this fat to contain electricity inside of your body, then wouldn't that mean that you had insanely powerful lightning still?<br>\r\nYou concentrate the sluggish energy in your body and zap a wall. <br>\r\nMuch to your suprsie, it blows a hole in it!<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" you cry. <br>\r\nIf you had that kind of energy from being fat, then imagine how powerful you would be if you got some training!<br>\r\nYou take one look at your body, and grunt. You may have obtained tons of electrical power from becoming a giant rubber blob, bu that didn't mean you would be getting some physical training anytime soon.You'd probably get stuck at stretches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around, and survey what has happened to you since that one fateful day about a week ago.<br>\r\nYou started out as a human boy, and now your a giant, fat pikachu with insane electric powers that's stuck inside a ruined lab due to his own weight.<br>\r\nNot good.<br>\r\nHowever, turning back was becoming an unrealistic option now.<br>\r\nBesides, there's NO WAY you could burn off all of this fat- it kept you alive by storing electricity in it.<br>\r\nYou have two choices now- you could stay as you are now, with insane electrical powers and slight mobility, or you could drink ANOTHER beaker of that chemical stuff. Sure you would become a giant ball, but everything that got in your way would be incenerated immediately. End of story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo which will it be?</span></div></div>",

You had to throw all of your strength towards the counter just to lean towards it. Sure your electricity was powerful, but that didn't mean it could retrieve things without blowing them up for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the lid off the top, and sniff the concoction with your highly-sensitive pikachu nose.<br>\r\nSmelled like pineapple too.<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath, and then pour the whole drink into your mouth, without it even touching the tip of your tounge. You gulp down the chemical and let your hand go limp, dropping the beaker and letting it roll off the side of your mountainous belly. <br>\r\nYou lick your fingers greedily, and then sit back and watch the show.<br>\r\nThis was a life-changing decision right here, and you were scared about it. What if things didn't go the way you imagined them too? What if you suffocated from being so fat? Would the fat somehow prevent you from using your power effectively? What if-?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are suddenly cut off as your belly suddenly EXPLODES an inch forward, and then starts to gurgle.<br>\r\nBy the way your body was bouncing, you'd think you were in an earthquake!<br>\r\nYour old fat you'd had was content and full of electrical energy, but this new lining of fat was ravernous and hungry. And if your fat came first this time before the electricity........... uh-oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClutching your stomach in fear, you feel your fat suddenly start EXPANDING outwards, as if you were some sort of balloon.<br>\r\nPikachu skin is very rubbery, but not too the the point where-<br>\r\nSuddenly your thought is cut off, as you feel a disturbing and yet exciting new sensation. Your belly is finally touching the ground, pushing your meaty legs to the side. You grab your belly, only to have your hand de-gripped from it's yellow, bouncy goodness again. This was disturbing............. but also very exciting, like riding on some sort of roller coaster that is inside of you. Terrifying and cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon your butt and legs begin to inflate outwards too, and you begin to feel the stretch on your insides as they both quiver.<br>\r\nAs I've said before, creepy but and weird but cool and exciting.<br>\r\nYour arms begin to inflate as well, and soon you can't carry their weight anymore- they're stuck at what is now about a 60-degree angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, right as your cheeks are becoming puffed up, the top parts of your legs and arms begin to be sucked into the increasingly noticable sphere shape of your body!<br>\r\nI guess your skeleton just couldn't hold the vast amount of fat together any longer.<br>\r\nSoon, your feet aren't even touching the ground- just the fat-filled curve of your lower stomach determines how high you are.<br>\r\nYour arms become immobile too- the rolls of fat all squish together, and leave no space for your joints to work. Soon, your arms are completely sucked into the fat, leaving nothing but your incredibly thick hands to pivot slighly on the wrists.<br>\r\nThe same thing happens to your feet too- now they can only pivot on the ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, you finally rip yourself away from your body on its quest to become sphere shaped. You can't look around much now though, since your neck has long since dissapeared.<br>\r\nYou notice one thing though- you're filling up the room! If this keep up, soon you'll burst out of the walls.<br>\r\nThe foundations are pretty weak after that first incident.<br>\r\nEventually it happens- with a sickening crack, the walls and ceiling of professor Oak's lab break open, letting your sides bounce out so that they quiver like jello.<br>\r\nYou seriously feel like you're about to pass out at any second now for two reasons- first off because your body is so large and takes up so much energy. <br>\r\nSecond off, because you're so dang hungry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour beady black eyes dart around- but there's no food in sight.<br>\r\nYou feel like you wanna cry.<br>\r\nBut suddenly, something miraculous happens- your electrical energy starts to build up! You almost had already forgoten about how it rippled through your body. This time when it rippled though, it caused your fat to jiggle when it passed by.<br>\r\nSuddenly, with a humoungous BOOM!!, some sort of energy rumbled deep within the core of your body. Your heart skips a beat, and you gasp- you KNEW what that terrible and beatiful power was- the ultimate thunderbolt.<br>\r\nMegabolt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of your body filled out with normal high-powered energy, unlike the stuff in your core, and soon you felt as energetic as any other person you might think of.<br>\r\nBut damn.................. were you hungry or what!<br>\r\nYou know that you're a fat pikachu the size of a house, but still............ you didn't know this kind of hunger was even possible!<br>\r\nFor cying out loud, you felt like you could eat a whale! And you probably could!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperately searching for some sort of edible item, you see two tings- the city and the lab wreckage.<br>\r\nThe lab wreckage still had blue plastic beakers in it, and they could either harm or help you.<br>\r\nOn the other hand, the city had enough food to last you a few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich do you pick?</span></div></div>",

You drank it, but you felt your belly filling up more than just what you drank. You weren't sure what was happening, but you knew one thing: it was taking care of the hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt actually felt pleasant, like you were having a good meal. It felt heavy in your stomach. The effect kept going, however, and you began to feel fuller and fuller. You actually got a little bigger just from the liquid filling your stomach! Just when you felt like you were about to burst, the liquid stopped filling your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue chemical was also helping you get used to the energy surging through your body. You could actually feel it circling around in your sphere of a body. In fact, despite all the fat between your core body and the outer edge of your body, you could still feel the ground and the gentle breeze. That must mean the electricity was connecting to your nervous system. You were beginning to involuntarily control some of the electricity stored inside you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hit you: the electricity must have also helped you get the bottle. Little did you know that you could also control static charge. That static charge allows you to move things across your body as long as they're touching your body. You unknowingly used it to take a bottle of blue chemical up to your head to drink it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about moving forward, and try to do it, but your limbs are too small to move anymore. When you try, however, you feel electric pulses start to move your fat and actually roll you forward. Your electricity was now your source of mobility, and you were glad to have one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had gotten accustomed to your new body, so now you wanted to try something more. You tried a simple electric attack, the effort you would normally use for a thundershock, on a nearby house, and it nearly obliterated the house, leaving flaming ruins. Though barely noticeable, when you did that, you felt fat shrink down just slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou loved your power, and you were glad you drank that last bottle of red chemical. You can finally take revenge on the world for getting you into this mess! You could also try to find a way to grow your power even more! You decided to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She got closer and realized that something seemed off about some of the noise coming from the seemingly small shack. She got closer and saw a strange light coming through some of the holes in the seeminly abandoned shack. <br>\r\nShe tried to knock on the door, and the door fell down due to the wood rotting away. she looked around haltingly saying \"H-H-Hello? Your door fell in here... Hello?\"  She saw that it was almost like someone's garage, with an overhead light that flickered on and off, and various objects all over the walls. She looked amazingly at some of the various tools and cans that littered the walls, and noticed something wierd. There was a bookshelf full of books with obscure titles like \"Moby Wailord\" and \"Catch 64\" all filty with dust and sand, except for one that seemed out of place. She tried to pull the one unmarked and cleaner book out from the shelf to figure out the title, and something clicked when he touched it. She heard a grinding, and saw a trapdoor open. She went down the unusual tunnel into an abandoned lab. \"Wow, these things are everywhere!\" she said as she stumbled into a room marked \"Experimentation\" A pichu floated in stasis in the middle of the room in the only filled tube in the room. \"My Word! Let me get you out of there!\" she said as she tried pressing an unmarked button.....</span></div></div>",

He was the kind of kid who could willingly blend in with a crowed if he wanted. Problem was, That wasn't what Matt wanted. All his life he'd been forced to go from one point to the next. One grade to another, one location to another, and all the while following a path he didn't want to set foot on to begin with. <br>\r\nThe realization of this fact had made him surlier day by day, his foster parents barely noticed though as they only cared about him following the rules, doing as everybody else did, and staying out of trouble. It was when Matt had reached the age of 18 and was just wrapping up High School that he knew this was too much. He couldn't stand it any longer. He needed an out, but he could see no hope for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a sullen gray day as he trudged home from school, looking like it could rain at any moment. He kicked his dirty read sneakers through the mud, not caring about it since the shoes were so worn they were about ready for the trash anyway. his dirty blue-jeans too were badly shredded in places and only barely enough to be considered tasteful and not trash. His old brown jacket was pulled tightly over his yellow shirt. He brushed the brown hair from his eyes as he looked down the dirt road that traveled along the end of town between the last few houses and the woods beyond. Many times he'd thought about running off and hiding in the woods, but every time reality had squashed the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stared at the dark trees though, he thought he saw something shining among them. For a moment he wasn't sure he'd seen anything, but then he spotted it again. Whatever it was it wasn't too far off. Figuring his foster parents wouldn't be too mad if he was a little late, Matt stepped off the road and angled for the woods and the strange thing he'd seen.<br>\r\nDespite it being close, it was still a good bit though the thick bushes, and he was damp from all the water on the leaves by the time he reached the spot where he'd seen the shining object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was it?</span></div></div>",

She was a huge (figuratively!) fan of anime and videogames, mostly games from Capcom's old group Clover, like Viewtiful Joe! <br>\r\nEven though she was a gamer, she was pretty smart, and even full of useless information, like how Roosevelt's poor eyesight saved his life from an assassin. She was a bookworm, and loved banned books and Young Adult ones. But that's all she let on about her life...<br>\r\nThe lovely vaporeon Erin was an FA. She loved to binge on a regular basis, usually with the intent of gaining a shirt size, because she found that skinny girls weren't sexy; they just looked like skeletons, and were weaker. Her muffin top was where most of her weight gain went, but her breasts were already good enough, at a C-cup. Her booty was tight at her current weight, much to her chagrin. She wanted it to get soft and jiggly, to impress a local Gallade in her college class, Tony. She knows he liked her muffin top, and had hidden his crush very sloppily, so Erin couldn't help but find it humorous.<br>\r\n...but cute as well! She also loved Tony: he was around 25 pounds overweight, but he was obviously not bothered. He was also a fan of her favorite anime, Angel Beats, and was a chubby chaser! <br>\r\nShe decided she'd gain more for Tony over spring break. Her goal was 20 pounds before the break ends. <br>\r\nThe question is: how?</span></div></div>",

She felt her chest as it seemed to have grown a little, her bra chafing. Her favorite part HAD to be her gut. It stuck out almost 2 inches now, and seemed to get 2 small love handles from her recent binge. At this rate, she'd probably beat her goal by four whole pounds!!</span></div></div>",

He had become a complete slob for her love; he had gained almost 70 pounds by the day's beginning.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>([~]=your name)<br>\r\n[~] was wandering around Viridian Forest. The 15 year old had caught wind of a Venusaur being spotted in the area. Since the Bulbasaur family was their favorite Pokemon, and since they don't live in Pallet Town, [~] told their parents and headed into the Forest. Though, they honestly didn't care about their (son/daughter) ran off into the woods at night. In their minds, it was just one less mouth to feed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, if I were a Venusaur where would I be...\" They said to themselves, holding up a flashlight and scratching at a vortex like birthmark on their cheek. Walking along, something jumped across the path, startling [~]. They dropped the flashlight, shattering it and leaving them in total darkness. \"Human!\" A sudden voice boomed, causing their birthmark to glow. \"State your reason for trespassing on Veanusaurs land!\" [~] began to sweat. \"Well, y-you see. I-I was hoping to catch a Venusaur...so maybe they could help me win a battle against my dad...and earn a little respect from him...\" [~] responded, trying to hide the sadness in their voice. \"Why must you earn your fathers respect?\" The voice asked. \"W-well...I thought maybe if I earned his respect...I might get some love from my family...instead of a bottle to head...\" They said. \"...come with me.\" The voice said. [~] felt a scaly, clawed hand take theirs and pulled them along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sir? Where are you-\" a sudden brightness cut [~] off. The entire area was as clear as day. Grass and Bug Pokemon were frolicking and playing with each other, while some were asleep. [~] then noticed who had lead them here; a Sceptile. \"Venusaur!\" He yelled. Suddenly, a Venusaur emerged from the woods and walked over. \"Sceptile, glad to see you again.\" The Venusaur asked, her voice smooth and caring. That's when she noticed [~]. \"Sceptile. Why did...no. Sceptile, they aren't them.\" Venusaur said. \"But, look! Look at their cheek! They bare our crest! It is them!\" Sceptile said, showing her [~]'s cheek. \"...Sceptile. I'd like to speak to them; privately.\" Said Venusaur. Sceptile nodded, leaving. Venusaur then indicated for [~] to follow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the two were in a sort of den. \"Young one. I must apologize for what my ex-mate did. He's been trying to appease me ever since I lost...\" She didn't finish, and began to tear up. \"Hey, hey. It's alright. I...I know your pain.\" [~] said, reassuringly. \"What do you mean?\" She asked, looking up with tears in her eyes. \"Well, you see...I haven't felt a loss of a loved one...but I feel neglect. I came out here to catch you and hopefully have you help earn my dads respect...and love...who am I kidding. I'm never gonna get his love.\" Said [~], finally breaking down. \"Oh. You poor baby.\" She said, rubbing their back with her vines. That's when a light bulb went off. \"[~], I have an idea that will help us both. But, I need your permission to do so.\" She said. \"What*sniffles*do you have in mind?\" They asked. \"I...I want you to become my child; we'll be much happier afterwards.\" She said. [~] thought it over, before nodding. \"Okay. Here we go.\" Venusaur wrapped her vines around [~] and hoisted them up onto her flower. \"Just relax. And everything will be fine.\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the petals closed around [~]. They began to panic, trying to push the petals open. \"Shh...Shh...mommy' got you~\" said Venusaur, stroking [~] through her petals. [~], slowly, began to calm down. \"Are you ready?\" \"Yes.\" Suddenly, a green powder began to fill up the \"room.\" As [~] inhaled, their skin slowly became a green-blue, becoming turquoise in some spots and on their birthmark. [~]'s hands and feet became paws, their fingers and toes becoming white claws. Their head changed, becoming wider, their nose moving just above their mouth, becoming two holes; and their eyes becoming crimson red. Their ears migrated to the top of their head as [~]'s canine teeth became fangs, hanging out of their mouth. Lastly, a big, green bulb grew out of their back as they shrink and become younger, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVenusaur opened up her flower to find a five-year old Bulbasaur flopped out on the center. \"Wakes wakey, [~].\" They opened their eyes and looked over their body, and smiled. \"This...is incredible! I...I love it!\" [~] said, hoping off her flower. \"I'm glad you love it~\" Venusaur said, walking over. \"Thanks momma.\" [~] said, moving up close, nuzzling their new mom. \"You're welcome. Now, how 'bout we get some sleep?\" [~] nodded. Venusaur moved to the center of the den and sat down. [~] walked over and did the same, resting near her head. \"Goodnight, momma.\" \"Goodnight, sweetie.\" She said, kissing [~] on the forehead. Soon, the two had fallen asleep, happy to be together as a family.</span></div></div>",

I just look really........ normal.\"<br>\r\nAnd that's what drove you into the weirdest adventure of your life: a quest to become un-normal.<br>\r\nAnd at about the point that you were in life, you were pretty sure you'd try just about anything.<br>\r\nEven changing your physical appearance.<br>\r\nWell, let's just say you got your wish...... but a a high price.<br>\r\nYou were about to become the strangest person of all. In a way, you weren't even going to be a person when you were done with yourself.<br>\r\nYou were going to become a pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea hit you on a cool, spring afternoon.<br>\r\nYou were sitting on your front porch, swinging on a bench and watching the breeze blow through the endless sea of grass in front of you.<br>\r\nRecently, you had obtained a jigglypuff- the baloon pokemon. It was a male jigglypuff, but it was pretty hard to tell the difference.<br>\r\nBut still, you liked it a lot........... envied it a little too.<br>\r\nEverytime you went training with it, it felt good to give commands, but you thought it would be a lot funner to be in battle yourself!<br>\r\nYou shook the thought out of your head though- you were a human, and humans never get to battle.<br>\r\nEver.<br>\r\nSo that's why the idea hit you- you could become a pokemon and battle yourself!<br>\r\nIt would be so cool!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mr. Jiggles!\" you called as you removed your ear plugs, after watching the pokemon sing one of its melodies.<br>\r\nYou had nick-named your jigglypuff Mr. Jiggles because you found it funny.<br>\r\nYour mom didn't appreciate it though, and you were pretty sure it annoyed your jigglypuff too.<br>\r\nIt was just kinda one of those on-going jokes.<br>\r\n\"I have an idea\" you announced as he approached you from the steps on the porch.<br>\r\n\"What if I became a pokemon?\"<br>\r\nMr. Jiggles stared at you with a weird look on his face as if you had just spoken to him in french.<br>\r\nOr german.<br>\r\nOr possibly even japanese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puff?\" asked Mr. Jiggles.<br>\r\nYou couldn't exactly translate what he was saying, but you had a pretty good idea of it from the look on his face.<br>\r\n\"You know, if I transformed into a jigglypuff like you or something! Not only could we talk, but I could battle and train and go on all sorts of adventures! Anything to get away from my life as a stupid, normal kid!\"<br>\r\n\"Jiggly?\" Mr Jiggles said, raising an eyebrow. He didn't look like he beleived you.<br>\r\nYou have to admit, you wouldn't have beleived that if anyone else had told me that either. It's impossible to turn into a pokemon!<br>\r\nBut that's where your brilliant idea came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember Bill, that famous professor that lives down next to the beach? The one that invented the pokemon storage system?\"<br>\r\nMr. Jiggles shuddered- he HATED the pokemon storage system. To him, it was more like a jail cell.<br>\r\nStill, he slowly nodded his head, one eyebrow lifted.<br>\r\n\"Well, a few years ago, he invented a machine that switches your body into a pokemon's! It's perfect! All I gotta do is get in there, flip on the machine, and BAM! I'm suddenly a jigglypuff!\"<br>\r\nMr Jiggles just froze. He seemed to have just gone into shock.<br>\r\n\"It's ok Mr. Jiggles.....\" you say playfully, scratching the pokemon inbetween it's ears.<br>\r\n\"It's just an experiment. If I wanted too, I could just get in that machine and switch back. Perfectly harmless!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou of course had no intention on switching back, unless you got really home-sick.<br>\r\nStill, this satisfied Mr. Jiggles, especially since he loved being scratched between the ears, and he replied with a cheefrul \"Puff!\"<br>\r\nYou laughed, and went back inside for dinner. This was gonna be great! You could become a beautiful singer, a powerful balloon pokemon, and have an exciting life with your friend if you went through with this!<br>\r\nTotally worth it.<br>\r\nSo that night, you planned on how to get yourself to the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould you sneak in there at the middle of night to use it and risk getting caught..........<br>\r\nor ask Bill with the likely chanche of getting turned down?</span></div></div>",

Besides, you didn't think your patience would last much longer anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressed in a black t-shirt and jeans, you sneak out the front door and into the front yard with your jigglypuff tip-toeing closely behind.<br>\r\nThis was gonna be fun.<br>\r\nYou take a left, and hurridly jog down Route 8, using the occasional street-light to lamp your way.<br>\r\nThis was so exciting!<br>\r\nWhen Bill's lab finally comes into view, you take a deep breath of the cool night air, and quickly take a look back.<br>\r\nThis was it. This was pretty close to a life-changing decision, and it was happening TONIGHT. No turning back now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly you jog down a slope and up to a side-window in Bill's house.<br>\r\nThe last time you would ever use your human legs outside was now. When you re-emerged, you would be using Jigglypuff feet, not your own.<br>\r\nWhen you re-emerged, you wouldn't be yourself anymore- you'd be something better, cooler, even funner.<br>\r\nYou would be a jigglypuff.<br>\r\nAs you force open the window of the lab and drop onto the steel floor, you shuuder- not from the impact, but from the pure terror and excitement pulsing through your head.<br>\r\nYou were really doing it!<br>\r\nYou take a look around, and notice the room was pretty much empty, except for a rack of needles with liquids inside of them, and the morphing machine with a white canvas draped over it.<br>\r\nBill must have taken most of his research home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, out of pure curiosity, you check out the needles.<br>\r\nWhat was their purpose?<br>\r\nYou figured they would be test chemicals or something, but gasp in confusion when you read the label \"Pokemon DNA\"<br>\r\nSo there was a different way to transform!<br>\r\nYou look through the needles really fast, and finally find one that's labled \"Jigglypuff\"<br>\r\nSo what should you do?<br>\r\nUse the suspicious chemiclas, or use the giant machine?<br>\r\nThey both seemed pretty dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquinting through the darkness, you say \"Well Mr. Jiggles? What should I choose?\"<br>\r\nYou weren't quite sure if he understood if he understood you not, but all he did was shrug and nervously rock back and forth.<br>\r\nHe knew either way would be pretty scary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, I guess the choice is up to you- use needles, or use a machine?</span></div></div>",

You still wanted to carry through with this.<br>\r\nYou, a very normal 14-year old girl, were about to become a jigglypuff.<br>\r\nYou felt both excited and proud, with your fear edging away as a comforting and warm mist filled the room.<br>\r\nThere was no turning back now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the lightbulb above you starts to brighten in intensity!<br>\r\n\"What the-!\" you yell.<br>\r\nBefore you can finish your sentence, a giant white-hot flash that fills the whole room goes off, knocking you to the ground!<br>\r\nYour ears are ringing, and your breath has been knocked out of you. The flash has also effectively made you blind, and paralyzed you.<br>\r\nSuddenly, another flash goes off, and then another!<br>\r\nYou try to scream in pain, but you can't: something in the mist seems to completely take your breath away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flashes keep on repeating over and over again, for about five minutes.<br>\r\nBut to you, it feels like an eternity!<br>\r\nThe flahses keep smashing your body around like they're beating you up or something, but you can't feel your body parts melting and shifting shape due to a strange numbness.<br>\r\nYour eyes grow huge, and your legs and arms shrink down.<br>\r\nAlso, your fingers and your toes melt together as your torso becomes rounder like a ball.<br>\r\nBut probably the worst part is how your skin turns a pinkish shade, and becomes strange and rubbery.<br>\r\nTo this day, the thought STILL chills you to the bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the weirdest part to change is your eternal organs.<br>\r\nYour stomach becomes a giant and hallow, and combined with the ruber skin, it's able to fill up with air and stretch like a baloon.<br>\r\nIt's almost as if god had forgoten to add organs that attatched to your skin or something in there.<br>\r\nAlso your vocal cords changed to a weird looking lump in your throat, vocal cords that meant for two things: singing and saying the words 'jiggilypuff'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, as your body was melting into it's last few changes, your body began to shrink.<br>\r\nIt kind of feels weird, like falling down a botomless pit.<br>\r\nYour feet also begin to lengthen and shrink at the same time, causing you to lose your balance and slip.<br>\r\nWhich way did you slip?</span></div></div>",

He stood up and decided to walk around the zoo until he found them. His butt became the size of two basketballs behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, he stopped at another bench, this one out of view by the public. \"Oh god I feel so nauseous\", he belched. His butt started to take up the whole bench behind him, his pants about to rip. \"God I wore some tight pants today\" he put his arms on the bench behind him, his bench sized ass touching his arms. \"Omigod!\" He shrieked, getting up. \"My ass is huge! Shit, now if I go out there I'll be a laughing stock, but I'm pretty sure it's still getting bigger. But any bigger and I won't be able to move!\" He sat back down, pants almost to their limit. \"P-please stop growing...\" he groaned, feeling his ass tower over him. He then reached behind him and tore a bit of his pants. \"Ahh so much better...Now what am I gonna do now?!\"</span></div></div>",

He thought, 'Omigod what if Ashley sees me like this?' Cole began to panic, his ass at his pants' absolute limit. Thankfully, he chose to wear sweatpants today of all days. Cole rested his arms on his 1 ton booty. It felt soft, and jiggled whenever he smacked it, which felt pleasurable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCole tried to stand, but instead, his huge couch-sized butt broke the bench he was sitting on. 'Jesus Christ, as if this could get any worse-' he thought, but he shouldn't have thought that, because just then his belly began to plump up along with his butt. First as a small bump, but then larger and larger until it was poking out from underneath his shirt. Cole just sat there, confused and scared. Would he ever be back to normal? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiipp! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCole's pants finally ripped down the middle, exposing his fat, blue-tinted ass for the world to see. His ass was growing around a tree behind him, the tree in the middle. Each cheek bloated up immensely but his belly wasn't far behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready bigger than his ass was a few minutes ago when it was couch-sized, his belly was turning a blueish color. Cole's arms and legs began to plump  up too, becoming more and more absorbed in his rolls of perky lard. He could still grab at things though, he grabbed a tree out of the ground and began to eat it like corn on the cob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy's ears drifted to the top of his head. And his cheeks became so large that he couldn't see past them no matter how hard he could try so his eyes were permenantly closed. His shirt finally ripped exposing his massive blue belly and his perky nipples. His hands and feet became claws. He grabbed the tree growing in between his asscheeks and grabbed it out of the ground and devoured it. Cole was no longer Cole, he was a Snorlax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If these didn't at least give the two of you a rounded gut, nothing will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMac took his time while you ate fast enough to be noticeable, but not enough to make yourself look like a feral beast. The pure fighting type chuckled at your eagerness and sped up to add some competition. It helped as you both chow down fast. It didn't take long before the first plate of food distended your bellies to sizes large enough for a normal sized pumpkin to snuggly fit inside. The second plate upgraded that size to basketball and added some pudge to the hips and thighs. The third helped the gut, thighs, limbs and face fatten to give the machoke a musclegut figure as he finished while you can triple that gain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were too focused on the friendly competition to notice Mac had stopped.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decided that since you were a pokemon, a house for humans would start to get difficult to live in. You weren't a human anymore, so you were quick to abandon any human-specific activities, behaviors and possessions. Because of this, it didn't take too long for you to say, \"Let's live in the wild, everyone!\". Lucario and Machoke were quick to agree with you, saying, \"I'm in.\" Charizard nodded in agreement, as did Hawlucha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSceptile and Zorua were both a little more skeptical. \"What about food? It can be hard to find food out there!\" Sceptile said. Zorua agreed, saying, \"Yeah, and it's nice to have shelter. You don't have to be human to stay in a house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were adamant, though, and you said, \"With seven of us working, food won't be a problem! There are plenty of caves around, so if we need shelter, we can easily find it!\" You said. Sceptile said, \"Alright. I'll go wherever you go.\" Zorua said, \"Fine, I'll go too. It might be fun to play tricks on some wild pokemon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was decided, and the seven of you left the house behind. You said, \"Since I'm a pokemon, and not a trainer anymore, I'm not using pokeballs, so you can say goodbye to those!\" Most of your pokemon didn't seem to care either way, but then you added, \"You all are also no longer my pokemon, so you don't have to take orders from me or even stay with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that comment, Lucario almost immediately said, \"I'll always stay by your side.\" Charizard said, \"Yeah! You may not be a trainer anymore, but we're still friends.\" Hawlucha added, \"Besides, you were good at being a trainer, so you'd be a good leader now!\" All of your pokemon were in agreement that they not only wanted to stay with you, but wanted you to lead them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were taken aback by how much your pokemon cared about you, and you said, \"In that case, let's explore the world, and find the perfect place to live!\" Your pokemon cheered, and soon you were walking together, almost like a herd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe area where you lived was pretty peaceful and sparsely populated, so trainers and even other wild pokemon were an uncommon sight. Most wild pokemon were intimidated by the size of your group and the power of its members, so they steered clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe environment was modestly forested with occasional meadows. You were travelling along the foot of a forested mountain range. Many of the rivers and streams that you crossed had waterfalls nearby. There were also frequent caves in the mountain range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe area wasn't lush, so food wasn't easy to find, but there was still enough to hold you over. There were occasional berry bushes, and plenty of foliage and bugs, though everyone had different dietary needs. For the most part, foraging worked, though, and berries were surprisingly filling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, the seven of you slept in a cave. Hawlucha slept alone, facing the entrance. You and machoke slept together with Lucario not too far off, between you and the cave entrance. Charizard slept by himself nearby, as did Sceptile. Zorua didn't want to sleep alone, so he cuddled up next to Sceptile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, the seven of you set off once again. This time, however, you ran into someone. He appeared to be in his thirties. He was wearing a lab coat and glasses. He looked like a scientist or researcher. \"Ahh, just what I'm looking for!\" He said as he looked at you, then threw a pokeball, with a Klinklang popping out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other six wanted to interfere, but you said, \"I got this. Fighting is super-effective against steel. Besides, you can't interfere if you wanted. I'm the one he wants, and we can only fight one at a time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of your team watched with bated breath as you fought. You began with a brick break. It just came naturally to you, and Klinklang definitely took damage. He was using iron defense, however, and he was getting harder and harder to do damage too. He then used gear grind. \"Ow, that hurts!\" You said, though the man only heard, \"Choke, machoke!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle continued, and you were starting to feel fatigued. At that moment, the scientist man pulled out an ultra ball. He meant business. You were about to see the full effect of role-reversal as he threw the ball at you, and you felt yourself freeze in place before everything went dark. You didn't feel the process of going into the pokeball at all. It just instantaneously went from outside to inside from your perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like you were in some sort of cage, and you struggled to break free with all your might. You were furious, and even if you were caught, you weren't going to give your new trainer an easy time once you got out. Your pokemon watched in horror as the ball wiggled, once, twice, three times, and...</span></div></div>",

All of your friends stare in shock, if their leader is caught... well this human is in for a world of it. but then they cheer in joy, and relief as the ultra ball opens and a huge flash of light is ejected, taking the form of their leader. \"Ugh..

The human merely heard a taunting \"Ma, machoke, mach\" He looked at his klinklang and nodded \"klinklang use gear grind!\" he said. \"Not this time!\" you smirk as your arm glows. You run forward and use a karate chop on klinklang again, and it falls back, \"klinklang get up!\" the human said worried. But the steel pokemon is too tired, and collapses in defeat.

Let's see if he has anything to say.\" The professor saw the pokemon looking at him, and he said, \"I'm sorry guys. I didn't realize that you were all Machoke's friends. It's just that Machoke is just the kind of pokemon I'm looking for to help with my research, and I really wanted him. Catching pokemon is usually the only way to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone still seemed pretty mad at him. Lucario said he was nice, and he seemed to trust the scientist, but everyone was still upset that he almost took away their leader. Either way, the scientist said, \"I'm sorry we got off to a rough start, Machoke. Let me introduce myself. My name is Professor Mahogany How about you and your friends come with me to my lab, and I can show you my research. I'll even give you some food to make up for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Lucario trusted him, you told the others to come with the scientist with you. The others were starting to get relaxed. Even though the scientist couldn't hear any speech from you or your friends, he still seemed to understand you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eight of you walked, and the scientist told you his story. \"I used to work at Silph Co. after I got my phd, and I was one of the researchers who worked on the first master ball!\" He started. \"I didn't like it there, because we didn't work directly with pokemon, so once I had saved up enough, I left. Since then, I got my first pokemon, a Klink, and that was the pokemon you just fought as a Klinklang. Working with Kilnklang, I've been building my very own lab! I want to be the kind of professor that gives trainers their first pokemon someday, but I'm also interested in research projects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was going on, you and the others just listened and followed him. Soon enough, you came upon a clearing in the forest that was against the mountains. On the side of a cliff was the most amazing building you've ever seen! It was built into the cliff. The outside part was a huge, windowed half cylinder. There was a waterfall above the building that cascaded onto the roof then flowed off the sides, framing the windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist took you to an entrance on the bottom. Inside it looked like a lobby. Everything looked new and open. There was a lot of glass and metal architecture, adding to the open feeling. At the back of the building was a set of double doors leading to a hall. It looked like a hospital, except the rooms were labs filled with experiments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist took you and your friends to an elevator, went to the top, and then he took you back down the hall to the front of the building. This floor had a big table, and the scientist then said, \"Let me get you something to eat, then I can talk to you guys about what I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, all of you were eating. The scientist sure knew his stuff, and he got foods specifically tailored to each pokemon, based on what he knew about all of their species. The food was delicious and the scientist was glad to have guests. He healed Klinklang and brought him out. Klinklang apologized to you, and you shrugged it off, saying \"It's all good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I've told you, I'm a scientist and researcher.\" Professor Mahogany started. \"Here, I've started my lab to do research on pokemon. I'm particularly interested in the source of power for pokemon. My research involves being able to enhance a pokemon's natural powers beyond what mere training can do. The problem is that I need willing test subjects. When I saw you, Machoke, I saw lots of potential. I'd like you to be my first test subject. I have something prepared that would theoretically make you more powerful than you can even imagine! I just need to test it. Your friends can stay, too, if you'd like, and I might even have experiments for them as I continue my research. If you don't want to, that's alright. You guys would still be welcome as guests. So what do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to talk to your pokemon friends about it, but all of them seemed to be in agreement that your judgement would decide this. You ultimately decided to...</span></div></div>",

They shake their heads and look at you. \"Its your choice\" sceptille smiled \"we trust youll make the right one..\" \"Yes. I have faith in you as well.\" hawlucha nodded. \"Machoke? what about you?\" you ask. Machoke smiled at you \"its your choice bud, you wanna get stronger go for it!\" You think it over, and soon turn to the scientist and nod. \"You'll do it?\" Professor mahogany asked eagerly. You nod again \"Choke!\" was all the professor heard. \"Thank you!\" he smiled. \"However, I have a few things to ask.\" You say \"1, I want me and my friends to live in the wild outside the lab, not in it. we will stop by when its time for the testing. 2, I'd like a pokeball to myself, so that I cannot be caught by anyone else. and 3, all my friends get treated well as well as I do.\" The professor blinked. as all he heard was \"Ma machoke choke ma machoke choke choke machoke ma ma choke ma choke machoke!\" You soon realise this, and look around, seeing a large computer. You remember how to use one from as a human. You stomp over and grab the keyboard and type on it. Professor mahogany is quite surprised by your ability to do so. \"Ok. yes you can live outside during this time. The tests will probably take a couple days. and yes you will all be treated and cared for properly.\" The other one surprised him a little, given what he had seen earlier about this machoke. \"Um... sure? I don't understand why but ok.\" You smile and nod standing up \"so we have a deal?\" you say holding out your arm. The professr nods and shakes it. Your friends smile. \"Here\" the professor said holding up a black pokeball with gold and red marks. you recognize it as a luxury ball. The professor hands it to you. \"Machoke will you do the honors?\" you smile holding it out to him. Machokek stares surprised, but nods \"ok.. here you go\" machoke said as he tapped it against your huge pecs. You smile feeling yourself sucked in like before. but this time it feels amazing. You love the feeling of this ball, which explains the luxury bit. Soon the ball dings, having successfully caught its target. Machoke then throws it out and sighs relieved to see his best friend. \"perfect\" lucario smiled \"now nobody can catch you!\" \"At least legitimetly\" charizard said \"there are crooks you know.\" \"Yeah I know but still\" you said. You turn to professor mahogany \"Are you ready to start?\" he asked. You nod. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Professor Mahogany said, \"We're going to start with some tests of your current physical strength.\". You nod happy to oblige, so Mahogany said, \"Don't worry everyone else, I'll have your friend back in no time! Feel free to make yourselves at home or let yourselves out.\" he said as he threw a key to the other Machoke. \"This is for the front door. Feel free to let yourselves in if you need anything. I'll have Klinklang help you right away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour friends then left, Machoke giving you a big hug before they went to explore the wild. Soon, Mahogany had you following him. He took you to one of the middle floors, and you noticed the elevator rotating. This place was even bigger than you thought. He took you down another hallway, then had you go through a set of double doors on the left, one of only two entryways on that side of the hall. Writing above the door said, \"Examination Room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked in, and were amazed by the sheer size of the room. It was like a large gymnasium, and the floors were shiny new hardwood. The room was well lit, and on one of the walls, there was a double-layered window, and a door leading to the room on the other side. Mahogany said, \"Wait here while I get the equipment.\" You waited in the large room. It felt sanitary and bright like a doctors office, but it was huge like a gym. You noticed that the walls were some sort of metal, probably steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have to wait as long as you thought, as the professor had already come back with a forklift loaded with a massive crate containing some equipment. To begin with, he grabbed a spool of metal cable. \"Can you hold this for me?\" He said, giving you the spool. You oblige, and hold the spool so that he could pull the end of the cable. The end had a heavy, cast iron latch on it, and he took it to a ring that appeared to be fastened to the wall. He then walked into the other room with the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First we will begin testing physical strength!\" He said through an intercom. \"We'll begin with tensile strength. When I tell you to, can you pull on the rope as hard as you can?\" You thought it was quite mundane, but you shrugged and grabbed the rope, pulling it hard as if it were a tug of war. Mahogany then began furiously typing at a computer, making notes and recording data.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had you do it a few more times before he moved onto the next test. He tested how much you could lift with both arms by having you lift massive weights until you couldn't manage. The weights were a lot heavier than they looked. The professor explained how he made those weights, but you zoned out. He also recorded pushing strength by having you push a pressure plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he moved onto the actual fighting ability. He tested attack by having you use various attacks on more pressure plates, but this time, before he started the test, he put a bunch of sticky pads attached to wires nearly everywhere on your body. Nearly every muscle was covered. Even your butt had a couple of pads on it. Mahogany explained that those pads measured the type of energy that only pokemon can use. He didn't want to go into further detail, but in fighting type pokemon, it tended to be most detectable in the muscles. He collected data as you attacked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised by how attacks worked for you. He just had to tell you what they were and your body just knew them. Sometimes, you couldn't do it though, and when that happened, the professor opened a drawer, and pulled out the tm for that move. He gave it to you, and as soon as you held it, you felt like you knew the move already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all was said and done, you were exhausted. Mahogany withdrew you back into his Luxury Ball. It was at least a pleasant feeling as you were taken to a healing machine. Once the professor had you back out, you felt refreshed and ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, let's start the actual experiment.\" The professor said as he took you back to the elevator, then to a room just down the hallway from the dining area. This new room looked almost exactly like a doctors office. You felt like you were going to the doctor as he told you to sit and wait on the examination table. Soon, he came back with a cart. The cart had a machine on it and various test tubes on the shelf above it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMahogany put the pads on you again, then he said, \"Alright, it's gonna be a little prick.\" as he gave you a shot. He then gave you a test tube, telling you to drink it. \"I hope this works!\" He said as you drank the bright red fluid. The instant it hit your stomach, you felt something surging through you. Your muscles tingled, and you didn't feel like you could sit still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor backed away from you, giving you some distance, and soon...</span></div></div>",

You grunt, and start roaring as pain overtakes your body. All your blood pulses and pounds hard as viens throb on your body. You cry out as you can't control yourself. The pain hurts too much. You start thrashing around, punching walls hard, and smashing through them, ripping the cart in half, and wrecking anything in sight. Professor mahogany goes wide eyed in shock, and immediately grabs a needle. he tries to jab you with it, but your thrashing around so much he can't do anything. Luckily right at that moment machoke raced in horrified, \"WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?!\" he yelled at the professor angrily. \"Please you have to restrain him so I can give him this medicine!\" Mahogany pleaded. Machoke growled, but nodded. he ran over and avoided a punch from you. Then he leapt up and over landing behind you. Using his own strength he grabbed your arms and locked them behind your back. Mahogony ran over and jabbed a needle in your shoulder. In a few seconds you calm down, and slowly take huge breaths. Finally you've returned to normal, and machoke is holding you concerned. \"I'm really sorry,,,\" mahogany said sincerely \"That formula was meant to give you vast power... but I guess it was too much for your body to handle.. even a machokes body.. I'll have to figure out how to fix this...\" he looked at machoke \"I'm really sorry... please forgive me....\" Machoke glared, then sighed. He knew it was an accident.. and this guy was able to save him... \"Fine..\" machoke muttered. He held his leader \"are you ok?\" he asked. You groan and open your eyes. you see machoke looking at you \"augh.... that was terrible.. it felt I had so much power inside me.. but my body couldn't hold it all and it felt painful...\" \"I'll try to fix this\" mahogany said \"you can use the healing machine. and do whatever youd like for the rest of the day..\" He handed your luxury ball to machoke \"i feel you better keep this from now on instead of me.\" Machoke helped you limp out of the room \"Ok, first, were gonna get you healed. but then what?\" machoke asked.</span></div></div>",

I don't want them to be too worried about me.\" Machoke nodded, then withdrew you into the luxury ball before healing you. Soon, he was leading you through the woods. Nearby, there was a cave hidden behind some trees. Machoke took you in and you were glad to see your friends again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel?\" Hawlucha said. \"I've had better days. The experiment didn't go so well.\" You said. \"I couldn't control the power.\" Lucario then said, \"Wait until I get my hands on that Mahogany guy.\" and Machoke said, \"He was very sorry about it. You saw it, he has a good heart.\" Lucario said, \"I know. I just don't like to see my friends get hurt.\" Zorua then said, \"Isn't that why this is an experiment, though? Those are the things that the professor wants to fix.\" and you said, \"Good point, Zorua. It didn't feel pleasant, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, you were talking with your friends. Zorua even had a story for you. He saw a Caterpie, and decided to take on its appearance to tease bird pokemon, but a Swellow got mad and attacked, and Charizard had to save him. The others had been exploring, mainly looking for shelter. They were glad to see that their leader was alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, you slept in the cave with your pokemon, in a similar arrangement to last night, though Zorua chose to snuggle up to you this time. Either way, in the morning, you woke up only to have Mahogany call out \"Machoke! Machoke!\". You went over to him, with Machoke following suit. When you found him, he said, \"Good, you're both here. Are you ready to try this again?\" He asked, and you nodded. \"And can you help me if things go out of control?\" He said to Machoke, who nodded as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMahogany then said, \"Thanks for coming back. I'm really sorry about yesterday.\" but you and Machoke were willing to forgive. The professor said, \"I think I figured out what the problem was. The shot prepared your body to receive the extra energy, and the liquid you drank actually gave you the energy. The problem was that there was nowhere to store it, so your body had to release it somehow. That's when I gave you another shot to absorb the excess energy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was saying this, he was taking you up to the dining area. \"Now I know that the energy can be productive. My hypothesis is that with enough fresh protein in your body, the energy would be able to build more muscles. After all, that's where fighting types keep most of their energy. We'll have to see what it actually does, though. Did you eat breakfast today?\" You shook your head, and the professor said, \"Good. I have a meal prescribed that will give you the protein you need. It might be on the big side, though. I just need to prepare it and get it out to you. The other Machoke can have what he wants.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, both you and Machoke were eating. You were having steaks and washing them down with protein shakes, with the other Machoke was eating berries and meat. Either way, you kept eating as the professor told you. He said you could stop when you wanted, but you were determined to go until he wanted to stop. Even after you felt full, you kept going. Soon, your stomach was getting distended with all the food inside. When the professor finally said the meal was finished, you sighed in relief and started to rub the swollen flesh, where abs were still visible on the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, it was time for the experiment. The professor had Machoke on standby, and he had you sit on the table. He had patched up most of the damage, and had the cart in the room already. He hooked you up with the pads again, then he gave you the injection, then finally he had you drink the liquid while he had the other shot ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the tingling sensation again, but this time, you felt it go towards your stomach. Your stomach started to feel very warm, though not to the point of being uncomfortable. At that point, you started to feel another sensation all over your body: it was the sensation of...</span></div></div>",

Machoke and Professor Mahogony stare wide eyed as they can see your muscles swelling and growing. Your legs thicken, and soon they become tree trunks of raw power. Your abs tighten, and grow even harder, then you feel 2 pops as another row of abs appeared, giving you an 8 pack. your biceps bulge outward bigger, and stronger. You flex your bicep, watching it rise higher and higher, your arm muscles expand thickening nicely. the red viens on your arms throb a little expanding as well to give more blood to the muscles. You grin feeling your back stretch and grow stronger as well. Last of all, but certainly not least, your pecs puff out, bulging as they swell up into 2 massive spheres of power. You grin flexing them, and bouncing them showing off. \"I don't believe it!\" machoke said amazed. You grin as you stand up. You aren't only growing buffer, your growing bigger as well. and soon machokes head only comes up to your pecs. Machoke stares up at you in awe. \"How are you?\" Mahogony asked. \"I feel HUGE!\" you smile. Mahogony smiled, having heard a happy \"choke machoke!\" \"That's good.

You look at your rear, seeing it swell up. Soon, you heard a tearing, and the back of your speedo ripped open. It continued to rip until the entire back was decimated, allowing your heavily muscled ass to bounce out. Now it was more of a loin cloth than a speedo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou liked all of those changes, and the professor soon came back, saying, \"Oh my. Let me see if I can find something that might not be so tight on you. Meet me in the examination room.\" You went over to the elevator and tried finding the examination room. Luckily it wasn't too hard, and you waited inside, seeing the same equipment from yesterday still in there. Along the way, you found out what the professor was talking about. With your back muscles pecs and abs growing, your belt was feeling very tight on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor came back, and he had the cart with him. He was holding some sort of black cloth. \"Try this on. It should give you more room. I'll give you some privacy.\" He said as he handed you the cloth. You unfolded it to find out that it was a jockstrap, made with very similar material to the speedos that Machoke wore. You felt it stretch very easily, and out of curiosity, you had Machoke hold the waistband. You pulled and pulled at the other end, and you could nearly reach the door. It was insanely stretchy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled off the rest of the cloth, and with Machoke's help, you unfastened the belt. You didn't know that Machoke had genitalia before, but now that you were seeing it on yourself, you were very aware of the fact. You were also starting to feel yourself lose control of your movements. Machoke pulled the jockstrap onto you, and you found it to be comfy and open. The waistline started to glow a bit, serving the same purpose as the belt did before. If anything, the garment accentuated the gap between your hamstrings and your glutes, making them both look bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, you let Mahogany back in, and soon, he was fastening the rope to the wall, having you do the first test. The professor recorded the data as you performed all of his tests again. When you got to the weights, you were able to lift up to 2 tons above your head, more than twice what you could before! The professor was very impressed with the results of his experiment, and he told you that all around, you were now twice as strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thanked you many times for helping him with his experiment, and he thanked Machoke for the help.

In terms of pokemon, there wasn't much. Mostly, there were flying pokemon overhead, but they were high in the sky and they kept to themselves. Occasionally you'd see some smaller rodent pokemon or bug pokemon scurry away as you drew near. The vegetation was also getting more lush. Near the end of the mountain range, you find a nice clearing. The weather had been beautiful all day, so you and the group decided to sleep under the stars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had plenty of food to choose from, and you ate more berries with your friends that night. You all slept closer together that night. You were in the open, and you wanted to make sure that everyone was safe.

Something builds inside you. Not exactly rage, but something else. Then one of the victreebell laughs and throws one of the little pokemon in its mouth before spitting it back out. That was all you could take. \"HEY!\" You yell ripping the bushes out of the way with a look of anger in your eyes \"Leave those kids alone!\" your other friends run over and join you glaring at the victreebell.

They all glow and use synthesis, returning to full health. \"Uh oh..\" zorua said \"better do something\" Zorua grinned trickily as he glowed pink, and started growing. \"We can fight you for weeks!\" a vicctreebell taunted. You glare \"I don't care we'll fight you until we win! you cant pick on kids like that!\" The 3 bullies laughed, but suddenly a huge shadow fell over you all. You all look up and stare. A giant kyurem, nearly the size of a mountain is glaring down, specifically at the 3 bullies. \"You...\" it said cold and angry \"leave. and NEVER return. And, NEVER pick on any pokemon EVER again! or else I'll freeze you til the end if time!\" It roared angrily, and the 3 victreebell scream running away fast.

You smile back at them \"thanks\" you said. \"its true!\" sceptile said \"your the biggest machoke in the world!\" \"and your almost as big as me\" charizard said. They all laughed and you settled in for the night. Soon the sun died down, and its dark. You lay on the sand, warmed by everyone around you. Machoke smiled as he hugged you \"your the best friend ever\" he smiled. \"thanks.. but I kinda wish you could get big too\" you said \"Hey I'm happy seeing you get huge!\" machoke said. he reached down and rubbed you exposed rear end \"hehe any machoke would worship a rear end that manly.\" \"H..hey cut it out!\" you said smacking his arm away \"sorry\" he laughed \"its just that rear end, and that build of yours is something all machoke would want for themselves!\" You smiled and went to sleep. The next morning you wake up to feel something wedged between your pecs \"ugh.. what the\" you reach inside your pec cleavage and pull out zorua. \"what the?\" you said startled \"aww please put me back.. its so warm in there\" zorua said. You laugh. \"come on everyone lets get ready.\"</span></div></div>",

The tricky fox froze, he didn't know what to do. Slowly he nodded. \"Ok thanks\" nidoking said plopping his weight onto a sturdy chair. The human sat down as well. \"So whats your name?\" he asked. Zorua was scared, charizard could sense this, and decided to step in \"you'll have to forgive my trainer.. he's mute.\" charizard said. Nidoking went wide eyed. \"Oh.. I'm sorry..\" From looking at his pokemon, the human understood \"Oh.. sorry to hear that.. \" They ate on quietly. You, lucario, machoke, sceptile, and hawlucha all groaned, you knew you couldn't go out of your balls but you felt helpless. \"So, do you know why everything is free?\" charizard asked nidoking. The poison ground pokemon looked surprised. \"You don't know?\" he looked between them, and they shook their heads. \"Its for the pokemon sumo tournament!\" \"Pok\u00e9mon sumo?\" charizard said surpised. \"Yeah.\" nidoking nodded. \"basically 2 pokemon wrestle, they aren't allowed to use moves, just their strength and agility. a pokemon loses if either they get pushed out of the ring, or if any body part other than their feet touches the ground.\" Zorua and charizard looked at each other surprised. \"any size pokemon can enter, from joltick to dragonite.

Behind his house was an open, grassy area, and behind that was the dense foliage of the jungle. In the middle, there was a large patch of exposed dirt, with a large white ring painted on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said, \"First, Nidoking's gonna warm up. There's a few exercises that help with balance and strength.\" Nidoking then went over to the sumo ring. He lifted his right leg high in the air, then he stomped back down before doing the same with his left. \"That's also traditionally what sumo wrestlers do before the match begins.\" The trainer said. Nidoking then did a few stretches, and was finally ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trainer then threw out a pokeball, with a Gigalith coming out. \"Gigalith here is nice and heavy, so I have Nidoking practice with him.\" Soon, Nidoking was pushing Gigalith with all his might, his pillowy belly pressed against the Gigalith. Surprisingly, he was moving Gigalith along until finally Gigalith was thrown out of the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, the trainer withdrew Gigalith, then threw out an Onix. \"Onix here is good at pushing, so I use him to test Nidoking's defense!\" The trainer said.

The human , and all his pokemon gasped in shock \"So THATS why he was never able to talk!\" nidoking exclaimed starring at the whimpering dark fox. \"but.. why pretend you have a trainer?\" the human asked. \"Because it would look suspicious for a group of pokemon with no trainer walking around.. we didn't want any attention.\" \"Ok..\" hariyama said \"go on..\" \"We have a secret friend.. that we don't want any humans to know about...\" sceptile said. Nidoking went wide eyed as hawlucha took the luxury ball \"hes in here.. that's why we didn't throw it out.\" \"Is he a legendary pokemon?\" They shook their heads. Hawlucha hesitated before throwing him out. You sigh as you materialize, you know you cant keep your existence a secret. Silence falls over the room until finally</span></div></div>",

It all started when I was a Machop. I was a loner in the wild, and I'd spend most of my time in the mountains lifting boulders and the occasional Graveler. Soon, I faced the trainer who I'm still with today. He sent out Nidoking, who was a Nidorino at the time, and he liked my fighting and determination. Even back then, I had more muscles than the average Machop. Through many battles and adventures, I evolved into a Machoke like yourself. I wasn't nearly as big as you are, but I was still bigger than most. In that time, I had developed a passion for getting stronger and more muscular. My trainer and his Haunter helped me come up with a type of drink packed with protein and the energy I needed for a good workout. With the help of that, I was able to start packing on muscle. My trainer didn't hesitate when he met someone who was willing to trade with him, just to evolve his pokemon, and soon, both Haunter and I had evolved, and we haven't looked back since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were enamored with his story, and you said, \"That's amazing! You were able to get bigger and stronger than the average Machamp, just through hard work.\" You thought of calling Mahogany when you got the chance, so you could report this to him.

You quickly typed \"he means since I was getting bigger still!\" Lucario looked at the human and spoke, he couldn't understand him, but he got it \"the prof. doesn't know he was a human?\" he whispered wide eyed. Zorua nodded.They looked over at you, while you typed on. \"Ok I see.\" the human nodded.

The trainer asked why he was so excited, and the professor explained that this was the perfect time to test his growth serums and perfect them. He figured that with all those pokemon trying to gain mass, he'd have no trouble finding test subjects. Many of the trainers and your pokemon were excited to hear this, and Mahogany seemed excited as well. He left the camera on as he started power walking through hallways, grabbing things and setting up boxes. He even wanted to enter Blastoise into the tournament, since he thought that it would be fun. You turned off the video call, and all of the sumos got back work with renewed vigor. Nidoking in particular was worried about taking on a blastoise that size, but he figured he'd just have to keep training if he wanted to stand a chance. This time, the sumos were divided. Sceptile and Machoke decided that they wanted to focus on eating, so they worked with Hariyama to build some more fat. Zorua loved the food, so he joined in as well. Charizard, meanwhile, was worried about his muscle mass, so he spent time with the now larger Machamp, working on building some more muscle mass. ...</span></div></div>",

The Sawk had to do everything in its power just to resist the force from it bouncing back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSawk managed to hang in there, but not for long, as Blastoise rolled forward once again, gaining ground and pushing the Sawk back. Just from his sheer size, Blastoises' belly managed to push Sawk just out of the ring, but it was enough to get Sawk eliminated. Blastoise was declared the victor, and after his own victory cry, he started rocking back and forth, creating some momentum until he rolled back onto his feet, shaking the ground again. The professor was proud as Blastoise lumbered off the stage, only to get withdrawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharizard, Sceptile, and Machoke had seperate matches the first round, so none of them had to face each other, and each gained a substantial victory.

He may not have been quite as fat as Charizard, but his arms and legs were thicker and stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSceptile was the first one to charge. He pushed straight into Charizard's belly, but Charizard's defense was staunch, and he barely gave an inch before he had repelled the attack.

You squeal in pain as the leg fades darker and darker until it is a small, black tendril. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tendril then lifts of the ground and you are suspended in midair. Although in the air, you are unable to move as you sob as the transformations continue. The changes makes its way to your waist as it crunches and thins to become part of your leg. You try to endure the pain as it makes makes its way to your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arms are then spread from side to side, almost as if you are about to embrace someone. It doesn't hurt, just leaves you in a state of peace. The calm doesn't last for long as the pain wracks your arms and they are crushed beyong repair. Your thumbs slowly dwinlde and recede back into your hands and they are forced ito a balled-fist position. As you scream at the uncomfortable sight of your arms (or what was left of them) slowly turning black, you then notice there are only a few changes left to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transformations make your way to your head, and you scream for help as your face seems to scrunch up into a permanent position, forcing your eyes closed and your frown to become permanently etched into your face. All at once, a sensation begins in your forehead as a strange, horn-like object juts its way out and starts to force your face to slowly peel off of your skull. As it hits the ground, the face hardens and turns gold, showing your faceless expression. Your eyes then swell larger and become red, your nose becomes larger and juts from your face. What is left of your face then becomes black like the rest of you, and the shrinking begins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body seems to bee tented in your clothing, as your bones become smaller and smaller, as you can her the sickening snaps from within. As the crushing feeling seems to stop, you then realize you can move, or float. Your tendril feels around the floor and grab the gold face, tucking it under you. You floated back up to the computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTRANSFORMATION COMPLETE, HAVE A NICE DAY!</span></div></div>",
