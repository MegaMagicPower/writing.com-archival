Normally that\u2019s not so strange, but this bar and grill is frequented by monsters. Gross ones, who don\u2019t think much of humans, let alone pathetic busboys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight was just an average night. You stood behind the bar, washing off the dishes, watching the patrons. It was slim picking, but across the way, a group of Orcs were loudly eating and laughing. You had seen each one of them down an entire fiesta plate of loaded nachos. Thank god you weren\u2019t a waiter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTaylor!\u201d Your boss yells. \u201cGo get the green backs from the green skins over there.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Your not a waiter, that\u2019s not your job. \u201cWhy can\u2019t Chris do it. It\u2019s his table\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the funniest things. I haven\u2019t seen Chris since I told him to kick that Ogre out. Maybe he'll turn up, but right now, I need you to get your butt over there and get that money.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou regrettably do as your told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approach the table, you can hear the orcs.<br>\r\n\u201c\u2014 Pianist\u2026 I thought you said Pee on it!\u201d The group busts out laughing, slamming their giant fists on the table, rattling the flatwere.<br>\r\n\u201cAww man Murk, you have the best jokes\u201d one chimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm excuse me but, I'm here.. for the\u2026 \u201c Before you can get the word \"bill\" out, Murk has his giant maw lined up in your face. His sickly yellow teeth filter his rancid breath in your face. Its hot, and wet. You can see slime drool down the side of his cheeks. How did Chris ever get used to this? He looked like he could bite your head off in one gulp. \u201c \u2026 bill.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cBill? Ah.. yeah.. the Bill. Alright boys. Toss in your cash.\u201d The orcs all dig in their pockets, throwing out greasy and stained 20\u2019s on the table. It doesn\u2019t look like enough, but your not going to call them on it. You quickly take it and start to walk back.<br>\r\n\u201cWait right there!\u201d He bellows out and you stop. \u201cI forgot to give you your tip.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTip? You\u2019ve never gotten a tip before. You could stay for a tip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around and wait. Murk waves his hand, asking you to come close. You take a step forward. \u201cCloser boy. I cant give you your tip all the way over there.\u201d You close in, till your literally inches away from the massive orc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leans away from you, digging in deep to his pockets. You divert your eyes, not wanting to look at his gigantic ass. In your moment of distraction however, you feel his hand grab the back of your head and pull you in, underneath his massive buttcheek. Pinned, your helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks down at you. \u201cYour tip is: If your head is ass level to an orc, don\u2019t stick around; especially if you\u2019ve just spent the night feeding him extra cheesy nachos.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurk grunted and shifted his weight. You felt the hot rumbling blast of a rancid fart wash over you. You squirm and try to get out, but the Orc is just too strong to break free. You can hear them laugh and cheer on their friend.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The smell wasn't as bad as before, but you were pretty sure it smelled like fecal matter.<br>\r\n\"Hey human! Get a load of this!\"<br>\r\nMurk wiggled his butt a little before he sighed heavily once again, releasing more compounds from his bowels. Only this time, it turned out to be a pile of orc poop. Murk farted loudly and then the poop began to fall out by the gallons. Some of it landed on the floor and onto your clothes, but most of it wound up in your hair. The smell was putrid beyond your dreams and you were unsure how you'd be able to get out of this situation. Sure, you could devour the feces but more than likely, you'd throw up in the process and you didn't need your own vomit in your hair. So you struggle once again to get free, but Murk shoves you back in and resumes his defecation. Murk and all of his friends are howling with laughter while you're screaming in a muffled voice, trying to get free. But sadly, nothing was helping.<br>\r\n\"Now let me see...what should I do next?\" Murk asked himself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Leslie had never actually <i>met</i> an ogre. She just knew them by their reputations as large, stinky brutes. Maybe this wouldn't actually be as bad as she thought. Just as she was thinking this, the bus doors opened and Leslie's nose was assualted by the rancid scent of the Ogre Swamps. She had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she got off the bus, Leslie was approached by an ogre, a green-skinned male wearing nothing but a loincloth. As he got close, his B.O. invaded Leslie's nostrils, and it was all she could not to pass out while he introduced himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be Leslie.

Now, you have a traditional life as an animator who works whenever you get a call from a business. But today you were on vacation, and not in the likeliest of places. In fact, you were in the musky swamp, filled with many creatures, including ogres, dragons, werewolves, you name it. And it happened you had an ogre you were spending vacation with, your old pal Gorg. Not entirely sure how you met, but you remember him and you being stuck in a bandit camp, and him farting. After that, it was all a blur, the stench you figured knocked you out. But you figured Gorg helped you out, and you're friends now. But then again, maybe you think he thinks you owe him one. Well, you vacationing in his hut, which is actually bigger then what one would figure, and that was to be a fun week. You arrive at his door a short time after tracking through the swamp. You knock on his door about two times before he opens. Gorg was in a loincloth colored green and brown, which barely covered his large posterior. He snorted, yawned, scratched his large butt, then belched rather loudly in your face. The hot breath always reminded you of rotten eggs with burnt meat.<br>\r\n\"Whew! Hello to you too.\" you groan, fanning your face.<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Gorg grunted, scratching his over sized belly.<br>\r\n\"I'm here for my vacation.\" You say holding up some clothing you brought.<br>\r\nGorg took the briefcase, grunted again, and then placed it near his backside before letting a large boom that sounded like a bomb come out. The smell hit you, and you gaged and groaned. After he farted, he gave you back you clothing, which now smelt the same as his breath.<br>\r\n\"You're welcome!\" Gorg laughed, seeing your disgusted face.<br>\r\nWith that you enter his cabin, which is large; it came complete with a kitchen, living room, bedroom,and a bathroom of sorts. It was just a giant natural hole in the ground that Gorg used for bowel movements, and the smell from there was even worse. Of course, it was now your bathroom, so its not exactly a choice. But the good news is Gorg had two beds, and you got one of them. They were ogre sized, much bigger then you, but the more bed the more sleep is what you always said.<br>\r\n\"Well what first?\" Gorg asked yawning.<br>\r\nIt was what you wanted to do first. There was plenty to do, including meet the ogres friends, a good old scavenger hunt, but then again you could always sleep. It had been a long day.</span></div></div>",

Maybe we'll do something later tonight but right now, I'm beat.\" you respond.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm a little tired myself. Perhaps you could meet my friends later today.\" said Gorg.<br>\r\n\"Sure, that should be interesting!\"<br>\r\nYou drop your suitcase on the ground and slide it underneath one of the beds. After that, you take off your shirt and shoes and lay upon the mattress, first noticing that something wet was on the pillow.<br>\r\n\"Ew...what is this crap on the pillow?\"<br>\r\n\"I had a baby dragon fly through the window and...it had a little accident.\" laughed Gorg.<br>\r\n\"EWW!\" you scream, throwing the pillow on the floor.<br>\r\n\"Just forget it! I'll sleep without the pillow.\"<br>\r\nYou turned to your right and saw Gorg untie his loincloth, revealing his humongous ass which was absolutely filthy. He sighed heavily and scratched his left cheek before jumping upon his bed and turning over to lie on his stomach.<br>\r\n\"I forgot--you sleep in the nude. Although I don't see why since that loincloth hardly covers anything at all.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, keep talking. Next thing you know you'll have my ass resting on your nose again like the last time.\"<br>\r\n\"Gotcha. Good night.\"<br>\r\n\"Good night buddy.\"<br>\r\nAnd with that, both you and your buddy go to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you weren't able to sleep for long because a bunch of things began to wake you up in the middle of the night. First off, the bed was actually uncomfortable than you thought. Despite how big it is, there's a lot of wet spots that are relatively sticky. Second off, you kept waking up to see some creepy little critter crawling on your leg or arm. The first time it was an ant, but the second time, it was a centipede...and it only got worse. But that's not the really bad part about it. Gorg kept farting and stinking up the room and with the loincloth off, there was nothing restricting the smell to his domain. Each fart sounded loud and the smell was terrible. It was like he ate nothing but stinky eggs all day and it was frequently pouring out of his butt in an aromatic way. It actually started to get ridiculous; he was literally farting every 30 seconds. Sometimes loud, and sometimes quiet. You finally realize that it's too much to bear so you get off the bed and walk over to the window and opened it, exhaling and trying to fan the stink outside.<br>\r\n\"Damn Gorg! What, did you eat a dead wolverine for breakfast?!\"<br>\r\nGorg responded by farting so loudly that you heard something break. It lasted almost 20 seconds and the smell almost made you vomit. You then proceeded to kick open the door to fan out the hut every faster. Sure, it was cold outside, but you'd rather be cold than locked inside a hot and stinky environment.<br>\r\n\"Whew! Okay...that's a little better.\"<br>\r\nYou return to your bed and go back to sleep, hoping that Gorg would stop farting and no more critters would crawl on your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, you wake up to encounter another problem...</span></div></div>",

You simply cover your nose and go back to sleep, ignoring Gorg and his rancid farts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout two hours later, you hear something churn once again and not a moment later, Gorg grunted contently and you heard raucous farts that was sheer noisome. You weren't even sure how to describe the smell, let alone the sound of it. It wasn't even really loud; it was more squishy and wet than anything else. And it lasted about five minutes; Gorg let out a monstrous fart before sighing and blowing out another wet fart. He sure did know how to make a stink! After he was finished, he let out a loud sigh and shifted back under his covers, snoring once more. You tried to sleep but the smell wouldn't go away! You thought that Gorg was letting off a bunch of silent but deadly farts, but you were pretty sure you would've heard at least one airy fart seep through his butt crack. So you grumble to yourself and step out of bed...making a splash when you land in something sticky.<br>\r\n\"What the...\"<br>\r\nYou lift up your foot and noticed it was dark brown...<br>\r\n\"No, he didn't! No, he didn't! No, he didn't! No, he didn't! No, he didn't!\" you shout out frantically.<br>\r\nYou warily pull back Gorg's covers and almost vomit when you see what he's done. Half of his bed was drenched with ogre fecal matter and was muddy and brown, reeking worse than Gorg's own bathroom. Gorg must've had a wet dream...or in this case, a stink dream, and relaxed his bowels too much. Even Gorg himself was half brown and half green, still snoring away like nothing happened. Appalled by your disgusting friend, you slap him on the belly and he jolts himself up.<br>\r\n\"Whuh?\"<br>\r\n\"I TOLD YOU TO GO TO THE BATHROOM!!!\"<br>\r\n\"Why? What'd I...\"<br>\r\nGorg sniffed the air and looked down to see his bed covered in his own poop, as well as the lower half of his body. He merely chuckled at the sight until he began to hoot with laughter.<br>\r\n\"Whoops!! Guess I had another stink dream! Sorry John...\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean 'sorry'?! I stepped in it and the whole hut stinks like an elephant's ass!! How am I gonna sleep with 20 gallons of ogre shit right next to me?!\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but since I already pooped the bed...\"<br>\r\nGorg relaxes himself and starts to urinate on the bed, creating a large pile of both urine and excrement. You step back from the bed to avoid getting the pee all over yourself. Gorg merely sighed and finished peeing, letting off a few more trickles when he was done. You stare at Gorg, completely grossed out.<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"...I'm sleeping outside.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait, why?\"<br>\r\n\"Gorg, I like you an' all, but damnit I have my limits and this...this is just too much. I can't sleep near you if you're gonna poop in your bed and fart every 30 seconds and pee all over yourself. The stench will literally kill me!! I'm sleeping outside!\"<br>\r\n\"But what about all the horrible swamp monster and creatures that live out there?\"<br>\r\n\"Hmm...get mauled by animals...or suffocate on ogre poop. ...Think I'd rather get mauled to death.\"<br>\r\n\"But John!\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Gorg, it's not like I'm leaving.

Gorg grunts loudly while making two fists and starts to pant erratically, just before he stopped to smell his armpit. That's when you look at the hole in his buttocks and realize that a large brown turd is coming out of it and spreading all over your chest. You scream with all your might to try and wake up Gorg by punching him on the back, but it doesn't really help you that much.<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you doing Gorg?!!\" you scream.<br>\r\nGorg replies by farting so hard that another chunk of poop plops out his butt and onto your chest. There's only one thing you can do right now, and that's rub the poop off your chest yourself. You groan loudly and stick your hand on the massive pile of ogre excrement, grabbing a ball of it and chucking it to the ground. But just as you finally finish, another load plops on your chest. You quickly discard of that one, but then even more falls onto your chest. At this point, you literally just stick your hand near his butthole and let the poop fall onto your hand so it doesn't get onto your chest. When Gorg finally finishes, he mumbled something incoherently and leaves the outhouse. You throw away the poop and groan loudly when you get a nice good whiff of your filthy dung-infested hands.<br>\r\n\"You owe me big time for this Gorg!\"<br>\r\n\"Werewolves? Where...where are those werewolves?\" said Gorg in a daze.<br>\r\nGorg began to walk out of the hut...still not wearing his loin cloth. You rush outside and step in front of him to prevent him from going any further.<br>\r\n\"Whoa, wait second...what are you gonna do to the werewolves?\"<br>\r\n\"...make dogs smell Gorg feet...make 'em...do bad things.\"<br>\r\n\"...Do the werewolves like smelling your feet?\"<br>\r\n\"No...they don't like it when I steal from dogs either...which I'm gonna do.\"<br>\r\nThis is serious. If Gorg gets spotted outside a whole bunch of things could happen! Those werewolves could rip him to shreds, some bandits could hold him hostage. Hell, he might wander into the city and get arrested for walking the streets in the nude...and Gorg probably won't do good in jail. Of course, if anyone messed with Gorg while in prison, he'd probably just fart or burp on them and they'd leave him alone. Regardless, you can't let Gorg walk around the swamp in his current state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, he did just take a dump on you.

What if something happened to him? You sit up like a bolt. \"Gorg?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA raucous burst of ass gas comes from the other bed in reply. You can see the hefty ogre's shape under the filthy blanket. \"Huh...?\" the ogre murmurs. \"What's goin' on? What time is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Gorg!\" You grin as he sits up. He's even more dirty than usual, like he's been walking through a sewer or something. He's also got quite a lot of scratches on him, but nothing looks serious. \"Gorg, what the hell happened to you last night?! Last thing I remember is you sleepwalking and saying your were going to make some werewolves sniff your feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh? Really?\" He shrugs, looking unconcerned. \"That's weird, I had a dream 'bout werewolves. I dreamed I was naked in a werewolf camp, and when they attacked me I farted on them into unconsciousness, then shoved my feet in their face and made them take a good whiff.\" He chuckles at the thought. You think maybe Gorg had a lucky escape last night, judging from all the scratches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGorg swings himself out of bed and throws on his loincloth - not that it really leaves much to the imagination, but it's something of an improvement. \"Well, time to get up, I guess. I'm hungry. You want breakfast?\" You nod eagerly... then stop when you think what your disgusting friend might have in the cupboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" You get out of bed in your pyjamas and follow Gorg into the kitchen, sitting down at his rickety wooden table - it looks like it was made out of driftwood and a few rusty nails. \"Say, what do ogres eat for breakfast anyway...?\" You smile nervously as Gorg starts heating up a pot of something. It smells like week-old garbage, but Gorg's already drooling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, just 'cause you're here, I made something special.\" He winks at you, and pours out two bowls of some kind of slop, setting one in front of you with a wooden spoon. It looks like it's got lumps of... something. Lots of things, actually. Though you can't identify anything for sure. Gorg smiles encouragingly and starts slobbering his bowl down, spilling the gross stuff down his chest and onto the table. \"It's called Ogre Breakfast Surprise,\" he adds, between mouthfuls. \"Dig in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't want to be rude while you're a guest... so you hold your breath and start to swallow the revolting goop. It doesn't just smell like week-old garbage, it tastes like it too. You know your breath's going to reek for the rest of the day - no wonder Gorg's breath is so bad!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Gorg?\" You manage to finish most of your breakfast and glance up at the ogre, who's rubbing his round belly with satisfaction. \"Why's it called Ogre Breakfast Surprise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that?\" Gorg chuckles, as you feel a rumbling in your stomach, and hear an equally loud rumble from Gorg's. \"That's the best part - get ready for your surprise!\"</span></div></div>",

Even with the cushion underneath his butt, he still managed to pull off a hefty fart that sounded awful to your ears.

Then he put a piece of wood over his bare ass and relaxed as much as he could. Next thing you know, he's breaking wind so hard that the wood is hovering in the air due to his boastful passing of gas. It took Lark ten seconds before he stopped farting and he sighed heavily afterwards.<br>\r\n\"Oh, good one Lark!\" complemented Gorg.<br>\r\n\"Hmph! Amateur...\" scoffed Stegnon.<br>\r\n\"Fine!

Not many ogres, let alone ogresses, could stand completely composed with fifteen digested swamp snakes ready to burst out the back door.

It felt solid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Bolen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" <b>BRRAAAAPT</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pointed to your butt. \"Watch this.\" You pushed and grunted, and from your rear came a long rope of shit that just kept coming. \"Those must be the snakes,\" you laughed. \"Argh,\" you moaned, gripping your head with both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What,\" <b>BRRUPT</b> \"Hurts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you growled through clenched teeth, \"just tickles like hell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolen gave a deep belly laugh, then grabbed his gut. \"Okay, my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held up a finger. \"Just one second.\" You pushed with all your might eager for this rope to get out. Eventually its weight pulled the rest out of your body, and it took everything you had not to claw and scratch your viscera as it slid out of its own accord. All that remained was some spluttering diarrhea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you said, shifting your bottom and looking at your buddy, \"You wanted to show me something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just this,\" Bolen said. He balled his fists and gave an ogre roar. You looked at his butt, eager to see what had been the cause of such a performance. Bolen was grunting and sweating now and his legs shook violently, but with a final triumphant cry, he revealed what he'd been pushing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA three foot long, half foot wide solid turd fell from under the loincloth. It made an almighty splash in the water. Bolen stood up straight and turned to you. Front the front of his loincloth, you could tell his manhood was charged. You were actually quite impressed. And the smell was unholy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final, violent diarrheic burst from your body, you stood as well, pulling up your boxers. \"Mom was wrong, we <i>did </i> make the swamp dirtier and smellier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't expect anything less from the son of Markua,\" he said clapping you on the back. \"Let's go refill the tank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Bolen made your way back to the house, leaving two blotches of brown in otherwise green water behind you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You re-entered the house to the smell of eggs. Your father had a fire going in the hearth and a pan filled with eggs was sizzling away. \"That was quite a performance out there,\" your father said. You weren't at all embarrassed that your father was complimenting your ability to defecate. That was normal for ogre families.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, I think I still lost to Bolen,\" you responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour friend beamed, but said \"Don't worry, Gareg, you're still king of the dump in this town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour father laughed. \"But you're a close runner up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly identified the smell of the eggs. \"Dad, are you making Gawker bird eggs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I am son. I wanted to thank your mother for fetching us those snakes last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great idea. We don't thank her enough for taking care of us.\" You realized you were still wearing boxers. \"I'll help you cut some vegetables as soon as I'm dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, physically, took more from your mother than your father. You were powerfully built, rather than fat, but you lamented at not having the pot belly that was the trademark of the ogre race. Being thin did have advantages though: you could wear human clothes, which were, while not as sturdy as the male ogre's leather girdle and loincloth (which doubled as protective armour) were considered much more stylish. Essentially, while not a physically perfect male by ogre standards, you had style, and that was just as good when it came to the ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou selected a wool tunic and leather pants. You slipped the traditional ogre sandals onto your feet and returned to help your father. Gareg had left Bolen in charge of the eggs while he mixed a special drink for your mom. You grabbed a knife and diced some veggies. When all was finished, Gareg piled Markua's plate high with eggs and vegetables, grabbed her drink and set it all on a tray. \"Can I carry the tray to her?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly.\" Your father gave you the tray, and you added your meal to it. You set off for the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approached, you heard a thunderous fart. Grinning, you knew your mother was far from finished. You rounded the corner and saw Markua still sitting on the toilet. She was yawning and scratching her left breast. Upon seeing you enter, she sniffed the air, looked you up and down, and smiled her wonderful smile. \"Human clothes, gawker eggs, sliced vegetables...\" she sniffed again, \"and a Rellick Sunrise.\" She growled passionately. \"If I were fifteen years younger, without a mate, and you weren't my son, I'd have you on the floor right now.\" You blushed. She gestured to the bench to her left. \"Come, set the tray down and let's dig in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did as instructed, handing her her plate before taking yours and sitting to her right. She grabbed an egg and was about to toss it into her mouth, but froze suddenly. \"Mom, is everything okay?\" <b>SPROOORRRT</b> Markua sprayed a burst of dung into the toilet then gobbled up the egg. Smiling, you leaned back to see if you could see any of the hole cut into the bench. Her butt covered the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like anything you see?\" your mother asked between mouthfuls, giving another fart into the pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything,\" you teased, starting on your own plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful, honey,\" she said playfully \"You've aroused me enough as it is.\"<b> SPRRROT</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed. \"Well, at least I know what will please the ladies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother leaned towards you, lifting her leg and letting out a loud <b>BBRRRAAAAAAPPT</b>. \"Farzaz,\" <b>SPLOP</b> \"If you treat every girl this way,\" <b>BRRUP</b> \"I guarantee, you will never have a lonely night in your life.\" <b>SPRRT</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolen came to the entrance of the bathroom. \"Farzaz, I'm going home. Hit me up if you want to hang at the bazaar later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave Bolen a thumbs up. \"Come back any time, Bolen,\" your mother said, punctuating her sentence with a <b>SPPLLRRT</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later Markua. Thanks for letting me use your jetty. And good luck with those snakes.\" Bolen hoisted a leg and farted loudly. Your mother returned the fart, but even louder. Bolen departed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice boy, look after him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will,\" you said and continued eating, listening to Markua relieve herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens when you're done eating?</span></div></div>",

She set her plate down on the tray and turned to you. \"Thank you so much, Farzaz,\" <b>SPLRRT</b> \"I appreciate all you've done for me this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt warm inside. \"Think of it as our way of thanking you for going out and getting those Swamp Snakes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw,\" she  said, letting a squeaky fart out, \"It was nothing, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, you deserve it.\" You finished eating.

Though you wouldn't admit it, she was right. \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BBBRRRPT</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can lie down here and nap until I finish.\" She furrowed her brow and fired a hissing fart into the pit. \"Which should give you about twenty minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" you said tiredly. You kicked your feet up onto the bench and rested your back across your mother's spread legs. Your head rested her left toned, black thigh. Your face was in her abdomen and your nose brushed some wavy bumps that could only be the snakes. You wondered how your mother was not doubled over in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Farzaz, could you push right there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rested a hand on the bumpy flesh. \"Here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkua nodded.

Though her face was mostly eclipsed by her two round breasts, you could still see she had her eyes shut, savouring every second of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at you. \"I'm sorry, Farzaz. I'm keeping you awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided a little flattery was in order. \"No, mom. <i>Your </i>music puts me to sleep faster than the finest human orchestra. Beside's, an ogress's bowels wait for no-one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother chuckled in appreciation. She put her right hand around your midsection to hold you close, and her left stroked the four stubby horns on your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sniffed the air and smiled, closing your eyes. \"And that smell is just <i>divine</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkua leaned forward a little and farted, providing you with more of it. You lay there in your mother's loving embrace as she lulled you to sleep with her loud dump.</span></div></div>",

She was still holding you tightly against her warm, bare skin, your head nestled against her belly. The second thing you noticed was the stink, which, even for an ogre pit toilet, was overpowering. \"Smells like I missed something epic,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I finished those snakes off ten minutes ago,\" Markua said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you've just sat here all that time? You could have woken me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkua stroked your face. \"I could have, but you were out so quickly I knew you needed some shut eye. You look cute enough to eat when you're sleeping.\" She made a \"grrr\" sound and bared her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pretended to be frightened and glanced at her now-flat abdomen. \"I think I'd give you more trouble than the snakes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. \"You're my son. You never give me trouble. Besides,\" she farted three times in succession, \"there's always more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled at her quip, and briefly wondered if you'd fare better than the snakes if you were eaten by your mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But my legs are falling asleep. If you want, we can continue cuddling in my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, mom, that's okay. I want to go do some stuff anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay son. Let me get up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got off your mother's legs and stood. She was in the middle of standing up, but quickly planted her rump back on the seat. <b>SPPOORRRRRT </b>The last little bit of snake fled her behind. She stood again. \"Still sure you could be more trouble than the snakes?\" she teased. Then looked herself over. \"Well, I suppose I should put <i>something </i> on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother was a strange woman in that she couldn't understand why people wore clothes. 'Why waste the effort? The clothes don't do anything for you. The people of the mountains I can understand but us ogres in our hot swamp? What's the excuse? You only make yourself hotter.' It seemed a strange, yet somehow logical, view to have. However she still conformed to society's norms--purely for the purpose of making social interaction easier--and had one or two things to wear, but she drew the line at undergarments. Those made the least sense to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After you,\" you said, making way for her to leave the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, thank you.\" As she walked out you looked at her bottom. It was quite a mess. Markua knew where your eyes lingered and asked \"As much as I appreciate your affection, Farzaz, shouldn't you be saving lustful stares like that for a potential girlfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just thought you'd like to know: your butt looks like armageddon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother looked back at you and grinned, rubbing her butt with both hands. \"One of the many wonders of being a female who loves Swamp Snakes.\" A little bit of flatulence came out of the ass which had you hypnotized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother entered her room and retrieved a leather robe, throwing it on but not buttoning it up, leaving her front exposed to the world. \"Aren't you going to button up?\" you asked, \"You know how distracting that will be on the street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkua gave her breasts a squeeze. \"Good thing I'm not going out on the street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis piqued your curiosity. \"Then where are you going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out to a favourite spot of mine in the swamp,\" she answered, heading for the back door. She stopped and turned to you. \"Would you like to join me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought for a moment. You did say you were going to hang with Bolen. On the other hand, it wasn't everyday you got to spend quality time with your mother.</span></div></div>",

There was no reason you couldn't hang out with Bolen later in the afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, mom, I'll go with you,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkua's ears perked up. She seemed excited that she was going to spend some quality time with you. \"Alright, but I'd recommend putting on something less expensive. We're taking the path through the woods from the backyard, so anything you wear is going to get muddy and wet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took her advice, putting on some ruddy shorts and a leather vest, which, like your mother's robe, you left unbuttoned. Returning to the kitchen. you found your mother had packed a satchel. \"I've got a few snacks for the road,\" she explained. Then, with a wily look in her eye, she added \"And something to pass the time.\" Oh the perverted places your mind went when she said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Markua left out the back door, taking a path leading away from your house and into the woods. \"The place we're going is a hot spring,\" she explained, \"It's a little off the beaten path, but it's well worth it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the road you talked about stuff: how life was going, if you were keeping up at school, if there were any girls that caught your eye. You loved how your mother took such an interest in your life and how she was willing to offer advice and talk about her personal experiences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a time, you decided to ask the question. \"Mom, back at the house, you mentioned you had something to pass the time. What did you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkua laughed, a little too maniacally for comfort. She opened her satchel and took out a bag of roots. You immediately got the idea. \"Vekki roots,\" she said, \"I thought we could have a little contest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVekki roots were highly nutritious, but give any who consumed them terrible gas. You and your mother used to eat them and have farting contests when you were little. You were surprised, but pleasantly so, that she even had them lying around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou each took three, crunching the bland roots in your mouth and downing them. Right away you felt gas buildup and you let out a small burp. Your mother had refrained from doing so. \"That's going to put you at a disadvantage,\" she said, \"now you have less gas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept from burping, swallowing hard each time you had the urge. Very soon you felt a pressure in your abdomen, and you kicked off the match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BRRAAAPT</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let it begin,\" you declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkua was thoroughly unimpressed. \"I'm sorry but I thought you were my son,\" she said, mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe broke wind without breaking stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BBBBRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPT</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a lesson, Farzaz.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped walking. Pushing your butt out a little bit, you gave a solid push.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BBBBBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPT</b><b r></b>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks,\" you said, with no small amount of insolence, and with a smirk on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother stood next to you, hands on her hips. A groan from her stomach gave you the sinking feeling you were about to lose this battle. \"Little boys should learn to respect their elders.\" She lowered into a squatting position with her elbows resting on her legs and let out the finishing blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPTTTTT</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe release was so forceful that smatterings of poop that had lined her colon had shot out onto the ground. Some of it got on the lower part of her robe, which was blown backwards. When all was done your mother just remained in that squatting position, crap dripping out of her ass, a snarky smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got down on bended knee before your squatting mother, patting her belly and deeply inhaling. \"You know I respect you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>SPRRT </b>More crap spewed from the ogress before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a rustling in the bushes behind you and the sound of footsteps. The smile vanished from your mother's face and she stood up straight, just as you were grabbed around the neck by a human, who leveled a dagger at your throat. He hauled you to your feet. He was 6'4\", you were 6'9\". You may have had a height advantage, but the man's arms were cords of steel. You realized that he was a bandit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spoke to your mother in a commanding voice. \"Throw over the satchel, beast.\" You were absolutely terrified. You were hoping Markua, even though she dwarfed both of you at 7'3\",  would just do as the bandit as asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, she shed her robe, once again naked before the world. Her tone was equally steady, and filled you with dread. \"I am going to ask you only once: take your hands off of my son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bandit just grinned. \"You want this slimy mongrel back, beast? Throw over the satchel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother wasted no time. She wheeled around and bent over, aiming her shapely rear straight at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BBBRRROOOOOOOROROOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRROOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRT</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother farted at you and the bandit. But this time, her gas was not the usual, likable smell she typically produced. No, this smelled like decaying flesh mixed with sulfur. You and the bandit both choked, and he loosened his grip. You blinked to clear the water out of your eyes and saw your mother charging at you. She threw you aside and drove the bandit to the ground, straddling him and pinning both his arms to the ground. It looked very sexual, but there was no pleasure in Markua's eyes. Just a madness and hate that you never thought her capable of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe roared in the bandit's face, drooling a little. She spoke with barely contained power. \"If you <i>ever</i> touch him again, I will break off your fingers and eat them one by one.\" You never thought you could be so afraid of anything, least of all your mother. The kindest person you knew was sitting on a man and threatening to tear his fingers off. \"Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bandit nodded rapidly, muttering \"yes\" several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother spoke again. \"Now you are going to run. And if you so much as glance back, I will come after you and gouge your eyes from their sockets.\" She got off him, picked him up, and threw him away. He followed her instructions to the letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkua took the bandit's dagger and threw it away. She turned to where you lay and you recoiled in fear. The dark form of your mother towered over you, and you felt your body wracked with shivers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hard, monstrous shell on Markua melted away. She knelt down, grabbed you and pulled you close, holding your head to her breasts. You couldn't help but hold her too. \"Are you alright?\" she asked, her voice once again motherly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" you managed to say. \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled away from her bosom and looked into her eyes. \"Would you have done it?\" you ask, \"Ripped off his fingers and eaten them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA harsh fart ripped from her bottom, the hard shell momentarily returning. She said in a deadly serious tone \"Yes.\"</span></div></div>",

With enough of your wits recovered, you looked your mother up and down. \"Do you always strip when you save people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed quite relieved, taking your humour as a sign that you were truly okay. \"Only for you, Farzaz.\" She retrieved her robe and threw it back on, still leaving the front unbuttoned. \"Do you want to go home?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, it was hard to compare this proud yet gentle creature to the savage thing you had seen just moments ago. She was concerned about you though. But that bandit didn't look keen on coming back, and any other dangers would be of a more mundane sort (swamp monsters, flesh eating plants, things that would be smart enough to avoid an ogress with her offspring). And you felt that the soothing warmth of a hot spring was what you needed most of all right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay, mom, really. Let's keep going.\" You walked in silence, the only action taken was your mother handing you some food, which helped quiet the nerves. Every now and again one of you would release some of the gas from the Vekki roots that remained inside your bodies. After a time, you reached a space in the forest filled with cauldrons of rock filled with bubbling water, and some columns that spewed gaseous fumes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to feel <i>so</i> good,\" Markua said, disrobing. She stepped up and over the brim of one of the cauldrons, wincing as the water made contact with her skin. After a moment she adjusted, and she closed her eyes and lay back in pure comfort. You stripped as well, but you sat in the spring a short distance from your mother's reclining form. She noticed the absence of your body and searched for you. Looking into your eyes, she saw what troubled you. \"You didn't think I could get that way, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkua glided through the water over to you. I took effort to not recoil as she nestled up to you. \"I promise: I would never, <i>ever</i>, hurt you. That said, I won't let anyone else ever hurt you. It took all I had to keep from ripping that guy's head off.\" The calmness with which she said this disturbed you. \"Look,\" she swam in front of you, holding you and looking into your eyes, \"you want proof that I'm still your mother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she do to prove it to you?</span></div></div>",

As she stepped out, she pretty much had her butt in your face. Her cheeks were shaking, trying to hold something in. Your mother's wet, muscled body began to ascend one of the shorter columns. She stuck her bum over top of the hole. \"The steam tickles.\" She rubbed her backside a little before <b>BRRRSSHHHPLRRT</b>. Her ass exploded into the column.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BBBBBRRRRRTTT BRRAAAAT FFFFRRRRRRRRT<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\n\"Wait,\" she said, shifting her bottom.

But you toyed with her a little. \"Not quite. How about a little more evidence?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother smiled, seeing through your game. \"Oh, you are just <i>asking </i>for trouble.\" She put her hands on her knees and bore down.

She walked over and stood on the rim of the spring, standing tall above you. She turned around so her bottom was right above you and slowly settled into a squat. As her ass descended toward your face you saw every tendon, every powerful muscle shifting and tightening beneath her fair black skin. Finally her bum was right above you, and your nose went up to greet it. Your hands went up as well, caressing and scratching the cheeks that you love. Markua purred in contentment. As you penetrated her crack with your nose she let out a wet <b>BRRRPPT</b>. The smell convinced you that this truly was your confident, loving, and most of all, nude mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkua settled into the spring with you and you lost yourself in her warm embrace. \"You are truly my mother,\" you said, closing your eyes and resting against her welcoming body.</span></div></div>",

You even tried some moss and attempted to defecate into a column, but the heat burned your ass, forcing you to relieve yourself on the ground while your mother watched smugly from a column of her own, her butt unloading into the fiery depths of the column. How she could stand her ass being cooked was a mystery to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a time, the two of you got dressed, but you only wore your vest and no pants as the moss continued to wreak havok on your bowels. Your mother wore nothing, carrying her robe, and the two of pooped and shatted yourselves all the way home, laughing the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you entered the house, you went and got changed back into fine human clothes. You went into your mother's room, which she had just finished fumigating with her bottom, and saw her lying spread eagle on the bed, a book in her hands. Her ass was still chugging away underneath her. Breathing deep, you told her that you were going to chill with Bolen. \"Okay, Farzaz. Give me a scratch before you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou placed a hand on her crotch and gave it a scratch. \"No, wait! I meant--\" She was overcome by a wave of pleasure. Markua growled, one of her hands gripping the fabric of the bed in pleasure. Then she kicked you away. She lay on the bed, looking at you and breathing hard. \"Stop! Before I end up mating with my own son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised a snarky eyebrow at your mother. \"That wouldn't be such a bad thing.\" Your young teen body found hers highly attractive, but you didn't really intend to do your own mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" She stood on the bed, legs spread apart a little and arms by her sides. She flexed all the muscles in her body, and you were hypnotized by the contracting tendons. \"You: a sexually inexperienced adolescent. \"Me: an adult ogress with enough strength to throw a fully grown human. You would be dead by the first climax.\" You knew that she probably wasn't exaggerating. Markua growled a little and began slinking across the bed towards you. \"But, son, you've gotten me <i>very </i>horny. I don't think I can wait until your father gets home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, seeing the point she was trying to illustrate: you mate with her, you die. Your raised your hands and backed off. \"Okay mom, I get it, point taken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, releasing some gas and further pleasuring your senses before lying back down. You bade her goodbye and left. As you departed the house, though you couldn't be sure, you thought you heard one or two roars of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled to yourself. You enjoyed these little, playful moments you had with your mother.</span></div></div>",

That was because everything had to be adjusted for the height of Bolen's family. You knocked on the large door and it opened. You face was level with the hips of a massive white-skinned ogress. You looked up, seeing two breasts that dwarfed Markua's, and the face of someone who considered you her second son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Farzaz!\" the cheery face of Bolen's mother greeted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Drezia. Is Bolen still around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he's out in the backyard. Come with me.\" Drezia brought you into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrezia was, like your mother, thin but with a good deal of muscle. The only two differences physically between the two were the eyes (Drezia's were blue while your mother's were black) and the breasts (Drezia's many sizes bigger than Markua's). Drezia also liked to wear clothes, but only outfits that complimented her melons. Her overall height was also unique. Drezia and her family were large for the ogre race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you looked up at the high ceiling of the massive house, a thunderous voice called from down the hall, \"Is that Farzaz I hear?\" These words were followed by a booming fart. Drezia chuckled. She stopped in front of a closed door, which promptly swung open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself between two purple legs the size of Redwood trees, and face to face with a gut that you could spend hours climbing. The beasts genitals were hidden behind a huge wedge-shaped loincloth. You looked up into the grinning face of Morag, a titan among ogres. The purple male was believed to be the biggest ogre alive, and there were rumours that his father was a giant of the north. Pure speculation of course, but you couldn't help but wonder sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother rumbling fart emanated from the beast's bottom. You waved a hand in front of your face \"Whew! Smells bad in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorag laughed, the sound like and earthquake. He farted again. \"Yeah. A couple of goblins are giving me trouble.\" <b>BRRRRRRRRTTT</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou furrowed your brow. \"Why did you eat a couple of goblins?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" <b>FRRRRRT </b>\"I was out buying stuff for dinner last night,\" <b>BBRRRUPT </b>\"when these two jokers came over and cut the bag. I <i>politeley </i>explained to them,\" he looked at Drezia as she said this, who merely rolled her eyes, \"that I was buying food for my family, and I didn't take kindly to people who steal from my family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did they do?\" you asked, nose pinched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe violet ogre vented again. \"They chanted, saying I was doing a woman's job and insulting my manhood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised your eyebrows, grabbing the loincloth and peeling it aside. Whistling, you said \"Not exactly easy to insult.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant before you laughed heartily. \"I tried to show them that, but they were either blind or stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably both,\" you said, letting the loincloth fall back into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's a male to do when his family is robbed?\" Morag asked. A deep \"thump\" of flatulence from between his legs helped you to formulate and answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat the robbers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, someone who understands.\" Morag grunted and a wet, crackling sound was heard, followed by a splash. \"Nnnng,\" he growled, \"that's one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou coughed a little. The stench was really starting to get to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The smell isn't as bad up here,\" Morag said. He reached between his legs with both hands and lifted you effortlessly, seating you on his right leg. Though the box-like bathroom was still hot, your nose wasn't tortured as much. A large bout of flatulence was released from Morag's behind. \"Goblin flesh is never easy on the bowels,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to go find Bolen. Enjoy yourselves,\" Drezia said, closing the door and leaving you with the gassy beast on the toilet, who looked down at you and chuckled with his deep belly laugh. But you were in no way nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorag had often taken care of you when you were little and your parents were out. He had entertained you, fed you, protected you, he was something like a second father to you, telling you many stories of his exploits.  He had even saved your life once. You were with Morag in the forest and a tree started to come down. He caught the thing and, with a mighty display of strength, whipped the tree away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's see about that guy's buddy.\" You were no stranger to Morag's bottom, after he'd relieved himself in the woods one day while he was with you. You knew the kind of smell he could produce, so you covered your nose with the collar of your tunic and nodded to him, signaling that you had braced yourself. He returned the nod, and gave a deep grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BBBBRRRRRP BBRRRRRAAAAAAPBRAAAAAAAAAP FFFRRRRRRRRRRTT</b> \"Argh!\" <b>BRRRRTT </b>\"Gah!\" <b>BRROOORT </b>\"Jeez!\" <b>FFFRRRARRT </b>\"Sorry, Farzaz. This one is feisty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe behemoth's belly rumbled. \"Here he comes,\" Morag said, and growled deep as he pushed out the log that was the second goblin. He relaxed against the back wall, ripping ass in triumph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at you and noticed how tightly your nose was clamped shut. \"I think they learned their lesson,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorag laughed, farting in agreement. Just then the door opened and Bolen stood at the entrance. The smell hit him and he recoiled in disgust. \"Dad, man you stink!\" Then he noticed that you were with Morag. \"Hey Farzaz, you and dad been catching up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Morag answered, picking you up of his leg and setting you on the floor. Down here, the stench of Morag's behind was much worse. The titan rose off the toilet, the rear part of his loincloth falling to conceal his buttcrack. You made way for the giant as he stepped out of the bathroom, getting a whiff of his ass accidentally as he passed by and headed for the kitchen. \"Honey, the tank is empty!\" he called to Drezia, passing gas as he did so, \"What's on the menu?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boiled Newt's Eyes,\" she called back. \"Farzaz have you had lunch yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't lived until you've tasted mom's Boiled Newt's Eyes,\" Bolen said, \"And they make you gassy as a bonus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou contemplated your decision. You'd always loved Drezia's cooking. On the other hand, you and Bolen could buy some great food at the market.</span></div></div>",

Morag walked up behind Drezia, who was kneeling at the hearth with a huge pot over the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're very welcome to stay,\" she said as her mate gave her an affectionate peck on the neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just make my day,\" Morag said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your Newt's Eyes, apparently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed and sat at the table, resting his colossal backside on the large chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How were the goblins?\" Drezia asked as she brought the pot over to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorag farted thunderously. \"Nothing I couldn't handle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your hand. \"I can vouch for that.\" You took a seat to Morag's right. Bolen sat across from you and Drezia opposite Morag. She brought four wooden bowls and poured the eyes into each, handing you your bowl first. You waited until everyone had their bowl before lifting yours to your mouth and slurping up some of eyes. They had been put in an orange vegetable broth which was delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, perfect as always, Drezia,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom rarely makes these for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why is that?\" Morag asked between mouthfuls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because mom prefers eggs and Swamp Snakes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorag smiled. \"I remember the last time we had Swamp Snakes. If you think I'm bad when I have goblins, you haven't seen anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned, wondering just what would happen if a beast Morag's size had Swamp Snakes. \"Could you show me? I ask because my mom is bad when she has fifteen of them, so I don't imagine you could be worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone suddenly stopped eating. Morag looked at you. \"Is that a challenge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAha, you'd got him. \"I suppose so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorag let out a menacing fart. \"I respect Markua, but that does not mean I will hesitate to prove my bowels are more destructive than hers.\" He downed the rest of his eyes, and scooped many more out of the pot. \"We'll get some snakes later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you spent a while eating, you started to feel intense pressure in your gut. Leaning to the side, you began the stream of gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BRRRAAAAAAAAPT</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrezia was next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>GGGRRRRRRRPPTT</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked.

When you all were finished eating and had vented some gas around the house, Morag asked you \"Now about these Swamp Snakes. We can get them from the market or the swamp.\"</span></div></div>",

All three of you farted loudly along the way and talked about various things, such as the best and worst dumps you ever took. You were interested in finding out what those were for Morag. \"The best dump I ever took was in a public outhouse. I had just had a major binge which contributed to this,\" he rubbed his gut \"and I had just sat down to let it all back out. Then this white-skinned female, surprisingly close to my height, bursts in and sits down next to me, farting up a storm as she does. I said to her 'You realize this is the men's outhouse, right?' She responded with 'Don't you like females?' I might have killed her if she had been a male, but her bluntness aroused me. That and her great big breasts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolen rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, we had a great conversation as our bowels emptied. I'm normally proud of how well I can stink up and outhouse,\" he farted to illustrate the point, \"but she did her fair share. I found out her name was Drezia. I realized then and there that I was in love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" you said, \"in a way it was your butt that brought you two together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. Now, worst dump ever, that's easy. I got lost in the swamp once and started to get hungry. So I ate these mushrooms I couldn't identify, not knowing they acted as a stool hardener. He grimaced at some recollection. \"I dropped a rock hard log the size of a boulder in the swamp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced at his behind. \"Wow. There isn't any damage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was,\" Morag said, smiling, \"it just healed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you came upon a pool of murky swamp water that was churning. \"Here's plenty,\" said Bolen. All three of you waded in and started grabbing snakes. The snakes themselves were harmless, but the hissing they made was a tactic to scare off predators. They made a lot of hissing when they saw Morag. As soon as you got fifteen you retreated from the waters and handed them to Morag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" he said. Then, much to your surprise, he started to devour them right there, alive and whole. When he had finished, you asked for an explanation. \"I've always liked my meat raw and wriggling on the way down. Hehe, that tickles,\" he said, patting his massive belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you wandered the swamp, taking in the sights and sounds. A few hours later, Morag's gut let out a savage rumble. \"Sounds like they want out,\" he said. He went behind a tree and out of your sight. There was silence for a while. \"Dad, are you okay?\" Bolen asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>SSSSPPPPPRRRRRRRRRRRTTT SSSSSSPPPPPLLRRRTTT SSSPPLOOOOORRRRRRRRT SSSPLLLLLLLLRRRP</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard Morag's rumbling chuckle. \"What does it sound like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Bolen smiled. \"It sounds like you've got this well in hand,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BBBRRAAAAAPT SSHHHPPPLRRRRRRRTT</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorag sighed with relief. \"Get comfy, boys,\" SSSPLLOORT \"I won't be done any time soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Bolen sat on the grass, listening to his father relieve himself. Morag roared once or twice, not in pain but as an expression of dominance, and you could honestly say that few could dispute him. The flatulence and splattering of Morag's butt showed no sign of stopping. You could smell his power after only a short time and it only got stronger. After about fifteen minutes, there was a squishing sound and a final <b>SPLAT</b>, and Morag said \"Okay, it's all out. You can come over, it's safe now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Bolen rounded the tree and found Morag squatting over a pyramid of liquid feces, a wide grin on his face. \"Did you enjoy the performance?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thoroughly,\" you responded. Morag rose to his full height. You pulled his rear loincloth away and inspected his backside. \"Well, you're not gonna be clean for a while, Morag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe farted in your face a little. \"A good ogre never lets his butt get clean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inspected the mountain of feces. \"I think I can honestly say you've beaten mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice behind you said \"Is that so, Farzaz?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was your mother.</span></div></div>",

You found out what it was very quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkua's stomach growled evilly. She rubbed it. \"Speaking of Swamp Snakes, I stopped at the pond where you ate, Morag, and had about a dozen or so of them. I don't know how you swallow them whole. It's quite a hassle.\" She walked over to you, standing behind you and putting her hands on your shoulders. She put her mouth close to your ear and whispered. \"Really, Farzaz? Going behind my back to prove that another ogre is better than me at pooping out Swamp Snakes and you thought I wouldn't find out? I expected <i>goblins </i>to be smarter than that.\" She had no anger, no contempt in her voice, just calm warmness. That made you all the more nervous, but you had a distinct feeling of what your punishment was going to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing you knew you were sailing through the air, flying over Markua's head. You thought you were going to plummet into the ground and break your neck, but your mother, true to her promise, didn't let you get hurt. You were borne downward and softly placed on the earth between her legs. She was in a squatting position above you, a foot planted on each of your arms. She looked over her shoulder. \"Morag, Bolen, could you go entertain yourselves for a while? Farzaz and I need to have a nice, quiet, mother-son talk.\" The two ogres walked away. You didn't hate them for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother returned her attention to you. She unbuttoned her robe, removed it, and cast it aside, revealing herself as she did at the hot springs. \"There. How's this for naked?\" There was that horrible rumble in her gut again. \"Almost time.\" The view from below her was fantastic, looking up at her butt, womanhood, belly and breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at your mother pleadingly. \"Mom,\" you said, all pretense of a steady voice gone, \"can we talk about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat smile was still etched on her face. \"That's all I want to do, Farzaz.\" <b>BBRAAAAAAPPT </b>A fart ripped from her bottom, spraying dung onto your chest. \"But it's going to have to wait. I've got twenty-four Swamp Snakes I have to take care of first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, lay back, closed your eyes, and braced for the storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForty minutes later you awoke to wetness. You're nude mother was washing your unconscious, dung-buried body in green swamp water. This act of love was in stark contrast to her earlier torture. When you could stand on your own, you looked your mother in the eyes. She was still smiling. \"Mom, I'm sorry. I'll never go behind your back like that again. Yours is the best butt I know.\" You and she hugged, standing waist-deep in swamp water. A cluster of bubbles came to the surface behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, son. Let's go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you started back through the swamp to your house. You thought of one more thing to say to Markua. \"Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Farzaz?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time I ask for Swamp Snakes for dinner, remind me what happened today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed, a musical, sweet sound, and put her arm around your shoulders as you returned to you house.

Let's just buy them from the market,\" you said, \"I'll pay for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan,\" Bolen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you headed to the front door, Morag in the lead with you and Bolen right behind him. This was inconvenient as he still had plenty of gas, and fired it in your face until you were outside. \"You know better than to be in the line of fire,\" he said grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all walked down the road from Bolen's house. The market was a space between a cluster of buildings with a series of awnings over the stands. Ogres sold everything, from food to clothes to weapons to precious stones. Morag sought out a stand that sold fresh Swamp Snakes. You saw that there was a jumbo bowl on the menu, so he ordered that and you paid. He took the bowl to clear table. Only you and Bolen could sit because of Morag's sheer size. He set the bowl down on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" you said, \"Morag, take fifteen out.\" He did so. \"That leaves six for me and seven for you Bolen.\" With the bowl divvied up, you started eating. Morag was done the quickest as he merely swallowed the dead snakes one by one. Bolen was second, eating half a snake at a time. You came last, though you had the fewest snakes. You ate smaller bites than either of your friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the snakes finished off, the three of you traversed the market, seeing the sights, smelling the scents, and even ogling a few lovely ogresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were observing a diamond stand when you heard a savage gurgle from Morag's gut, which was right behind you. Looking up, you saw Morag nodding, a smirk on his face. \"Come on. Let's find an outhouse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have to go far. As ogres were creatures whose favourite pastimes involved defecating and farting, they kept outhouses ready at all times. The one you approached only supported two people. \"That's okay,\" Bolen said, \"I'll find another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll wait here for you,\" Morag said. Then you and he both entered. There was only one door as the outhouse had two seats with no partition. There was a single wooden bench with two holes cut into it. You yanked down your fine trousers and sat. As you watched, Morag swung his huge backside around, positioned it over the hole, and sat. To tell the truth, you felt a little insignificant and weak next to this colossus about to do his business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>UUUUURRRRRPPTT</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorag had already managed a bit of flatulence while you hadn't made a sound. He noticed this and looked at you. \"You're awfully quiet.\" <b>BRRRPT </b>\"Feeling blocked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Just a little intimidated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorag raised an eye brow, farting at the same time. \"You've seen me take dumps plenty of times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" you say struggling to express yourself, \"but I've never gone <i>with </i>you. It's a totally different experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So just pretend you're going with your own father or Bolen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BBRRRRUUUUUUUUPPT</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pointed to his bottom. \"Those thunderstorms make it somewhat difficult.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced downward, frowning. You got the sense that he truly wanted to help you. \"Alright,\" he said, \"how about we take turns?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was your turn to raise an eye brow. \"Turns? You mean farting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorag nodded. \"Farting, pooping, whatever happens to come out. Look I'll start.\" He grunted a little and out came some gas. <b>BBRRRARAAAAAPT</b> \"Now your turn. I won't go until you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill unsure whether you could do it, you pushed hard down below and a burst of gas came out more easily than expected. <b>FFFRRRRRRRTT</b> Not as thunderous as you bench partner but still progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled. \"Good. Now let's up the ante.\" <b>BBBRRAAABRAAAAAAPPT</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou became more relaxed and got into the game. <b>BBRRRRRRRPPPTTT</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, time for some poop.\"  You saw Morag's enormous gut flex. <b>SPPPLLLLOOOOOORRRRRRRT </b>The snakes began their escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou growled a little and got out some of you own. <b>SSHHHPLRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPSHLRRRRT</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorag gave you sly look. \"Are you sure you're not a child of these loins?\" he asked, pointing downwards to his loincloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" <b>SHLOORT </b>\"Naw, not big enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorag laughed, pooping some more. It went on like that: back and forth, back and forth. Morag with his cannon of an ass, you with your popgun by comparison. You two increased the speed of your turns until each of you was just going constantly. The frame of the outhouse even shook a little form the force of the defecation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>SPPLRRRRRRRRRT SPLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRTT SSHHRRRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTT BBBBBBBLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRB BRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPT<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\nThe outhouse started to smell, and you were pretty sure Morag could account for most of it. Finally, you ran out of ammunition, but Morag was still going strong. You thought about what you could do now. You could just wait outside for the purple behemoth to finish his loud--and rather smelly--business. Then you started to get a more interesting idea. Looking beneath you, you realized that the pit wasn't that deep, and you could easily climb inside and see the beast's but in action.</span></div></div>",

You glanced at the open toilet. A fart from your seated friend signaled he knew what you were planning. \"Are you sure?\" he asked, his butt going <b>SSHPLOOORT</b>. \"It's going to be more than a little dirty down there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay.

As you expected, you could easily climb back out. Light spilled in through the hole, and as Morag predicted, it was filthy. You saw a small mound of dung that had to be what you expelled. But at the far end, there was a mountain. Morag's of course. A loud FFRRRRRRT sound drew your eyes upward. A glob of crap fell out of a butt that put your own father's to shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe, enjoying the scenery?\" Morag rumbled, expelling another blob of shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes,\" you said, \"and it looks like you are going to beat mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BRRRAAAAARRT </b>\"Good. By the way, you know how violent my dumps start to get as they reach the end.

You continued to watch for several minutes as the ogre who was like a second father to you took one of his massive, signature dumps above you. He grunted every now and then, and sometimes you heard a gurgle from the thunderous beast above. You imagined his gut rippling and convulsing with each load he dropped. All the while with him sitting there, legs spread apart, hands on his knees, sitting up straight and casually letting fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter seven minutes of loud defecation, you heard the door creak open.

He grimaced. \"Oh, excuse me...\" he pitched forward, allowing Morag to look behind him and see what was the cause of his trouble. The little light that entered revealed a log almost as tall and half as wide as you snaking out of your father's behind. His anus was stretched to the max and he was growling as it left. Finally it broke off (you barely dodged it) and he sat back on the toilet. \"Roast gnome flesh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I've had that once,\" Morag said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour father farted loudly. \"I'd imagine it doesn't give your butt as much trouble, seeing as it's three times the size of any male's in town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorag shook his head, giving off a deep sounding <b>SSPLOOOOOORT</b>. \"I'm larger, which means that everything is scaled <i>up </i>for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou father's eyes went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorag growled as another sizable chunk fell out of his behind. \"I was shitting logs the size of this outhouse.\" <b>UUUUUURRRRRRPPPT </b>\"I could eat some and show you some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGareg thought a moment. \"That could be interesting,\" he mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>SSSSSHHHHHHPPLLLOORORORORORRRTTTT </b><b>BBBLLLLOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRBBBBB </b><b>SSSSHHHHHBBLAAAAAARRB </b>A great many snakes were blasted out Morag's ass.

She wore a green dress that was split up the sides to show off as many curves as possible. It also showed off an ample amount of cleavage and the lower part barely covered her bum, keeping her legs in plain view. You just stared at her, mouth open and drooling a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Farzaz,\" she said, walking up to you.

I'd recognize that sound anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the door opened and the violet colossus stepped out, fanning his rear. He was surprised to see his mate outside. \"Hey, Drezia. I thought you were staying at home today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I decided to come to the market to get something special for dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even more special than what we had last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a loud rumble from Drezia's stomach. She rubbed it with her right hand while she explained \"That's actually the reason I came over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorag looked at you. \"You may want to join her for this, Farzaz. She doesn't blow very often, but when she does...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrezia grinned, shaking her hips. She stopped when another rumble shook her stomach. \"Ooh.

She walked up to the bench and contemplated the hole. \"Morag and I always have trouble using these benches,\" she said. You understood. These outhouses were built for regular ogres, not unusually large ones like Drezia and Morag whose rears were several times the size of a regular ogre's. \"Oh well, time to begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around and stuck out her bum, slowly bending her knees. She flipped up the rear of her dress. She navigated her bottom downward until it touched the bench at which point she relaxed completely, leaning back. \"Hnnng.\" She gave a solid grunt and things started almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPTTTTT  BBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTTT  FFRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPTTTTTTTT UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPPPPPPPPPPPPRRRRRRRRTTTTT</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrezia moaned in relief and giggled a little when she saw the expression on your face. \"Didn't think females could do that, did you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot exactly true. \"I knew certain females could explode like that.

Being male or female doesn't make a shred of difference.\" She fired off a loud, squirting fart to illustrate that point. Then Drezia leaned forward and picked you up, as effortlessly as Morag did, and seated you on her leg. \"There. That's more comfortable isn't it?\" <b>SSSPPPRROOT</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. You saw her face briefly scrunch up in concentration before relaxing again. Down below, there was a loud crackling. \"First solid?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" she said clearly in pleasure, \"And it's a big one.\" She reached down and rubbed her abdomen, and you saw her hand briefly drift a little farther south than that before she caught herself and stopped. She blushed. \"I think I'd better pinch this off.\" There was no change in her facial expression as the crackling accelerated, stopped, and a splat was heard from far below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any more?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, and let out a loud <b>SHPLOOOOOOORRT </b>in response. \"Lots more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the door opened.

She acknowledged you two with a fart. \"Hello, Farzaz, Drezia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrezia echoed it with an odd-sounding expulsion. \"Hey, Markua. Farzaz and I were just enjoying some quality time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that.\" She closed the door behind her. She stripped off her robe, beneath which she wore nothing, and lay it on the bench beside the unoccupied hole. Drezia wasn't at all fazed about seeing her neighbour naked. She enjoyed stripping herself, but for the purpose of showing off her body rather than adhering to Markua's philosophy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother stretched high before walking over to the empty seat. She stopped and took a whiff. \"A big guy was in here.\" She looked at Drezia. \"Morag, I assume?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white beauty responded with a gooey release from her rear. \"He likes to take big, long dumps,\" she said, \"I barely get to use the outhouse at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkua laughed, seating herself on the bench. \"Gareg's the same way.\" <b>SSSHHHHHHLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRTTTTT</b> Markua released a large load. \"But males will be males.\" <b>SSSHHHHLLLRRRTTT</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crawled off of Drezia's leg and sat on the bench between the two ogresses, both of whom dwarfed you. You had Drezia's ample hip nudging against your let leg, and on your right was your mother. Drezia let loose an unusually large explosion from her backside. She laughed a little. \"I think I'm going to fill the pit in a couple minutes at this rate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkua retorted with BBRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPTTT. \"Not before I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrezia was unimpressed. \"Please, you've got my mate's previous dump as a head start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkua looked confident. \"Really? I didn't notice. I think I could've filled this place without Morag's help in the same amount of time, while you'd still be stuck on what's in your lower bowels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrezia's demeanor turned absolutely predatory. \"Are you insulting my ability to fill an outhouse pit?!\" She leaned across the bench, her chest right above you, and growled in Markua's face, who returned the action. You knew you should probably run fast and far. Contests between females tended to be violent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just saying your butt could never measure up to mine,\" Markua said. \"You're good but not that good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to get very nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Drezia said \"We'll let the little one decide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour nerves got considerably worse. \"M-me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrezia and Markua looked at you. \"Yes. You've been sitting here listening to us this whole time. Who's better at dumping?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at your mother. Her eyes gave you a look that said <i>I am your mother. I can do terrible things to you if you do not make the right choice.</i> You looked at Drezia. She gave a similar look. You knew what your mother could be like when she became vengeful. The demonstration with the bandit had made that clear. Though she had promised never to hurt you, there were other ways to make you pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Drezia. She was twice your mother's size. You wondered just how dangerous she was when riled. You looked down at her massive bottom, which let out a low, threatening fart, warning you against choosing your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne way or another, you are royally screwed.

She looked smugly at Drezia, who was still smiling, betraying nothing of her thoughts. \"Farzaz has chosen. Better luck next time, my dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrezia said nothing. She just sat there and pumped more juicy poop into the hole. \"You stick with your family. I understand.\" But in her eyes, she said to you <i>You shouldn't have.</i> She swung her feet up onto the bench and relaxed against the corner of the outhouse, her butt still on the toilet and chugging away.

Bolen will be stinking it up really badly in a couple of minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go to our house,\" Markua said, \"Gareg is out until night and I won't be home for three hours. Not because I'll be tied up here,\" she pooped loudly, \"I just have a few more errands to run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's decided,\" Drezia said with glee, \"We'll head to your place.\" <b>SSHHHPPRROOOOOTTT SSSSHHHCCCCLLLOOORRRRRRRTTTTT SSHHHLLLLRRRRRTTTT</b> Drezia concluded her dump and got up, showing her bum to you. \"How bad is it?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't even need to look. \"Terrible,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.

She was going to punish you for what you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think my butt isn't as powerful as hers?\" she said laughing sweetly and maniacally at the same time.

That was nearly twice the size of a common male. His deep violet skin was strange for an ogre. There was even a rumour that his father was one of the giant race.

It was something Morag excelled at, and you were eager to see him in action once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds fun,\" you said, stomach grumbling, \"but do you have something I could snack on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorag turned and started walking down the hall with you following. His butt was right above you. \"There's some Boiled Newt's Eyes in the pot on the hearth. Help yourself.\" Morag turned and entered a large, box-shaped room with a bench, similar to the one at your house. The difference was that the hole in the bench was big enough for you to climb into. You watched Morag intently as he walked in. He turned around, bent his legs and sat on the bench, hands resting on his knees. He gave a good grunt and a thunderous <b>THUMP</b> of a fart left his rear. He chuckled a little. You continued on to grab some Newt's Eyes, hearing more cannon-like farts come from the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found a bowl and scooped out some eyes. \"Find them?\" Morag asked, letting out another <b>THOOMP</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" you called back. Bowl in hand, you returned to the bathroom, which already began to stink. You walked up and sat down between the ogre's massive legs, your back resting against the wood of the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorag looked down at you. \"The smell's worse down there,\" he commented, farting as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the idea,\" you replied. Morag grinned and let out another thunder strike. You enjoyed Morag's smell almost as much as your mother's, seeing as he was with you so much growing up. You had been with when he'd pooped so many times. It had become a form of entertainment and bonding for you two. And here, between this behemoth's legs as he took a dump, you felt completely safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorag's toes flexed. You put your ear to the wood behind you and heard a crackling sound. The giant was dropping his first solid. The crackling went on for several seconds before it finally stopped and the beast relaxed. A second later you heard a massive SPLAT within. Smiling, you looked up at Morag. He leaned over and looked at you. \"There's more where that came from.\" <b>THOOMP </b>More gas shook the wooden bench. You continued eating, periodically hearing thunderous flatulence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you finished your Newt's Eyes, Morag said \"Another's coming.\" You saw his toes flex and you quickly put you ear back to the bench. The crackling was much louder this time, but was slower. You looked up, seeing Morag with his teeth clenched. \"Grrrrrr, this one's dry,\" he growled. The crackling increased in intensity and speed. It ended after about ten seconds, and Morag relaxed once again, releasing gas in triumph. The thud you heard from within the toilet was substantial. \"Stings,\" he said. He looked between his legs to make sure you were still alright. You gave him a thumbs up, and he proceeded with his dump. The smell was getting intense, but that made it all the more enjoyable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant above you broke wind like clockwork, the sound like the pounding of a drum. He scratched his belly every now again, but otherwise stayed as still as a statue. After a while you heard an ominous rumble from his stomach. He chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a big one,\" you commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis toes flexed once more and he winced a little. \"Oh yes,\" he said, letting an earth shattering burst of flatulence out, \"it's <i>big</i>.\" You put your ear to the wood again and heard a steady crackling. It didn't sound big, but then again, you weren't the mighty beast on the toilet pushing it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorag opened his legs wide, leaned forward, and bore down. His giant loincloth and genitals landed on you. You pushed them away and backed off from the bench. \"Careful,\" Morag growled, \"I'm going to need those tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up and saw the beast's massive gut and face directly over you. His fists were clenched and a look of effort in his eyes. He was growling deep in his chest, and the crackling from his butt was audible without you having your ear on the bench. For a whole minute you two were like that. You lying back and looking up, Morag bent over you forming a roof with his gut, looking at you through a mask of effort. \"Hehe,\" he rumbled, clearly enjoying the experience overall. Then you saw his fat belly starting to flex, and he was breathing hard. The crackling increased in intensity. Then the monster of a load finally slipped out of the beast's ass with a loud <b>SSHHHLOOOOKK</b>, leaving Morag to sigh in relief. The whole bathroom shook as the turd hit the bottom of the pit. Morag was smiling proudly down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathed in deep. \"It smells rank down here,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorag leaned back onto the seat, scratching his substantial manhood. \"As it should be,\" he rumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to teach me that trick sometime. That thing you did with your belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed a little. \"It's an old ogre belly technique, great trick for getting the big stuff out. I'm surprised your own father never taught you it.\" <b>THWOOOOMP</b>. He chuckled at another burst of gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then...</span></div></div>",

He walked towards the bandit, who was completely paralyzed with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we have here?\" the beast rumbled, \"A thief? Come to steal from <i>my </i>family? While I am taking a dump in the presence of a guest?\" He picked the bandit up with one hand, pressing the intruder to his massive, soft belly.

You knew what Morag intended to do. Granted, it was well within an ogre's rights to eat unwelcome visitors on his or her property, but most considered the practice outdated, and turned intruders in to the proper authorities. But Morag was old-fashioned. You didn't want to see what he was about to do. To you, it was as good as murder.

Well we'll just have to rectify that, then, won't we?\" He carried the bandit over to the bench and gently lowered him into the toilet's opening. The bandit seemed disgusted and frightened, but grateful that he wouldn't be killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant turned around. You were right below him, and got more than an ample view of his rear and underparts. With a great sigh, he bent his legs and settled his colossal rear back onto the seat. \"Ahhhh,\" he sighed, releasing a bombardment of flatulence and farts. There was some rapid crackling followed by a SPLAT. The bandit cried \"Ow!\" causing you two to laugh. \"I'd avoid the solids if I were you,\" Morag said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

I think I'm running out here,\" Morag said. \"Hrrg.\" <b>THOOMP</b> He grunted hard and several more booming farts echoed in the toilet. <b>THOOMP THUMP THOOOMP</b>. Then there was audible crackling again. \"Hehe, you may want to dodge <i>this </i>one, thief.\" You heard a scuffling of feet. Morag gave a good push and there was a banging sound as his turd hit the bottom. He let out some more ass gas before standing, causing you to scurry out of the way. He reached into the toilet and retrieved the now-filthy bandit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe and you both left the hot and smelly bathroom. \"Go have a seat at the table. I'll make something more substantial for us both once I put the rat out.\" He shot the bandit a glance and started walking down the hall to the front door. You watched them warily. You were hoping that Morag would just do as he said and put the bandit out. You figured that Morag wouldn't eat something covered in dung, but you knew from many a morning and evening spent with him taking a dump that he ate some pretty strange things. You proceeded to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorag opened the front door, and brought the bandit close to his face. \"The only reason,\" he said with utter wrath, \"that you are still breathing is that there's a little guy in the house.\" The bandit was utterly terrified. \"If I ever see you in this swamp again, you will suffer a very slow and <i>very </i>painful death. Got that?\" The bandit nodded vigorously. \"Good. Now run.\" He set the bandit on the ground and watched him scurry away. Morag slammed the door and returned to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You let him go, right?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and I think he won't be returning.\" You smiled in gratitude. \"Now, how about gnome flesh for brunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brightened up, but asked \"Are you sure? I mean, I remember what happened to your bowels last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waved a hand. \"Only the best for a guest. Besides, it wasn't <i>that </i>bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to dispute that but Morag wouldn't take no for an answer. You settled down and ate, thinking about the effect it would have on your own bowels later. Morag still had gas which he released periodically throughout the meal. When you two were finished, you wondered what was taking Bolen so long to get home. \"They'll be along,\" the beast at the table reassured you. He belched loudly. \"I'm going to nap while this stuff digests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll join you,\" you said. You followed Morag to the bedroom. The bed itself was massive, as it had to support two bigger than average ogres. There was a crater-like groove where Morag slept, and overall his side of the room was not clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat down on the bed. He picked you up and lay down, gently resting you on his mountainous gut. The flesh was warm and his hands around you were like a blanket. Resting your head, you heard the churning of his stomach, which lulled you to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up...</span></div></div>",

He just was nervous about doing it in front of females. Especially your mother, who, though kind to him, always intimidated him with her extrovertedness and rock steady attitude.

She and you were getting desperate, but she looked at Bolen and asked \"What's the matter, Bolen? Haven't you relieved yourself with a female before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned at her wittiness, then saw something in her eye twitch. \"We'll have to do it,\" she said, \"are you in or out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh,\" Bolen wasn't given another moment.

It answered with a SPRRRT. \"Enjoy yourselves.\" And then he departed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, your friend and your naked mother adjourned to the bathroom to do the unmentionable. She lifted the seat up, so the hole was revealed and became more like a deep trough. Your mother hoisted herself up, making sure her bum was well over the opening. You stripped off your boxers and sat to her right, while your friend, with some trepidation, removed his loincloth and sat on her left. She eyed his genitals. \"Very respectable for your age, Bolen,\" she said with a motherly smile.

You are about 17 years old in dragon years and liked to explore the country, meeting new animals and creatures for the sole purpose of playing a hilarious prank on them. Right now, you were calmly flapping your wings over a mucky swamp, looking for a certain character to help you in your quest. His name was Qwazo, and he was a sloppy black ogre living within the swamp. You find Qwazo's filthy house and land right next to it, being careful you didn't step in any of his dung piles. Qwazo always used the bathroom outside of his house and didn't have a running toilet in his home.<br>\r\n\"Hey! Qwazo!\" you shout out.<br>\r\nYou bang your snout on one of Qwazo's windows, expecting him to open it and reveal himself to you.<br>\r\n\"Qwazo, you in there? Come on! I'm gonna take you on that cruise in the skies I was talking about!\"<br>\r\nQwazo eventually opened up his door and walked outside. Qwazo was wearing a pair of dirty green shorts, but the first thing you saw was his stout belly. He was scratching it with his left hand and yawning loudly, revealing a set of yellow teeth.<br>\r\n\"What man? I was having a beauty rest!\"<br>\r\n\"...There's no way in hell you can get beautiful.\" you respond.<br>\r\n\"This coming from a dragon who's date-less.\"<br>\r\nQwazo passed gas for a very long time before he sniffed the rancid odor and fanned it away.<br>\r\n\"Nice one.\" you say, flatly.<br>\r\n\"Hey, you know the food I eat doesn't react to my bowels perfectly! Why else do you think I fart so much?!\"<br>\r\n\"To torture me?\"<br>\r\n\"NO! ...Well, yeah.\" Qwazo laughed.<br>\r\n\"Just shut up and get on my back so we can go, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking off from Qwazo's dirty house, something delays you from getting to the new location.</span></div></div>",

You stretch your wings wide, then with a powerful downward beat take off directly upwards into the air. Qwazo clings on tighter now - you know he's never been a good flier. You start flapping your wings, circling above Qwazo's hovel a few times. \"Man, it doesn't look any better from above, Qwazo!\" You laugh and fly off towards a small human village you know, where you'll be able to find plenty of folk to play pranks on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before you're even halfway there, all of a sudden, you feel a grumbling in your stomach and a pressure in your butt. Damn, after complaining to Qwazo, now YOU need to fart! You don't want him to say anything, so you try to hold it in, flying onwards gritting your teeth. But after a couple of minutes you know you can't hold it anymore - you let rip with a monstrous dragon fart! You can hear Qwazo start laughing on your back. \"Damn, Tenrow! I thought there was to be no farting on this flight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to tell him to shut up, when another even bigger fart blasts its way out! This one's a real hurricane, and the force of it blows you way off course! You plummet through the clouds with Qwazo shouting on your back about your lack of flying skills, and before your know it you're lost - you look down and everything seems unfamiliar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon me!\" You grin as you apologise a little too late, but you know Qwazo loves to hear a good fart anyway. \"But more importantly, I think we've gone off course.

This place wasn't as dirty or smelly as the swamp, but there was this odd fog hovering in the air that was hovering over the ground and covering your feet.<br>\r\n\"I think I've heard of this place before.

Qwazo examined some of the creatures by picking them up by the ears and staring at them from his point of view. Some of the creatures were actually very mysterious, ranging from rabbits to rats and scorpions to jack-elopes. In fact, one of them wound up snapping at Qwazo in the face.<br>\r\n\"OW!! You damn scorpion! Take this!\"<br>\r\nQwazo placed the tiny brown creature near the seat of his pants and he let loose and foul, wet fart. It sounded like water blowing out of a trumpet and Qwazo was pretty sure he crapped his shorts. The scorpion abruptly stopped moving and you were pretty sure the smelly fart killed it.<br>\r\n\"WHEW!! How do ya like them stinky apples?!\" shouted Qwazo, inhaling his anal expulsion.<br>\r\nOf course, just as he was done sniffing his flatulence, he stepped onto a thick bumpy tail. Connected to that tail was a crunchy brown body with two gigantic pincers on the end. It was another scorpion...a GIANT scorpion to be more like it. And it probably wasn't too happy that you just killed a fellow scorpion.<br>\r\n\"Ooooohhh...crap.\"</span></div></div>",
