After 11 months of intense fighting across the globe, those who had survived gathered in Neo-Hong Kong for the final battle and a chance at grasping glory for their colony. One such champion was Neo-Sweden's Allenby Beardsley, though she had little interest in glory. Orphaned as a child, the young woman had been taken in and raised by Neo-Sweden's military in the hopes of grooming her into a champion Gundam Fighter by any means necessary. Regular tests and training had molded Allenby into a nearly undefeatble warrior. Although only 17, she was one of the most dangerous humans alive. Perhaps her only weakness was her loneliness. Allenby, like any normal person, had never imagined this sort of life for herself. She received no love from the military and was treated as little better than spare parts. Perhaps the closest thing she had to a friend was Professor Behluima. Even that was little comfort as the man was responsible for the Berzerker System, a brainwashing control system that turned Allenby into a raging beast for quick wins and fights. Her luck had changed though recently. She'd become friends with Domon Kasshu, one of the mightiest competitors in this year's fight and current holder of the King of Hearts title. Through him, she'd also come into contact with his 4 Shuffle Alliance allies and Rain Mikamura, Domon's female assistant. Rain occasionaly showed a dislike for Allenby, as if she was worried the younger girl was going to drag Domon away from her. Allenby would privately admit she was at least a bit smitten with Domon, though wished Rain no ill....though she had occasionly wondered what would happen if Rain wasn't a factor...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Allenby, it was just another day. She had no fights scheduled for that day so the scientists, as usual, had decided to use the time to test new theories for increasing Allenby's performance. The first on the agenda was a radical growth hormone injection. Neo-Sweden's team had noted that at least three of the competitors in this years finals- Neo-Russia, Neo-Canada, and Neo-Greece, boasted superiour muscular structure. Allenby had already managed to defeat Neo-Russia thanks to her Berzerker System, but the team weren't taking any chances. Allenby wasn't weak but the strength of the three highlighted competitors was beyond human. To combat this, the scientists had created an advanced growth hormone which would be fed into Allenby during combat, greatly increasing her muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllenby stood in a center of a lab, clad in her blue, red and white Mobile Trace suit. The body tight suit showed off her body to great effect. Had Allenby lived a normal life, she'd have no trouble finding a boyfriend. Injected into her body at various places were a series of transparent tubes, designed to feed the hormones into her. She sighed \"I wonder what Domon's doing...\"<br>\r\n\"Begin the test!\" shouted the lead scientist, a rather cold and uncaring man Allenby greatly despised. The order was followed by the clattering of keyboards and Allenby watched as the fluid travelled through the tubes to her awaiting body. She winced as she felt the fluid begin to enter her system.<br>\r\nResults showed quickly. Allenby screamed as the muscles of her body swelled, further accenting her already stunning body. Despite the girls pain, the scientists appeared overjoyed- their theory was apparently a success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, something went wrong<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllenby's body shot up in size, the muscles appearing to vanish as the rest of her body caught up to this unnatural factor. She slowly returned to how she looked before the experiment, only several times larger and still growing. Her MT suit was luckily managing to keep up with the growth due it's stretchiness. Some of the scientists started to run off in fear as Allenby's growth started to stop at a height of...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Allenby's growth halted at a size of fifteen feet. The straps on the table snapped just before the climax, as Allenby collapsed to the floor. The pain was immense, and her nerves still throbbed with massive amounts of tingling all over. Gasping for breath, the more curious scientists began doing bodily tests on her, measuring her pupil dilation, trying to return her to a state of complete consciousness. Within a few moments, Allenby began to open her eyes, looking around to the world around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... Why... Hey, you're smaller, what..\" She began, as a headache whiplash came into effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She seems okay, but she can't pilot a gundam like this. Get to work on finding out what happened,\" The lead scientist said, ignoring the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean I can't pilot,\" she said, sitting up. Vertigo began to settle in, as she slouched back against the table. She nearly was as tall as they were, but sitting?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reverse it, do something. I don't want excuses, I want results,\" he continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reverse what?\" Allenby asked, finally standing up. Then it all clicked, noticing how tiny everyone was. She wasn't entirely stupid to think that the world had all shrunk equally. She was fifteen feet tall, although she'd just roughly guess this. A sense of freedom, liberation, began to sweep over her. Not from some inbred desire to be powerful, or some goddess, but instead, she was no longer their plaything. \"I guess I can't pilot a gundam like this. I'm going to the arcade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral scientists began to lobby their protest, stating quite numerically a list of reasons involving public relations, unknown side effects, potential mishaps, public frenzy, the fact she was still only wearing her MT suit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for bringing that up. I'm sure I can find a long dress that'll do nicely for a skirt somewhere,\" she said, preparing to leave the room. \"Then i can show Domon!\"</span></div></div>",

Her head soon enough brushed the ceiling, forcing her to sit down on the ground and curl up her knees as her growth finally stopped at a staggering 40 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess pilot was simply floored by this recent endeavor. Despite the pain she felt from growing, it did feel somewhat nice to see these results. She then examined the lab all around her, which didn't look quite so big anymore..and it was a pretty big lab! Even at this moment in time Allenby still thought about Domon...but also, at the same time, about her duties as a Gundam pilot as well. But what good would a Gundam do to her now? She was several times way too big to fit into hers; heck, if she were to grow some more, she would be strong enough to fight without any weapons at all! It's possible that she could grow to make any Gundam look downright puny in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not going to get much done here\", Allenby said to herself as she punched out one of the walls around the lab, slowly making her way to the hallway and beyond, hoping that she wouldn't grow any more until she at least got outside. The reactions she got from other people in the building were priceless, a few even making her smile at their expressions. Maybe being big wouldn't be so bad after all..</span></div></div>",

They told her that her muscles would grow, but they didn't mention any possible side effects, much less growing to the size of a giantess. It sure didn't help that many of them were either running away from her or were speechless as she kept looking for someone to talk to, feeling very frustrated at her inability to talk to someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I'm going to do this the hard way\", Allenby told herself as she grabbed a near-by scientist by force and lifted him up straight to her eye level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, what's going on? Why am I so big?!\" she demanded of the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well...you see..\", he began, fearful of the 45 foot giantess in front of him. \"In the beginning we simply wanted to increase your muscle and perhaps your height by a few inches. Maybe to, say, 6 feet or so. But somehow we were a little off with the calibrations during the testing process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little!?\" Allenby fumed. \"I'm 45 feet tall! 8 feet would be a little; <i>this</i> is humongous! I assume you know of a way to fix it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at the current moment. But we're soon going to start finding a cure for your gigantic size..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how long will that take!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....a few months, a year, several years...who knows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? You have to be kidding m...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Allenby could continue talking to the man, she started shooting up high in the air once more, now at the 70 foot mark. Once again her suit keeping up with her growth, Allenby found an already cramped room now impossible just to sit down in (even with her whole body wrapped up), and soon enough found herself smashing her way to the outside world. When she finally did get out, stand up, and brushed herself off, the already tall giantess was now an amazing 90 feet tall!</span></div></div>",

Through a window of the central palace, the acting monarch Relena Peacecraft took in the breathtaking view. It had be a dramatic year for the girl, bringing a wave of confusion and sadness and ultimately sweeping her to this destination. Finely discovering her birthrite, Relena had chosen to rebuild the once destroyed kingdom and make it a beacon of peace in a chaotic era. But this was not easily done...the drums of war cried loudly and each day, she knew that war may eventually arrive on their doorstep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was shaken from her thoughts by a knock on the door. \"Come in\". The door was opened, revealing Lucrezia Noin, Relena's acting advisor. \"Princess Relena\", she bowed before continuing, \"I bring a report of the highest urgency...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes later, the pair stood in a secret hangar gazing at a mysterious machine, being worked by a small team of mechanics. \"What in the world is this?\" asked Relena. \"We're not sure\", replied Noin, \"One of my scouting teams claimed it from a Romafeller convoy quite close to our border\". \"A scouting team?\" questioned Relena, alarmed, \"Ms Noin, are you engaging in combat within our very own borders?\" \"I fully understand your misgivings, Princess Relena, but please note this is simply a small defence team I have mustered to keep us safe. The world is at war and not everyone is as open to words of peace as us\". Relena frowned and lowered her head. Noin's worlds held an uncomfortable truth. Despite their best efforts, were they just fooling themselves that peace could be obtained?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelena walked a path around the mysterious machine. An unwelcome shape gazed back at her \"This looks like a cannon...\". Suddenly, a rising hum filled the air. \"WATCH OUT!\", yelled a mechanic, \"I think I've activated its pow-\". He was cut off as a blast of green light shot out and engulfed Relena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoin watched in terror. \"PRINCESS!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quickly as it came, the light vanished. Relena was still where she had previously stood and showed no physical damage, but quickly fainted. Noin dived in and grabbed the girl before she hit the ground. She looked Relena over with concern, before turning around to the machine. \"WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?!\"  \"S-sorry, ma'am\", stammered the mechanic, \"It was-\". \"Save it\", Noin fumed, \"Luckily for us all it seems to have caused little harm to the princess\"  *Thank God*, she thought to herself, *Zechs would never forgive me if I let his sister die...*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalls for a medic were made. though directions were given for him to go to Relena's bedroom. The hangar was still supposed to remain secret and so Noin would make sure the girl was safely delivered back to her room. But suddenly, Relena's eyes opened. \"...N-Noin.?...I....what hap...\". \"Easy now\", spoke the lavender haired woman, \"There was an accident. Nothing too bad, but we're going to get you checked out\"  \"An...acci..dent....I-\". Relena was cut off as her body lurched forward and her pupils constricted. \"PRINCESS!!\", Noin screamed again, lost as to what was happening. The mysterious machine looked to be a weapon, but what kind? Relena's reaction suggested some kind of poisoning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was what happened next that truely confused Noin- Relena began to grow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow big does Relena get?</span></div></div>",

She'd taken to ocassionly wondering the halls, a minor bit of freedom she had been granted until such time as she could be transported to somewhere safer. She knew some of the officers from her youth as friends of her father...obviously they wished to return the favours he'd done them by looking out for his little girl. Those damn Coordinators! This was all their fault...she'd find some way to make them pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlay was snapped out of her thought by the sound of sparks and rambling. \"...polarise the power coupling...amplify the processor...\". A mix of curiosity and lack of anything better to do led to Flay looking into the room the noise was coming from. She saw a science officer, tinkering away at something. He hadn't noticed her presence, apparently too involved with his work. \"There, that should do it! Watch out, you freaks, things are gonna get nasty for you!\". No sooner had his rant ended, he spun around to face Flay \"Identify yourself!!\". Flay was taken aback but quickly tried to do as ordered \"F-Flay Allster..I-I'm-\". The stranger cut her off, his face changing to a look of suprised joy \"The Allster girl?...PERFECT!\". Even though he appeared to be a genuine officer, the man's erratic behaviour was scaring Flay. She thought it best to flee but before she could do that he addressed her again- \"You miss your father, don't you?\". The words struck her heart like a knife. Although the grief constantly swirlled through her head, no one had really spoken to her about it. Not the Archangel crew nor the Alliance officers who had taken her under their care. To have someone actually ask her about it.....She fell to her knees, her head facing down \"Yes\".<br>\r\nThe officer stepped closer, resting a hand on her shoulder \"There there...I know how you must feel. It wasn't long ago those freaks cost me family too...my mother and brother, killed by those abominations from space!\". He took his other free hand and raised her head by the chin, his eyes softly piercing hers \"But I have invented a way to get revenge. For me, for you...for everyone who was served injustice by those Coordinators....but I need your help\".<br>\r\n\"M-My help?\", Flay responded. \"Yes\", explained the officer, \"since they love those oversized wind up toys made in the image of man so much, I thought \"Why not one up them?\" Why attack with a giant in the image of a human...when you could create giant humans\". He walked back to his desk and picked up the device he had been working on \"This machine can make any human being gigantic, easily a match for ZAFT's mobile suits....in theory. Those fools signing the cheques haven't given me the allowances I need to test it as I would wish. That is why I ask for your help, Ms Allster. We are kinderate spirits. We can understand the pain those freaks cause and why they must be wiped out at any cost. You are young and thus your injustice is greater. If you help me and the test works, you will become a juggernaut, easily able to wipe out scores of Coordinators in seconds. Will you help me...please?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It sounded like crazy talk. A device that makes people giant sized? But if true...Flay considered the possibilities, her near insanity being tempted further. She hated her lack of power. Her inability to save her father. The way the Alliance officers ordered her around. The fact she had had to manipulate a Coordinator instead of being able to do something herself. But if she was a giant, that would all change. No one could order her around or hurt her and she could easily protect whoever she wanted...and the Coordinators would soon be nothing more than dark history.<br>\r\nFlay's eyes met the officers, fierce determination burning in them. \"I will do it\".<br>\r\nThe officer clasped his hands togethor \"Thank you, Ms\", he sighed wistfully, \"The experiment will need to be done here, I'm afraid. Should the other officers see us they will foolishly try and stop us. A mere lab is a small price to pay for justice\". He began to set the device up in front of Flay. It resembled a large TV studio camera. \"My invention will fire a ray at you, starting the growth proccess. As you are a young lady, I will reassure you your dignity- the device is designed to make clothes grow too. May I say, your choice of outfit is perfect\". He referred to the uniform Flay was wearing, the same one she'd had since the started service back on the Archangel. For a military uniform it was rather eye catching, something that had only helped her initial schemes to win over Kira Yamato to repay for his sins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the device stood ready. Tension in the air was thick. The rewards should the test work were most tantalising for Flay, but should they fail...well, she hadn't been told.<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" the officer asked. Flay nodded. \"Good luck, Ms Allster\". He fired up the machine and a beam of green light headed straight for Flay, covering her in a similar aura. For a few seconds nothing seemed to happen...then it began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a steady increase in speed, the world around Flay grew smaller and smaller. What had once been an average teenage girl began consuming more and more space. Flay had been an earlier bloomer and her increasing size only accented the curves which had made the crush of so many on Heliopolis. True to the officer's word, her clothes were keeping up.<br>\r\nAs she continued to grow, the room felt the effects- tables and shelves were pushed aside, chairs and smaller items were crushed. Flay felt that clashes but they were next to nothing to her. She could also feel how powerful she was getting...it was perfect!</span></div></div>",

That should do for now\", spoke the overjoyed officer, \"This is wonderful!\". He moved to turn the machine off, hinting a switch...a red light began beeping in response. \"What? NO! Stupid machine, switch off!\". He began trying any number of button combinations. All the while, the ray continued out and Flay continued to grow. She took minor notice of the events, puzzled as to why the growth had not stopped as said but far from unhappy. The man continued to franticly work at the machine, paying her no attention which seemed almost impossible. Was he more concerned about his precious invention then her?....He'd lied. He was no different then all the others. As these thoughts entered her head, she finally met with the limits of the room. Still growing she began to burst through the walls and ceiling, her shapely form plowing through concrete and steel as though it were paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis finally drew the attention of the insane officer. He spun around, screeching frantic nonsense. Flay payed him no mind as her growth continued to rock the room. Parts of the ceiling gave way, one burying the officer and his prized invention as Flay finally burst out of the building, her growth now stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Flay do?</span></div></div>",

She was asked to test it out during the battle that she and the others were going to be launching into.

Since her mission was to test the device, Fa pressed the button without much concern. Once the 'Yes' was pressed, the letters disappeared and in place of that, her cockpit was glowing purple !

The 26 year old strategist was hard at work on planning the next wave of interventions to be undertaken. But something troubled her. Even with the aid of Veda, the quantum super computer at the very heart of Celestial Being, she was having difficulty creating this new strategy. She'd been at it for ages and still no real progress. There had to be something else she could do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she remembered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe full virtual reality immersion system was a rarely used part of the Veda system. It had last been used during the training of the four Meisters and at that time had shown slight curiousities. But Ian had been working on it since, so surely by now it would be fine.<br>\r\nHer plan was simple- she could use the system to personally run through her draft with the strategy. Seeing it in action would then allow her to better understand where she was going wrong and eliminate the problem.<br>\r\nFrom her desk she produced a slim visor, the means of entering the VR system. She was thankful she was allowed this courtesy, not particularly wishing to leave her room at this time. Making herself comfortable on her bunk, she placed the visor on her face and activated it. She began to drift off slightly as the system began...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the Veda System. Please provide Security ID and Password\"<br>\r\n\"Security ID  SUM0079, Password Tequilla\"<br>\r\n\"Authourisation accepted. Welcome, Sumeragi Lee Noriega. Assigned task?\"<br>\r\n\"Activate the Intervention Trial Programme and load Intervention Plan 3987. I want to test it\"<br>\r\n\"Very good, Miss. Loading Intervention Plan 3987. Assigned Gundams: GN-001 Exia, GN-003 Kyrios and....and....and...and...\"<br>\r\nSumeragi was concerned. Not a glitch! This was the last thing she needed...<br>\r\n\"and...and....searching.....alternative source found...Continuing to load Intervention Trial Programme\"<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a great flash...when it cleared, Sumeragi was in the virtual world. The level of technology was so advance that the world before her was nearly indistinguishable from reality. The landscape, the rush of air...even herself had been recreated perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched as over the horizon Exia and Kyrios appeared. But no Virtue. That was odd, the system had said it had found an alternate source so where was it?...It then struck her that the two Gundams looked different. Not as large as she expected. In fact, everything looked a little small...<br>\r\nThat's when it hit her.<br>\r\nThe alternate source replacing the gigantic third Gundam....was her!</span></div></div>",

System normal\"<br>\r\n\"Me at King Kong size isn't normal!\" she growled in response<br>\r\n\"System normal\" the computer repeated again.<br>\r\nSumeragi sighed. \"Fine, whatever.

If this problem persists, please contact your assigned Veda system administrator\"<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response. The stress was unusual. Computer glitches were common three centuries ago but modern technology was far more advanced. Veda was the peak of this, possesing near human interface. To see an element of it behave so poorly...she let out another deep sigh. Sometimes life really seemed to hate her.<br>\r\nShe pondered her next step. Despite classifying her as Virtue, the system had merely created her at its height of 60ft tall. Other than that her measurements were her own and she wore her usual blue and white attire. It was an odd feeling, being so big....Oh, sure, she'd been 'big' since her late teens but this was something different. She wondered how her old friend Billy would react if he ever saw her like this, his favourite lady now the size of a mobile suit...she laughed at the idea and then sighed a liitle again. Thankfully none of this was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst she had pondered, the two artificial Gundams had reached their target- a military base. She watched as the pair skillfully destroyed all resistance, the system using data logs of the Meister's past battles to determine how they would most likely act. This was a living, breathing world, running exactly like the real one...the one she needed to get back to. The system had told her the only way to achieve that was for the simulation to run its course. If she helped, that would come quickly....but at the same time, her natural desire to procrastinate made her wonder what else she could do here with her new size...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind was up. She began to walk,her massive white high heels making the ground shake with every step as she...</span></div></div>",

Surely between that and the simulations she could quickly resolve this issue. Her titanic stride quickly enabled her to reach the simulated military base and with a comical cry of \"Gundam Sumeragi, Launching!\" she lept into the fray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the Gundams she lacked weapons, but her sheer size and strength made up for that. She took mighty strides, getting quite into her role. Below, smaller base vehicles swerved to miss her feet as she marched. One barely managed, scraping past her shoe as it swerved. \"HEY!\" she called down, \"Watch the merchandise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few strides away stood the radar tower, one of the key installations necessary to complete the intervention. It would be an easy task to lay into the building and damage it herself. The way was clear, with all the MS seemingly busy fighting the Gundams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, a team of 8 Enacts marched into view and blocked her path \"Freeze, Gundam scum!\" the enemy commander demanded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumeragi sighed. \"One way or another, I always suffer for AEU stratagies...\" she grimly commented. At least this was just a simulation. A game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered how 8 Enacts would do against her at this scale. Granted she wasn't really a fighter. Though maybe there was something she could use to even the odds. She looked around for something...something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when her eyes fell on him- a group troop who had seemingly been cut off from his fellow troops. An idea struck her....she had never been keen on the idea of using hostages in war, but as she'd already resolved this was effectively a game.

The Enacts weren't going to give her the chance to ponder it- they began swooping in, attacking from various angles like vultures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!

The daughter of deceased Gundam Meister pilots, she had spent her life raised within the highly secretive Celestial Being organization. This extended even to family members, meaning Felt knew little of even her own parents. From what little she did know, she had chosen to continue their legacy as a technical operator. As of 2307, she was stationed on the carrier ship Ptolemaios at the dawn of Celestial Being's global intervention campaign. However, even if Celestial Being was now publically active this did not mean that testing and research was not still being conducted...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelt proceeded down one of the many narrow corridors of the ship, propelled by a hand rail. She wore her usual casual attire, an odd almost catsuit-like get up with long gloves and boots. Unknown to Felt, she was being watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a far away facility, two shadowy Celestial Being officials watched a security camera feed of Felt from within a lab.<br>\r\n\"So this is the subject?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's her. A daughter of two of our most promising and talented Gundam Meisters. Tests indicate she has the potential to match and possibly exceed her parents in all fields\"<br>\r\n\"So you assume this would make her a strong candidate for Leviathan?\"<br>\r\n\"Quite so. She's also been raised within the perfected environment of the organization. A trait the lack of which makes certain other potential candidates less desirable\"<br>\r\n\"I agree. Even our current Gundam Meisters are showing a questionable lack of clarity. The sooner we can address that setback the better\"<br>\r\n\"I have your approval, then?\"<br>\r\n\"As much as needed. Leviathan is needed now more than ever\"<br>\r\n\"Very well. I shall give the word to our trusted operative...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelt reached her destination, the mess hall of the Ptolemaios. It was empty, the rest of the crew either attending to duties or in their quarters. She just taken her meal and sat down when the Gundam Meister Tiera Erde. Much like herself, the androgynous young man seemed to have a long history with Celestial Being though he never spoke of it. When he did speak, his words often isolated the crew of the Ptolemaios and his fellow Meisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly for a loner such as Tiera, he sat straight across from her. \"Felt Grace\", he began in his usual style. \"Tiera...\", responded Felt, herself not much for talk. \"I wish to congratulate you\", the purple haired male continued, \"Whilst some other operatives are showing such poor performance, you continue to perform all that is asked of you. If more of our operatives mirrored yourself, I have no doubt the plan would be on schedule. Let me thank you\".<br>\r\nHe stood up and placed a hand on her shoulder, managing to knock over the cup Felt had been drinking from. \"Forgive me\", he apolagised, mopping up the mess with a serviette, \"I'll get you a replacement\". Felt remained silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Felt, the knocking over of her cup had been quite less than accidental. Tiera had planned the whole thing. Off in the corner he spiked the new drink with a green liquid, the work of a Celestial Being project code named Leviathan. The green mixture swirled around briefly, before fading and slipping into the base liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go\", announced Tiera, setting the new drink before Felt. \"Please forgive my clumsiness. I'd keep you company but I have a mission report to finish\". And with that he slipped away. Felt briefly thought the whold incident quite odd but let it go and returned to her meal.

Nature had even gifted her with amazing looks and a cunning mind. But no matter the luxury she enjoyed, it was simply never enough for the young heiress. She always desired more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWang's status had led to her being scouted as an agent of the formerly secret Celestial Being. The organization had many such agents, but Wang was one of their most frequent allies. This was partly due to the sheer amount of resources she possessed but also because she wished it to be that way. Amazing though they may be, Celestial Being was nothing more to her than a pawn in the global chess game she was playing to control humanity's future. Armed intervention, Gundams..it was meaningless to her. But one item in particular had a greater use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe secret to Celestial Being's power were the GN Drives and the GN Particles they produced. The abilities of these particles seemed to be near infinite, though Celestial Being seemed to have little interest in exploring these avenues. Wang Liu-Mei was not so foolish. Whilst it would be impossible to steal one of the five GN Drives at this juncture, the technology existed to save the particles for later use- GN Condensors. The staff of Celestial Being may have consisted of spurned dreamers, but they weren't all noble. In the face of trying to change the whole world, it was a simple matter to bribe a no name technician to fill up a spare Condensor for her use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat Condensor was now safely stored in her mansion. The key to unlock greater power for herself over the rest of the world. Gundams were one thing, but the possibilities of combining GN Particles with living matter...she had heard scant whispers of the concept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was, which avenue to pursue?</span></div></div>",

Again, her vast wealth ensured they kept quiet on the affair. Besides, if the technology worked it'd be very easy to 'silence' them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was some months later that Wang was informed that the tests had been a success. Entering a secret sub basement below her current residence, she was ushered down to a strange chamber. The small team of scientists stood within making final checks. \"Mistress!\", began the lead scientist, \"How honoured I am to inform you of our triumph\". \"I would expect nothing less\", replied Wang, \"I have no time for failures\". The cutting remark was common of the young lady, a constant reminder of how she viewed herself. \"I take it this chamber creates the desired effect?\" \"Yes, Mistress.  The chamber is able to modulate the incredible particles to induce size reduction. We've had perfect success with inanimate objects\" He held up his proof- a tiny chair and car (which Wang recognised as one of the many gathering dust in her personal garage). \"All that remains is testing on a human subject\". \"Well now\", Wang grinned, \"No time like the present\"  \"Mistress?\" asked the scientist, somewhat concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the push of a button the chamber sealed shut, trapping the scientists within. \"Mistress, what are you doing?! Wang Liu Mei, answer me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlanked by Hong Long, Wang headed for the control panel. \"You were following the development closely?\" she asked, already knowing the answer. \"Yes, Mistress\" replied Hong Long. \"Begin activation sequence at maximum\". Her bodyguard looked uneasy \"Liu Mei-\"  \"I gave you an order. Do as you're told\". Hong Long nodded, his momentary spurt of courage quickly ended. The chamber began to glow, an initially green form of light changing instead to white. Through the glass windows that surrounded its edges the form of the scientists quickly diminished downwards until finally fading. Its task done, the chamber switched off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWang grinned again. \"A complete success\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the loose ends tied up, it was time to explore the machines usage. Luckily there was no shortage of staff within her service. But who to pick?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Seventeen and in the prime of her youth, Louise Halevy studied aerospace engineering overseas with her boyfriend Saji Crossroad. As much as she tries to get him to only pay attention to her, though, she occasionally sees her boyfriend eyeing other girls, which annoyed her greatly and resulted in her pulling his ear whenever he did so. Louise wished there was a way Saji would pay attention to her and only her..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo one day when walking a walk, Louise comes across a stand run by a single guy on the sidewalk. The only item the man was selling were a bunch of bottles with clear liquid in them. They looked more like water bottles than anything else. She picks up one of the bottles and notices some writing on it, which she begins to read out loud:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill make you a big target for the person in your life!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouise was confused by this. Was it an enhancer of some kind? Whatever it was it didn\u2019t interest her, and she put the bottle back on the table. As she prepared to walk away the man arose from his seat and started shouting to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy lady, that is not SIMPLY a water bottle you held! It can make you grow taller!\u201d Louise seemed intrigued by this and rushed back over. After all, it was the future, a time where people could travel in trains in space in zero-g. Could this truly be something that would make Saji notice her more? She decided to buy one of the bottles and head back to her place. Too excited to wait, she started to drink the bottle\u2019s content and quickly, right in front of the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a great drink\u201d, she smiled to the man. \u201cBut I don\u2019t feel anything yet..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh ,you will\u201d, the man said, laughing under his breath. Louise didn\u2019t hear him as she ran back home. As she did, she called Saji and told him to meet her at her living quarters. He reluctantly agreed, not wanting to be chewed out by his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Louise was back home, having enjoyed her walk around the neighborhood. She looked down at her body and didn't notice any differences yet. She then began to sigh. However, as Louise looked at her hands, she felt something strange circulating her entire body. The girl then stood still and started to sweat, wondering if she was coming down with something. She ran quickly to a nearby bathroom and looked at herself in the mirror. As she did her feet and legs were slowly starting to grow, the first part of her body to start growing. The man was right: the bottle's contents WAS making her grow! Scared of her towering height, Louise ran out of the bathroom, accidentally knocking her head on the bathroom ceiling as she did so. By this point her legs were now almost 7 feet long, and both her feet were at least 3 feet long, though the rest of her body had not yet grown in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer next growth happens shortly after leaving the bathroom: her hair. Louise always admired her long, blonde hair, but now it was getting so long Louise couldn't even see since her hair was covering up her face. Her hair grew until it was at least 9 feet long, touching the ground and rolling on it like a carpet. Her next growth was her hands, which grew in three short, but fast, spurts until they were about 6 times their normal height. Her arms then began to grow unwieldy, growing so long and so fast Louise couldn't even see her hands on either arm after they finally stopped growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was her chest, which grew in spurts of 30 cm a second until they were 6 times their normal height. Her butt was the next thing to grow, growing in the same manner as her chest. Her torso finally grew in height, allowing the girl to fully stand up, as opposed to having to hold on to the wall like she was doing for the last few spurts of growth. Her legs and feet continued to grow then, her legs growing until they were at least 19 or 20 feet in length, and her feet at least 6 feet long. And lastly was her head, which grew in five small spurts until it, like the rest of her body, was at least 6 times its current height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time it was all over Louise was now a little over 30 feet tall and sitting on her legs in an Indian-style manner just to stay in the hallway without cramping her body. She was thankful that no one was around to see her until she saw someone approaching. It was Saji! How should Saji react to his girlfriend\u2019s growth?</span></div></div>",

When Louise wanted something, there was little chance she could drop the notion until she'd gotten it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was for that reason that he'd headed over to her apartment. He had a ton of papers to write but feared the wrath of his forceful girlfriend if he didn't do as expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouise had entrusted him with the spare key to her living quarters, a rented apartment similar to his own that was jointly funded by the education board and Louise's family. Opening the front door, he entered. \"Louise? I'm here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering into the hallway, his eyes were treated to an unexpected sight- a giant, sock-clad foot. A similar appendage was close by, both connected to a pair of equally giant legs. He continued to follow up, seeing an ample chest and a familiar face \"Hello, Saji\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Japanese boy's eyes nearly popped out of his skull. He knew this couldn't be possible but here it was right before him- his girlfriend at gigantic size, clad in her usual attire. Her large frame filled the majority of the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActing on basic human instinct, he turned to run. But it was futile. \"Saji, you jerk!\" bellowed an upset Louise, grabbing her tiny boyfriend by the legs and pulling him towards her.

As she did so, she noticed several people closing their doors in horror, leading the girl to sadly sigh as the now 55 foot tall giantess inched her way out of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a problem, though: Louise was too big to get out. She could barely fit her arm through the front lobby, much less her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I have no choice\", she sadly sighed to herself as she broke down the front lobby with her arms, making an exit to the outside barely big enough for her to squeeze through. When Louise DID finally get outside, she stood up and stretched her whole body, relieved that she was no longer cramped up inside. She was also now 60 feet talll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where IS Seiji, anyway?\" the annoyed giantess asked herself, looking in all directions for the boy, expecting him to be bringing her a butt-load of ice cream. \"He should've been back by now.\" As Louise looked for her boyfriend, the people below her were freaking out, either running into their cars or into other buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seiiiiiiji. Where are you?\" Louise called out, hoping to spot him.</span></div></div>",

She quickly got out of traffic and headed to the sidewalk itself, grabbing hold of her boyfriend and hugging him (causing the ice cream he had from earlier to fall to the ground).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are, Saji! I was so worried about you\", the giantess exclaimed, still hugging the boy in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Louise, I've only been gone for maybe 40 minutes\", informed Saji, but she didn't care. She was just happy to see him again, long since too big for her to stay in her original living quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was quite a dilemma for the both of them. Saji already came to the conclusion long before Louise opened up her mouth that she had outgrown her apartment, so now where would she live? And who could possibly afford to feed, clothe, and look after a 60-foot tall...no wait, make that 80 foot tall now...girl? Even the growing aspect wasn't as much fun anymore; it was quite for Louise to hug Saji when she was doll size,d but now he was looking bug-sized to her.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alejandro Corner sat at his desk, sipping wine as he casually viewed confidential documents on his computer. The first stage of the long planned Corner revolution had proven a great success. He had been able to convince the world that his imitation Gundam Thrones and their Trinity sibling pilots were the next stage in Celestial Being's plan. True, the Thrones were limited by the equally imitation GN Tau Drives but he had made allowances for that. The pilots themselves were perhaps a greater issue. Eldest sibling Johann was more than capable, as well as being loyal to his mistaken belief he had been chosen for Aeolia Schoenberg's plan. But the other two...their manic unpredictability certainly helped to weaken public support for Celestial Being, but was it perhaps too much? Especially the female, Neena..... Alejandro smirked. No, it was impossible for him to miscalculate. He was so close to possesing what generations of the Corner bloodline had long waited for. Perhaps, he mused, there might even be a way to use the Trinity girl's behaviour for a manuver he doubted the intrusive Veda would ever see coming. Widening his grin, he opened a buried file...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the secret mountain base of the Thrones, a commotion was brewing. \"Brotherrrrrr~!\" \"What is it, Neena?\" replied Johann, midly annoyed. \"I'm bored! When are we going to get to doooo something?!\" \"I thought you'd recently complained we were overworked?\". An annoyed 'hmph' was all Neena offered in response before turning away. \"Don't be so hard on her, bro!\" cut in Michael, the manic middle child, \"She's got a point\". Johann pondered how much Michael actually agreed with her and how much was his sister complex showing. Regardless, it did little to change matters. \"I'm sure we'll receive new orders soon\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had Johann finished, a monitor blinked to life. Striding over, he read the incoming transmission \"It's a new mission\". \"Awesome!\", cheered Michael, \"I'll go get suited up!\" \"No\", replied Johann, \"you're not a part of this mission\" \"WHAT?! You bastards, since when was I excluded?!\"  \"You're not the only one\", continued Johann, \"These orders are exclusively for Neena\". Hearing her name, the redhead turned around \"Me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the orders, Neena proceeded alone in a distant segment of the base, so far removed she'd had to take a special underground bullet train. The area in question was normally off limits but had been opened to her following the mission briefing. The steps she was taking was in fact all the briefing had requested of her. She hadn't even changed into her pilot suit, still clad in her usual white attire. As she advanced down a long corridor she wondered just what exactly was going on.<br>\r\nThe corridor ended in a set of large doors. The metal sheets groaned apart as they registered her pressence. Inside was a gigantic barren room,similar to the hangar the Thrones were kept in but no mobile suits in sight. As she walked to the centre of the room she caught sight of a large glass panel some distance up. Behind it stood the familiar form of Laguna Harvey, head of the siblings operations. For Neena it was all finally too much. \"What the hell is going on?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neena\", began Harvey, his voice communicated through a speaker, \"I have a most important mission for you\". \"So you say\", responded a still angry Neena, having little time for such cloak and dagger manuvers. \"This is a single person mission which requires your unique talents\". Neena grinned. Now that she liked the sound of. Although she didn't personally acknowledge it, her vanity was one of her most striking features. \"So what do you need me to?\"  \"As you are aware, the Gundams are powered by GN Particles. This miracle power source can serve many roles. Some of these results are less documented than others\". His hand moved to a control panel by his side and he flipped a switch. Suddenly, a dome opened in the ceiling above and a large device descended, looking not unlike one of the Gundam's rifles. Before Neena could registed quite what was happening, the device shot a concentrated blast at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it was a beam weapon it didn't incinerate her. The light seemed to fluctuate between a rainbow of particles but keeping one element consistent- GN Particles. Was she being used as a guinea pig?! What the hell WAS going on here?! It didn't take long for an answer. The room was shrinking...no...she was growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaguna Harvey watched the transformation with some shock. As always, his orders had come from Alejandro Corner and he had then passed them on to these disposable soldiers. This most recent order had been largelly vague and now Harvey saw why. Before his eyes Neena Trinity was becoming a collosus, the young woman's form expanding to fill the considerable GN Particle lab. He wasn't sure how this would end but finally gathered enough of his senses to abort the test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe particle dowsing ended just as Neena reached the height of sixty feet tall. Harvey watched as the girl looked herself over. Was she angry? Thankfully her clothes had grown with her, so surely that would grant him some leeway, Having finished her review, Neena turned towards Harvey and shot a grin which sent a chill up his spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I understand the mission, Mr Harvey\" and with that she turned and busted out through the wall of the lab, headed for the rest of society. Harvey scrambled for his phone, furiously making an urgent call. \"Corner, Corner! She's gone rogue!\".  To his suprise, Laguna Harvey heard a soft chuckle from the other end of the phone \"Perfect...\"</span></div></div>",

I love to play!\" she shouted, her voice echoing through the streets as the titaness walked forward, eager to begin her game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose that hesitated underneath her were crushed by her idle strides, Nena not even bothering to look back at what she had done.  The little people in front of her who actually thought they could flee, they were much more interesting, and much more entertaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, you move so slow!\" she marveled.  \"I guess you can't resist being away from your goddess, huh?\"  Nena took all of this in with giggles, failing to realize that they only reason the crowds appeared so slow was because of how much distance her enlarged body could cover in a single stride.  Unfortunately for this crowd, the self-declared goddess had soon had enough at merely looking at her toys.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a speed impossible for the tiny humans on the ground to match, Nena dashed forward, scooping up a few people in one hand and smashing others into bits through her powerful strides.  The survivors all fled as quickly as they could, crowding into one area as they attempted to create as much distance between themselves and the giantess as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, this merely played into Nena's hands.  With a grin, she moved ahead of the crowd and saw groups of buildings at eye level with her.  Smirking, she pushed over the tall but frail structures with her free hand, watching as they fell right into her trap.  The crowd, caught between the rubble of the demolished structures and the sixty foot tall redhead, could only look on terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I win!\" Nena announced in a sing-song voice as she approached the crowd.  \"Since you picked the first game, it's my turn now!\"</span></div></div>",

How about...you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA random man was plucked from the crowd without warning or reason, facing down the giant Meister as she looked on, eyeing his figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look pretty strong.  Do you work out?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...yes,\" the man replied.  It was true, he did go to the gym often, and weightlifting was a hobby of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you're stronger than me?\" Nena asked, her last word spoken with a slight grit of her teeth.  Seeing the man fumble for a response, she added \"I think my little pinkie is stronger than you!  Wanna find out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man couldn't reply before a giant digit pressed onto him.  And while he struggled valiantly, the multiple tons of Nena's bodyweight proved too great for him to overcome.  In one fell swoop, he was reduced to paste with the others looking on silent, a reaction that the cruel woman did not appreciate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No clapping?  No cheering?  Oh, I get it, you want to see more!  Well seeing as I'm such a caring goddess, I'll show you another game!  Now, who to play with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more people, three men and two women, were plucked from the crowd in front of Nena.  Curiously, she eyed them, placing them on her index finger, a fragile stool for the group.  They had all but ten seconds before she announced her intention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The last one to stay on gets a prize.  The rest say hi to the ground the hard way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Nena began violently shaking her finger as two men fell to their deaths, the crowd able to do nothing for fear they might be the next participants in her little games.  Those on her finger had little to focus on besides survival, the one man finally having enough and pushing his two \"competitors\" to their deaths, watching them unceremoniously fall as Nena dropped him into the safety of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd, remembering what happened before, clapped at the deplorable sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good!\" Nena announced to the man in his hand.  \"I think you deserve a prize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A prize?\" the young man asked shaken, the T-shirt he was wearing drenched in sweat from the emotions that had overcome him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, a prize,\" Nena repeated, bending over and puckering her lips.  The man knew what she was going to do, and didn't refuse.  It felt odd, but in a good way.  Her lips were warm and soft as they explored him.  Lost in the moment, he closed his eyes and kissed the goddess back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>GULP!</i></span></div></div>",

It was his best chance of getting out of this mission without being insubordinate or revealing himself to be scared of what was essentially a giant fangirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Sumeragi shook her head at the suggestion.  \"Long range bombardment unfortunately carries with it the risk of putting civilians in danger.  Even if the target was silenced in one shot, we would face the very dangerous possibility of her falling onto the entrapped civilians and killing a mass amount.  In order to reduce civilian casualties, we need to engage the target up close, hence, the choice of Exia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetsuna was out of excuses.  But he still didn't want to commit to this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, what's wrong?\" Tiera, who had remained silent until this moment, finally asked.  \"Is the embodiment of Gundam himself scared of a mission?\"  As was common for a comment from Tieria, it cut to the core of Setsuna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mission accepted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's no need to be so formal,\" Sumeragi answered, but if that's the case, then off you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSestuna ran towards the hangar bay, with only one sentence left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will silence the target.\"</span></div></div>",

A distortion....he would destroy the distortion.<br>\r\n\"Exia, you are clear for launch!\" Christina's cheery voice sang over the comm. \"Roger\", Setsuna responded, \"GN-001 Gundam Exia, launching!\". The launch catapult quickly flung the mobile suit into the black veil of space, where it continued towards Earth's atmosphere and its target...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the city, Nena had become frustrated. \"Bored, bored, BORED!\" wailed the giant girl, stomping her feet with every word (and killing several people with every stomp). \"You worms are so pathetic! Can't anyone offer me a challenge?\". Over the last hour or so she had played any number of sick games with the tiny residents, testing her limits and flaunting her power. She'd known it would be the case anyway, but they were so fragile. None could hold up to her majesty. Those who remained alive cowered in fear, too afraid to run unless they became a target. \"You better get used to this, you trash!\". She shot a grin before continuing; \"Now that I'm large and in charge, you all belong to ME!\". She slowly stomped forward with an exagerated stride, intentionally accenting her sheer size. The tiny people trembled as they were once again reminded of the sheer unchallenged power this girl held over them. \"No one's even tried to rescue you. Your government has abandoned you. You're beyond hope now. You live under my law now and what I say goes!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if in response to this decleration, something struck Nena in the back of the neck. \"OW!!\" she cried, spinning around to locate whatever had attacked her. \"Who the fuck was that?! Show yourself, you bastard!!\". Her attacker had no intention of hiding. Hovering in the air stood the Gundam Exia, it's right arm still raised after firing a beam shot. \"Setsuna F Seiei has intercepted the target. Will proceed with the intervention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A GUNDAM?!\", Nena snarled, \"You dare challenge me? You're a wreckless bastard to be sure-\". She paused. A wreckless Gundam Meister? That sounded like...she looked again. It was! Gundam Exia. Her anger disipated, replaced with a delighted grin. \"Ooooh, so it's you! The wreckless Meister that turns me on. Did you come to worship your goddess?\". She raised a monolithic hand, moving it towards the Gundam. Setsuna's response was swift.Unfurling the GN Sword he struck at her palm before diving out of the way.<br>\r\n\"OW!!\" the giantess cried again, snatching back her hand on reflex. The wound was not unlike a paper cut. \"Heh, so you wanna play hard to get, cutie? I'm game...\"</span></div></div>",

In sharp contrast was the gigantic Nena, with Exia resembling a large figurine in comparison to her, squealing with delight even as she was attacked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come over here little cutie,\" she cooed, \"I promise this won't hurt...too much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat dreadful feeling took hold of Setsuna again.  It occurred every time he was near the girl, and he couldn't explain it.  Was the feeling fear?  Disgust?  God forbid, an attraction caused by said disgust?  What mattered was that it was interfering with the...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA furious rattling shook Setsuna from his thoughts as he noticed Nena's hand clasping around his Gundam.  But that was...her hand wasn't that big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a sec,\" Nena pondered as Exia quickly flew off.  \"Is that getting smaller?\"  She was so preoccupied with the question that she didn't notice Exia coming in close for another strike.  However, as it approached, she did notice Exia visibly shrinking in front of her, along with the rest of the surroundings.  The realization of what this meant caused her to grin in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exia's making me bigger!  Oh you little cutie!\" she exclaimed as she reached out with stretched arms to embrace the shrinking (to her) mobile suit.  \"Come here!  I want to thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetsuna could only stare.  The GN particles were most likely the cause for this, but other than full retreat, what could he do?  Still, remaining was a problem, since every second waited was only empowering the Throne Meister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Setsuna flew at a series of odd angles in an attempt to confuse the giantess, readying his sword for one killing stroke.  He was prepared to strike, but unfortunately for him, he failed to make one calculation.  Nena's size allowed her to sweep him and Exia up before he could get within striking distance, as the still growing girl embraced the mobile suit, kissing it and cooing at the Meister inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much for this power!\" a delighted Nena got off between kisses.  \"We are going to have so much fun together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetsuna looked up at his monitors, the cameras drenched with the saliva of the giantess' kisses, as he realized what that feeling was.  Dread.  Unmistakable, bone chilling dread at what she wanted to do with him.</span></div></div>",

Were it not for Haro the sniper unit would not have moved in time, missing by inches and swooping over the gigantic palm. Not thinking, Nena relaxed her other hand and threw it across her chest in a second attempt. The miss was even closer this time, clipping off the bottom of one Dynames shield panels. Nena growled from the depths of her throat, a terrifying sound.

Most Gundam females are peace loving, so to have them suddenly wanting to kill people for fun is a great stretch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBe respectful- Different people have different tastes. Do not hijack a thread to focus on your interests alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo crossovers- keep this to Gundam only.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that out of the way, have fun!</td>",
