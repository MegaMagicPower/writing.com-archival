Not really thinking at all, you decide to look for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe site immediately loads up and you see a a space to type into. You see the space that says:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife: ::empty::<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Enter name of person you wish to become)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Become? What is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around for other options and find a list of preferences, but there are so many that you decide to ignore it for now. Under the box where you input the name is the button named \"DIVE\" which is grayed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the hell of it, you put in a name and click the Dive button. Without a moments notice, nothing happens until you see a loading screen and your computer starts making noises. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, you suddenly black out and the last thing you hear a loud WHOOSH noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt feels as if you're falling in which you are and you land out in your backyard. You get up and look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the? Why am I outside? What the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around and see that you're outside your house and its light outside. You're wearing a sweatshirt and jeans since its a little chilly outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Was I dreaming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head and head into your house. Entering the kitchen you look at the clock and see it as 9:02am. You find your three sisters Jenna, Megan, and Jessica sitting in the kitchen table eating pancakes. Kind of odd since Jenna and Jessica don't get along with Megan at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" - you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's what loser?\" - Jenna says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha Loser!!\" - Jessica says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, Megan sitting with the enemy? \"  - you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan looks at you and stays silent and depressed looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay whats going on here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three keep eating despite giving you looks. Something doesn't seem right to you, but you ignore it and head for the cubbards to eat. You pull out a bowl and get some cereal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenna, where's mom at?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I know idiot, I'm not a mind reader.\" - Jenna scorns<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna gets up, and puts her plate in the dishes. Angrily you slap Jenna in the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwaiting her retaliation the weirdest thing happens: Jenna doesn't react at all but gets up and heads up to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the.........\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Jenna's plate and see that she only took a bite of her pancakes and dumped them in the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParanoid you back away and wonder whats going on. You then see Jessica get up and dump her own plate in the sink. Same result, one bite and food wasted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down next to Megan and try to figure out whats going on. You and Megan are really good friends and stick by each other. She isn't very social except to you and looks up to you like a protective older brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meg, whats going on?! Megan, say something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan looks to you: \"Martin, I was wondering if you could help me with my bio homework. I got a 76. I'm just not going to pass this test. Please help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meg, are you listening to me?!!! I dunno if I'm being paranoid but something off is........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan just stares at you blankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get an idea:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about later tonight when I'm done with my own work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks man, you're the best.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan hugs you and gets up to leave. She reacted when you played along with her, not when you were wondering about what was going on.<br>\r\nYou suddenly remember that game online you found, could that be it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTired you get up and take off your sweatshirt you were wearing. As you remove it you find a watch on your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou examine it as you never seen this watch here before. It gets so tight as you remove it so it seems impossible to remove. You see the current time on the watch (April 20) and 9:11am. Below it you find a second time April 20 10:38pm. The first time seems to be ticking. You remember the second time being the exact time you were on the computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this Sim-U-Dive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan climbs down the stairs fully dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Martin, can you take me to the art store. I need to buy some paint supplies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her but ignore her. You see some buttons below the times called \"PAUSE, RESET, and EXIT\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sis, head to the car, I'll be there in a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan then walks to the door where the driveway is. You hit the PAUSE button and suddenly, the birds stop chirping and Megan stops in her tracks. She just stands there blinking and breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pause mode huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up to Megan and wave a hand in front of her. You remove her glasses and she doesn't react. You take her long darkbrown frizzy hair mess with it and nothing happens. You take her purse and she doesn't do anything either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah.......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look out the window to see if everyone outside pauses. Whats scary is that the neighborhood is empty. Just houses and cars in their driveways, no people at all. You leave with the kitchen door and go outside, and just like that, people appear frozen in place in a \"Zombie\" mode. Cars are stopped in the street. You look back into the house and don't see your sister Megan anywhere. You enter the house and Megan appears but the activity outside disappears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the activity depends on where I'm at. Awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go outside where the cars and people appear and hit PAUSE again. Everything resumes as it is as if nothing happens. Megan appears behind you ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Martin are we ready to go?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Meg, but I got other plans.\" - you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hit Exit, hoping it does what it does and then a green portal appears. You jump into it and you find yourself back in your room later at night with the computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit...............\"  - You say amazed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the computer where you inputted your own name in the person you wish to become. You check the preferences and see the time entered April 20, 9:00am as well as other familiar things, free will sliders, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am definitely checking this out.\" - you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would you like to do now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>What better way than to experience life living as one of the members of your own family and playing along with the simulation. You know your own family better than anyone else so it'll be a good learning experience for you. That or mess with their lives. You have no consequences getting away with anything since the last time you were expecting someone to retaliate to you, nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who do you want to be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey're five family members for you and each one is different than the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Jenna (20): Elder Sister - Jenna is a good choice for ruining a life. She is extremely athletic, but has an attitude problem toward you and your sister Megan. She goes to the same college as your father and is a good track athlete in various competitions and won many awards. She's very tall and loves to compete. Her figure is very good and ripped. She has a boyfriend and despite her attitude towards you you and him are okay with each other. Getting her arrested, pregnant, or whatever would feel really great for you to do even if the experience is simulated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Megan (16): Middle Sister - Megan is VERY shy and gets picked on alot at school. She has no athletic ability at all and oftentimes she's alone drawing. Megan has average looks, long frizzy hair, glasses, braces, and a decent figure. Think of that Princess Diaries chick before her makeover. She's into anime, videogames, and RPG's. She doesn't have many friends except two close ones and you (Martin). You're the only one she opens up to. If you Dive as her you're mission is simply make Megan's life better in school, friends, and romance, but its up to you. She doesn't deserve any crap in her life that she gets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Jessica (9): Younger Sister - Jessica is a brat. Enough said. She is the goody goody Princess that strangers and old people love but when you get to know her, she's a brat. She takes her bitch lessons from Jenna as the two are obvious best friends. Playing in this simulation, you could ruin Jessica's life, make her fail in school, or do whatever. The rest is up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Bill (46): Father - Your Dad Bill is an okay guy, a laid back father figure. He's a college Professor at the same college Jenna goes to and teaches Chemistry and other assorted science subjects. In this simulation you can make it so that the marriage doesn't work out and you can divorce Helen and date others, do fatherly things, teach a class and fail the entire class, or quit and do something else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Helen (42) Mother - An over protective mother whose a stay at home housewife. She is obsessed with womens talk shows and goes back them in the parenting department. She leads a steady life and motto that means her kids should never touch a beer or smoke or other drug while she's still alive. She's too overprotective in letting you do whatever you want. Possible scenarios are hanging out with other mothers, partying, or doing something out of the ordinary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour decision.....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You grin, 'I'll be looking forward to it.'. Then you wait in Jennas room for him. It seems to be ages until he arrives. You open the door and walk in Jennas room with him.

You find Meg's backpack and take out a mirror. You see your cute sisters pretty face in sync with your facial movements. Yup, you're her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at yourself and see you wearing a polo plain T-shirt, a uniform dress, and brown sandals. You look outside and see mountains in view instead of the school. You also look around and see the rest of the people dressed in summer clothing along with packed bags which means one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLY HELL! WERE GOING CAMPING!\" - You shout out loud in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No shit jackass!\" - one of the students says as you get pelted with crumbled up papers, straws and spitballs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan was the shy girl who always gets picked on at school. She has low self esteem and doesn't stand out in the hot department. Her curves are average at best, but she has a cute face with glasses and braces. She's an art, video game, and manga junkie. Her relationship with you is very good. You two are best friends and you serve as her \"protective brother\" because she's been through alot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peer outside and see that you might have a long way to go so you lie back in the seats and rummage through Megan's backpack. You find the usual things in there. binder, papers, inhaler, several manga books, as well as a sketchbook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling it out, you check out Megan's work. She has alot of drawn up characters, creatures, as well as several drawings of guys from animes. You turn the pages more and discover she's into yaoi based on the next couple of drawings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" - You<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breeze past those pages until there empty pages and decide to try out your own hand at drawing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not very artistic, but if you have Megan's body, breasts and asthma, you should have her drawing skills. Taking out a blue pencil you sketch out a figure and its like second nature to you as you do indeed have Megan's talent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpending the hour and a half you compile over 5 drawings of nude women and several fanservicy pics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't you were into girls Megan. Must be sad giving up on boys huh?\" - Sandra, one of the cheerleaders in front of you says as she peers behind the seat to see you art.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirk and counter:<br>\r\n\"Well, there's a first time for everything. You're pretty cute yourself. Wanna sit by me?\" you say as you wink back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised Sandra moves to another seat in front of the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I thought honey.\" You say with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later you arrive at Clear Lake Camping Facility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get off with your things and are escorted to the bunks. The facility has a lodge, a huge trail that goes off in the woods, several bathroom and shower facilities and even an astronomy lab with a huge telescope. The bunks are divided into two set by gender which means you get to enjoy living with fellow girl campers, the bad news is you're Megan and you have to endure their torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wander around and head to the girls bunk where you look for a bed. After searching for the 29 beds you discover that everyone has a bed except you. You go to one of the teachers and asks what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what were going to do about this Megan\" - Mr Schwimmer says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its okay if I can stay in the guys bunk, I don't mind.\" - You<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't allow that.\" - Mr. Schwimmer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teach were not kids, were mature people and you don't need to worry about me.\" - You speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll speak with the camp counselors.\" - the professor concludes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're forced to wait about 20 minutes so you wander around outside the girls bunk and get a good view of the landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher returns:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, we discussed it and decided to go with this. Because of the lack of single beds in the girls room, we'll bend the rules a bit for you. We already spoke with the men in the bunk and they don't mind at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\" - you say. You're pretty stunned that they would let you do this considering everyone would say no to such a request in real life, but it is still a simulation after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk towards the boys bunk and see half of the student group about ready to take a tour. You are interested in this camp so you hurry to the bunks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you enter you are greeted by a slew of eyes looking in your direction. The glares turn to disappointment and most of the fellas groan and resume unpacking. An obvious insult to you and Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel so welcomed.....\" - You say annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find a bed in the corner of the room and decide what to do next. </span></div></div>",

She stands about 5'7, fair complexion, average breasts, her butt is a tad large. She has short black hair with red streaks on the bangs, brown eyes and twin earrings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe steps out wearing jeans, a camisole, and a black jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, I'm not with the Reservation. I'm a camper like you too.\" - she says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my bad.

The little outburst she was forced to go along with must have been terrible.<br>\r\nMeg does not look worried though. Almost dismissing it, like you usually did with any ridicule. <br>\r\nYou watch as Meg and the other students board the bus, the teacher telling everyone to settle in, and the driver making the bus splutter to life.<br>\r\nIt was thirty minute trip and you wished there was a fast forward mechanic in the simulation.<br>\r\nYou floated around Meg as she looked through her things, and start to draw.<br>\r\n\"Meg, can you hear me?\" you ask her.<br>\r\nMeg took no notice, didn't even bat an eyelid, but her voice still spoke. \"Martin, what's this? What's going on?\"<br>\r\n\"It's a replay of my Simulation.\"<br>\r\n\"You wanted to live as me? Why? And what did you make me do?\" <br>\r\nMeg's Avatar had just finished drawing the nude girls and had moved on to the fan service pictures.<br>\r\n\"I was just curious, seeing what your life was like, and what you could do.\" <br>\r\nMeg's voice snorted \"No wonder you took so long in your morning ritual this morning. Umm...those girls I'm drawing, are they doing what I think they are doing?\"<br>\r\nYou see Sandra getting board and starting to find something that could interest her<br>\r\nyou chuckle. \"Wait, It gets better.\"<br>\r\n\"Wha...\"<br>\r\n\"I didn't you were into girls Megan. Must be sad giving up on boys huh?\" Sandra craned her neck over the seat to see the drawings.<br>\r\n\"Well, there's a first time for everything. You're pretty cute yourself. Wanna sit by me?\" Meg's avatar said flirtatiously and winked at Sandra.<br>\r\n\"You didn't\" Meg's voice squeaked.<br>\r\nSandra had a look on her face of pure befuddlement, clearly having no clue what to do in that kind of situation, and she moved to another seat quickly.<br>\r\n\"That felt so embarrassing, why did you do that to me?\" Meg said in a small voice.<br>\r\nYou feel a bit sorry for your sister.<br>\r\n\"Didn't it feel good to you know, get the one up on her?\" you ask tentatively.<br>\r\n\"Yes, but...it....\"<br>\r\n\"Just trust me, the part that I'm embarrassed about will come in a bit. I'm going to work something out. Have fun\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw your sister walking up to the Reservation when you got back.<br>\r\nYou learned how to end the replay and let Meg take over her avatar completely, not playing back your actions and thoughts.<br>\r\nThe button was in your ghostly hand ready to let Meg take over. You wonder what she will do.<br>\r\nYou followed Meg into the Reservation as she went around, admiring and petting the animals.<br>\r\nTaylor was at the door making noise, Making the Meg avatar jump and try to make a run for it<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Taylor called.<br>\r\n\"Gaaaaah, I'm sorry. I just wanted to see the animals here. I'll go back to my....\"You saw Meg begin to say<br>\r\n\"Relax, I'm not with the Reservation. I'm a camper like you too.\"<br>\r\nTaylor stepped out of the shadows. You have to look at her again. It was the same person. She looked a little above adverage in looks, but you were sure she looked better when you were Meg in the simulation.<br>\r\nYou try jumping into Meg's avatar. A shock ran through you as you started sensing things like a normal human being again. The first thing you noticed is that Taylor now looked like stunning. Next thing you notice is that you can hear Meg's thoughts.<br>\r\n<i>\"oh, she's my age, and she's nice.\"</i> you almost feel her relief, but also her tension at having to talk with someone.<br>\r\n\"Oh, my bad. Well I was just looking around and checking out the animals, then I was going to go on a hike.\" You hear yourself in Meg's avatar say.<br>\r\n\"Hiking at this hour? You're a brave girl. You can call me Taylor.\"<br>\r\nYou feel Meg's dismay, <i>I'm not brave. I'm a coward.</i><br>\r\nYou feel shocked and dismayed at hearing this. She didn't know you could hear her thoughts. Is this what she usually thought?<br>\r\n\"My name is.... Megan. \" The avatar continued. \"I don't think I've seen you. You from another school?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, lots of schools schedule these trips. I'm so tired of the sluts and assholes at my school, its refreshing to meet other people who share in my misery.\" Taylor smiled grimly<br>\r\nYou feel a pang in your heart, exactly what Meg was feeling. <i>\"She understands...\"</i><br>\r\nYou loosen control of the Meg avatar a bit, letting the predetermined words fade, letting Meg talk for herself, not just you putting words in her mouth.<br>\r\n\"I don't like school either. I...hate it.\" Meg murmured, her head bowed.<br>\r\n\"Why hate?\" Taylor asked softly.<br>\r\n\"They pick on me, they...I....they say I am the nerd girl.\" you feel Meg's mind race <i>\"Martin wouldn't have said that, that means I'm saying it. Then why am I telling this girl so much? Oh no, I'm stammering\"</i><br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, there are plenty of assholes in school. And you don't look like a nerd to me. You're.....cute. The glasses are a nice touch.\" <br>\r\n\"Um, no...I'm...just...I...not...\" Meg's heart skipped a beat. <i>\"I'm....cute?\"</i><br>\r\nA blush stained Meg's cheeks a vivid red.<br>\r\n\"Do yo want to hike together?\"<br>\r\nMeg didn't give it a second thought. \"I'd...yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether Meg and Taylor hiked up the mountain, talking with each other.<br>\r\nYou have never known your sister to talk so much to anyone before, so openly as she did to Taylor.<br>\r\nTaylor was speaking as openly as Meg was, and was a very good person to talk to.<br>\r\nThe two friends sat down at the riverbank and Meg looked up at the stars.<br>\r\n\"It's beautiful out here.\" Meg whispered in awe.<br>\r\n\"People don't know what they're missing out on. My whole class just walked right past a sleeping owl once, they were chatting away or on their phones. Only me, my friend and the camp teacher noticed it. we all stopped and had a moment.\"<br>\r\n\"Their loss.\" Meg smiled.<br>\r\n\"Sometimes these camps are good for people, they give new perspectives, change minds and opinions, to hold on to things while they last.\"<br>\r\n\"Do you have to think of the end just as something starts?\" Meg asks.<br>\r\nTaylor nodded. \"It makes you think of the time you have, and how to use it well.\"<br>\r\n\"And what can I change? when I go back I'll have to do the same as before, spitballs and cutting words.\" Meg bowed her head.<br>\r\nTaylor put her fingers under Meg's chin and gently lifted her face so they could look into each other's eyes.<br>\r\n\"Things can always change\" Taylor whispered as she took Meg's glasses off and set them aside. \"You look really cute without them on.\" <br>\r\nAs Taylor starts to move in for a kiss, you feel Meg's mind race, her conflicting emotions. <br>\r\nYou knew Meg couldn't back down, her actions still guided by the simulation playback.<br>\r\nTaylor met Meg's lips, tenderly and lovingly. Meg's heart skipped and fluttered, the breath seeping out of her body.<br>\r\nIf the simulation replay continues then Meg would back out, so you end the replay, giving Meg in her avatar complete control over her actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There staring back at you was Sarah as a kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, the time travel Sim works!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's hair is short and goes to her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return to your room and see the date. Its Christmas day today, but you're not as enthused about it because you have better plans for today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend the good half hour browsing around Sarah's room, looking around, finding school pictures (you shudder at how stupid you look in em), Sarah's awards from school, and other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour rummaging gets the attention of Sarah's parents. Her father Jack peaks his head into the room as you make a mess on the floor full of papers, pictures and toys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey baby, ready for Christmas presents?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lose control after seeing your \"Dad\" with a full head of hair.

Are you okay?\" - Jack<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope I'm fine Pop.\" - You (Sarah)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well come on down and open your gifts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you mention it, I think I'll give the bald look a try. Hahaha\" - Jack<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So thats how it started. Hehehe.\" You (Sarah)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head downstairs and find your new parents gather round the tree. You get a glimpse of Sarah's mother Alicia and admire how hot she looks. Her hair is longer, but shorter in the present day and has a great figure. It runs in her family.You put your mind at ease and play along being Sarah Johnson, the kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimulation days pass as its Monday December 29 and its the first day of school as Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecapping the weekend, the simulation went by no different from real life save for there not being any TV shows, or media of any kind, but you found your own fun. Using the watch to pause the simulation and wander around town and having the time of your life but you regretted it a bit because you miss your height to reach places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're actually hyped about coming to elementary school because of how easy its going to be. The sad thing though is coming face to face with your own self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get dropped off by Alicia taking one last look at her out of admiration and head to the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around and see the children around you. You look around and see the animations of most of the kids as they repeat the same idle actions over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thats when you see them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYourself (Martin), and your best friend Marco as nine year olds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SARAH!! Heya!\" - Martin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Brainy! Are you ready?!\" - Marco<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\" - You<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y2K IS GONNA DESTROY US ALL! WE NEED TO SAVE OUR BUTTS!!!!\" - Marco<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why aren't you preparing for the end of the world?!!!\" - Martin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder as you remember something. You and Marco were into that Y2K scare. You two were idiots for believing that crap and as nine year old impressionable kids its not surprising. Sarah was the one in your group who never bought into that. Smart kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, was I stupid back then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guys go hide, but I'm gonna laugh at you guys when you're hiding in a sewer and I'm partying with the family for 2000!\" - you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a lost cause dude, we lost her.\" - Marco<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Martin's and can tell he's a little hurt.

You were sitting before in your office chair and now you're standing in the front yard of a house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou materialize inside the simulator and the first thing you see is your girlfriend Sarah's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around and see that its day. You see light traffic out on the suburban street and people passing by unaware that they're computer programs with no AI intelligence whatsoever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down on yourself and see Sarah's breasts in view blocking the rest of your lower features. You've become Sarah Johnson, your girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah is wearing a white blouse, a babyblue and white leather jacket, earrings, heels, and jeans that really shape out her curvy body. Her hair is straight and long instead of curly and frizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, this is Sarah. I'm me. Martin is an asshole.\" You test her voice while pointing fun at yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way towards your new house although its hard walking in Sarah's feet and these damned heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the house and fine your new parents sitting and watching TV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey honey. Not hanging out with Martin today?\"  your mother asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah It's all me today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats nice.\" your father says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk to the stairway and see Sara's parents watch the TV. Whats odd is that the same 3 commercials are played and no show is on, just the same three commercials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be a Programming thing. They couldn't program TV shows in this Simulation I guess.... Ooops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your folks who heard that and they don't react at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right, If I bring anything up relating to this simulation, nothing happens unless I play in character.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go up to them in front of the TV. the two of them look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you two, I'm really Martin and you guys are just AI programs on a computer game.  I'm in your daughters body about to do who knows what to it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around and spank Sarah's butt and blow a kiss to them, and amazingly both parents don't react at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man this is too easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, we can't see the Tv, move along hun.\" - Your mother says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright mama, sorry, I'm going to take a nap.\" - you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K honey.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey leave you be as you head to your new room while laughing along the way because your gal's folks are watching endless commercials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou been to Sarah's room hundreds of times before during visits, hangouts, sleepover, study-groups, family BBQ's etc, but now the room is yours. You remove your jacket and those evil heels and lie on the bed. You get up to inspect the room further. Every little thing in this room is exactly as it was in the real world, you search through Sarah's shelves and even find a picture of Sarah, Marco your best friend, and yourself Martin when you were kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince this is your own world you had no guilt so you decide to be reckless. You take the photo, open the window, take a moment to gasp at there are no signs of life outside and fling the frame out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets cause some problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run to Sarah's clothes hamper and pick out some sloppy clothes to try on. After getting a flannel shirt, some short shorts, flip flops, and a nightgown from the hamper.<br>\r\nYou grab the nightgown and take a whiff of Sarah's scent from it. You find it extremely odd that this game even has exact scents too. You take in the rest of Sarah's attire enjoying yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow to undress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly remove the pants taking in Sarah's curvacious lower body. You enjoy the sight of seeing her white lace panties as you toss aside the pants and now stare in the mirror flushed at this wonderful sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remove the top slowly and exposing Sarah's Twin C cups in a white bra.You get a feel for both of them and massage both breasts. Your pelvic area getting moist from the groping you lie on the bed and continue groping. You plant a finger towards your clit and start fingering yourself. You gasp, moan and sweat in bliss that you continue until you explode. Worn out you can't do anything but lie and wait until you're able to regain composure again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it feels real even in THIS world! Good GOD! This is MORE than just a game\" You say exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stagger to the mirror and remove your bra and wet panties. You take the hotpants and put them on. You put on the flipflops, and throw on the nightgown and put on the flannel shirt and leave it unbuttoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou throw out the jeans out the window and decide what to do next.<br>\r\nYou find Sarah's cell phone and realize that you're dating yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be too weird, so you could dump yourself and try dating again. Perhaps have a new girl-girl relationship or something. Maybe date your own sisters just to see the reaction of your own digital self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr do something else.</span></div></div>",

You decide to start out like you did before. Entering the kitchen you look at the clock and see it as 9:02am again. Like before you find your three sisters Jenna, Megan, and Jessica sitting in the kitchen table eating pancakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this\", you ask?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's what loser\", Jenna says?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, ha Loser!!\" - Jessica says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenna, where's mom at\", you ask? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I know idiot, I'm not a mind reader\", Jenna scorns!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna gets up, and puts her plate in the dishes.

You smile and answer by saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to teach you a lesson you annoying, stuck up, and arrogant cunt\u201d. With that you shove into her room and to the floor. \u201cMartin, what are you doing\u201d, she yells? You answer by reaching up her skirt and ripping off her panties. You then begin unbutton your jeans and pull out your cock. She begins to struggle and you push her back down. You force your way between her legs and shove your cock into her pussy. As you begin to slam her you tear of her shirt to reveal her breasts. You start twisting her nipples and fondling her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jenna had started out fighting, but is soon moaning with pleasure. \u201cWho\u2019s the bitch\u201d, you scream? \u201cI\u2019m the bitch, I\u2019m your bitch Martin\u201d, Jenna screams back. You pound her harder and harder as she begins to climax you explode inside her. \u201cOh God Martin\u201d, you sister screams as you hot sperm fills her up. For good measure you pull out and shoot a couple of loads onto her tits and face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You get up and hit the exit button on the watch and are suddenly back in your bedroom in front of the computer. \u201cMan, that was therapeutic\u201d, you say out loud. You look back at the screen and see you can enter the world as other people, not just as yourself. \u201cThis has a lot of potential\u201d, you say smiling to yourself.</span></div></div>",

You feel a little bad about having your way with your sister, but the way she felt and screamed when you had her made you want to feel that way as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin the simulation and suddenly feel your cock shrivel up, go inside of you, and become your new female parts. A new weight lays on your chest as your breasts sprout. You look at the clock. It is 9:02 AM. You are sitting down, eating pancakes, wondering where your bother is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly someone who looks exactly like you enters. You never thought of yourself as attractive before, but looking over the other body makes something inside of you feel good. You can't help but whisper to your other sisters that you would like to fuck your brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" he asks.<br>\r\nYou giggle and try to pretend you aren't interested. \"What's what loser?\"<br>\r\n\"Jenna's, where's mom at,\" the new you asks.<br>\r\n\"Somewhere else, you idiot,\" you say. \"Figure it out yourself.\" You get up to do the dishes, having finished your food.

It turns you on to call yourself out on how much you like being a girl, feeling that you need to be filled. Wetness drips from your new body.<br>\r\n\"I'm going to teach you a lesson, you stuck up, arrogant cunt,\" your old body says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shoves you on the floor.<br>\r\n\"Yes, please use me,\" you say, unable to help, despite the fact that your sister said something else. You bite down hard on your cheek to stop from squealing as he forcefully rips off your panties and undoes his buttons.<br>\r\nHis dick slams into you, and you scream in pain. You try to struggle, but he holds you down as he removes your shirt.<br>\r\nYour nipples are hard, but he tweaks them as he continues ramming himself into you.<br>\r\nSomehow, the cock on the other you seems bigger than the one your remember. You wish it bigger and it seems to grow.<br>\r\n\"No, no\" you start to say, as he gyrates in and out of your new pussy.

You can choose to become anybody in the world in this simulation and live their lives, whether its a celebrity, actor, actress, or even your own life, friends, family or other people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world inside is an exact copy of earth except for a few rules to the player: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- To Dive, you are given options to who you want to be. enter a name and hit \"DIVE\" and you'll be transported to the MMO world. You can also set up little details, like location, and other small things in this menu, but thats up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- When you're inside \"Sim-U-Dive\", you become the person you choose before you dive. You can feel, see, touch, taste, and hear in this world. You can talk, communicate and basically do anything as you would in real life. You can eat, shop, dress, bathe, run, etc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- The people inside are NOT real, so you can do anything to them without fear of consequences. You have FULL control and can decide to play out the scenario or see what it's like ruining someones reputation or something and seeing the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Time does NOT pass when you're playing a Simulation. You can spend a week in the Sim-U-Dive, and leave and you'll return to the real world the moment you left off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlayer Options:<br>\r\nInside the Dive, keep in mind that you are wearing a special watch at all times. The watch has player options which are:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Lists the time and date in that world you're in<br>\r\n- Lists the real world time and date as well<br>\r\n- Has a \"RESET\" option which resets the scenario back to the moment you first arrived and you can play the sim over again with full knowledge<br>\r\n- Has a \"PAUSE\" mode. Everything including time pauses. People become zombies and don't react to you, so you can wander around without no one saying anything to you. People merely are idle, still breathing and blinking but don't do anything else, so you can do anything here.<br>\r\n- Exit: A huge green portal appears where you can leave the Simulation<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- CHARACTERS - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters are the same as my \"Body Swap Remote\" Interactive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Martin (17): You  - Joker, Sports fanatic<br>\r\n- Sarah (17): Girlfriend - smart, hot, childhood friend, anti sports<br>\r\n- Marco (17) Best Friend - Jokester, third Wheel, childhood friend<br>\r\n- Jenna (20): Elder Sister - A Bitch, extremely athletic and built, tall, college student<br>\r\n- Megan (16): Middle Sister - Shy, Average looks, glasses, artist, mangaka<br>\r\n- Jessica (9): Younger Sister - Brat, Attention Whore, Gullible<br>\r\n- Bill (46): Father - Chemistry College Professor, Laid back, Busy worker<br>\r\n- Helen (42) Mother - Motherly, Overprotective</td>",
