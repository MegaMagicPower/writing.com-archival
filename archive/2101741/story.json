The last thing she remembered she was on a yacht out at sea where she was doing a photoshoot for Esquire when a massive storm hit. Snapping fully awake she looked around her surroundings and realized she was no longer on the yacht. Instead she was on a beach with ocean before her, and a jungle to her back. In distance to her left Scarlett could see the wreckage of the yacht. Examining herself she saw that was still completely dressed in the outfit she wore for her photoshoot. A sleeveless tan top and white under shirt that exposed her cleavage, gray shorts that left little to the imagination, and she was completely barefoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what do I do?\" Scarlett again asked herself as she slowly got up on her feet. She actually had a few options. She could try and scavenge the wreckage for supplies, but who knew if there was still anything useful on board. She could try and start a fire to try signal any passing ships for a rescue, but who knew what else it might attract. She could head into the jungle to try and find food and shelter, but who could say what dangers lurked in there. She could go for a swim and try to get her mind off of things for a little bit, but was now really the best time for it? There was also the possibility she wasn't the only survivor and the others might be searching for her, so it might be best to stay right where she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end Scarlett decided to...</span></div></div>",

A few rapid breaths later, Scarlett had collected herself, \"keep your cool, girl. Just... <i>focus</i>. I need to find water, but I also need to find more wood if I want to make a large enough fire. I could try gathering stones to make some kind of message on the beach, too. What to do?\" In the end, Scarlett decided to...</span></div></div>",

As she worked, she let her mind wander, humming tunes and daydreaming beneath the slowly descending sun. Before long, her rock pile could easily have filled a respectable wheelbarrow, and she was having to wade out deeper into the waters to find good-sized stones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn what must have been her hundredth trip out into the shallows however, something happened. She had waded out from the shoreline a good hundred feet and was scanning the waist-deep water for a last stone when she felt something brush against the back of her thigh. Spinning about quickly she tried to locate the source of the intrusion, but the lapping waves and reflecting sunlight made it hard to see properly. Still, it only took her a moment to spot the animal. Her heart froze in her chest...</span></div></div>",

For a moment she could do nothing but stare in terrified awe at the circling animal, her fear holding her solidly in place. The shark seemed impossibly large - from its cold, black eyes to the tip of its tail it spanned a length three times Scarlett's own height, and it could very easily have weighed a ton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a shell-shocked soldier returning to their senses, reality came sweeping back to the petrified actress, and her eyes darted to distant shoreline. Her mind was racing. <i>Can I make it? The water is shallow - if I can get far enough, it'll beach itself. Shit! What was I thinking!?</i> Scarlett whimpered with fear, her legs trembling as the patient predator completed another circle around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, on impulse, she made her move - the water that had once seemed so inviting now felt like molasses, slowing her as she frantically half-ran-half-swam toward the shore. <i>Ohh god, please... pleeease...</i> She lost track of the shark in her panic, focusing only on each stride carrying her to safety. <i>Come on girl, -move- your ass!</i> Was the beast behind her? Was that its nose prodding at her legs? <i>Fuck! Oh no, no, no no nooo...</i> The shoreline was drawing nearer, and a glimmer of hope flickered in Scarlett's mind, when suddenly...</span></div></div>",

Scarlett could see the side of the shark and the shore getting smaller. The shark eventually let her go and started to swim around her again. Scarlett's side hurt, but it wasn't too bad. However, she knew what was coming, and the shore was too far away from her. After the shark circled around her once, it charged at her head. The shark grabbed Scarlet and started to swallow her, being careful not to bite. This shark in particular loved to feel prey struggling in its stomach. It kept moving forward, eventually swallowing Scarlett's legs. She had soon gotten to its stomach. It was dark and cold. As the poor girl began to lose consciousness, she beat on the walls, hoping to upset the stomach. After what felt like hours, Scarlett couldn't fight anymore and fell into a deep slumber. She would never wake up again.</span></div></div>",

For the briefest moment she could see palm trees swaying lazily on the beach, and then the shark thrashed violently, sweeping her underwater. Her nostrils and mouth filled with water and she screamed uselessly, streaming bubbles into the red, churning water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back of her mind, she felt the bones in her legs crunch and crack in the shark's jaws as it pulled her back out into the deeper water before suddenly releasing her. Flailing her arms, Scarlett breached the surface of the water, loosing a gargling, coughing shriek of agony as the predator circled 'round again. <i>Oh jesus, ohh fuck no no no please...</i> Her vision blurred and faded slightly as the pain pulsed through her, and she couldn't bring herself to look down at what was surely the mangled remains of her once-famous legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happened like a flash. The snap-away at the of a film scene. Cut. End take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut in the deeper waters, the tiger shark was free to move at its normal striking speed. As Scarlett floundered in the water, doomed and bleeding profusely, the predator struck like a freight train. Its jaws gaped wide, pearly teeth glinting in the sunlight at the edge of its maw, and then they sank deep into the flesh of Scarlett's torso and waist as she was plunged underwater. The sheer violence of the attack was immediately fatal. A few quick, utterly destructive bites from the shark and the once Hollywood starlet's body was crushed, eviscerated, and swallowed whole. Then silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few floating scraps of Scarlett's silken outfit and a cloud of dissipating red were all that remained in the deep, unforgiving ocean.</span></div></div>",

Through the trees she could see the sun getting lower in the sky. If she didn't find shelter soon she would be subjected to the trials of the night such as the cold, darkness, and maybe even predators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last thought made Scarlett stop dead in her tracks. She hadn't considered the possibility of predators on the island. The very idea that something could attack and eat her at any time sent a chill down her spine. Becoming the world's sexiest dinner definitely  wasn't how she would want it to end. It was to late to change her mind now though. She had not been keeping track of where she was going, and the shoreline was nowhere in sight. So with a sigh Scarlett continued to move forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour of walking, Scarlett came across two paths. One that was covered in vines and one that was clear. Realizing that this was her best bet to find shelter she decided to take one of these paths and see where it leads, but which one? The path covered in vines might not only lead to shelter but possible a source of fruit as well, but those vines made her nervous. The other path was neater, but what if it was a game trail?

Before long however, her musings were interrupted by a low gurgle coming from her belly. She sighed exasperatedly, running her hands through her  now slightly dampened hair, \"I'm going to <i>have</i> to trudge through that overgrowth... I've never hunted anything in my life, so foraging is really my only hope of getting food.\" She glanced down at her belly as another short gurgle cemented her choice. \"Well, best get to it then...\" Scarlett steeled herself, and then plunged into the thick, leafy vines, determined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the former actress padded along through the foliage, she became increasingly aware of just how exposed she was. The occasional twig or thorny vine would scratch at her shoulders and midriff, and her periodic yelps of pain punctuated the general quiet of the jungle each time she stepped on a sharp stone or root. Just when her patience and her optimism were beginning to falter, she stopped in her tracks, focusing on a sudden new smell. It was sweet, like some fruity syrup almost, and the scent was a fresh relief in the otherwise muggy atmosphere of the jungle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping off to the side of what could barely be called a path that she had been following, Scarlett pushed aside more vines and ferns, moving toward the smell. Shoving a final large vine out of her way, her gaze fell upon a most unusual bit of vegetation - in the center of a small clearing, suspended from the canopy by thick, coiling trailers, was an immense pitcher plant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't any question in Scarlett's mind; this plant was surely the source of that delicious smell. Her hand moved to the smooth curve of her belly as her stomach gurgled again. \"I just have to cut it down, or tip it over or something... it must be some sort of sweetened rain water in there. <i>Gods</i>, I could go for a drink right now.\" Mouth watering at the thought of sating her thirst and hunger, Scarlett stepped further into the clearing toward the plant, when suddenly...</span></div></div>",

She clawed at the ground for any kind of purchase, but it was no use. Before she knew it she hanging upside down at least a good five off the ground, and rising. She looked up at the vine that had grabbed her, and could see no end to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go!\" Scarlett yelled as she began to struggle and tear at the vine to get free. Eventually, the vine began to lower her back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, giving up I see,\" Scarlett laughed. She looked back down and her heart sank at the sight before her.

She quickly got back on her feet. The pool of digestive juices came up to her waist and her skin tingled were they made contact. To think she had wanted to get to them earlier, but now all she wanted was to get out before she was digested. Scarlett looked up at the mouth of the pitcher plant. It was a good six feet above her head. There was no way she'd be able jump up to it. Her only option was to try and climb out, and try she did. Unfortunately, every time she gained a foot or so, she would slide back down into the digestive juices. After a few minutes it didn't matter anyway as the lid of the pitcher plant closed, thus trapping the former actress inside. Despair washed over her as she collapsed to her knees, thus bringing the digestive juices up to her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is how it ends,\" Scarlett began to cry. \"All that hard work just to become plant food?\" Tears rolled down her face. Eventually, the tingling sensation of the digestive juices turned into a burning one. Scarlett screamed and thrashed in pain as she was slowly digested alive. Over the course of the day she was turned into nothing more than a nutritious soup. The mush that had once been Scarlett Johansson was absorbed by the pitcher plant before it reopened its lid to wait for its next meal.</span></div></div>",

Soon, she was dangling by one of her feet above his mouth. It was wide open beneath her. She could see his long, salivating tongue and his jagged, dirty teeth. She began to flail her arms about.<br>\r\n\"No!\" she said. \"No! Please!\"<br>\r\nBut the ogre didn't care. All he cared about was his next meal, and that was Scarlett Johansson. As far as he was concerned, the only place the beautiful, sexy young woman belonged was in his stomach, and it was beginning to grow restless with hunger.<br>\r\nHe lowered her in. His lips clamped around her waist, leaving her legs kicking outside his fat lips. His tongue began working on her, licking her all over, taking in her taste. Indeed, the woman was the best thing he had ever tasted. But his growling gut far below reminded him of his need for food. With a moist slurp, he too the rest of her into his mouth. With a light gulp, her head entered his throat.<br>\r\nScarlett screamed, but it was muffled by the flesh of his esophagus. She continued to kick, knowing it was futile and that she was running on pure survival instinct. With a few more gulps she was completely in his esophagus. Another, more powerful swallow squeezed her through a sphincter and into the ogre's stomach.<br>\r\nThe first thing that hit her was the smell. The indescribable stench hit her nose immediately and her eyes began to water. The next thing she noticed was the complete darkness, even darker than the cave. Next the sounds. The deeper parts of his digestive tract rumbled, anticipating the hearty dose of protein her sexy and delicious body would provide the giant.<br>\r\nFar above her, the giant burped. The air in his belly grew thinner. She began to feel lightheaded. Soon, she ran out of oxygen and passed out before his belly bgan to digest her.</span></div></div>",

However, Scarlett's attention was mainly on the giant sandwich ingredients the ogre had set next to her prison.

Scarlett was certain the fantastical reptile found her to be delicious as moans of pleasure rose from his throat and she became covered in saliva. After about ten minutes of tasting the tongue slid out and licked each of the lovely lady's toes and the soles of her feet. She squeaked and wiggled her feet and toes harder in response, but it was useless. With one slurp Scarlett felt her heels, soles, and finally toes squeeze past the dragon's lips as she was brought completely into his mouth.

All too soon though Scarlett's journey came to an end when she came to the stomach sphincter. It recognized the former starlet as found and squeezed her into the stomach with a plop. Scarlett sat up in the fleshy chamber that was to be her end and looked around her dark surroundings. No longer was she one of the sexiest women alive, but instead a tasty meal for a hungry dragon. This realization hit her so hard that Scarlett brought her hands up to her face and began to weep. She wept as the digestive juices began to flow.

Scarlett almost didn't mind the gurgling of the stomach below her as it became louder and louder. Soon her relaxation came to an end when she felt her feet hit a wall of flesh. It was none other then the stomach sphincter, and recognizing the former actress as food it quickly opened up as she was squeezed into the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlett landed in the stomach with a splash. It was already filled with digestive juices ready to digest her. When standing up she noticed that they only came up to about her neck. Her skin tingled where the digestive juices touched her skin.

She was lizard food now and there was nothing she could do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess there are worst ways to go,\" Scarlett said with a sigh.

The thought of it finding and eating her was almost too much for the blonde starlet to bear. She was certain it would find her any second as the lizard's forked tongue tasted the air for her. Then just as Scarlett was considering coming out from hiding and getting it over with the lizard's foot disappeared from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is it leaving?</i> She wondered. Her answer came when she felt the lizard's footsteps moving away from her until they disappeared altogether. Slowly removing her hands from her move she let out a sigh of relief. The she crawled to the entrance of her sanctuary and cautiously stuck her head out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was too close,\" Scarlett whispered to herself as she made sure the coast was clear before completely emerging from safety. The thought that she had almost been eaten made her tremble. She still need to decide what to do next though. She could continue exploring the jungle and risk almost being eaten again with the root cave acting as her shelter. Though she could also try and make it back to the shoreline and wait for rescue there. However, there was also a third option that Scarlett wasn't too fond of. If the lizard was any indication the on this island she was no longer one of the sexiest women alive, but instead the sexiest main course in the world. It could only be a matter of time before something ate her. Maybe it would be best to just find another predator and allow herself to be eaten. Scarlett tried to shake that last thought from her head as she tried to decide what to do.</span></div></div>",

She landed on the ground with a thud, the air forced out of her lungs. By the time she recovered her entire view was taken up by the sight of the lizard's open maw coming towards her. She screamed in terror as the reptile's jaws clamped shut around her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith its prey now helpless the lizard lifted its head back up as Scarlett's legs kicked in the air as the former actress tried to gain her freedom. Unceremoniously the lizard slurped her legs into its maw like a pair of noodles. Then the lizard tilted its head back back and with a loud gulp  it swallowed the starlet whole. The bulge that was once Scarlett Johansson could be seen traveling down the lizard's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile on the inside Scarlett was having a terrible time as the esophagus squeezed and compressed her downwards to her tomb. Saliva and mucus covered her from head to toe.She could hear the beating of the heart as she passed by it, but what unnerved her was the gurgling of the stomach as she came closer and closer to her demise. Soon she came to a wall of flesh that was none other than the stomach sphincter. It quickly opened up to accept her as food and she was pushed into the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside the stomach Scarlett stood up as best she could, but the stomach was so cramped that she had to arch her back in order to stand. She started to punch and kick the stomach walls in order to get the lizard to let her out to no effect. Before long though she started to feel a tingling sensation on her feet, and she looked down only to scream in terror once again. The digestive juices had started to seep in and were rising. Scarlett's struggles became more desperate, but it was no use. Soon the digestive juices were up to her waist, and the tingling sensation had turned into a severe burning. She screamed in pain as she was digested alive. Her only salvation that day was that she quickly passed out from the pain before she was completely digested.     </span></div></div>",
