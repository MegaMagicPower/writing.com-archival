Once you pick a story route, you are expected to keep her character aligned in that department,.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood: She becomes a defender in Japan, protecting it from monsters, aliens, and other bad things like a superhero. People will surely love her and look up to her as a hero. She tries to minimize the damage as possible in the city, and is focus on saving lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvil-Kaiju: Need I Say more on this. She is an evil rampaging giant monster that destroys Japan or rules it like a goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeutral: Neither good or evil, just doesn\u2019t care what happens, she is just focus on herself. She is uncaring about damages she causes and is rather annoyed. Which I have more to say on this. More slice of life on this route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnti-Hero: Kinda similar to Neutral, but here she does fight monsters and other evil forces, but is uncaring on damages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore Story options: Need I say more.</span></div></div>",

They will have a choice in the following chapter of Riho\u2019s alignment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlice of kaiju life: An option based on my Typical life of a kaiju giantess. Riho gets used to living life as a good giantess among the people of Japan, and they are no threats around her, and she acts like a maintained giant monster. She likes to roar and stomp around. She continues her modeling career, now gigantic. Lives with them. Also a living tourist attraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsland Life: The government quarantines her on a remote island off the coast of Japan in a Monster Island like setting. They might be some more monsters there, maybe she gets used to life there and becomes a tourist attraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeaching another Giantess: She could be a teacher to another giantess, older, same age, or younger to getting used to her size and powers, and could be good, evil, etc. Hero, Rampage, etc?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess: Here she has even more powers and becomes onmipotent and a ruler. How will she use her new found godhood, up to you. Turns out that alien gave her more than lasers and size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore options: need I say more</span></div></div>",

Remember Riho Futaba everyone, the young model from Japan. The girl who gets bitten by an alien and turns into a 160ft kaiju with laser beam eyes and various other powers. Well she is back in a new Interactive where you decide how she uses her powers. Note I am taking liberties with the story of the game, liking not having the alien be attach to her to give her powers, etc, and how we can decide how she acts as a giant, but I do hope we can revive this classic RP for a new decade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules<br>\r\nNo Male Giants<br>\r\nNo ending the story, always leave an option to continue<br>\r\nThey can be more than one giantess, but remember Riho is the main one<br>\r\nNo nudity for the first 3 chapters, want to give the option of clothes for her at least<br>\r\nDo have fun<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am being more lenient on rules here just to allow more adult content, but I do hope we can let younger reviewers and people add to the story even though they shouldn\u2019t be, to see if they can handle it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere is a link of an image of our beloved kaiju girl for reference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://static.miraheze.org/giantesswiki/thumb/4/46/Demolition_Girl_NTSC_J.jpg/350px-Demolition_Girl_NTSC_J.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://static.miraheze.org/giantesswiki/thumb/4/46/Demolition_Girl_NTSC_J.jpg/3...</a></td>",
