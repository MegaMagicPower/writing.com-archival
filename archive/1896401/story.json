And once again Fujiko betrayed the others, however this time Lupin was prepared for such an occassion, so when Fujiko escaped with all the stolen goods, Lupin ascertained that she would find a little surprise. When Fujiko arrived at her home, she opened the suitcases where the stolen goods should have been, but instead she found.....her own lingerie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked by that ridicolous joke Fujiko screamed angry \"Damn Lupin, how dare he did this to me? Sure, I betrayed him, Jigen and Goemon a few times, but this is cruel. This cause for revenge, but how? What could be more appropriate?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next couple of hours, Fujiko thought on an appropriate way to punish Lupin, but so far nothing. Tired from all that thinking, she lied on her sofa and started to read a magazine. Reading it, Fujiko find an interesting article with the following title <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scientist William Perke is looking for an assistant to help him in his experiments and inventions\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, fujiko started reading the article and find out that this scientist was developing some interesting inventions that Fujiko thought \"This guy could have something that I could use to get my revenge on Lupin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess there is no harm in investigating. Docotor William Perke, your new assistant is on her way to you\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

HOW?\" asked a very interested Fujiko <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well first of all you put the data of the body of the new person in this computer, along with his new mind set, then you put the test subject inside the machine through this door\" and he pointed to the automatic door \"then you push the big red button and ba-da-boom you have your new person.\" explained the Doctor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, if I put my measures inside this computer along with a new mind set, and then I put a man inside that machine, that man will turn into a female version of himself, with a body shapeshift like mine and a mind that I programmed\" asked Fujiko <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly Fujiko\" responded the Doc \"the new person wouldn't lose his intelligence, but he/she will changes his/her memories and attitude\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing that Fujiko said \"That's brilliant Doc\" and made the Doctor blushing, but what she was really thinking was \"Lupin, my revenge is near\"</span></div></div>",
