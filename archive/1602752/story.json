She wore what seem to be a lace-frilled dress, the high collar /w open front on her dress was soft around her delicate looking neck, her long gown skirt flow elegant like the wind, but the girl notices that she is all numb around her body, and her eyes have become an eerily pale color along with all of her still beautiful skin, but she notices that she stinks of rotting flesh and manages to burp and fart frequently and not be embarrassed about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she tries to stand up out of the swampy mud, she realises it, she has become an undead, but her mind is still her own and she is still beautiful, but she has lost her memory, and she doesn't know where she is... Her quest begins as she tries to find her memory, find her way, and find out how she died, her only clue was a scar on the side of her neck, but she believes there's more than just that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should she do, first? </span></div></div>",

She reached down and got a sturdy grip on it and lifted up. Expecting it to be heavy she put too much power it to lifting it and nearly fell backwards. She thought apparently zombies have super strength because this branch is way too big for a normal girl with her muscles to lift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the branch in hand she rushed back to the mage only to find that she was much deeper than before and though she is sinking faster I best hurry.

Her eyes looked like they were expecting you to turn on her any moment and attack her, and her body language said the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then spoke \u201cThank you for saving me, had you not come around here I would have surely died a slow death. I am tired so I think I will find a spot to set up camp.....and was wondering if you would like to join me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was scared by the mage thinking that the mage would kill her when she slept, just because she saved this Mage does not make her any less of a slayer. The mage noticed the look on the zombie girls face and said \u201c you saved my life, and as I said earlier my wand is down in that mud and I have no desire to go down and get it......How about this, I will make an promise to you that unless you give me just cause I will not attack you. Does that sound fair to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe zombie thought about that deal, still a little scared of the slayer but feeling a deep loneliness inside her she nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the mage rested for a couple of minutes they began walking through the swamp together. The mage began asking questions about the zombie girl that she couldn't answer because of the lack of memory. But the she assumed it was manly to ease the tension between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after a short walk they came to a clearing. The trees provided good shade from the sun and there was soft grass for them to relax on. The mage asked her to go collect some logs for a fire as she went to dig a hole for the fire pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was gone for 15 minutes looking for as many logs as she could carry. When she returned the mage had finished digging the fire pit and was working on a big shelter for the two of them out of tree branches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the shelter was complete they started a fire and sat around it trying to think of how to get the zombie girls memories back.</span></div></div>",
