Soon the all of the classrooms including yours came bursting out with people screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was completely nuts to where you had to stay put or you'd get tackled by over a thousand students. A few minutes went by and you figured it was safe to get up, but immediately you knew what all the chaos came from. <br>\r\nIt was a reaction to what was a Zombie apocalypse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonally you never were in to this thing so you had no idea how to properly survive it.

However the things that were nearby that very staircase were starting to come towards you and yor companion. You had to do something in order to distract them so you grabbed something from the ground and threw it near the windows where \"they\" were near.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazingly it worked! This gave you an opening to get out of there, but that same girl who you eard screaming was still being attacked by one of \"them\". Miraculously she wasn't bitten at least yet. However that guy you rescued threw it off the staircase making it fall head first on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! Let's get out of here!\", he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all hid inside one of the classrooms and shut the doors. That was without a doubt the closest thing you ever went through in your life.

If we see any we'll help them out so we can earn their trust.\", you excalimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were not going to do anything crazy right?\", asked Tomoko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean by earning their trust by helping them get out of here. No point in trying to take over a group, we need people but not everyone is welcoming, besides they might only be accompanied by friends they trust. So we have to make them trust us, simple as that.\", you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then let's go then let's find some weapons and get out of this place.\", Yuuta said.</span></div></div>",

You used a school fire axe, Yuuta had a sword, and Tomoko used a lug wrench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you just stormed through not stopping for anything. As you were cutting up \"them\" you began to feel like this was second nature.

What are you skills? Kohta is the gun expert and I'm a genius.\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all have good experience with melee weapons.\", you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. There's a few things you should know about \"them\". They can't see and noise attracts them.
