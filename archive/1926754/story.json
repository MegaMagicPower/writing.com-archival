            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first thing I saw when I woke up was a picture frame. It was big, 70X100 , and standing on some kind of <br>\r\nalter. The frame contained a picture, probably recent, of some guy I never met before with slicked back black <br>\r\nhair. He was young and handsome in an old Hollywood kind of way. The room I was in reminded me of those <br>\r\nshrines that crazy people make in the back of their closets. It was mostly dark, with what I assumed were <br>\r\ncandles providing the only luminescence sitting somewhere behind me. The room looked well furnished. Red <br>\r\nvelvet lined the walls and plush red carpeting covered the floor. I could tell since I wasn't wearing any <br>\r\nshoes. I tried to speak out loud, but my mouth was covered in duct tape. I attempted to move, but surprise <br>\r\nsurprise, my hands and feet wee bound by rope to the chair. I could at least turn my head though. I'm part of <br>\r\na semi circle with four other guys, also tied up to chairs, also with duct tape over their mouths. All them <br>\r\nare awake, seemingly resigned to their fate as kidnapping victims, for none of them were putting up any kind <br>\r\nof a struggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, Sleepy Head is awake\u201d I heard a woman's voice say. She had been behind me, out of my line of sight the <br>\r\nentire time, which disturbed me greatly. If I was going to be a victim of a serial killer, at least it be a <br>\r\nmale serial killer. She stepped forward, past, me, into the center of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked great for her age, which I guessed was her fifties judging by her taste in clothing and the <br>\r\nwrinkles on her face, which admittedly were hard to see behind her makeup. She her long, thick black hair <br>\r\ndraped across her shoulders and forehead, and she was barefoot like I was(and, I noted, the other kidnapping <br>\r\nvictims as well).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Esmeralda Kirke. I'm very sorry for abducting you all. I'll do whatever I can to accommodate your <br>\r\nneeds. Hopefully, we can all look back on this one day and have a good laugh about it\u201d announced Esmeralda. <br>\r\nHer voice was calm and sweet, with no hint of malice or madness in it. That disturbed me even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis\u201d, she pointed to the photograph, \u201cis my son. His name is Adam. He's a great boy. Rich, smart, funny, <br>\r\ncompassionate...he's going to make someone very happy someday. I know he's made me and his father happy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I know that each of are wondering why you are here. You're here because of a ritual prophecy that's has <br>\r\nbeen running in my family for a very long time, and the Fates have chosen each of you to be elements for the <br>\r\nritual. I've tried. I've really, really tried to avoid having to do this, but it's impossible. We are but but <br>\r\nplaythings for the gods! The English translation of the prophecy goes like this: \u201cFour wives for one husband, <br>\r\nin every third generation . Two will be petite, two will be tall, one will be gorgeous above the rest, and one <br>\r\nnot at all. Four wives for one husband, that's the way things ought to be, and if you have something to say <br>\r\nabout it, you'll just have to find the key!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou've each been injected with a slow acting potion, due to fully metabolize in each of your bodies in eleven <br>\r\ndays. Every day for these next eleven days, you'll all gain certain new traits. Your skin will become smoother <br>\r\none day, and the next your voice will crack an octave. For every day of these eleven days, you'll <br>\r\nincrementally become more slender, more graceful, more beautiful, more feminine until, on the last day, all <br>\r\nbut one of you will be young ladies suitable enough to marry my son.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, this is officially like Saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou all might be asking yourselves, why didn't I just kidnap a bunch of women instead? It's because men <br>\r\nunderstand how to best pleasure another man. It's been said that a woman's prerogative is to care for her man, <br>\r\nand her children, but I'm of the mind that that's all socially constructed nonsense. Take a man, make him a <br>\r\nwoman, and she'll instantly understand both. And vice versa, of course. I should know since I've dabbled in a <br>\r\nbeing a man before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy two chairs down from mine suddenly gave a very WTF look with his eyes when she said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm a sorceress, gentlemen. I can do lots of things. Witness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsmeralda snapped her fingers, and suddenly we were released. I ran out of the room first, through a bunch of <br>\r\nother rooms of what looked like a very expensive house, and out the front door...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho's story do we follow?</span></div></div>",
