            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Captain Pete. Thats what they use to call him. Back before all the Heartless came and he started traveling to new worlds. Before he became the servant to a stupid witch, before becoming an outlaw and leader of a gang. Before Queen Mini locked him in another universe after he nearly killed his arch enemy, one time friend, Mickey Mouse. Or as they call him know, King Mickey. Back when all he wanted was his Steamboat, good food and drink, and a nice place to sleep. Now he was no longer happy with any of it, even when he got his steamboat back it was hollow and meaningless. Many villains felt this way, thats why they tried to take over the world or something, they were just trying to fill a need that they had but didn't understand. So they were always trying to do greater and greater things, never happy with what they had in life even if they didn't understand why. Pete was once like this, he thought that if he could become king or empire or something he would be happy. His plans got bigger and bigger until eventually he was locked away in another dimension. But during that time in his hell he came to understand what he really wanted out of life. All Pete wanted was to beat Mickey, take every thing he had and then watch as he tried to survive with nothing. Just like he did to him all those years ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete was in his room as he thought back to the days before Mickey caused all this to happen to him. He did this when ever Merlefercant gave him time off after trying to scare him into thinking she was going to kill him. He couldn't help but smirk at the idea that the witch really thought she scared him as much as she thought she did and that she thought she had all the power. He did fear her, a little, he wouldn't lie about that because she was damn scary. But Pete know that she needed him way more than he needed her, even if she didn't know it. He ran her army for her, kept her allies in line, and made sure her plans went as best they could. With out him what power she had left would fall to pieces. But without her Pete would just find another \"master\" to take her place.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThats what Pete did best, survive. He would use these more powerful villains, help them with what ever insane plan they had to take over the world, and when that failed, he would just leave and find some other person to leech off of. And Merlefercant was no different, just another moron who didn't know when to be happy with what they had. But Pete know what he wanted, and he knew that he would one day reach it, so long as he survived. And he did, he always did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant fat cat's thought turned from the present and back to the past. He let his thoughts drift back to when he was forced down this dark path were he would become nothing more than a pawn for morons. If he had only known were his actions that day would led him. He would have strangled that shrimp with his bare hands. The day he meet Mickey Mouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Mickey. Thats what they called him know. Mickey sat in his throne room, his crown feeling heavier than normal. It always did when he thought about his one time friend, now arch enemy, Pete. Peopled told him all the time that what happen to Pete wasn't his fault and that the fat cat made his own decisions that lead him to were he is. But deep in his heart Mickey still felt guilty, that maybe the only reason he was wearing this crown now was because he ruined his best friend's life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMickey wished he could help the evil fat cat, save him from his own anger, and from the past that still haunted both of them. Or at least make his friends see just how dangers Pete really was. Tell them that they need to stop thinking he his the fat idolt they think he is. They didn't understand just how smart Pete is in his simply way, how far he would go just to survive, how they would think that just because they were able to beat him once or twice that meant he was no threat to them. But Mickey knew, he seen just what his arch enemy was truly capable of. He saw that no matter how many times he was defeated Pete always managed to get away. What most people saw was a fat dumb bully that ran at the first sign of trouble, Mickey know that underneath that extra was  a man who cared so little about those around him that he would let them think he was that dumb bully so long as he won in the end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs mouse king thought about his history with one of him most dangers foes, he couldn't help but let his mind drift back to the day were it all started. The day that would forever change their lives. If Mickey had known about any of this he would have .... done something. Anything to save that over weight steamboat captain form his fate. The day he meet Captain Pete. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day started off so normal, it was sunny and warm. Birds were singing in the sky, and the people of the Magic Kingdom were going about their business. Of course you couldn't see that from the inside of Captains Pete small quarters on his boat the SteamBoat Willy. He kept the blinds closed and the room was filled with the smoke from his cigar. The whole room was fairly messy, the bed was unmade, dirt covered the floor, and clothes hung were ever he threw them, the worst bit was his desk, not only did papers and pens covered the top and filled the draws to bursting but it was covered with crumbs and stains from all the meals he had eaten there. But Pete kind of liked the mess, it made him feel like the place was his and no one else's. He wasn't big into other people, he had a hard time trusting them and after awhile they always got on his nerves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even he couldn't run a steamboat by himself, even if he was the best captain on the river with the fastest boat he still needed a good deck hand. His last one had run off on him. \"Wimp.\" Pete thought to him self as he looked through the resumes. The biggest problem for the Captain was that not only did his reputation as good sailor get out but also his temper was now becoming legendary. So few people wanted to work for the great and terrifying Captain Pete that he only got three people that wanted the job. He all ready saw the first two this morning and they seemed to be nothing but cowards and thieves. The only one left was a pipe quick named Mickey Mouse. \"I just hope he doesn't wet his bed the first night.\" Thought Pete as he groined in his mind. He then bellowed in his deep voice, \"NEXT!\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mickey Mouse was standing outside of the big doorway with the sign \"Captains Quarters\" hanging on the door knob. Earlier there were two bigger, tougher, and stronger looking fellers who went in before him, both times they came out looking as angry as heck. Mickey guessed that Captain Pete turned them away. And if Captain Pete, a man known for taking some of the most dangers jobs on the river, turned down those two guys what would he want with someone as small and as scrawny as Mickey. But the young mouse was running out of options, he needed a job and fast. Back home he had no food and the rent was due, so if he failed here he would wind up on the streets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind Mickey Mouse tried to imagined him self as a big strong Key Blade user who was about to enter a monster's cave and fight the beast. He sat up strait, pushed out his chest and giving the best heroic look he could do, and in his head he pictured himself as a mighty hero.  For a moment he really did feel braver and more confident. However that all went away when a deep massive voice bellowed from the inside of the cabin, \"NEXT!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his fear Mickey slowly walked up to the door and opened it. As he did he was hit by a wave of black tobacco smoke that made him gag for air, beyond that was a dark smoke filled room that really did look like a monster's cave. And behind a messy desk sat the monster. \"He is huge!\" Thought Mickey, he heard the stories of just how big and scary Pete was and they did fill his heads with pictures of a giant demon like cat that could use his bones as a tooth pick. Mickey could see he wasn't really that big, but through the darkness all Mickey could make out was a massive frame, lit end of a cigar, and two eyes that were locked on to him. Standing there with those two angry eyes staring directly at him made Mickey feel even smaller than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete stared at the little mouse for a moment, shivering at the sight of him. He nearly life at the sight, the other two had just came walked into his office like they had already got the job. They were arrogant and foolish, and on his boat only Captain Pete was allowed to be arrogant. They were also rude and had huge egos, again something only Pete was allowed to have on his boat. Pete could tell they wouldn't give a rat's ass about their jobs, or his boat only the money that came their way. However this tinny little mouse was different, he seemed like the kind of guy that would be happy with any job he got and would know to keep inline and not try anything stupid. After a minuet thought of waiting for him to come in Pete's non-existing patins was fed up. \"Stop your gawking and get in here!\" Ordered Pete once more in his huge voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMickey followed the order with out question and hurried inside. \"Now shut the door.\" Order the dark figure with a quieter but still rather scary tone, Mickey obeyed out of fear of getting eaten by the giant. By the time he turned around his eyes had adjusted to the darkness and could make out the shadowy figure. He was a hug and bulky black cat with a somewhat big belly, but underneath that fat was a solid wall of muscle. His huge arms looked like thick tree branches and his hands were the size of Mickey's head. All he was wearing was captains hat and a pair of worn out overalls with a single strap on his right shoulder. But it was his face that kept Mickey's attention. Mickey was pretty good a reading people, he could often tell what kind of person he was dealing with just by looking at their faces but Pete was different. He looked mean and tough, yet also lonely and afraid to trust people. He also looked like an arrogant fool that would always let his pride and anger control him, and yet he also seemed to be smarter than most people would think. This made Mickey confused, which made him even more scared of the huge cat.      <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete took a good look at the tiny mouse that was sitting in front of him. He was wearing a pair of red shorts with two huge white buttons and a pair of yellow shoes, both looked old but clean and well maintained. Pete could also see that he was scared of the huge steamboat captain, yet he could also see a bit of bravery and loyalty in there that was covered by self doubt, not the self preservation like the other two had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was also seeing that Mickey was at least smart enough to keep his trap shut, so Pete decided to see if he was smart enough know how to open it. \"So Mickey Mouse, why do you want to be my deck hand? Your fairly young, you are quivering like a leaf, and you are tinny. I need someone I can trust not to run at the first sign of trouble.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,... Uh... Captain Pete.\" Mickey stammered, which seemed to make Pete even madder. \"I know I'm small and skinny, but I wouldn't just run away when there's trouble. I would do stick with my Captain.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete gave Mickey an odd look, surprised by the fact he actually believed the pip squeak. \"Ok pip squeak, but you didn't answer my first question. Why do you want to be my boat hand, I can see that your scared out of your pants by me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMickey thought for a moment, thinking that he should tell the Captain he always wanted to have an adventure on the river (which was partly true) but the angry look on Pete's face Mickey could tell that he would see right through his lies, he was after all an awful lier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath Mickey said, \"I really need the money. I have nothing left, no job, no food, and soon I'm going to lose my home. I don't want you to think that I'm just going to sell you up the river or anything, I just want a good job with a paycheck not riches.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumpy Captain was impressed by his honesty, unlike the last to bone heads who made up some dumb stories of wanting adventure. \"Listen tinny you don't need to feel bad about wanting money. This job is no dream, it will require hard labor followed by ether danger or more often boredom. So if you said you didn't want any money out of this I would have thrown you out for lying. But you seem like an honest kid that understands loyalty and what being a deck hand is really about, so you get it the job. Be here tomorrow morning at the crack of dawn we have large order to deliver and I need to start your training.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big black cat then tossed the tinny mouse out the door before Mickey could react he then turned back to his desk, wiping his hands off and muttering to himself. \"I like that boy.\"   </span></div></div>",

To Pete it looked like the little guy was trying to out run the sunlight before it reached the boat. By the time he got to the top of the ramp he was out of breath and painting. \"Well color me surprised!\" Which Pete said in his normal deep booming voice. \"Your on time. Now go stuff your stuff down in the cargo hold next to the hemlock. That is were you're be sleeping. Then meet up at the steering wheel and I can start your training.\" Pete then turned around and walked off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMickey was a bit put off by his new Captain's roughness but like the good deck hand he wanted to be he followed his orders. Mickey then spot the crane that lifted things in and out of the boat. With his sack in his teeth he climb down the rope with ease. He searched around for a few minuets until he found his new sleeping quarters. It was as Captain Pete, an old worn out hemlock that was covered in patches. It was in the far right corner so at least he would have some protection form the elements and his Captain was also nice enough to proved two blankets, a thick one for cold nights and lighter one for warmer nights. It wasn't much but Mickey appreciated that he would have a roof over his head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Mickey place his bag underneath his hemlock he then crawled up the rope and made his way to the steering wheel. When he made it to were Captain Pete was standing he saw a very grumpy look on Pete's face. \"Uh... Anything wrong Captain?\" Mickey asked nervously. \"There is a stair case that leads to the hold.\" Said Pete as he pointed to a small square hole on the deck. \"I'll remember that next time Captain.\" Said Mickey.    </span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This is the story of how Mickey Mouse went from being an deck hand to becoming a king and the savior of the world. It also about how Pete went from being a respected steam boat captain to one of the most feared villains in the universe. Now I know many people are going to wonder why I would choose Pete as a main character. Well it's because he is ovisly important to the Kingdom Hearts story, why else would they give him his own level about his past. I think he has a much bigger role to play in the game and this story is about how his and Mickey's past relationship has effected them selves and their world. I also like how Pete is different from other villians in the game. He isn't as book smart as they are but he does take a more practical look at his plains and knows to always have a way out.  <br>\r\nRules: Try to keep the characters close to what they were in the game, so keep Pete acting like an idiot. But I want you to remember Pete is not as dumb or as wimpy as they show in the game. He may not be book smart but he is a survivor and usually has a plan of action he also knows when to fight and when to run. So most of the characters can assume Pete is stupid when they first meet him but I want him to be using this to his advantage. <br>\r\nI don't want to see sex, swearing, or to much death and blood. If you want to kill a charicter that is fine just don't make it to bloody. You can also have lesbians and gays in the story if you want, just no sex. <br>\r\n</td>",
