It was a brown soft thing, and after some seconds he saw the rest of the room and realized that he had shrunk -\"WHAT THE...AM I SHRUNK??!!- thought to himself. Then, he thought -\"T...This...this is impossible...people don't shrink, that just happens on Sci-Fi or...I don't know...Fantasies?...or...Is this a strange dream? or...\"- He was cut off when he heard booming steps, he saw his now gigantic girlfriend walking toward the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake pinched himself, believing that this couldn't be nothing but a Nightmare, but it wasn't...he was really 2 cms tall...-\"Blake?...Blake?...Where are you?\"- Joana said -\"Ah, crap\"- Blake thought -\"Where did he go?\"- muttered Joana and walked toward the couch. -\"Oh, Dammit...I'm gonna die in the stupidest way ever!!\"- Joana turned around and was about to sit on her boyfriend without even knowing it. He stared at her now gigantic and beautiful ass, paralyzed by the fear and the awe...But the fortune goddess was on his side, Joana stopped because she saw the control on the couch's pillow she was going to sit on and took it with her hand, and inmediately looked at a strange tiny thing. Blake thought for a moment -\"Thank god, I didn't want to die as a cushion...\"- but he was cut off again when he noticed that Joana was looking at him, and got her hand closer to him, trying to pick him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake instinctively tried to avoid it but naturally Joana's hand was faster than the shrunk guy, and  having taken him, she looked with a closer view. -\"Can this be a bug?\"- -\"Oh f@#k, I was so close...\"- Blake muttered and was interrupted by Joana's soft voice -\"Blake...is that you?\"-. He couldn't believe it, she recognized him!! He was so happy in this moment but soon talked to her because he didn't want to make her believe that she was just hallucinating. -\"Yeah...It's me, Joana\"- Blake said -\"How did you get...this small??\"- -\"I don't know\"-Blake said, saddly, and lowered his head. Joana tried to comfort him -\"Why are you sad?, I mean this is bad but I'm with you, and I won't let anything bad happen to you,my love\"- You could't help but smiled shyly, and Joana continued -\"And you are SO CUTE when you smile...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? (By the way Blake won't change size except if he's able to return back to normal, and his voice is still audible to a normal person, I repeated this just in case)</span></div></div>",

Oh no!' And she checked her shoes. There was nothing. If she crushed her beloved boyfriend, it should be a red stain, or in the floor, but there was anything.

If there were posiblities that this machine hurt you, believe me, I'd never test it on you\"- Blake was relieved, after all, Karina has been a very long friend of him, even longer than Joana (Blake and Karina met since 9 years old). Joana took Blake a bit roughly this time and she hugged him. It was a very tight hug and Blake felt himself sinking in Joana's breast as Karina continued -\"Blake, your whole body is about 90% more resistant, so, you can't be crushed anymore, except with an intense force like an intentional stomp, which you would even resist and I don't think Joana would even think about do that to you\"- Joana was still huggin Blake and Karina concluded -\"But don't hope to be able to lift up your girlfriend or even me...your muscles are only about 15-20% stronger only\"- Then Joana released her hug and they three talked about many things for about two hours. Then Joana and Blake said goodbye to Karina and went to Joana's house.</span></div></div>",

Blake was frozen when he saw almost in slow motion how Joana turned around and sat down. Her huge ass now looked like a planet!! In fact, each of her buttocks were as huge as one. And the worst...it was going to crush him to dust definitively. Joana stopped for a moment and thought if she wasn't gonna crush her boyfriend again underneath her big ass, so she checked the bed and despite Blake cried and waved his arms (he wasn't paralyzed anymore), she couldn't notice her one millimeter tall boyfriend, and turned around to sit down again. Blake saw in fear how her gargantuan rear came rushing down on top of him, and felt the weight of Joana's glutes. <br>\r\n-\"I ...I am going to die...\"- said to himself Blake, he now was so small that Joana wouldn't feel him under her and maybe she never would know that he died beneath her gigantic rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake felt himself under an inmense pressure, underneath his girlfriend enormous backside, it felt like being crushed by a soft but still heavy planet, all that weight on his body. Despite he was stronger, he knew he wouldn't be able to resist for long.

Blake saw some remembers of his life and knew that this was the end <br>\r\n-\"J...Joana...maybe you'll never know you killed me...but...I love you...ughhhhhh\"- those were the last words Blake could said muffled by the flesh before being totally crushed.

What was Joana doing? He thought that she was in SUPER panic mode right now. And what was Cinthya going to do with him, due to the fact she hated him. There was going to be hell to pay for Blake when he got to Cinthya's house. Blake then wondered, is this somekind of twisted conspiracy? Soon, he saw light for the first time in a while. It must have been hours since lunch that he saw light. He didn't want to see light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Blake.\" Cinthya said with a smile, an evil one at that.<br>\r\n\"Hi.....Cinthya.\" Blake said.<br>\r\n\"So how long you have been this way?\"<br>\r\n\"About a day.\"<br>\r\n\"I think I am going to enjoy this.\" <br>\r\n\"LET ME GO BACK TO JOANA!\" Blake said in anger, he knew it was wrong in this case.<br>\r\n\"You think you have the right to talk to me like that at YOUR size?\" Cinthya said. \"I mean, I could kill you Blake. It wouldn't take me any effort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's the last thing Blake wanted to think about. DEATH. It would ring in his mind for a long time until he was back to normal. After having a near a death experience, he didn't want to think about DEATH. Even when that healing machine made him stronger tu crushing, he felt instinctively that he couldn't be inmortal and in some point, if Cinthya wanted to kill him, she would do it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, just don't kill me.\" Blake said. \"Do whatever you want, just don't kill me.\" Said with some desperation while thought in a way to escape, or something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was going to happen to Blake.</span></div></div>",

Blake wasn't able to imaginate more things, those two were horrible enough to not sleep in three days...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour before...In school...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana went to get her purse and saw that Cinthya left... she thought she wouldn't watch her things since she still probably hated her because of Blake... Cinthya was wrong anyways, She didn't really love him and Joana knew who was he truly... Cinthya only knew the fighting guy who beated many times many bullies around the school...who strangely was pretty smart for not being a nerd (And Blake ISN'T a nerd...he never studies for tests, excepting by Math and Physics, numbers aren't his area) and she wanted him even knowing Joana was his girlfriend (They were together since the end of 9th grade, and Cinthya appeared about 4 months later, in first semester of high school). Joana din't think much about it and went to her last classes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich were Chemistry and Biology, she was so busy and didn't talk to Blake, not knowing that even if she did, she would be speaking alone. The final bell rang and everyone got out from the classroom... Joana remembered about her tiny boyfriend and said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Honey, I'm sorry for not saying anything... But at last it's time to go home...\"- She had no answer <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"- Joana checked her purse and didn't find Blake... -\"Blake?!\"- She was getting worried about him... Why Blake wasn't in her purse? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake...please, this isn't fun\"- Joana was begging to Blake, hoping that only all it was a simple joke of her shrunk boyfriend...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Joana was getting in panic, and tried to step back with her mind and regain what happened in all that day... but before she could get it, many thoughts came to her mind, a tiny Blake falling from her purse in any moment and being stepped or sat on by people, even her... 'that can't be...I've been very careful...And when I sat on him the first time, I felt him clearly...' Joana only had a weak relief that at least she didn't kill him... She looked in the places where she was until the lunch time and didn't find any stain (if he was crushed his stain would be still there, janitors clean school half hour after last ring), and, Joana really didn't want to find a little stain like it was on her couch when she sat on him (which Joana doesn't want to remember or mention EVER)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana the got it... Blake disappeared just in the moment she left her purse and Cinthya \"watched\" it and mysteriously left before she was done in the bathroom... Cinthya definitively took him... The question is... Will Joana rush in Cinthya's house and fight her to get Blake back (for the ones who like catfights...) or will she plan a smarter method?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing forward, to Blake's torture moment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was still with his eyes closed when he felt a finger push him on his stomach <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey lazy bug! Time to worship me!!\"- Cinthya got tired of waiting Blake unconsciousness, and after putting him on her palm, she said with an evil smile <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Guess what task have I for you now?\"- Blake thought, like he was talking to his girlfriend 'Joana...What are you doing!! Come here and smack this bitch's face'  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"argh...I can't save myself...dammit...What now?\"- Blake sighed and asked to his \"master\"...</span></div></div>",

Good people that are pure of heart go to a clouded place with a golden gate.\" Lith smiled, <br>\r\n\"Yet we are alone, because we are different Blake. You will find it out later.\" Blake looked at the girl, questions bubbled in his eyes.<br>\r\n\"Wait! Lith! Why am I different? Lith!\" Blake yelled, getting up. He fell to the ground.

I can't walk!!\"- He returned inmediately and said -\"It's ok, don't worry Joana\"- as he lifted her up and carried her in his arms, Blake walked for about 2 minutes and then felt weak, and fell down, Joana remained on him and they both got unconscious...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake woke up first (he was more resistant due to his physical condition) and could hardly move, he was under a gigantic and soft objet, which was strange 'What the heck am I under?!

The first school day passed, everything was new, but Blake managed to survive to that, and the final bell rang. Almost everyone ran out of the school, but Blake remained in calm, he just thought how pathethic were those children, and he was calmly leaving when he saw a bully threatening a girl, holding her by the throat and was about hit her... Blake regained his memories and thought 'I just can't let this one to do that...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, when the bully was about to punch the poor girl was interrupted -\"Stop it, you coward!!\"- Blake said -\"Shut up, this is none of your business, Blake\"- -\"Let her go now...\"- -\"I won't, and...what are you going to do about it?\"- George answered -\"This!!\"- And saying this Blake hit him in the stomach, making him release the girl. Then the fight started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was accustomed to fight those guys, in fact, he grew up fighting them, and this one wasn't a real threat, since he had fought stronger ones and this was just a jackass. Blake dodged esaily George's hits, and hit him 3 times in the head and a stomach kick to make him fall down. George was on ground and with his face bleeding -\"It's over, George, you know that you just can't fight me, so, stop annoying people or I won't spare you next time\"- Blake said finally -\"There won't be a next time!\"- George said and deployed a knife, quickly slashing Blake's right arm (he blocked it, the slash was going to his face). Blake just blew him in the face and fell down, knocked down finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was still calm and just took a pink backpack that George released before the fight started, and going toward the girl, only said -\"I think, this is yours\"- He said, a bit roughly, since he hadn't much friends and that was one of the very few times he helped other person (Almost always fought to defend himself), the girl took it and said -\"Thank you\"- And gave him a hug, Blake was surprised by this, he never had been hugged ever since he's got memory. And for a moment, forgot his wound's pain. Then he released himself from the hug and said -\"I have to go...\"- He started to walk when was interrupted -\"Hey, you're injured\"- -\"Don't worry about me, this happens all the time\"- -\"I can't let you go like that, after all, you saved me, and the least thing I could do would be to heal your wound\"- -\"What the...?!\"- He didin't even finished the pharse because she grabbed him by the left arm and took it to a tree that was nearby. -\"I'm serious, this isn't necessary\"- Blake replied, not accustomed to...being healed by someone...-\"Oh just stay here\"-  the girl said, while she took out a bandage and started to heal him, and put some alcohol on the wound, she stopped thinking that this had to hurt...and after some seconds, she asked:-\"Don't you feel pain?\"- -\"I'm accustomed to that\"- Blake answered. After some minutes, she was done with the bandage and said: -\"That's all\"- Blake could feel some sadness in her voice, but he couldn't understand anything about all this. He was leaving when he turned around and talked to her: -\"By the way...I'm Blake and...-\" Blake was trying to think something to say and he only could say -\"...be careful with those guys, they have no compassion with anyone\"- the girl came closer to him and gave him another hug -\"I'm Joana...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is how all started... </span></div></div>",

Joana tried to be friendly to Blake but it was hard at first, he never had a friendship with a girl (in fact, she's the first girl he met). He almost always went alone, wandering in the school, getting into fights, his original lifestyle he had since ever. But Blake had noble feelings, many times, the guys he fought threatened to have their revenge on Joana and that forced him to go with her wherever she went only to protect her from those guys. Joana didn't know this for a while. She even started to think that Blake was a cold guy who hadn't any feeling. And a day that he was lonely, she decided to ask im about that: -\"Blake...why you...ehm...why are you so cold toward...me?\"- Blake was surprised by this question -\"Huh?...Really, I...I just don't know about treat people, I've been always lonely and I'm not accustomed to this, and...I'm sorry, I didn't want to hurt your feelings\"- Blake said, almost neutrally since he hadn't shown much emotions. Joana decided to talk with him about that and why he was this way. After some hours she discovered that Blake grew up in low streets and  his mother (father died) was a true demon who punished him for almost anything with cable hits. Joana felt heself like crying inside, she never had thought this was the past Blake had...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was affectionate with him as possible, (even though he didn'tn like hugs very much at first), and after knowing this, she became even more affectionate to him, but Blake tried to understand her, and the girls' way to be friendly. The months passed and a lot of things happened, like this:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA day, Joana was talking with Ayrton (Blake's secondary best friend, except by her) and in the talking Ayrton told her that Blake always had been protecting her from many guys who tried to get their revenge on her. She couldn't talk for a moment, and felt bad with herself because she thought that Blake never cared about her, and Ayrton continued -\"I don't know if Blake even knows the love but at least he always has been willing to receive the hits instead of you\"- Joana felt very happy, and thought 'Blake always has been noble with me and I didn't even noticed it...' Blake came (a bit wounded as always) and Joana didn't say anything and hugged him and Blake, surprised by this asked -\"Why was this?\"- and Joana smiled and said -\"Because you have been protecting me and I thought you were an insensitive\"- Blake only blushed a little which surprised both Ayrton and Joana, but she was happy with that...</span></div></div>",

The things were quiet until a day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big guy appeared blocking way to Blake and Joana, Blake inmediately went in front of her and was in guard, ready for the worst, and the big one laughed and said -\"So...you're the one nobody beats, huh? and the one who protects this girl though she isn't even his girlfriend?\"- -\"That's not of your business, and I protect her because she's my friend and nobody must be injured by my own fights\"- Blake answered, with some anger since this one was the worst school bully...Ivan (yes the same that years after Blake would kick easily) -\"So, do you want to play, Blake?\"- -\"I don't fight for idiots' pleassure\"- -\"Well then, I'll have to obligate you!!\"- and with this he tried to punch Joana, she covered herself in fear but didn't feel anything and saw that Blake intercepted the blow receiving himself -\"Blake!\"- was the only thing she could scream and he, calmly said -\"Don't worry, I know you don't like me to fight but I won't let this guy hurt you in any way!\"- Blake said and started his life's fight. Joana remained silent but she almost cried b inside with those words, thinking 'You always say that and go fighting...but...will it ever end?'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake started, this was one of his hardest fights, he was a good fighter but was on extremely physical disadvantage (he was just a 13 years old against a mastodon) he easily connected fists and kicks but nothing seemed to hurt Ivan too much, as he laughed -\"You bug, you can't even hit me, you only tickle me!\"- Blake thought to himself  'Dammit...I won't be able to keep fighting with this guy for too long'. After several minutes Blake was pretty tired and Ivan wasn't hurt at all. Then, he said -\"Now it's my turn!\"- As he blowed a weakened Blake with the hardest punch, sending him a meter away, and he couldn't even get up since Ivan started to hit him brutally, leaving him worst than ever, but even with that, many years of fighting made Blake stronger than average boys, and he could resist for a while, being able to stand up (very, very injured) and trying to keep the fight, being thrown to ground by Ivan, hitting his face against the floor and stomped by Ivan's feet...Joana was horrorized at seeing this and couldn't resist, she started to cry...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was being blown when for a moment he could see Joana's crying...and thought 'This is all my fault...she doesn't deserve to suffer for a guy like me!' And connected some hits but Ivan wasn't hurt, then Ivan threw him against lockers, hurting him a lot but the pain of the wounds wasn't stronger than knowing that he was making Joana suffer, even when he didn't know that they both loved mutually...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana stepped in to stop the fight and said angerly -\"Stop it, Ivan!\"- And his answer was -\"Shut up, cheap bicth!\"- and he smacked her against the wall, that was his last move. Blake saw almost in slow motion what happened and, he felt like something inside him crashed into thousands of small pieces, and became furious, furious as he never had been before, and with his last energy, he stood up again and said furiously: -\"IVAN!!! THAT...WAS...YOUR...LAST...MOVE!!!\"- And not knowing how he ran toward him and hit with his strongest punch  in face, making Ivan to fall down, knocked out. Blake didn't even took care about himself, he inmediately came where Joana's and said: \"I'm sorry...all this was my fault\"- the he helped her to get up and then, he fell down since he used all his strenght to defeat that mastodon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, while Blake was unconscious in nursery, Joana said softly -\"I love you, Blake...I'd like you to know it\"- as she stayed with him while he was asleep...</span></div></div>",

Your name is almost the same, and it sounds like some cheesy superhero!\" They teased Blaze and his grin grew, <br>\r\n\"Blake's mine, do you think you can beat him? Yes... of course you can...

Something changed in Joana's instincts, because now she felt herself more affectionate and protective to his now tiny and defenseless boyfriend. Consciously, she never had seen Blake as someone she had to protect, he always protected himself and the people who mattered to him...but now all it was different, he wouldn't even survive 5 minutes alone and shrunk in school if he wasn't that lucky that he was with his girlfriend in the right moment. She walked carefully where Blake was lying and picked him up delicately. And she stared at him with a sweet look 'Aww, he looks so cute now...' was Joana's thought and she caressed him softly with her index finger, feeling his warm and even his hair, which Joana always liked. There elapsed some minutes before Blake recovered consciousness. Then, he awoke and saw thet he was in a strange place, it was warm and soft, and it had strange lines, before he could figure out where the hell was he, he felt a soft warm air draft and he turned around and realized about 2 things: Joana was HUGE!! and he was on her hand!!...He inmediately understood that he was the small one. But would Joana notice that it was he or he looked like a bug to her? He now was very afraid, he could accept almost any way to die but he never would like that Joana (even when she wasn't his girlfriend) hurt him, she was the only person Blake would trust his own life and the only who made him feel happy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana saw in Blake's small eyes that he felt himself helpless and was scared about her, so, she decided to calm him down -\"Blake...- she started to say in a very soft voice, almost sensual -I know it's you, don't worry. You're safe now\"- Blake was very relieved, he didn't even care about his safety but at least Joana knew his condition. and he answered to his girlfriend -\"I can't believe it...\"- -\"What?\"- Joana asked inmediately and almost slapped her forehead since he just shrunk and she asks what doesn't he believe... -\"I'm really lucky to be your boyfriend\"- (It was rare for almost everyone he said something like this but he really felt the love's characteristic warmth inside him) Joana didn't say anything and hugged him very tightly, sinking him softly in her huge and precious breasts (even at normal size they were huge to Blake, she must be D cups at very least).

He said -\"Huh...thanks...\"- and decided to continue his way but before take a step the boy talked again -\"So, you can only beat weaklings like those?\"- Blake didn't know if taking that as an insult or a challenge, but didn't want to waste his time with a weird boy...Then, he didn't answer and began to walk -\"What about me, huh? Do you think you can beat me?\"- Blake stopped and said seriously -\"I DON'T FIGHT I HAVE NO REASON TO...then, why would I fight you? Leave me alone\"- Blaze answered -\"If you keep like that you'll never unleash your full strenght\"- -\"I'm strong enough to defend myself and people I care\"- -\"I don't think so...you can't even protect your girlfriend\"- Blake closed his fist when heard that...that was one of the few things which made him really angry, and decided to give this guy a lesson he'd never forgive -\"Okay then...you wanna fight?\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze only smiled and Blake attacked, punching him but Blaze blocked the fists, then, he threw punches also but Blake dodged them and reattacked with a kick, which Blaze dodged and, making a somersault, threw a strange upward kick which hit Blake, throwing him to the ground. Blaze stood up and said -\"Is that all? I thought you were stronger\"- There was no answer, just a furious Blake who connected a fist on his face and began to punch him in stomach and kicked several times, Blaze took some steps backward and said -\"That's was I was talking about, hehe\"- and the awesome fight continued, the fists and kicks were flying at incredible speed and they both dodged and connected many hits to each one. They were at the same level, or at least that seemed to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake took a step backward while breathe heavily -\"This guy is pretty strong, but he can't be stronger than Alexander...\"- he muttered, thinking about Alexander Santos, his nemesis, who was his enemy since he's got memory, he claimed for some sort of revenge for somethingt Blake doesn't know. Then Blaze, who was still like nothing happened, just a little damaged, said -\"Nice warming up, Blake, now here comes the real fight\"- 'THE WHAT?!' thought Blake, noticing Blaze was serious and he didn't deal real damage to him, despite they were at the same level...Blaze began to fight seriously, and Blake was barely able to stand up against him, his hits were now a lot faster and stronger, Blake couldn't dodge so many as he did previously, and Blaze now dodged almost every punch or kick he threw and the very few ones which hit Blaze didn't seem to cause real damage. Blake now was thinking what kind of beast was he fighting with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze laughed as he hit many times Blake and sent him hurling against a wall... -\"Ookay...you were a lot WEAKER than I thought you'd be\"- 'What the!!?' He thought 'Dammit beast...he can't be that strong' And, seeing how Blaze approached to him, he remembered to his father, 'Father...lend me your strenght, wherever you are' thought to himself and said furiously -\"I'll never give up!!\"- -\"Heh! Let's see how long you can say that\"- Blaze said as restarted the fight, which Blake was losing again because Blaze was far stronger anyone could imagine...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a frenetic and desperate fight where Blake barely dodged a few fists and kicks while tried to hit a Blaze's weakpoint, but there wasn't any, and, at the rate they were taking, Blake couldn't take it for so long. Blaze dodged Blake's fists and said -\"Too slow\"-, Kicking him and sending against an abandoned building, breaking part of a wall. Then, he said -\"Hey Blake, don't you think Joana is a very beautiful bitch?\"- There was no answer and he added -\"Those bugs are so fragile...aww...Why can't I have fun?\"- But the rubbles trembled as Blake reemerged from the rubbles, being totally furious, showing the fierce nature he had (he had this kind of state when defeated Ivan years ago), his eyes even became fully white and said -\"NOW I'LL SHOW YOU!!\"- Yelled as he dashed quickly toward him, hitting Blaze in stomach with a lot of strenght...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze said -\"Well at least I can get some more fun\"- The fight restarted again and this time was even more amazing, Blake near of his full strenght was like a beast and the punches and kicks were a lot faster, showing the two amazing warriors they were. Blake now balanced the fight being almost at the same level of Blaze, and after several minutes of a hard fight, they both got a little away and Blaze said -\"Even at your current state you can't win. My strenght and skills overwhelm yours\"- Blake only answered with more hits, and Blaze did so. Then...</span></div></div>",

Even when they were just friends, Joana acted very maternal and protectively with Blake (healed his wounds and was affectionate to him, she was protective to him also), and, the Blake's new size increased those instincts, that's one of the reasons Blake looked much more cuter to her at that size. Joana had still the hug on Blake while he thought 'Despite all this...I won't give up...I promised...to my father I'd never do that...happened what happened...'</span></div></div>",

(In high school she was more affectionate as normal girls but she still had, her own style).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze got up and said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, you wanna fight me, huh? I won't hold back just because you are a girl\"- Karina said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake, I'll take this one, rest for now\"- Blake replied <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Karina, it's not what you think, he's way too strong, you'll be killed, I only was almost at his level...with my fury...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarina remembered. Some years ago, when Blake was 9 and she 10, after some months they befriended, 5th grade bullies threatened them one day, and despite the fighting duo was almost unbeatable, they were being beaten by a bunch of 5th grade bullies, Karina and Blake were pretty injured and Blake fainted for a moment, Karina was about to, she just resisted more somewhat (Is supposed that men are stronger while women have more resistance, according with genetics). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when she fell down, and one of the bullies put her foot on her head, Blake got up, but he was strange, his hair spiked slightly (not very noticeable) and his eyes became fully white, he didn't say anything, just defeated all that bunch of bullies in question of seconds, mostly punching them or kicking in stomach and neck. Then, Blake looked at her for some seconds and fell down again, fainting, he muttered with a faint voice -\"...i won't...let you...\"- and went unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarina at first was scared about that kind of fury state but then she understood that Blake hardly ever reached those fury levels and that he was still somewhat himself, he didn't hurt people who mattered for him, only the ones who hurt him or her...Karina was the only who understood almost perfectly Blake's fury state until she explained to Joana when Blake went furious again in the fight with Ivan. And now...he lost a fight with that, supposed to be unbeatable in that form...would Blaze be really that strong that Blake couldn't defeat him even at furious state?</span></div></div>",

Karina connected many consecutive kicks (her speciality, and the first kind of move she used when fought Blake at first time), Blaze grabbed her leg and said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You lose\"- coldly, And threw Karina down, but she made a circular kick which made Blaze trip and fall. She then answered <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I told you...Never make angry a girl\"- Blaze knew that girls may be dangerous when hopped wild, but he was way stronger to be afraid of. He got up and blocked Karina's fists and said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I was just playing\"- punching her many times on stomach and kicking her, throwing her on Blake, who was still on the floor, not having enough strenght to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarina said after falling on Blake <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh...Sorry...\"- She got up and Blaze hit her again many times, leaving her almost injured as Blake was.

Blaze left saying <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You maybe are a worthy warrior, I hope to not be wrong, I'll fight you next time, soon...Survive for some time, when you were ready, I'll know...\"-</span></div></div>",

She decided to forget about it when she heard a faint voice, the doll was moving!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"puff...ugghh...\"- Blake got up with difficult, not knowing the big, or better said, little problem he had. Karina stared at him and looked that the \"doll\" was kind of hurt and his clother were damaged, just like...Blake? While she wondered about it, Blake muttered to himself after looking around (Karina was behind him and hadn't looked at her), <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ok...that was weird...that dammit Blaze shot at me cowardly, but...- He looked at his hands and arms, he was still hurt but not more than he was before falling unconscious, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...And...Shouldn't I be dead?...Or...no...this can't be heaven...or hell, right?\"- Blake muttered while seeing the strange world he was now. Which he didn't know is that his words were his saviors, because Karina recognized his voice, and when she did, she picked him up quickly (maybe a bit roughly) and hugged him tightly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake, I'm so happy to see that you are alive!!\"- Blake was surprised by this, he was quickly lifted up and squashed against a soft and warm thing, then he heard Karina's voice and after fractions of seconds he realized the terrible truth...he was shrunk, S-H-R-U-N-K, tiny, weak, puny, defenseless, and practically a bug with clothes...Those thoughts were on his mind, he was in a situation where he would have all disadvantages...he was sad and angry because Blaze did that to him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince he was being squashed, he answered to Karina <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"..well...I won't be so much longer at this rate...\"- Karina released him inmediately and said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sorry...I...I just thought you disappeared or were dead...\"- and blushed slightly, she always worried about him and even protected him in some fights where Blake was weakened by fighting many thugs and they were still more. She had a protective behavior to him, but it had its own style (Joana is technically a lot more protective but she rarely fights). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And...I didn't see...why are you so small and where's that weirdo?\"- She placed him on her palm to let him to talk, he explained <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"First, that weirdo's name is Blaze, I know it sounds like a kind of cheesy hero or something like that but he has an overwhelming fighting level, well you know that, and...after leaving you unconscious, he shot at me with a strange gun, it looked like a futuristic thing or a toy, and then, he said I had to survive in a more dangerous environment...and then, I'm here, squashed by my friend and telling my story\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both laughed, Karina was a little surprised Blake wasn't so sad or angry as she thought, despite being a fierce fighter, he han an impressive self control, which he only lost in a very few times (becoming extremely furious). He seemed to be calm, maybe because now he was safe and that he had hopes to find a way to get him back to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarina got up after some minutes with Blake on her palm and thought 'What should I do with him now?'<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And he said to Karina <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, you're right, after all, Joana is the most caring and affectionate person I know...\"- Then, realizing of what he said, he apologized with Karina <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't mean you are not caring, I'm just...agh, I'm just a jerk\"- Karina laughed and said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I got what you were saying, I'm not mad to that.

It took to her about half of an hour, but finally she arrived. After all, she wasn't that damaged as Blake was, at least...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knocked the door, and after some seconds, Joana opened the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hi Karina...\"- She saw Karina and asked with some fear  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What happened to you?\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ugh...I'm okay, Joana...but...\"- Karia tried to calm her down <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's going on, and why are you so injured?\"- Joana asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well...I helped Blake fighting a weird guy named 'Blaze', he was extremely strong, maybe stronger than a bear, he could even beat Blake at his furious state\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?!\"- Joana was now in panic <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And if you're THAT damaged...WHERE'S Blake??!!\"- Yes, Joana was in super panic now, and Karina didn't find a way to tell her the 'little' problem Blake had <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well...I don't know how to tell this...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake's dead??!!\"- Joana interrupted, being really worried about him, and Karina continued <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He's safe...\"- Joana rushed out and said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What are you waiting for? Blake need us and we can't let him like that\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarina knew Joana had that kind of behavior when it was something about Blake, she was really motherly in some times...and very protective, and decided to tell her about Blake being calm <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Joana, we don't need to go for him\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WHAT?! You crazy!!? Or...did you take him to hospital?\"- Joana calmed slightly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No, if I did that, they wouldn't let me go out and you'd be a lot more panicked than now because you wouldn't know anything\"- Joana answered <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, where's Blake\"- Karina was a little nervous about telling her because Joana may react as an angry lioness to her...she gulped and said -\"Weell...Take this little gift I brought for you and I'll explain you everything\"- Joana was getting angry, and even Karina, who was her friend and a very brave one, was afraid, Blake was right in a thing: ANGRY JOANA = YOU BETTER RUN OR DIE!!, fortunely for him this never applied to himself. She remembered why people was afraid to provoke Joana...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn 8th grade, almost in last months, after Ivan incident, Blake and Joana were normal, he recovered fully from that fight and was the same everyone knew (he didn't remember what Joana said to him while he was unconscious lying on the nursery bed). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana was a little saddened because she wasted her chance to asking him out, and despite he noticed something, Joana said it was nothing and since he almost never understood girls, he stopped thinking about that matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, Ivan appeared again to claim revenge, and, rushing in, he said angerly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake!! Fight me like a man!! Second round!!\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake stood in guard but before doing anything he saw Joana and felt the sadness in her eyes...he decided that this was time to change things, he stood normal and said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why have I to fight you again? I won and you're just scum, so, leave and let us in peace\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ivan laughed and answered <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You coward!! Are you afraid about round 2? Hah! I knew you were just a crybaby!!\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake closed his fists and said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, since I'm one, you're less than that because I'm stronger\"- He looked at Joana again, he felt like something in her was chaining him, and Ivan said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well here I come, you ready or not\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd hit with a fist which Blake dodged and locked him from behind, twisting his other arm and his back, making him bend backward, which may even break his spine with more strenght and said coldly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't need to fight to beat you\"- Joana smiled, not because of the combat, but because Blake wasn't fighting for her...Maybe there was hope for her, Blake wasn't insensitive, and was trying to not hurt her feelings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ivan regained strenght and grabbed Blake with his free hand and threw him forward, hitting him against a wall and then Ivan hit him in the body. Blake was about begin to fight but the thought about Joana's worries for him made him not fight at all, and, trying to dodge a hit, the fist hit him on the back of his neck and fell down, almost fainting, since the back of his neck resulted to be his weakpoint, but nobody knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvan just laughed and said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're weaker than I thought\"- And got closer to him, Blake just said with a fainting voice <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Joana...I'm sorry\"- and got unconscious <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(NOTE: Blake wasn't weaker, in fact, he was stronger than before but he wasn't able to fight because of Joana and that he was blown down on his weakpoint)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvan was about to finish him off when Joana ran there and stood in front of Blake, between him and Ivan and said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Stop it! I won't let you to hurt him anymore\"- Ivan laughed by the idea of Joana protecting Blake, he thought she was a weak girl and, like last time, he tried to slap her off, but Joana wouldn't let him this time, and stopped the hit with one hand (ONE HAND!!).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ivan realized something was wrong and said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the hell?! Why...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose were his last words, Joana only punched him in stomach with such a strenght that would have made Blake become frightened to her, and she said angerly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Never, never hurt my Blake again!!!\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvan was in so much pain and bent down, he fell on his knees and then he fell down completely, he almost popped his eyes with that fist hit and said with the few air he had left <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"u...ugh...how...how could this be...ughhhh...\"- he blacked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone took a step back when Joana looked at them, now the knew that seriously nobody should get Joana mad...(and the weird fact is that Karina is the fighting one, but Joana, due to his maternal instincts, uses the true strenght of a girl). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knelt down and hugged Blake, then, he woke up after some minutes (even being hit in his weakpoint, he was able to wake up quickly since this time he was practically intact. He saw Ivan thrown in the floor but he thought he lost control again, but unlike other times, Joana wasn't sad, and he felt a kind of inner power coming from her. For obvious reasons, nobody told Blake Joana blew out Ivan with one fist. And didn't even Karina (not wanting to be next) nor Joana (not wanting Blake afraid of her because she would never do that to him).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarina said in a scared tone <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Please, you first must take this and you'll understand\"- she saw the anger from Joana's eyes and quickly took out from her purse something which seemed to be a mini doll (2 cm). Karina put it on Joana's extended palm. She looked at it (Blake was in deep sleeping because of the fight) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This doll resembles to Blake, but what's with this? How does this tell me where's my boy?\"- Karina calmed her down and said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's hard to believe but the weird Blaze shot at him with a toy-like gun, and he shrank down to his current size..I mean...you have Blake on your hand...\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana was surprised by this and looked more carefully at her boyfriend, she was able to see his ripped shirt and his wounds (tiny to her). Suddenly, something in her happened, she felt more protective now that Blake was shrunk, and, more loving also. She began to caress him softly on his head and chest with her fingers, very softly. Karina said, opening the door <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well...I have to go...Take good care of him, please\"- And she left, maybe she was going to a nursery, or maybe she went with Ayrton. Anyways, now Blake was safe with her and that was the only thing what mattered for her..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[NOTE: What it was said in here doesn't mean Joana was an angry person or that she had anger problems, she hardly ever became in anger and just for Blake being in danger, just like a protective mother, unlike Blake's...]</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blake began to wake up, he just recovered enough energy to stand up normally, the last he remembred was Karina putting him into her purse and then he fell asleep since he was too tired and injured, now, he was staring at his gigantic girlfriend, who smiled to him. Blake, thinking she was about to scold him for fighting (which she never has done but Blake always thinks that she will)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just scratched the back of his neck and smiled nervously, thinking up a way to explain Joana his new size and the rest of the story, but, fortunely or unfortunely for him, she knew that gesture already, and said softly -\"Blake, my love. Don't worry. I know this isn't your fault\"- She brought him closer to her face and kissed him. Then, she said -\"Anyways, I never get angry at you, hehe\"- Joana said happily, closing her eyes. She looked very cute in that moment to Blake, and he said -\"It's okay...\"- Joana knew that when Blake answered vaguely it meant he really was in trouble, or at least he felt so. She wanted to comfort him because he's the only person she cares. -\"Blake...\"- She began to speak -\"Huh?\"- Blake seemed to be thinking, maybe about how would he live at that tiny size, or even how he may die...all that looked to be more than what he could bear. But he always went forward when he had trouble, he was stronger than this, Joana's voice interrupted his thoughts. -\"I...I don't want you to be sad...I'm here to take care of you\"- She hugged Blake and said -\"I'll always be here to protect you. I won't to let anything happen to you. Believe me\"- It worked, Blake was comforted, but the 'Believe me' made him think that she was hiding something from him or just emphasized her phrase. Then, the memories about Ivan's second fight came to him, and he remembered that he got unconscious and when woke up Ivan was already defeated and Joana was hugging him, which resulted to be strange if he had lost control...Joana almost always became sad until she realized he lost control only when someone hurt her (In other circunstances it would be more rarely he did), and that she was the only one able to calm his furious mode...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy? Well...Going back in time again...In 9th grade, when Blake almost stopped fighting because of Joana, and their feelings to each other were becoming more obvious, Blake fought a bully who wanted to defeat him and Blake accepted the challenge when he saw Ayrton was blown down by him. He was another overwhelming one, and the combat was almost equal because Blake was older, more skilled, and stronger than when he fought Ivan. But Joana appeared and tried to stop the fight, Blake was distracted by this and this guy blew him and hit brutally, sending him against a wall... Then, he threw Joana down to the floor when she tried to save Blake, and...He lost control. Blake became furious and began to kick that jerk's ass, defeating him easily, but, in difference to other times, he wasn't stopping, he was still punching and hitting him even after he gave up, and really was damaging him. Blake made him to spit blood when he kicked him in stomach, then he punched many times in face and wasn't done, he grabbed him on the neck and lifted him up, then hurled him several times against the wall (Blake doesn't speak in that state, so, he didn't say anything). After all that, he wasn't still done, Karina and Joana became afraid of Blake killed him and, remembering, there was no way to stop him. At least it seemed so. Blake at furious state didn't stop with nothing, that was that everyone believed since years ago. But Joana decided to do something, she walked a few steps toward him and said -\"Blake, stop it!\"- Everyone thought it was useless, but Blake stopped hurling the guy and then, seeing it was successful, Joana said -\"Please, let him go, he already learned that he must no bully anyone\"- Blake became confused, and for the first time, he released him. Joana walked toward him and said -\"Come here Blake, forget about that fool one\"- Blake now was very confused, even when his fury state almost always blocked everything else in his mind but he wasn't able to ignore Joana. And felt great pain in his head and body...he grabbed his head with both hands while bent with pain, the conflict inside him was incredible... Joana stared at him for a moment, then, the bully wanted to get his chance and hit Blake when he was vulnerable... he fell down and quickly got up, being more angry, but before he did anything else, Joana put her arms around him and kissed him...Everyone gasped since they never had done such thing and even weren't a couple yet. The most amazing thing was that Blake's fury state stopped, his hair went normal and the iris in his eyes returned, after some seconds, Joana looked at Blake and he only reached to say -\"J-Joana...I...\"- and fell down, losing consciousness. Never anyone thought that Joana would be able to calm Blake's fury such way. Blake didn't remember anything from this (He never has memories about what happens when he loses control)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake thought more deeply, and remembered why she wasn't sad as usually was when he lost control that day...he decided to ask it to her -\"Joana?\"- -\"What is it, sweetie?\"- she answered -\"Do you remember the day Ivan fought me and I refused to?\"- -\"How could I forget it! I....!!\"- She cut herself off before saying something else, Blake tipped off that something was hidden to him -\"I remember losing consciousness and then, when I woke up, Ivan was defeated, but you weren't sad as you always are when I lost control of myself...\"- Joana hesitated and, realizing Blake wanted the truth, she said -\"I'll tell you but promise me you won't be afraid of me\"- -\"Why would I?\"- asked Blake, disconcerted, and Joana answered -\"I...I wasn't going to let Ivan hurt you and I defeated him with a punch\"- -\"You WHAT??!!\"- that wasn't the kind of answer he would expect from her. Karina was supposed to be the fighting one, and she wasn't that strong. Joana said -\"I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to be frightened about me\"- She hugged him and said -\"I only did that because I love you\"- Then, Blake felt better, knowing that Joana was protective even when he wasn't shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she said -\"Now, let me heal you\"- She licked him several times, which was weird to Blake -\"Ermm...that was weird Joana...Why did you...??\"- Blake began to ask when Joana answered -\"I don't have bandages that small for you and I thought this would be the best way to heal you, and, I enjoyed doing it\"- she said jokingly, and then laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had tried to ask Joana out for two weeks but all that came out of his mouth was gibberish. Fighting was easy, but girls arn't.

It locked in place and he turned red, \"Have you seen the weather today? Very intense, well got to go!

Blake clenched his fists and tightly closed his eyes.<br>\r\n\"Hey lovely..\" Blake gazed back at a huge group of boys, there were about 13 of them. Blake was a good fighter... but not that good. He began to walk away,<br>\r\n\"Why not ditch Blake and have fun with a real man?\" Anger flowed through Blake's body, he spun around and saw Joana pinned to the wall by a guy with barely any neck. Worst of all, he was trying to kiss her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJef was having the time of his life untill he got hit by a truck. He flew down the hallway and skidded on his back. When his eyes focused he saw Blake lowering his nee.<br>\r\n\"Is he stupid or what?\" Shouted Jef's friend. Blake planted his heel on the boys chest and twisted. His other foot lifted off the ground and kicked the boy in the face. He landed gracefuly on one foot. His heel never left the boys chest. He pushed the big football player down and before Blake's foot touched the ground, he swiped another person. The gang snap out of there daze and fight back. Blake dodged fist after fist, and returned them the his attackers. Untill one of them got a good hit. Blood sprayed from Blake's mouth. More fists connected, Blake fell to his nee's and got beaten and kicked into the ground. They left him soaking in his own blood. Joana rushed to his side and lifted Blake's head, tears formed in her eyes,<br>\r\n\"That's the most stupid thing you have ever done! You could have died!\" Tears roled down her cheeks, Blake smiled and asked her to come closer.<br>\r\n\"Will... will you go out with me?\" Blake asked weakly before passing out. Joana sobbed and nodded her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go! All done.\" Blake snapped out of his story and examined the wound. Joana smiled, \"I remember the docters saying you would be allowed to leave the hospital in 3 weeks, but you sneaked out after the first day to pick me up for the date.\" They both laughed and the bell rang. Joana waved goodbye and walked to lesson's<br>\r\n\"That day was the best day of my life\" Blake grinned happily.</span></div></div>",

'Joana...' Was his first thought after realizing about this 'At lest I hope...If Cinthya caught me...I'm more than dead...' he thought while frozen strangely by an unknown fear to him, the fear to be unable to defend himself, his whole life he has depended on his fighting skills to protect himself until Karina and Joana appeared eventually in his life, and he had still fights to protect himself from bullies and some bad guys...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard muffled voices and then a door opening and closing, then he heard more clearly Joana's voice -\"Don't worry Blake...I know you think this is weird but I had no time to hide you...I won't squash you...just enjoy!\"- She said playfully, not expecting to hear an answer under her big butt, which was really hot despite the whole school drooled for Cinthya's... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd despite Joana's subtle attempts to seduce Blake while they were in Secondary (High school from 7th to 9th grade), she never was able to catch him glancing at her voluptuous body. She even wore some times tight clothes but Blake had such self control that he never stared at Joana's body when she wasn't looking. Despite in a talk with his friends, he finally admitted that Joana was hot to him. (It happened long before he asked Joana out, so, it hadn't really influence in Blake's decission, he did it by himslef after realizing that he loved her in any way and he didn't even know it clearly the previous times)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana was still holding her weight from her shrunk boyfriend when...</span></div></div>",

That thing shrank me!! One moment...I shrank? What the?!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could finish his thoughts he felt quakes that shook him, the quakes were rhythmical and he realized that they were footsteps, Blake made a quick calculation and, hoping it was Joana, he found out that the quakes indicated a person heavier than Joana. 'There are many possibilities...I better get outta here' Blake thought, and finding that he was still unable to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a big curved shadow covered the seat and he looked up in horror, it was Lillian!! and she didn't even check her seat, she turned around and showed Blake the reason of why he feared her now, her ass was huge!  He looked at the enormous buttocks that would sit where he was. She always had the biggest ass in school and even when he didn't care about it because he loved Joana, now was fearing to be crushed under her immense glutes. He neither knew the real danger, more dangerous than that huge ass is only Lillian herself, who had a big crush on Blake since 7th grade, a few days after Joana met him. And probably having him shrunk, she was going to keep him beneath her gigantic buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake also remembered that sometimes she tried to seduce him or to tease him by rubbing her butt or sitting on his legs when they were at secondary, and it hurt since Lillian had a heavy backside. She liked to sit on Blake because she knew he wouldn't be able to get up, she also had some times taken Blake's hands and playfully put them on her huge ass, though he immediately took his hands away, it was weird. Now, remembering, he thought 'Damn! I thought Lillian's ass was immense, but this is ridiculous'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge ass began to descend and Blake desperately tried to move out of its way, but, after he regained a few energy, he tried to escape and realized that Lillian's gigantic glutes would take the whole chair, and even when he was about to jump off the chair, Lillian leaned her ass backward to sit down and her big butt came down on top of him and crushed him slowly. Lillian wiggled slightly her huge backside in the chair grinding Blake, unaware that the guy she liked was being flattened beneath her enormous buttock, continued to pay attention to the classes, even when her big backside made her to feel unconfortable on the chair...</span></div></div>",

How naive was he, and he didn't know that it would be the last thing that Lillian would do when having him shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class passed and after several minutes Lillian wiggled slightly on the seat, a little uncomfortable because of her big backside, not knowing she was squashing Blake beneath her huge glutes. Blake was unable to move and he felt the weight was unbearable, and he couldn't do anything about his current situation except to be stuck to her big buttocks for a long time, and try to not die suffocated underneath that giant ass. Blake, even when he didn't like to be shrunk, he'd have prefered Joana to sit on him instead of Lillian. Why? Besides the fact she's his girlfriend, she was lighter than Lillian, so the weight would be more bearable. the other fact, with her his salvation was practically guaranteed. And...she was sexier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Blake thought, Lillian didn't feel anything under that huge butt else than the discomfort of the chair, caused by the size of her ass.</span></div></div>",

He opened the locker and before he could do anything else he heard someone being hurled against the lockers, then some punchs and another hurling, then an unknown voice -\"You two idiots, did you think you could beat me? Hah!! Blake wouldn't even stand up a chance against me...And without him you aren't nothing\"- Blake thought for a moment the worst, but then he reasoned that Joana couldn't even fight someone like that and he spoke to two, so they must be Ayrton and Ferdinand. He closed his locker roughly and ran to the place where was happening something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he arrived he couldn't believe it, there were Ayrton and Ferdinand barely stainding up in guard position in front of a very big and strong guy, who probably was a bully, then he noticed that some lockers were dented and stained with blood. He hit that one in his jaws just in time because he was about to gibe them the final punch... Ayrton and Ferdinand stood in disbelief for some seconds and then they saw to their savior...Blake...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around and then asked to them -\"Are you ok?\"- -\"Well...as possible...\"- answered Ferdinand, then Blake said -\"Ok, go back, I'll take care of this one\"- -\"But what?! Are you crazy?! You won't defeat him, he's too strong\"- Ayrton exclaimed, Blake remained silent and then said with a more serious tone -\"I won't know it until I fight him\"- -\"If you are going to fight him, I'll do so\"- Ayrton said, remebering an atrocious past battle, when a bully called Ivan, who was like this guy (less heavier and stronger and they were 13 years old in that time), Blake could barely beat him and only because he became extremely furious when that damned guy dared to hurt Joana and that was his last move...Ayrton knew as well as Joana that despite Blake fought his whole life, his body has its limits (he could resist for longer a fight that Ivan would have finished in less than 5 minutes) and he wouldn't let him suicide like that, then Ferdinand added -\"I'll fight also\"- Blake was annoyed by this by two facts, his friends were hurt and, he never liked to fight with numerical advantage, it was kinda coward, and he didn't say anything as he started the fight alone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake stood in guard in front of this guy and said -\"Who are you and what the hell do you want?!\"- The big guy laughed and answered -\"My name is Albert, and you must know my little brother...Ivan\"- Blake froze for a moment '...It can't be...Ivan had a big brother...dammit' he thought and then said -\"I guess you want to avenge him, do't you?\"- -\"Nah...Ivan is just a weakling\"- Blake couldn't believe that arrogance, it had t be just a joke, nobody could call Ivan a weakling, then, he finally said -\"So, let's end this once for all\"- And they two started the combat, Blake dodged his fists and connected a good punch in his jaws, but he wasn't even stunned, Blake thought for a moment that when he fought Ivan it was like this, he didn't seem to be hurt even after several strong hits...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight continued, the fists of they both were flying at a very high speed, crashing in some times and Blake's connecting in others, even at this moment, Albert had failed every punch, Blake kicked him and made some combos but Albert stood up in perfect conditions, like nothing happened to him, and several minutes elapsed like this, Blake was dodging every punch and connecting nice hits which resulted useless, he kept fighting like this for more than 20 minutes, after this, Blake was getting tired, at this rate, he wouldn't be able to keep fighting for long, his energies were running low and Albert was still alright, maybe a bit hurt but it was almost unnoticeable. After a few minutes, he was pantsing and thought 'Damn it!! This guy is just like Ivan...' Then he dodged two punches and the third hit him, sending him about half meter away and against the lockers, Albert just laughed -\"Hehehe...so, this is the guy who nobody was able to beat?\"-  Then, before Blake got up, he kicked him in the stomach and hit him in there several times, then he grabbed him in the neck and lifted him up...-\"Hey Blake, your girlfriend...or I mean...future widow...is beautiful...maybe I'll fuck her after kicking your ass...\"- Blake became very angry and hit him with a very strong punch on the face, forcing Albert to release him, they both fell down and Albert got up quickly, taking Blake by the neck and started to punch him in the stomach, about 10 times and then Blake spitted out some blood...Albert just threw him against a locker and then he threw him against the floor, Blake was injured and weakened at this moment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake got up with difficult and barely stood up, grabbing his left arm with the other because it was damaged by hurling against the lockers, Albert approached to him and blew him away with another punch, and before he could continue, Ayrton ran and started to punch him quickly in the stomach while Ferdinand grabbed him from backward to not let him to move, Albert released after 2 minutes and sent away Ayrton and Ferdinand easily, then he plated his foot over Ayrton's head and said -\"I want you to see your friends being crushed\"- and started to stomp over Ayrton's back until he spitted out blood, then he took Ferdinand and started to hurl him against lockers about 5 times and then he threw him away, hitting his face against the hard floor. Albert was about continue his \"fun\" when Blake gave him some furious punches and kicks, despite his damaged body, his spirit was what made him strong... and a desperate battle began, it didn't last for long because Blake connected his strongest kick on Albert's nape of the neck, leaving him thrown on the floor. Blake then went with his friends and helped them to get up -\"You better go away while you can...you should go to the nursery\"- -\"But what about you?\"- They both asked, which Blake answered -\"I...ugh...I have to finish this\"- When Albert got up, Ayrton and Ferdinand had no choice but leaving Blake alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood again in front of Albert and suddenly they both ran toward the other, they connected several fists and kicks and then Blake gave him his best punch while he rememberd what happened to Joana....the moment he wasn't able to protect her... and finally connected the punch to his jaws, Unfortunely, it didn't work. Albert was still standind up, and before they could finish their fight, Albert saw a teacher approaching from far and said -\"This was a very good fight, but I've got more businesses and can't lose my time playing with you...for now...\"- Then he left. Blake wouldn't have let him go, but now he was too injured and the teacher would report him, so he decided to go for his books again (now missed history class) and left that corridor just in time, then he, barely being able to walk, reached his locker, he grabbed his biology books and decided to go to his next class (despite being THAT hurt and Joana would worry about him) But before this, he had a bad feeling and before he looked around, someting or soemone gave him an injection -\"ARGH!!...Dammit\"- Blake felt inmediately more weakened than normal and fell unconscious. While he was out he shrank to 2 cms. Then...</span></div></div>",

The second place she went it was Blake's locker, he had to be in there since he wasn't in nursery and he hasn't gone to classes.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She noticed a small thing on the floor. It seemed to be a doll, but when she picked it up and looked closer, she realized that it resembled Blake a lot... and that is was severely damaged... Joana kept looking the wounds, she thought 'A wounded Blake's doll? Who would make this?' She put her finger on its chest and found a very little stain of blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is strange... dolls don't bleed...\"- In other times she'd have just discarded the doll but since she was really worried about Blake, her instincts told her to examine the supposed doll. Joana checked if wasn't it just paint, but she look how the miniature Blake was still bleeding. She gasped, and brought him near her eyes, she noticed the weak movement of breathing. 'Either I've gone mad or defintively there's something strange here...' She thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana decided to ask Karina about this, she was practically a genius and was Blake's best friend besides Ayrton and Ferdinand. So, she placed him in her cleavage because she thought that her pocket might be too rough for him in his current state. She grabbed her stuff and met up with Karina in the classroom. They were lucky that besider her and Blake, not much people in this school liked biology so nobody bothered on arriving early. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana entered and found Karina, who was doing some homework with her laptop. She greeted her. Joana greeted her back and sat in at a desk next to hers. Karina was surprised to see her alone, and was worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Did you find Blake?... Or... was he that badly beaten...?\"- She said the last with slight fear. When they were 10, Blake alone didn't stand a chance against Albert. He and Karina together were barely able to beat him and both got terribly hurt<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sort of... But I need your help...\"- Joana answered and Karina immediately sat up, now worried <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Is he somewhere unconscious and you couldn't get help?!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nope, well... he's unconscious... but I managed to bring him with me...\"- Joana said, Karina raised an eyebrow, Joana was alone... so... why did she say Blake was with her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uhmm... where did you bring him?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's difficult to explain... please, don't tell me I'm crazy...\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What is it? Say it already!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Blake slowly woke up, he was very damaged and all of his senses weren't working as they should. He found himself in an unknown place. It was dark, with very weak illumination. He could see that the place he was in was seemingly peach colored, he had little strength to move but felt around, he thought that he might be somewhere outside school, but the walls around him felt soft... and warm... That snapped Blake out of his weakness for a moment, he thought that definitively there are no such things as warm and soft concrete, or rocks...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard a heartbeat behind him. It sounded like a heartbeat, but was far stronger. He noticed that his own body was still battered and bleeding, and all of this, him waking up, this strange, there was only one thing Blake could figure out.....Death...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So... this is the afterlife? How strange... no clouds, no grass, no ground... just this strange place... I guess that the heartbeat is a reminder of life's constant flow or something like that... whoever who made this place had a bizarre yet poetic of what death is like...' He thought, remembering one of his Biology classes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The first sound every person hears is the heartbeat\"- Said his teacher in a class. He also said something about motherly stuff that Blake didn't bother to listen. He had had many bad experiences with what everyone else calls a mother. Why? To make the story short: His mother never wanted him, and hated him every day of his life, until 5 years old when he and his father were forced to leave the house. He was never nursed nor had ANY experience with a mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil 4 years later when he was 9, he was found by his grandmother, Irma (Blake's father died the day they were forced out, defending Blake from his brother who was seeking revenge on him). She was the only woman he ever called Mama. She soon noticed Blake's disgust toward mothers and most of related stuff in general... at the time, Karina herself didn't help either, as she had mistaken him for a bully, and seeked every chance to fight him, Blake described her as 'The girl who wants to punch me for no reason'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis grandmother however told him that he was deeply hurt by his past, but that he should let a woman to help him in the future, to fix those wounds. Blake at 10 years of course denied needing care from someone else (Specifically, he stated that he didn't need other than his only family left, his grandma). By that time, Karina had become his friend and fought at his side. Meeting Claire filled Blake with doubts, as her behavior was strange for him... To Blake's logic, Karina's behavior was the normal one... not that she looked tomboyish but she was a girl who kicked asses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's constantly hugging Blake annoyed him further. That's why, years later, when he was 12, he was reluctant to let Joana, a girl he just saved the first day of 7th grade from a bully, heal the wound he got from a knife the bully used. Let alone that Joana effectively grew fond of him, despite he just wanted to get away from her. Still, he protected her from many other guys who threatened her. Joana was in love with him in no time and he had no idea. For three years, Blake just thought of her as a second Claire, though for some reason he didn't fell that annoyed. He also found surprising that he felt he could tell her his past and why he is the way he is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly at 9th year he'd know the reason, and after all of his male friends and Karina shouted into his ears that Joana actually loved him, he decided to ask her out... though it was more like she asked him out instead. Anyway, Blake warned Joana that he knew nothing about relationships, she just giggled, it was the Blake she knew and she loved him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven together, Blake wasn't too fond of excessive hugs or kisses, and one of these days he was surprised when Joana hugged him and he heard her heart. He felt tired and sleepy, and had no idea why. That class at Biology answered his question: The first sound a person hears before birth, is the heartbeat. It also soothes babies. Since Blake was never taken care by anyone but his father, he  was never soothed. Not that his father was bad, but when he wasn't there and Blake cried, his mother, Lilith, solved the problem beating him, until he learned not to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would be one of Blake's trademark signs, he would never cry, nor show emotion. His relationship with Joana was slowly changing that but he still refused instinctively to show sadness.Karina told Joana once that Blake's cold attitued was a scream for affection, even if he denied it...</span></div></div>",

Blake closed his eyes, awaiting for death and for a final rest, he reflexed about his life, and felt stupid about wasting the last three years<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I should've asked Joana out back at 7th grade... How the time passes... Now that I go out with her I die... I feel bad for her... and me...' He thought. His body was too weak to do anything but still Blake moved slightly to get comfortable in his strange prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake... he... he is...\"- Joana gasped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What was that for?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You won't believe me...\"- Joana took carefully Blake's tiny body out of her cleavage, Karina raised an eyebrow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why do you carry a doll between your boobs?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not a doll, look...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarina examined the \"doll\" and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\" *Sigh* I thought that your obsession with Blake would be over when you finally got him to ask you out... But voodoo? It's sick!! And... why did you have a voodoo of Blake in there?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not a voodoo!! I found him on the floor... and he just moved...\"- Joana was saying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You felt it, right?\"- Karina said, Joana blushed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is strange, who would make a voodoo and then throw it on the floor?\"- She took the tiny body and Joana said, worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't be so rough!! He's hurt!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Joana, it's just a doll, nothing is going to happen to the real... What the?!!\"- Karina noticed that Blake's tiny body seemed to be bleeding, and that her hand had a small red stain. She gently placed Blake on the desk and sniffed the stain<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Oh my God!! It's blood!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe I'm crazy but could this be Blake?\"- Joana asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I dunno... this might be an unknown doll stained with someone's blood...\"- Joana glared at her, and she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll need to see if this is actually alive\"- Her question was soon answered, Blake struggled to get up but he was too weak. Joana stared at Karina<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh...okay... You won... But he needs immediate attention\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We're in a biology lab, duh...\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay, Me - 0, You - 2. Let's not make a contest out of this...\"- Karina said, and searched for the laboratory stuff, and got a first aid kit. She applied iodine on Blake's body with a cotton swab, very carefully. Blake grunted in pain despite being unconscious and this confirmed that he was alive. Karina looked closer at him, she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"This is incredible... I can't believe it's Blake...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Something inside me told me to pick him up...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You must thank it because otherwise you might have stepped on it and never know... or maybe he'd have ended up in a trashcan...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't even say it... I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I killed Blake...\"- Joana said, imagining many possible bad endings for Blake's now tiny life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't be worried. You were lucky and saved him. Now, it's your turn to protect him...\"- Karina said, noticing Joana's stress on imaginary situations. Joana snapped out of it and nodded. Blake had risked himself for his friends and her many times. Now that he was vulnerable, she had to take care of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarina placed her ear very close to his tiny body so she could hear his heartbeats. She could, and said to Joana<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He'll survive, but you better take intensive care of him...\"- Then Karina reflexed, and looking at Joana, said worriedly -\"No!! You better take just light care of him!!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Let's admit it... You are a bit overprotective... So, keep it like that... if you're too overprotective you might end up hurting him...\"- Joana was annoyed at the remark but nodded. Karina cut a thin piece of the bandages she found and with that she could bandage Blake. He was still unconscious but moved, curling up. Joana thought it was cute, and Karina said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It means he's sleeping. Let him rest, he's had a hell of a day... and it's just 9:55...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"When does this class begin?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"10:00 AM\"- Karina replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh...\"- Joana contemplated Blake. She wanted to kiss him, to hug him and to ask him how he got so small. Karina again noticed her look, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"At least while he's hurt you shouldn't hug him... Blake has said that you give him death hugs... and that was at normal size... if you do now, he might be crushed like a bug...\"- Joana's look saddened, definitively it hurt her that she could injury Blake with simple moves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Specially with those\"- Karina added joking, if you know what she meant<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey!!\"- Joana didn't like the joke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's true... with just one of them you might crush him...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's not funny Karina\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay okay...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, how do you think Blake is?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I told ya, he's sleeping, but obviously, he won't wake up easily. His body forces him to sleep so it can repair itself... His energies must be low too, make sure he eats something when he wakes up...\"- Karina said while looked at Blake, who seemed quiet, sleeping, like there was nothing else in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey heard the door open and Joana quickly picked him up, putting him again in her cleavage, Karina was both O_O and blushed in embarrassment. Joana replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"He might be hurt in my pockets, and my purse is no option...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"O...kay... just, don't squash him with your boobs or I'll kick your ass\"- Both her and Joana laughed.

After what felt like forever, the class ended and Joana and Karina headed into the women\u2019s room. Joana took Blake out and gave him to Karina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow does he look. I\u2019m just so worried about him.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, his wounds seem to have stopped bleeding and he\u2019s a little bit more active. He should wake up soon.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, thank the lord. I\u2019ve just been so worried for him. He just so small...so vulnerable.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got that right. Let\u2019s just hope he even remembers who he is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana could only worry even more about him. What if he didn\u2019t remember who he was? What if he didn\u2019t remember who <i>she</i> was?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes passed. Joana lightly nestled Blake in her hands, running her finger along his small head. She could feel him in there. Suddenly, his head moved away from her finger, just ever so slightly. She jerked her hand slightly at his movement. She brought him closer to her face, wanting to see her dear Blake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlake. Blake. Can you hear me?\u201d Blake slowly moved around.<br>\r\n\u201cUgh. Joana, is that you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes Blake, it\u2019s me. Thank the lord you\u2019re alive.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes...Ugh, why is this floor so squishy and warm?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUm...Blake. Open your eyes.\u201d Joana watched as Blake opened his eyes. At the sight of his now giant girlfriend, he fell back in complete shock.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat in the!? Joana, how do you get so big!?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTechnically speaking, she isn\u2019t the one who changed Blake\u201d Karina butted in.<br>\r\n\u201cWait, if you guys are...then I...SHRUNK?!?\u201d He screamed in terror.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...Look, we don\u2019t know what happened. I found you in the hall at your small size. I\u2019m just glad I saw you and didn\u2019t...you know.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. So, what do we do now? I can\u2019t stay small forever.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I could try to figure out what caused you to turn small and make some kind of reversal serum, but I can\u2019t make any promises.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWait, really? Will it hurt?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly, I have no clue. Since you had passed out before shrinking, you should pass out when it happens, but it\u2019s not a certain.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, as long as I get back to normal, then I don\u2019t care. So, when do you think you\u2019ll have it done.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAgain, no idea. These things take time. Um...I don\u2019t know how to ask you this but I need some of your blood.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMy Blood!?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYes. Whatever caused your shrinking would be in your DNA, or at least traces of it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOk...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh wait. Joana, your hand.\u201d Joana looked down at her hand, now red from Blake\u2019s blood.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well I guess you already have it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed. Now, I\u2019ll have to get to the lab and start working on the formula. Joana, keep him safe.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cKeep me safe? I can take care of myself, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBlake, at your size, you can easily get hurt. Just let me take care of you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFine, but only because you\u2019re my girlfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGood, now I need to go to the rest of my classes. I guess you can ride in my backpack. Sound good?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Joana hid a Blake and headed Tom class.</span></div></div>",

Being in the backpack, Blake wasn\u2019t too worried about being found and even ate a small bag of cheez-its. Finally, it was time for Joana and Blake to head home. On their way out, they spotted Karina in the lab, working on the serum. They decided to chuck up on her progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Karina. How\u2019s Blake\u2019s reversal serum coming?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell it coming. The only problem is that it\u2019s taking forever because I\u2019m working alone.

So as I was saying, without more people working on the serum, it\u2019s going to take quite a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell why don\u2019t you see if you can get more people working on it? I\u2019m sure some chemists are sure to want to work on something so new like this.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell...I could do that, but I\u2019ll have to be careful and Blake, you need to keep from being found.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo kidding.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBlake, Karina...\u201d Joana butted in. The two of them stopped bickering. \u201cGood. Now, I think it\u2019s time we get going. Good luck.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Joana and Blake left, anxious about the whole situation. Joana drove back to her house, still concerned with Blake\u2019s injuries. While he may have been acting as if nothing was wrong, Joana could tell that he was in a lot of pain. Pulling up to the house, Joana picked up her backpack and took out Blake, placing him on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, here we are. Let\u2019s head inside.\u201d She climbed out of the car and walked up to door, unlocking it. She opened the door and walked in, placing her bag by a table. She climbed up s flight of stairs and entered her room. Blake just sat on her shoulder, the pain obviously overwhelming him. <br>\r\n\u201cW...wow. You have a...nice house.\u201d Blake\u2019s voice was broken, pain shooting through his body. Joana had noticed this.<br>\r\n\u201cBlake, are you ok?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not really. My body I saw still killing me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI bet. If only...wait. Maybe...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I could warm you up with my...my...\u201d He started blushing now a bright shade of red.

If you don\u2019t want to, it\u2019s ok.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake thought for a minute. Joanna had been caring for him this far and nothing went wrong, so what could the harm be?

Slowly and carefully, she brought him around to her face, the two coming face to face. She brought him a bit closer and lightly kissed his forehead. She then slowly lowered him down, softly placing him in between her two breasts. Laying between the two blossoms, Blake\u2019s whole body started warming up. His joints started relaxing, his muscles following close behind. It was like being surrounded by warm balls of wax. Joana looked down at her little friend, relieved to finally see him relaxed. As Blake closed his eyes to rest, Joana layed on her bed, dozing off as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was late in the night when Joana woke up again. As she sat up, she looked down to see her prince, sleeping peacefully in the warmth of her breasts. Gently, she brought her hand towards him and lightly nudged his head. Blake slowly opened his eyes as he took in his unfamiliar surroundings. Unable to see much, he started feeling all around him, trying to figure out where he was. Joana softly spoke to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlake, are you ok?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYe...yeah. Ugh, where am I.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHere let me help you.\u201d She lowered her hand down to Blake and cupped it under him, much to his shock. As she brought him out, he was able to see everything around him. His mind started racing, trying to comprehend what was happening.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Where? What the heck?!?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa Blake, calm down. Try to remember what happened.\u201d Closing his eyes, he though back trough the day. <i>How did I get myself into this?</i> he thought to himself.

I\u2019m still a bit sore, but definitely not as bad as I was. Thanks again for...you know.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Anyway, I have some work to do before we head to school. We might as well do it now.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yay...\u201d</span></div></div>",

She still wanted Blake for herself, she liked him since the high school started (10th grade and forward, they're actually in 12th). He appeared as a silent and lonely one but when the bullies challenged him he finished them impressively. And his way to be, though and determinate Cinhya had never seen someone like him, and her particular tastes for exotical things made her like him even more (Blake is latin, and in fact speaks spanish perfectly but he almost never does). But then appeared that he had a girlfriend and it was a girl of the classroom, Joana, Cinthya didn't even know about their story and when she was told, she didn't care and tried to ask out Blake in any way, she even tried to kiss him by force to show Joana that he'd cheat her for such a girl like her, but it didn't work, Blake refused and said that Joana was the only girl he loved.  For her closed mind, she would never understand that, despite knowing some things about their past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Returning to the moment where Cinthya was looking the combat). She saw how Blake left being brutally wounded, he had to grab the lockers to stand up and went to his lockers. He knew Joana would worry about him and his state. And the worst was that Albert wasn't finished off, he resulted very damaged but he had sill enough strenght to crush Blake and friends to dust. Cinthya (who admired the fights but never really cared about them) knew that Albert would return to finish Blake and she didn't want that (Even when he refuses to be her boyfriend, she has still hopes to make him break up with Joana). She decied to intervene, she went with Karen and Thania and then they talked to the football team (friends of them as they were popular and Cinthya was a cheerleader)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asked them a favor and then she told them what happened and that she wanted them to finish Albert, one of the guys said -\"Are you crazy? Almost anyone can't stand in front of him!! and only some stupid ones like Blake would fight him\"- She slapped him and said angerly -\"Hey! Don't talk like that about him, and I know he's a though one, Blake was barely able to stand the fight\"- -\"And there are two facts: One, Albert isn't at full strenght, he has been very weakened by Blake, and two, you will fight him in a very numeric advantage, I mean, you're 6 (the ones who came to her call, the others were in classes) and he's just 1. And you're very strong also. Even 1 or two of you may defeat him at his current state\"- added Karen. -\"Well...I guess we can, anyways, we have many reasons to punch that bastard, and this would be the moment to beat him\"- added the first guy -\"Yeah! Let's kick asses\"- added another and they all were agree with going to blow Albert. But then one of them asked -\"But what thing do you have with Blake? I mean...he can take care of himself, and we have gotten conflicts with him, you know, we've fought him several times by our own reasons...and, anyways, he has a girlfriend and has refused to leave her\"- Cinthya slapped him as she did with the first one and said -\"Blake will be mine...and that's not your business after all...and about you fought him...you are the stupid ones because you know he only fights with bullies, and when you threaten his friends or that damned bitch he will appear\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the guys went to attack Albert, they were barely able to beat him even at his state and Albert could knock out 5 of 6 guys who fought him. Then they threatened him to not appearing close to Blake or they'd return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they did this, Cinthya tried to use what she did as a chance to get Blake, and went where he should be, his locker, then she saw it opened and the books thrown around, her first thought was that the guys didn't beat Albert but when she called them by phone she confirmed they did, so, she looked at the place with more attention to get a clue about where would be Blake, then she looked a strange little thing, it looked like a little doll but she reasoned that Blake would not have dolls, and after some seconds she gasped, the \"doll\" had the same clothes as Blake, she decided to pick it up to get a closer view. -\"I can't believe it...the destiny gave me a great gift\"- muttered to herself, realizing that Blake was unconscious, tiny, and at her mercy...</span></div></div>",

Please add. By the way, this is a bit different than some other giantesses stories, check it out!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMain Characters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake (Main character): Tall and strong 16 years old latino boy (long black wavy hair and black eyes). He used to fight a lot at school (but he never was suspended, and only fought bullies who threatened him, his friends or Joana, and almost doesn't fight actually since 9th grade, just some times in streets and not for fun, and...yeah, he has a kind of honor code about fighting but fortunely or unfortunely the fights remained in the past) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the way, He's very smart and even gets high notes without studying for exams, just bad in Math and Physics (number things). He has a muscular body due to his fighting life and soccer playing, his skin is tanned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana (Blake's girlfriend): 17 years old beautiful girl (dark brown long wavy hair, hazel eyes,D-cups and a very big ass, clear skin). She loves Blake since 7th grade but he realized about that and decided to be her boyfriend until 11th grade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was his best friend since they met in 7th grade and was the one who was almost always with Blake and healed his fight wounds, she's the only one who knows who is really Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecondary Characters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarina (17 years old): A good friend of Joana and Blake, she's cute but isn't Blake's type. She doesn't seem to have more interest about him than friendship and she probably would help if Blake was in trouble (But Joana was the one who has done that the whole time). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlonde with green eyes and short hair. She's Ayrton's girlfriend. Longest female friend of Blake, they met at 4th grade and she was a fighting since those days. She has still fighting skills depite she fights less to be more feminine, and helps Blake in fights where he's losing by physical disadvantages or numerical...Her body is possibly B cups and slim hips. Green eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinthya (18 years old): Beautiful and very popular latino girl who wanted Blake for herself and almost did it until Joana appeared (Blake was keeping in secret his relationship because his mother is a true demon who hits him with a cable since he was 5 years old. But it was revealed to the classroom when she almost kissed Blake by force...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[He refused because really loves Joana and wouldn't do such a stupid thing after he was an idiot by 4 years...] and Joana appeared to stop her). Her feelings toward Blake now may go from still wanting him for her to hating him (she hates more to Joana). She has black hair, small boobs and a nice butt (Joana's is better but almost everyone drool for Cinthya's). Dark brown eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire: 17 years old. Blake's friend (since 3th year, second longest one since Karina). Very beautiful and the only one even Blake has thought could rival Joana. C-Cup breasts and a big butt (slightly smaller than Joana's, still better than Cinthya's). Her differences with Joana are that she has Asian-like black eyes which look very sensual, while Joana's are big, light brown and cute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, though Joana's thighs are thicker, Claire's seem slightly thinner and longer, the other difference is that she has a bit of tummy (and Joana not, because she played volleyball and basketball, and not enough to be called fat, in fact, it makes her to look cute). She has black straight hair worn as a ponytail. She hugs and kisses Blake (in cheek) more often than Karina, causing Joana to be jealous of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she's aware Blake has a girlfriend, most of times she doesn't pay attention to it, as she only acts friendly. Her feelings to Blake have never been clear as she acted as protective as Joana in the time they didn't know each other. Some times it seems Joana wants to just kill her (And Blake has to appear to prevent it)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's very likely to help and taking care of Blake, but due to her relationship with Joana, it's not very probable she'd give him back to her (She also acts some times jealous as Joana has a better body and is Blake's girlfriend)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyrton: 17 years old boy. Blake's second best friend (since secondary). Short and tanned. He fights along Blake sometimes but he really isn't a fighter, just an average guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerdinand: 18 years old boy. Some sort of mixture between a goth and a nerd (He has practically the same intelligence level as Blake but he's better in Math and Physics while Blake's better than him in the rest of subjects). He's Blake's third best friend. And is stupidly in love of Cinthya (Physic: a bit shorter than you,thin,dark brown curly hair).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren: (17 years old): Nerd/Geek girl. Cinthya's friend and accomplice. she hasn't practically own will and does every thing that Cinthya tells her to. (red hair, small breasts and a very big butt. She's not really pretty because she's flabby and a bit fat). Blue eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThania: (16 years old): Average popular girl, Cinthya's friends but she's the least evil one. She seems to have a crush on Blake but she respected Joana since she had known Blake more time than her (light brown wavy hair and body like Karina's, but she's shorter). Hazel eyes darker than Joana's<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian (16 years old): A Joana's, Blake's and Ayrton's friend. She seems to have a crush on Blake and Ayrton but hides it because of Joana and Karina. She's the tallest girl with long black hair, small but round breasts and a HUGE ass (biggest of those characters). Brown eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRULES:<br>\r\n-No gay/lesbian stuff<br>\r\n-Joana's not evil.Even if she turns into a giantess.(The other characters can go free about their behavior to Blake)<br>\r\n-No parents<br>\r\n-Feet are ok but take on count that Blake doesn't particularly like them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease add and enjoy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </td>",
