            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The adventure begins with a family who live in a house in suburbia that is rather large, but not a mansion. It is white with a green door and grey roof and very neat lawns with a vegetable garden in the front yard and a mini-playground in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilton McKensie (36) is the dad and he is an electrician. He has curly, short, blond hair, brown eyes and fair skin. He wears black pants and grey shirts. He likes to play games with his kids and is interested in Greek mythology. He is 5'9 and slightly muscular, but not like Superman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAida McKensie (36) is the mom. She is six feet tall and of average build. She has long, straight, brown hair, fair skin and blue eyes and she generally wears red dresses. She is interested in many science-related topics, including astronomy, biology, chemistry and geology. She, like Milton, likes to play games with the kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike McKensie (10) is the oldest kid. He has short, straight, brown hair and wears white shirts and black shorts. He rides a skateboard which he sometimes lets Nadia ride. He is a bit of a rebel and not above breaking the rules, but is a good big brother and (despite getting in trouble for breaking school rules) gets good grades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNadia McKensie (8) is the second-oldest kid. She has her mother's hair and wears brown dresses with navy blue shirts underneath. She is very curious and imaginitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert McKensie (3) is the third-youngest kid. He has short, straight, brown hair and wears navy blue shirts and jeans. He is very advanced for his age (he can read already) and is often seen wandering around in a daydream with his toy snow leopard Simon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly McKensie (1) is the older twin by two minutes. He has curly brown hair and wears neon green onesies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeanne McKensie (1) is Billy's twin and the youngest in the family. She has straight blonde hair and wears a little white dress with blue flowers on it and a blue bow in her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNewton is the McKensies' fluffy white cat, named after Isaac Newton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNerissa McKensie (38) is Milton's sister and the kids' aunt and they love it when she babysits because she always makes things fun. She is 5'6, with fair skin, straight red hair that she wears down just past her shoulders, and a light blue dress with her initials embroidered on the collar. She is a tough cookie, does volunteer work and rides a white Harley. The reason why she has red hair and her brother has blond hair is because their parents (the kids' grandparents) had been trying to conceive, gave up, adopted Nerissa, but the grandmother found she was pregnant soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerry Fallon (37) is Nerissa's neighbor and good friend. She is skinny and East-Asian and wears blue shirts and grey skirts. She's very clumsy, but a huge optimist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does the adventure start?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(P.S. Another rule is no racism/sexism/any other prejudice unless it's a bad guy who believes that)</span></div></div>",

If you want to do something that's against the rules, maybe this is not the story for you, but otherwise, have fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) No cussing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) Don't kill anyone off, have them move away or otherwise write them out. If somebody disappears and there's a plot based on getting them back, that's fine, as long as they do come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.) Transformations (shrinking, growing, age changes, shape-shifting, etc) are encouraged, provided that nobody gets fat (introducing a character who's already fat is OK as long as it's not fetishy) and that they are only temporary. An exception is superpowers, which can be permanent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.) No sickness (this includes adverse reactions to food) and no injuries more serious than a skinned knee. Allergies are fine (provided that nobody has an allergic reaction that produces nausea or other stomach-related symptoms), and so are people with disabilities, provided that they've always been disabled. Also, no mental illness or sleep deprivation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5.) A bit of potty humour is fine, but don't go overboard. (e.g. a joke about someone needing to pee is fine, but a joke about someone *drinking* pee is not).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6.) Nudity is fine in a nonsexual context, but no lustful narration. A bit of romance is OK (this includes gay romance) as long as it is not smutty. Don't pair-bond characters introduced at the start (although introducing love interests is A-OK) and don't break up established couples. Also, no romance of any sort between characters who are related!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7.) No vore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8.) Don't make dramatic character changes and have them be permanent or rewrite a character's personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9.) Going to other worlds is fine as long as they eventually go back home.</td>",
