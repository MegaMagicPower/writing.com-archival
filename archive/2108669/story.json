Where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see, populated with state of the art animatronic characters and automated systems. Full tummies are happy tummies and the staff at Gerbert Gerbil\u2019s strives to make every meal, birthday and gathering an event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoin heroic astronaut Gerbert Gerbil in his far out adventures alongside the Cosmic Crew: Hippo Don the musician/gangster hippo, Moolia the hybrid cow and dessert maker, and Fuchsia the color changing dancing flamingo. The Cosmic Crew\u2019s adventure shows include other characters, aliens and robots, most persistently Gerbert\u2019s rival astronaut Hamster Louie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith lavish game \u2018n\u2019 activity areas, spectacular special effects and good food surely there could be no funner place on earth, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, even a family dining &amp; leisure business can host its own share of less-than-innocent horrors. Peer past the childlike wonder of the place and Gerbert Gerbil\u2019s is in pretty dire straits. Cosmic Crew Entertainment has been hyper focused on the cartoons and merchandizing of Gerbert and the gang that they throw money around get rid of problems. Short sighted, bribed \u2018solutions\u2019 that only end up making things worse. With health and safety inspections paid off rather than earned the restaurant faces many issues. The complex automated systems are glitchy, the food quality is much less than it appears, the overstressed employees try to get away with questionable activities during work hours and sometimes there\u2019s just something off, you know, with the animatronics. Cosmic Crew Entertainment also denies there being any reports of missing children, possible murders, employee or customer injury or the chance of the whole establishment being haunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story looks to delve into the lives of those that work or frequent Gerbert Gerbil\u2019s, both the horrific consequences of their association with the franchise and the fattening effect of the menu on their waistlines. Follow a character as they work, play, eat, explore, investigate, eat, panic, survive and eat at Gerbert\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo begin, select a category of focal point characters.</span></div></div>",

Mainly from all the fumes from Vinnie\u2019s weed habit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow look,\u201d the old man said. \u201cI am sick and tired of you stinking up the house you lazy bum.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinnie, satiating some munchies with half a burrito, didn\u2019t reply right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve flunked out of high school, got no college prospects, I will throw you to the curb unless you earn your keep.\u201d A set of the classified ads was tossed at Vinnie, who caught it on delay with greasy fingers after it had already landed on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a job by tomorrow you\u2019re gone!\u201d The old man wheezed his way back upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinnie exhaled and took a look at the classifieds were stuff had been circled. Office clerk? No. Shipping? No. Mining labor? So far all the jobs sounded hard and sucky. Vinnie slunk further into his well worn groove on a pot and shroom infused couch. Distinct apathy at whether he\u2019d be forced to complete actual labor or be thrown out of the house left him indecisive. He turned the newspaper pages back over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGerbert Gerbil\u2019s looking for new hiring.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the dim light Vinnie skimmed over the notice. The space themed pizza joint all the kids frequented? Damn, that didn\u2019t sound hard at all! Maybe he could score some free pizza out of the deal too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterviews open. For once there was a different kind of fire lighting Vinnie up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite not having any applicable skills, demeanor, or shirts that didn\u2019t reek of perspiration, Vinnie found himself a job. Greg Pierce, a reedy and jovial kind of guy, lead him through the hiring process, uniform and other tidbits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this is what we in the business call the main Showroom Floor,\u201d Greg indicated after Vinnie had been given a uniform. The checker tiled dining room faced a central stage that housed the main animatronics; Gerbert Gerbil, Hippos Don, Moolia the Cow and Fuchsia the Flamingo. Each table had cheap white paper confetti pattern tablecloth, the booths on the edges having menus while a few tables in the center were set up for a party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is where the show happens. We also have individual party rooms for multiple groups so they rotate between their main party space and coming out here for the show. The key thing to working a Gerbert\u2019s is good knowledge of the space.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinnie was scratching his chin and only half listening. He always got itchy towards the end of his buzz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember to smile,\u201d Greg said with a plastered grin. \u201cYou are the face of Gerbert Gerbil\u2019s!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinnie forced a smile, wisely keeping his teeth covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow this is Mabel Lynn,\u201d Greg indicated a petite woman, probably no older than Vinnie. \u201cShe\u2019s our new floor manager so she\u2019ll be responsible for getting you up to speed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome!\u201d Mabel said with her own smile. Though not a genuine smile, she was cringing at the sight of Vinnie. Greg didn\u2019t appear to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019ll be instructing you on all the spaces we need cleaned. Like I said before the key to working here is good knowledge of the space. I\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg departed with a wave. Vinnie, unsure if he needed to wave back, returned a very delayed wave. A pair of fingers was snapped in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow look here pothead,\u201d Mabel said, true colors showing. \u201cI can tell you might not care about whether you keep this job or not. But I care about my job and I can\u2019t have you jeopardize that. So don\u2019t do anything stupid or I will have you blacklisted, understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reminded Vinnie somewhat of his old man, so he just stayed quiet and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, now you need to report to\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Still getting used to the clinginess of the Gerbert\u2019s employee uniform (did they hyper-starch these or something?) Vinnie went through the one employees only door that was indicated to him. Inside the smells were like heaven to his over flared nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheese, grease, tomato sauce, pepperoni, other stuff. The usual smorgasbord Vinnie liked when he and his friends were getting good and stoned. It was a mouth-watering smell. And chocolate cake! There was chocolate cake being baked somewhere too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be the new guy then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a rotund woman, not much older than Vinnie, hands deep in a mound of pizza dough. She had a pretty enough face. For Vinnie it was enough that she was female and not snapping her fingers in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh yeah, I guess so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen welcome to Gerbert Gerbil\u2019s kitchen! I\u2019m Sandy.\u201d Hers was a genuine smile. \u201cMind passing me that water bottle?\u201d She nodded towards a drink caddy sat on the shelf above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinnie reached up for it. Upon popping it open he smelled pepsi inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you could just hold it in front of me.\u201d Hands still caught in the dough, Sandy moved her head to take a long slip from the bottle. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said after a refreshing sigh, \u201cit gets mighty hot in here sometimes with all the cooking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned to beating the pizza dough flat. \u201cHey Jessica, come over here and meet the new guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha?\u201d another voice spoke up from further back in the kitchen. Another woman walked around the corner. The blonde to Sandy\u2019s brunette, she was as short as the manager but had a doughy pear shaped body. Even though she was wearing gaudy oven mitts Vinnie found himself staring at her chunky thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is\u2026what\u2019s your name?\u201d Sandy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVinnie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, ok. I\u2019ve got cupcakes in the oven,\u201d Jessica said, uninterested. She went back around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s friendly when you get to know her,\u201d Sandy said. Once she had gotten the dough flattened to the right shape she scooped on some red sauce. \u201cWhatcha here for Vinnie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, that maple chick. I mean, Mabel, told me to come here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Mabel.\u201d Sandy spoke in a mock whisper. \u201cYeah, she can be a pill to swallow. But stay on top of your tasks and she won\u2019t bother you.\u201d Sandy clapped her floury hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can\u2019t have you cooking in here with all your scruffy hair.\u201d Subconsciously Vinnie ran a hand over his mullet. \u201cSo Jessica and I will need you to grab things from storage and the freezer, mostly. Not all the time, just check on us every once in a while to see if we need something. Did they show you where the freezer is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d if they had Vinnie hadn\u2019t been paying attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just further down the hall. I could use some more ground sausage and chicken cuts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, uh, guess I\u2019ll get that.\u201d Vinnie backed out of the kitchen obligated to work. He was hoping he would start tomorrow.</span></div></div>",

It had been a long weekend and she\u2019d slept in too late, she was late for her job at Gerbert Gerbil\u2019s. Not only was she late for her job she was late on her rent, she was a late graduate because she had to repeat a grade. For most of her life Jessica had been late at things. And she didn\u2019t need her ex-boyfriend calling her this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was trying to sort out what little bedhead she had while tangled up in the phone cord. \u201cI mean it Jason. Us\u2026we\u2019re not an us anymore. You barely pay attention to me and when you do I\u2019m at work, I can\u2019t have you coming to work like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach rumbled. Breakfast would have to be skipped if Jason wouldn\u2019t get off the phone. But now he was launching into one of his chauvinistic tangents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat has nothing to do with it!\u201d Jessica shouted. She was reaching the end of her fuse. Jason wasn\u2019t picking up any of her hints. \u201cIt\u2019s not, this isn\u2019t something out of the blue it hasn\u2019t been fun going out with you for the past few months.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t want to yell at him because he would yell back. Although she had reached her boiling point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLOOK! Just because we had the horizontal tango didn\u2019t mean I still wanted to be with you! I thought maybe that would let us split up on a high note but clearly I was wrong. I have to go to work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica hung up on him. And clenched down on all those bitter feelings all the way to Gerbert Gerbil\u2019s pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she was very late to work Jessica managed to smooth things over enough to not get a reprimand. She claimed she was feeling ill. She was feeling sick, she\u2019d been feeling sick ever since last week although that might have been more to do with Jason. Not that Gerbert\u2019s had much of a sick day policy so she was still expected to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirl, you look dead tired.\u201d Her co-worker in the kitchen, Sandy, spoke up once they were back into their routine. Sandy was a few heads taller and several dozen pounds heavier than Jessica was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was rubbing her eyes in-between mixing up frosting for the cakes. \u201cI am tired. Sick and tired, I can\u2019t seem to shake it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeed a break?\u201d Sandy offered. \u201cCool off in the freezer maybe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah. I need my rent money too much to be caught slacking again.\u201d Although Jessica put on an air of hardening her efforts in the kitchen her empty stomach betrayed her with a rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need to eat something,\u201d Sandy chided. \u201cI know they don\u2019t want us eating in here but,\u201d she overturned an empty water pail in the corner for Jessica to sit on. \u201cI\u2019ll look away while you eat something. Here, homemade lunch.\u201d Sandy passed Jessica her lunchbox. \u201cOr there\u2019s the leftover pizza. It\u2019s\u2026old.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure about this?\u201d Jessica glanced nervously at the camera over by the kitchen door. She didn\u2019t need the day shift guard reporting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax, its fine.\u201d Sandy lowered her voice to a half whisper. \u201cActually that camera hasn\u2019t worked in ages. I think the cooking steam shorts out the visual feed. Audio might work so just be quiet about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBegrudgingly Jessica sat down at the makeshift seating area Sandy had set up for her. The main pizza cook was far too kind, Jessica was feeling worthless the way her weekend had been going. To make up for missing breakfast she opened Sandy\u2019s lunchbox.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Appreciating Sandy's generosity, Jessica cracked open the borrowed lunchbox. Goodness, this was well packed! A bologna and pastrami sandwich cut in rectangles. Homemade potato salad. An assortment of veggies, diced fruits, and a bag of chips. Jessica just about inhaled the first half of the sandwich, her mouth salivating at the anticipation of feeding her hunger. She crunched some of the veggies between her teeth, finding a cup of ranch dip and dunking those in before opening the packet of chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarlic taste. Heavily seasoned. Factoring in the sandwich that left Jessica's throat dry. \"Do you happen to have any--?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore her question was finished Sandy, wrists deep in some pizza dough, extracted a hand to point towards a pair of thermoses. \"Left has the soup, right has the hot chocolate. Try not to get them mixed up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomentarily hefting herself from the overturned bucket seat, Jessica grabbed the two thermoses. She opened up the hot chocolate for a long chug, then returned her surprisingly ravenous attention back to Sandy's lunchbox, spooning up potato salad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to save me some of my lunch, you know,\" Sandy said a few minutes later. Jessica looked up guiltily, her cheeks stuffed with the last of the fruit and quarter of the sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind,\" Sandy sighed, although her tone was sympathetic. \"Plenty of options for figuring out my own lunch around here.\" A pause as she returned to her work. \"Again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica reached for the thermos, finding chicken soup in place of the hot chocolate she had been anticipating. Chasing the soup with the creamy beverage made her notice the dynamics of the savory chicken broth along with the milky chocolate. Glancing to make sure Sandy didn't notice Jessica took a swig from both, eventually draining both from alternating sips as she tried to find the right balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel better?\" Sandy asked as Jessica was cleaning up the inedible remnants of the lunchbox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Loads, actually,\" Jessica smiled. \"Let me wash these up for you.\" She set aside Sandy's lunchbox near the other dishes to wash, then returned back to her bakery station. Now to finish up those cupcakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-gurgle-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica bit her lower lip. Yet another pang of hunger, right after she had taken advantage of Sandy's generosity by eating her entire lunch. It looked like the pizza cook didn't hear that last rumble over the sound of slapping out dough balls into shape. Jessica felt worried. How could she still feel hungry after eating lunch?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought back to the argument with Jason. She <i>had</i> skipped breakfast, so maybe her metaphorical gas tank was still a quart short? What else was there easily enough to grab in the kitchen without it being missed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Jessica saw the old pizza. In fact, it looked like it might not have changed positions since yesterday. Unused pizzas at Gerbert Gerbil's were kept in the food warmer by policy, a set of stale pepperoni and sausage slices having long crusted over to where the cheese couldn't even bubble anymore. Jessica held a long, unfocused gaze with the old pizza before her newfound appetite finally won out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, eating the stale pizza was tough. At least it was warm, meaty and once you got past the hard surface the cheese gave way to softness underneath. Jessica snuck two slices when Sandy wasn't looking. Which turned into the rest of the old pizza slices over the course of the next half hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling rather unaccomplished in her day of snaking, Jessica buckled down harder on meeting the quota of cakes meant for a birthday party later that afternoon. She focused on a familiar rhythm of mixing batter, baking, cooling and decorating said cakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBroken up by still more cravings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill utterly bewildered by her hunger pangs Jessica was losing all will against them, taking more brazen attempts at sneaking bites now that she had heard the camera in the kitchen didn't work properly and Sandy was the only other worker on shift, herself distracted with cooking. What was the harm with Jessica invoking the rule of the baker's dozen, with a thirteenth (and accompanying fourteenth) cupcake for her to savor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe followup half bag of buttercream frosting was unintended until Jessica realized she was squeezing the sugary goodness right past her lips. She did remember to start a new bag to continue frosting cakes for the customers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, just as Jessica thought she could eat no more, her stomach would settle in fifteen or so minutes to offer up a little more room. Maybe it was due to her accidental combination of chicken stock and hot chocolate that had her mind and tongue straying towards downright bizarre taste combinations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo heck with this. Call it an early supper but Jessica was making herself something to take home. That is, if she could leave work before scarfing it down right then and there.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ah, shoot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring her continuous cravings for the time being, Jessica realized how much she had neglected to complete her work. She was under quota on cupcakes, running out of frosting and there was the pile of dishes she still had to wash. Let alone she had just dumped too much cinnamon into the cake batter she was working on, the batter itself having sat out too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica needed to shape up. However she took a taste of the batter, liking the cinnamon mixed with the sprinkle cake mix. Company policy said improper cake batter should be wasted but why should that be? The cinnamon gave Jessica an idea. Coffee cake! It wasn't a flavor found at Gerbert Gerbil's and Jessica half remembered a recipe for simple coffee cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real question was where to get coffee. There wasn't any in the kitchen. Then Jessica remembered the staff lounge, making an excuse to step away. The loge had that strange coffee drink machine made from leftover animatronic parts. Few ever used it so there were plenty of coffee crystal containers that Jessica felt one wouldn't be missed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the kitchen, she got to work mixing in the base coffee component to her batter. She hunted up other spices to add to the mix. A pinch of this, a dash of that, a fistful of brown sugar...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButterscotch chips? Why not. Root beer? Could work. Gummy worms and marshmallows? The sugary treats were some of Jessica's favorites as her inhibitions got away from her and the core coffeecake idea. All the chunky ingredients were making it hard to mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you been working on over there?\" Sandy asked, startling Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh, nothing,\" Jessica had been so caught up in designing her own cake that she had forgotten that Sandy was in the kitchen. \"Just an...experimental recipe from corporate,\" she fibbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" Sandy believed Jessica's answer readily, hanging up her flour caked apron. \"I'm clocking off until I come back this evening to close. Don't let the day get away from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye,\" Jessica sighed with relief when Sandy left, some unnoticed tension leaving her body and freeing up her shoulders. Feeling emboldened by what she thought she could get away with at work and still suffering from her mysterious hunger pangs, Jessica continued mixing the batter until it was just the right consistency. Then it was time to find a cake mold and bake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she waited for the cake to bake Jessica leaned back, one hand idly reaching for the give of her stomach. She felt kind of bloated from her contest snacking today, a hint of pudge plumping out her middle. Before she started feeling self conscious she got off her duff and tried to tackle her remaining work as her crazy cake was baking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, once it had baked and cooled, Jessica stared longingly at her creation. The cake had turned out far too dark, nearly burnt, although as far as random creations went Jessica was happy that it had kept its shape. Trying a chunk, she was heat heavy with the coffee/cinnamon taste and the end of a melted gummy worm. Although a cake wasn't a cake until it was frosted. Cream cheese frosting was the only way to go, followed up by a caramel drizzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it was time to try a piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" Jessica chewed it over, factoring the taste and texture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm,\" she smacked her lips, trying to bite through a very chewy section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh.\" It was a very dense cake, very strange tasting but still satisfying for Jessica's sudden shift in appetite. She was starting to reach her threshold, however, and with that drew the puzzle of how she was going to leave with the cake without it being noticed by management. Even if the kitchen security camera itself was on the fritz there was one in the hall right outside, she'd be spotted the moment she walked out with the cake.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As nonchalantly as she could manage Jessica left the kitchen with the excuse of retrieving more frosting from the storage freezer to thaw. In actuality she was looking to where the cameras in the staff only section of the restaurant where placed. Her trip, complete with an outer lap into the main section of the building to remember where the other floor cameras were, ended at the kitchen with quite the puzzle facing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica couldn't think of any route out of the kitchen that would allow her to keep her cake hidden. She had to assume the rest of the cameras were still working, unlike the one in the kitchen with its video on the blink. Three cameras were at the staff entrance and branching hallways. The cameras in the dining and playroom were off in the corners but that gave them a wide angle of coverage. Jessica would be seen carrying something cake sized even if it was from a ways off. The real death knell to her take-home plans was the camera just outside the kitchen door. It was a panning camera that would swivel to look down both ends of the hall in turn, although it was directly across from the kitchen door. As the camera cycled through swings there would still be part of the kitchen entrance visible in the corner of the feed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like if Jessica really wanted her cake, she would have to eat it too. Right there in the kitchen during the remaining time of her shift before Sandy came back to close. The real difficulty was that she had been eating over the course of the day, would she really have the room for it? Jessica wasn't one to let food go to waste, her bottom heaviness hadn't only been from hereditary genes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a reluctant sigh Jessica willed herself to eat up the rest of the cake. She couldn't leave any evidence of the forbidden confection for Sandy or management to find. She was beginning to regret having used a 9\" by 13\" pan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo help mask the sounds of her eating from being picked up by the camera's microphone, she started the water in the sink again to make it sound like she was washing dishes. Setting up her impromptu bucket seat by the sink, Jessica rattled some baking trays between bites to complete the effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out Jessica was just two slices away from her threshold. The short, hip heavy baker felt her stomach indicate it was full after a shift of eating far more than usual for her. She looked at the remaining three-quarters of the cake with disappointment. This experiment was about to backfire on her drastically. The sane mind would have cut her losses by now and thrown the cake away, hiding it under further garbage bags.  Yet Jessica couldn't bring herself to do it. Something about strange, bizarre tastes had become addictive for her taste buds, plus cream cheese frosting was one of her favorites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolidering on, Jessica worked her way through another column of cake slices. The gooey chips and half melted gummy worms proved to make each bite slow and it only got slower going the more Jessica ate. What had been a warm feeling of contented fullness was giving away to the pained feeling of being overstuffed. Jessica looked blearily at the cake, idling clattering dishes together to make it sound like she was still busy. Half of it left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother two pieces and her jaw was starting to hurt from all the chewing. Her face was feeling flush. She'd lost track of time, mindlessly eating in the constant battle against the monstrous cake. The groaning from Jessica's stomach changed from gurgles of hunger to moans begging her to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon had to untie the strings of her apron, her middle feeling quite tight. Jessica breathed heavily. She was fit to burst. One lone quarter of the cake remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire situation had become a sunk cost fallacy for Jessica. She was committed to finishing the cake now, believing it would hide the evidence of her overeating on the job (by more overeating on the job). Just small bites of cake was painful, her stomach protested, and there were two slices left to go. Jessica clutched her tender middle but had to stop as it caused a new flare of pain in her belly. The bucket was not a comfortable seat, her bum hanging over each side, however Jessica had effectively pinned herself from such indulgent gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne slice left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica had legitimately run out of room three slices ago. She could feel the backlog of food sitting heavy in her stomach. It felt like it had built up to the bottom of her throat. She was breathing hard, body flush with pain and sweat. The tantalizing random taste of the cake a deadly relief to her pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Jessica gently stoked her stomach, trying to find some kind of relief. Half a slice of cake taunted her. \"...God...\" After a series of short breaths, Jessica squeezed her eyes shut and ate the last of the horrible morsel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat there for far longer than she should have, her legs had fallen asleep. All Jessica could do was lightly moan. Her stomach was so densely packed it didn't budge a millimeter, so densely packed with the densely packed cake. Gripping the side of a counter and the edge of the sink, Jessica laboriously hauled herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she was standing now, her stomach felt like it was still stuck below, the lead weight barely able to digest in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little woozily, Jessica tried to make do with removing the last of the evidence, plopping her cake pan and silverware in the sink to be washed. It took every effort from her to not fall face first into the sink. She was still trying to finish dishes by the time Sandy returned for her closing shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plump cook thought something was amiss when she came to relive Jessica, although she couldn't figure out what. The young baker was typically a fount of energy, although today she had been sluggish. \"You alright, girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-Fine,\" Jessica lied loudly, trying to drown out the angry sounds from her belly. The telltale cake pan was up in the drying rack, nondescript amongst similar pans. It was enough to adage Sandy from further scrutiny, although the cook found it odd that Jessica plodded out of the kitchen with a slow march as she left to clock off.</span></div></div>",

She regretted eating all of that cake. She couldn't explain it, being lost in the mindless consumption throughout the course of the day. At the moment she felt that her esophagus was working against her, reversing its tract as the bodily corridor from mouth to stomach. Her stomach was far too full that food was starting to work its way back. Like she was one of those gaudy PEZ dispensers only for sickly custom cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gastrointestinal organs were currently locked in a truly monuments ordeal. Jessica had stuffed her gullet with plenty of food before she had indulged in her indecent cake concoction. The process of breaking all that food down to unleash more energy was taxing every fiber of her being. The skin along her middle tingled, slick with sweat and feeling confined by her shirt and work pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRest...her body ached for a chance to rest, a chance to sit and digest all she had happened to feed it. The dining hall opened up in her bleary vision. Lights blinked from the stage although the seating was surprisingly empty. Rain pattered away on the metal roof of Gerbert's. Rain. A slow evening. Comforting rain, the sound of rain always helped Jessica fall asleep, especially if life was troubling her. And life was plenty troubling. Jessica had been putting in long hours at the restaurant recently. Then there was her breakup from Jason plaguing her from this morning. She had once thought he was the guy she would always be with...but it was getting harder to think as that feeling of fullness blotted out everything else from her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just needed a rest. Five minutes to sit down. Jessica sat herself in a booth, overjoyed that she had found one without the busted springs. A small bit of relief entered her, her feet happy to be freed from supporting the bulk of her binging. In the distance, or perhaps it was from her fading consciousness, the sounds of arcade games in demo mode bleeped and blipped and rattled in tune with winking lights out of the corner of her eye. The drowsy Jessica failed to notice how her shirt had lifted a few centimeters, freeing a bit of her bulging belly. She was too stuffed to move from this spot, failing to remember that sleeping on the job, especially out in the customer dining, was frowned upon. Still, the booth was a better fit than the tatty old couch in the employee lounge which almost perpetually smelled like drunk employees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting herself in the booth was all it took. Jessica was out like a light, thrust into a food coma and dreamlessly sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know how much time had past, only that her sleep was fitful. When Jessica came too...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was turning out to be a lousy month for Jessica ever since she had broken up with Jason. The stress and how much she\u2019d been working lately must have been getting to her because she felt sick all the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer nose and tongue were hypersensitive. Jessica knew that while Cosmic Crew employees were meant to keep up a modicum of cleanliness standards she hadn\u2019t realized how rank many of the caked in smells to the joint were. Rancid leftovers from the dumpster. The permeation of grease that had seeped into every wall. Jessica couldn\u2019t even look at cracked eggs anymore, which was a problem given that she was a baker for Gerbert Gerbil\u2019s. It was all she could accomplish to no hurl into her cake mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica\u2019 illness did not go unnoticed. Well, in actually Jessica hid her symptoms as best she could because the new floor manager, Mabel Lynn, was a skinny witch if there ever was one, she got the last manager fired just from pulling up all of his dirt. So Jessica had managed to swallow down the ever-present bile and mask her health as best she could, from both Mabel and some of the other employees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy was the one co-worker that knew better, given that both Sandy and Jessica worked in the kitchen. The plumper and slightly older cook wasn\u2019t a nurse by any means but she tried whatever she could to make her younger colleague feel better. All the appreciated efforts were mostly for not as Jessica\u2019s body turned into a sluggish crawl so as to not be violently ill all over the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you haven\u2019t got the flu or something,\u201d Sandy asked one afternoon when Jessica\u2019s face had flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jessica said. \u201cI only seem to get sick when I\u2019m here.\u201d That was a half-truth. Sometimes it was a bear for Jessica to leave her bathroom when getting ready in the mornings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould it be something with those test renovations? I didn\u2019t think Bilbo having to install new animatronics would cause foreign particles in the air.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that either.\u201d Jessica took a seat on the overturned pail. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026ugh, I\u2019ve never been sick like this before. Guess I\u2019m quite late for all my colds this year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica laughed weakly, it was a poor attempt at a joke. But that got her thinking. And dawning comprehension showed on her face as she did some mental math regarding her biological clock. She was LATE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA feeling of butterflies added to her stressed tummy. \u201cCan you,\u201d she asked Sandy, eyes boring ahead into nothing but kitchen appliances, \u201cwould you mind finishing this batch for me? T-there\u2019s something I need to get at the drugstore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWish I could but these Extra Cheese Specials can\u2019t make themselves\u2026\u201d When Sandy turned around Jessica had already left. \u201cDamnit girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the closest drugstore was a few blocks from Gerbert Gerbil\u2019s it didn\u2019t have public restrooms. Jessica was forced to sneak back into work to use the pizzeria toilets. She waited until some giggling girls returned to their birthday party before using a stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon she got the results of the pregnancy test. And it was true that she was late.

Two party days always meant the kitchen was hopping. Sandy, one of the main cooks, could barely keep up with precariously balancing two wide trays with fresh out of the oven pizza, ooey-gooey bubbling cheese on both and crisp pepperoni on one of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could hear the echoes of the screaming kids all the way down the checkered halls of the pizza joint, past the kitchen and prize corner towards one of the private party rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s ready for pizza?\u201d Sandy asked. A veritable hoard of little kids in their party hats and cardboard animal masks screamed in excited jubilation at the prospect of pizza. She sat down both of the pizzas on the table and they were almost devoured on the spot. One of them already had a piece missing, which shocked Sandy until somebody tugged on her uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a little girl in a purple Hippo Don mask. She lifted it up. \u201cCould we get some more soda too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell aren\u2019t you the sweetest!\u201d Sandy had a real soft spot for kids.

I\u2019m finally 8!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re so cute I could pinch your cheeks,\u201d Sandy said, although she refrained from doing so. \u201cI\u2019ll get some more soda, what\u2019s your favorite? Cola? Mountain Dew?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrape soda.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA girl after my own heart that\u2019s one of my favorites.\u201d Sandy could see herself in this little girl. Especially given the snugness of the pink party dress. Sandy had always been a pudgy girl that had grown into a fat young woman, by this point in her life she\u2019d gotten comfortable with that. \u201cEat up, I\u2019ll be back with more soda.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy left the party room with a smile on her face.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Catching sight of her mirrored image in a reflective wall panel, Sandy stopped. There was a gooey string of cheese dangling from the corner of her mouth. Recognizing the taste of sauce and pepperoni on her breath she realized she had eaten the pizza slice compulsively without being conscious of the act. A further stomach rumble punctured this revelation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it was quite common at Gerbert Gerbil's for the kitchen workers to not get their own lunch breaks in the midst of serving scores of pizzas, cakes and other food. Sandy was having to cover a double shift, Jessica Getty was out with some sort of flu, so she was bereft of any quiet moment to find something for lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy put a had to her mouth with a mollified expression. After slurping up the last of the cheese, of course. How many other pizza slices had she unwittingly eaten over the course of the day? Not only was that unprofessional it was also unhealthy. It felt like working at Gerbert's had contributed to some recent weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy looked herself over. Her apron and greased stained red uniform framed her plump curves. Most of the weight was concentrated in her belly, as thick as an industrial sack of flour. Her khaki pants were starting to feel a little snug, although there was still room in them. Her hips and backside had fattened to meet the width of her middle and by this point, Sandy's breasts could no longer be considered modest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, who would want to be known as the cook scarfing down on other customer's pizzas? Catching sight of her reflection like that had given Sandy a moment's contemplation as she rushed back to the soda machine to get that grape soda. She could do with losing a bit of weight, At the very least, finding a way of eating healthier so she wasn't tempted to eat the customers' food while on the clock. She was a decent cook and could always bring lunches from home again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The worst thing about the job was that Roxanne had to help open the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA morning person she was not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe early hours didn't even make sense for this business. They didn't have a breakfast menu to speak of and the earliest they had customers was after noon. Yet here Roxanne Swank had to be, as early as the cooks and management, to help turn everything on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn, you stupid thing!\" This morning in particular had Roxanne struggling with her junker of a car as she blazed through a red light. A cream Volkswagen Beatle, classic model, that had seen better days. She thought the style of car was cute but didn't have the money for a new model or a proper restoration. The handling left a lot to be desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same to you, bud!!\" Roxanne returned the less than friendly gesture to the guy that cut her off (actually her cutting him off) at the turn into the parking lot for Gerbert Gerbil's &amp; the Cosmic Crew. She parked right by the entrance, space reserved for customers. Eventually the boss would have to tell her to move but Roxanne hoped to be persuasive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main problem was that Roxanne's job bridged the divide of cast and crew. She worked as a hostess, of course, but she was also  a few of the characters. Usually the alien costume of Bellixie but also two different narrators and sometimes she did puppet shows as well. It wasn't the best start for the aspiring actress. Yet Roxanne was a true thespian, able to keep up her false small for an entire day of guiding patrons, hosting parties and entertaining children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis pretty much left her pissed any time she wasn't in character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready her reputation at work proceeded her, the other mid morning workers avoiding Roxanne as she stomped through the doors. Any newcomer gawkers soon learned that the busty bombshell had a horrid personality. Roxanne was a true stunner, a leggy wide framed hourglass with hefty breasts, vivid dull red hair and a beauty mark under one eye. She liked to pamper herself, bathed in fragrances from a new shampoo or perfume and dressed more fashionable that her paycheck from Gerbert's would suggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn other words, a total knockout. She gathered plenty of attention from the male sex regardless of age. From a string of hanger on boyfriends, to being the first crush of some of the young patrons or causing dads, uncles or grandfathers to hold their gaze for too long. As for her fellow coworkers, they knew Roxanne to be as witchy as they come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who used up all the instant coffee?\" she yelled from an empty cupboard, breasts swaying from the sudden turn. She got even crankier without the morning caffeine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...we're out,\" mouthed the hip heavy Jessica who paused by the door to the employee's lounge. What the Gerbert's baker didn't say was that she had confiscated the rest of it for some special coffee cake. \"But why not use the Decaff machine? That always has java reserves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want a cup of joe from...it.\" Roxanne's issue was not with the Decaff machine. The term was a misnomer as it wasn't only for decaffeinated coffee. It could make regular, decaf, cappuccino and supposedly iced coffee. It had this shape, though, that was off. Somebody had desired to make a coffee machine have some personality with its design. It didn't quite mesh with the designs of the other animatronics in the restaurant, even with the space theme. To Roxanne the sanctuary of the employee's lounge should not have these connections to the rest of the establishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's cute,\" Jessica said, hitting a switch on the Decaff machine before Roxanne could protest. The vessel within the machine boiled to life. The unit raised up on a set of treads, a robotic arm twisting around to serve the dispensed cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxanne shuddered. The costumed animatronics were one thing. The Decaff machine both was and wasn't anthropomorphized. It had no true face, although those dials on either side of the 'nose' to the machine that held the coffee pot looked too much like eyes for Roxanne's tastes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica wisely fled before Roxanne could unload into her. As much as she hated the machine the disgruntled hostess admitted it was a good cup of coffee. Just enough to get her ready for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what a day it was going to be.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Much to Roxanne's chagrin she was going to suit up in costume all day. The process alone took twenty to thirty minutes out of her day at the best of times. Less if she had help but Roxanne didn't have the friendliest relation with most of her other coworkers. Unlocking the door to Service &amp; Storage Roxanne turned on the lights. All around her were spare costume parts for both workers and the animatronics. Fuzzy displaced parts of the Cosmic Crew were shelved around her, such as Gerbert's torso next to Fuchsia's wings, Moolia's tail and Hippo Don's great purple head, amongst others. Employee uniforms were in the back rack, among with other failed costumed characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxanne didn't remember seeing any of the spare costumes used. Some of them were animal mascots like Gerbert and the crew, some were decidedly more extraterrestrial. Rows of large black eyes stared back at her she found the means to get into character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Roxanne had relished in the privilege of becoming such an integral cast member. The Bellixie character became an important part of the local Cosmic Crew mythos. Unlike the animatronics, which were prone to breaking down, Bellixie required human input to step into the costume and bring her to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling into the outfit most days lessened the high she got from the attention of the role. The costume was effectively a white jumpsuit with pink trim, like a cross between sportswear and an astronaut's uniform. It was quite snug, spandex and velcro making up  most of the outfit's material. Once Roxanne was sealed in she could barely breathe. Regulating her temperature was a nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Roxanne had to lace up the roller skates. She had lied about being a good roller skater during the interview, she hadn't skated since she was a kid but soon picked up the skill again within a week. The roller skates helped her get through the restaurant more quickly, often Roxanne would borrow the skates even when she didn't need them. At least the costume wasn't too large and bulky or rollerskating would be a nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowner to the outfit was the mask. Bellixie had the classic variety of wide, inverted teardrop shaped alien noggin with no nose, a small mouth and green skin with huge round black eyes. Completing this look was a series of green tendrils that acted like hair, for lack of a better term, bound back by a pink and white hairband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the suit was in place, Roxanne changed from a disgruntled wannabe actress into the giggly, hyperactive alien that was equal parts cheerleader, popstar and the worst parts of roller disco. Such was the result of characterization by corporate committee.</span></div></div>",

She felt like a great weight was pressing down on her. \"Stupid, *huff* costume!\" She tried to flail her arms, the motion slowed by the tension from the tight costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like it didn't fit anymore. And it wasn't like the costume had shrunk in the wash, these suits had to be specially dry-cleaned. Admittedly the suit had been constructed with an average woman's build in mind, not someone with Roxanne's generous figure. So it had always been snug on her since she first stepped into the role of the alien mascot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet this was weird. Roxanne was struggling to get on the suit. Had corporate swapped it out for a new one? Was this one of the new hire's stupid pranks? The rage was building within Roxanne, a dangerous proposition for the fiery tempered redhead. The next coworker to tick her off was likely to be fried. In her mind somebody was responsible for all her issues this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that the unlikely person to tell her would survive the encounter, but maybe it was Roxanne's own fault?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps she was getting too voluptuous for her own good. Hadn't the other day, she had prided her self on graduating to a new bra size, a feat she hadn't managed since college? Didn't her rear have an extra bit of wiggle? Her hip checking the car door shut had made that guy coming out of the grocery store drop his jaw in awe. Roxanne loved the attention her dangerous curves sent her way. Although she was dangerously close to not minding her figure. That shopping trip had a fair share of ice cream, chocolates, heavy milk and other rich foods in her shopping basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxanne would never consider herself fat. She was a stunner! All the excess calories were soaked up into her bust and hips, not a hint of pudge elsewhere. A sentiment long overdo for reevaluation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of these hints towards some recent weight gain entered Roxanne's mind at all as she fought to put on the Bellixie costume. She grunted, cursed and swore. It was probably a good thing the little kids weren't around just yet, or they'd be getting some colorful bits of language from overhearing Roxanne's frustrations.</span></div></div>",

Roxanne sat down on a bench in the middle of Service &amp; Storage, utterly defeated and oblivious to the extra pudge on her figure that tried to form a roll as she sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxanne was her own woman, so she absolutely hated what she had to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELLO?\" she called out, \"could somebody come help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe response wasn't imminent. Ideas of possible helpers went through Roxanne's head, none of them particularly flattering. Would it be that witchy new junior manager Mabel Lynn? That schlubby guy whose name Roxanne never remembered? Being caught in a state of half dress with the costume, which was so precise that Roxanne had to strip down to the smallest amount of clothing to get in on, was normally a bit of a turn on for the vicarious aspiring actress. Although now, being found so defeated and sweating up a storm from trying to get the costume on, Roxanne didn't fancy becoming the object of barbed insults or leery-eyed looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CAN SOMEBODY help me??\" Roxanne called again when her first plea went unanswered. She wasn't about to flash through Gerbert's at this hour looking for help, nor was she going to get redressed to find assistance as that would defeat the purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roxanne?\" came a small, questioning voice. It was Jessica Getty, the baker Roxanne had wrote off after being forced to use the uncannily anthropomorphic Decaff machine. Roxanne refrained from scowling, as the wide-reared cook was probably the best she could settee for given the circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Roxanne drawled with a faux-friendly tone, \"would you be able to help little old me get the rest of this on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's what you were doing,\" Jessica said, entering Service &amp; Storage. \"Sorry. I've never been back here before so I didn't know where you were calling from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon surveying the scene of her hostess coworker in the midst of suiting up, Jessica was glad not to be the one that had to strut about in such an outfit. There was something disconcerting about a 'sexy' alien being marketed to kids. Or maybe that was due to Roxanne's own bombshell  figure, better than Jessica's bottom heavy genes. Although she didn't want to earn Roxanne's ire by suggesting she looked to have put on a few pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you to bring those flaps together and latch the velcro,\" Roxanne gestured towards her back the best she could as she continued to lay on the mask of friendliness. \"I'm so glad it's you helping me, Jessica, and not one of the guys who might take advantage of the situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure,\" Jessica replied genuinely but heavily distracted. She wouldn't call herself uneducated but miss Getty had not done the best at school. The most complicated thing she had to deal with her job was setting the oven. The order of operations for closing the flaps, as Roxanne had under-played it, was boggling the mind. She'd seen Roxanne suited up from afar before but Jessica had never comprehended what all went into putting the Bellixie costume together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the baker worked on closing up the back Roxanne smelled a hint of cinnamon and coffee in the air. Whatever it was she wanted a piece, although she supposed that would have to wait until she was on break. \"I want to thank you again, Jessica, for being so understanding about all this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't,\" Jessica wrestled with the straps, \"mention it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxanne liked being pampered. She'd settle for having a nobody trying to dress her up as an alien mascot, as it took her mind off of things just the same. \"Plenty of people try to help me for the wrong reasons,\" Roxanne continued, opening up a hair's breadth. \"They see my hot bod and think I'm easy pickings as an object of affection, they're always after some perverted goal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't say,\" Jessica was only half paying attention, still utterly baffled by how Roxanne had been able to suit herself up before this particular morning when she didn't have the machinations of the back latchings in front of her. Although the hip heavy baker's own love life was not something she'd want to get into at this moment anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You almost done back there?\" Roxanne asked, getting impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost...there...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Roxanne was so tired when she sat down that she missed the sound of her velcro tearing from her back yet again. Finally she had some relative peace and quiet in the booth. It was never really quiet at Gerbert's, bloops and bleeps from the arcade could be heard constantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere had been a double birthday during the early hours the store was open. For Roxanne, that meant staying suited up constantly. Bellixie had to be present for every animatronic show, photo opportunity and birthday cake presentation. Both sets of families had gone for deluxe packages, which required attention to detail to serve the birthday girls (in today's case) plus a dozen or so friends each that wanted a personalized visit to Gerbert Gerbil and the Cosmic Crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the sole human of the Cosmic Crew it was exhausting work. Once the second party was finished, Roxanne found that there was just an hour or so free of patrons until the expected after school crowd. Hopefully none of the previous sets of birthday guests would make a reappearance. Roxanne had quashed her frustrations with the ill fitting costume for long enough, now that she didn't have to be artificially peppy and cheering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank gawd,\" Roxanne sighed when a lunch tray was set in front of her. \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" Jessica Getty said, looking bushed herself as she sat with her own tray. From those two birthdays she had to ice three cakes, the second one needing to be redone because she had outlined the wrong character stencil for the frosting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that chocolate?\" Roxanne asked, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Jessica was knocked out of her funk. \"Oh yeah, chocolate with maple filling. Since I screwed up the second cake, so...\" The baker didn't expect Roxanne would go for the cake first, forgoing utensils as she took a big bites out of her corner slice. Smears of frosting covered the hostess's nose and cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear, those brats don't know cake sometimes,\" Roxanne relished the taste of the cake. \"Those boys kept trying to shove their slices in each others faces. What a fricking waste!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Jessica agreed. She hated seeing anything she baked go to waste. She tried to motion her hands along her face, to see if Roxanne would notice that she was covered in frosting but Jessica was unable to communicate that thought to the hostess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the thanks we get dealing with these snotty nosed kids day in and day out,\" Roxanne angrily bit into her pizza. Lunch had been whatever Jessica could find extra from the catered parties. She had given each of them three slices all from different pizzas, curly fries and carrot sticks. One of the few vegetables Gerbert's served and the kids still didn't go for it. Jessica half felt guilty for her bottom heavy genes so carrots were her go-to side on a meal to pretend that it was healthier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter stuffing her face for a minute, Roxanne finally swallowed enough to notice that her co-worker was staring off into space. Which for a space themed family restaurant and arcade was far too easy to do. \"Hey, Jess? Aren't you eating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Caught off guard again, Jessica scratched behind her blonde bob cut hair. \"S-Sorry.\" Her voice was quiet and wavering. She looked down to her pizza glumly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxanne didn't feel like playing big sister but she couldn't stand her lunch being fouled up by Jessica feeling sorry for herself, especially when Roxanne could read the baker's mood all over her face. \"Spill it, something is eating at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica tried to hold back a sob. \"Sorry.\" She held up a slice of pizza to her lips, although her mind wasn't on eating right now. \"I was just thinking about Jason. We've been going out for two years...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh,\" Roxanne took another large bite of pizza. She could smell drama from a mile away, already guessing what type of issue Jessica would be facing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we were close. And physical, he used to be such a fun boyfriend. I thought he cared. But...\" She started to sniffle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please,\" Roxanne leaned over as far as her bust would let her, reaching for some napkins. \"Go on. Bow it out of your system.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica cried and sneezed into the napkins. \"He...He...but he keeps making fun of me! Whenever I'm clumsy, whenever I get something wrong. And when we last made love he was teasing that my behind was getting too big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please,\" Roxanne rolled her eyes. \"You've been complaining about this guy for how long, Jess?\" Roxanne didn't want to dedicate the brain cells to remember how long she had know Jessica, since at least the time she had started working at Gerbert's. \"A man that wants more from the relationship that sex wouldn't be criticizing all your flaws, let alone your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really,\" Roxanne nodded. \"So dump his ass already before he dumps you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica sobbed louder. If Roxanne wasn't so tired from working two parties she would have taken her lunch elsewhere to eat in privacy. She was too exhausted and hungry to move. She did relieve Jessica of some curly fries since her mind clearly wan't on food. Although if she kept crying Roxanne was going to tell her to stuff a sock in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Jessica had some intelligent conversation out of her blubbering. \"You're right, Roxanne. I've been fooling myself with Jason for so long. He's such a jerk, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, jerks are a dime a dozen,\" Roxanne replied sagely. \"No use crying over them.\" Roxanne's own overdeveloped bod had awakened her sexual experiences sooner than most girls after puberty. She'd had a lengthy string of boyfriends and exes, all eager to feel up her curves during sex, but Roxanne soon tired of those that only wanted her to put out. She could land any man but most of them were as brainless as they considered her to be, which was their downfall when dealing with a woman with as much personality as Roxanne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica blew her nose one last time. \"Thanks, Roxanne. That really makes me feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me Roxy, Jess,\" Roxanne said, starting to feel for her co-worker's plight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, Roxa-Roxy,\" Jessica smiled and tucked back into her lunch, missing out on the fact that she had far more carrot sticks than curly fries as Roxanne polished off her plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could go for another slice of that cake,\" Roxy said, \"how 'bout you?\"</span></div></div>",

The baker had confronted her boyfriend about their relationship falling to pieces, beating Jason to the punch as he admitted to wanting to break things up with Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt brought her much needed closure, although for two days she was distraught and blubbering. Roxanne was her reluctant shoulder to cry on, at first, but the hostess soon took to having the attention from Jessica. Not only did her junior find her a mentor in the ways of love, she also brought Roxy lunch, which was a plus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Jessica was over her boy issues the two found that they had more in common than just working at Gerbert's. Jessica had an appreciation for the theatre, although she had never acted. They watched the same soap operas and liked the same foods. Both of them were thrifty when looking for fashion, as Roxy played mentor again to improve Jessica's wardrobe while the latter had practical remedies to save clothes from stains and wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot!!\" Roxy cried out when a glob of mustard landed on her silk blouse. She had paused, mid-fry to her mouth, to chuckle at a story Jessica had about something strange that had happened at the grocery store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry.\" Jessica reached across with a napkin to mop up the stain. \"We can easily get that removed with a vinegar wash. I can bring some from the kitchen to the laundry room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all?\" Roxy asked amazed, as Jessica's domestic know-how was saving her a mint on her dry cleaning bills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we can do that before close.\" Technically the laundry was only supposed to be used for company uniforms and costume pieces, not the fancy personal clothes Roxy wore as hostess. Yet the busty bombshell was mildly corrupting the simple Jessica, who was self-justifying more lenient behaviors at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch as the extent of their lunches. What had started as a way to eat unused food had morphed into treating Gerbert's as a personal kitchen. Their employee discount only accounted for staled food, yet the food that was 'staling' was made extra by Jessica just so the two could continue to cater their lunch breaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food was becoming experimental as well. Who said the fryer couldn't be used for homemade stromboli instead of onion rings? While couldn't the cake maker be used for a rum cake matching the recipe Roxy had read about in a magazine? And so what if nacho cheese was unapproved as a pizza sauce?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica loved the chance to improve her cooking and Roxanne relished the newfound tastes to be had in the fried food. Working at Gerbert's had made the chow boring for the hostess. Jessica had been able to find new ways to spin it. Roxy had gone from thinking that she could always blame Jessica if the two ever got in trouble for unauthorized food to wanting to protect her because damn, this stuff was tasty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unlikely pair had been building their friendship around these lunches, and the lunches had expanded considerably. What used to be combo plates had graduated to meal platters, as personal sized pizzas were traded for splitting a medium. Then large. And soon it looked like half an extra large wouldn't satisfy both women, and that was before we talked about the sides like fries, breadsticks and corndog bites!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their friendship was growing, so too did Jessica and Roxanne grow. For the dumpy pear shaped baker, her weight was settling onto her lower half. Her hips gained a couple inches as her thighs plumped up considerably. Whereas her growing rear had been a point of contention with her ex Jason, Jessica's butt had graduated past that point to grow even more wobbly. The extra cushion meant Jessica sat slightly higher in her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't just her rear, however, that was gaining a layer of fat. Her belly took on a share of calories, and her arms were chunkier. Jessica's height made any weight gain drastic, as she would be sporting a double chin and plenty of backfat soon if her appetite continued to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxanne, in contrast, wore her weight far differently. The curvaceous bombshell with her hourglass body was used to ripening in all the best places as she put on weight. All of this pizza and fried food was knocking a blow to her metabolism, unfortunately. Roxanne had been oblivious to her gain thus far, as she treated the growth of her curves as something of a second puberty, making her all the more sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet Roxanne wasn't a ripe hourglass anymore. As the newfound weight settled on her body, one of her assets had outgrown the others to the point that her profile was changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of her typical hourglass, Roxanne put most of her pounds into one feature:</span></div></div>",

She shrugged and turned back to the novel she was reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem, miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet another voice from nowhere. This weirded out the clerk to no end until she stepped away from the register. There was a short man with thick glasses, dressed in green and brown, who hadn't been seen from the other side of the bakery case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry,\" the clerk said, stifling a bit of a giggle. What a tiny man! She almost could have stepped on him. Her expression was easily portrayed on her face, as the man sighed wearily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I could get an apple turnover, one of your bacon breakfast sandwiches, a lox bagel, a coffee with one creamer and an orange juice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe balked at the order. \"Who's joining you for breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just me, miss.\" Bilbo Dennings pushed his glasses up his nose. \"Could you please be quick about it? I'm on call today and I don't have much time for breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged off his concerns and set to getting Bilbo's breakfast at a less than hurried pace. Bilbo found a chair to hop up onto. He had curly, reddish brown hair. At his size he should probably watch what he ate more often, given his small frame left little space to keep any pounds. He had a slight potbelly from having to rush his meals. For those that asked what his job entailed they soon heard an earful of it during the time it took Bilbo to give a full polish to his glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe worked at Gerbert Gerbil &amp; the Cosmic Crew. Not regularly, at least that was how the position was originally advertised. Gerbert's was the newest and most technologically advanced in children's dining and entertainment. Most of the infrastructure was dedicated to the mascot animatronics and their mobile platforms, a system that was Bilbo's primary concern. Although this had spread out into other issues the restaurant faced. Whatever hoodoo Bilbo or another worker had triggered there had been a downward spiral of problems at the establishment as of late. Bilbo dreaded the signal of his pager interrupting his time off. He'd had so little time to enjoy his own life outside of work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was with relish and enthusiasm that Bilbo anticipated his breakfast, now more of a brunch given the hour of the morning, to enjoy without having to be called in. The majority of his past meals had been rushed or making use of his employee's discount at the restaurant. Much as he could be abashed about his height, although it made crawling under tight hatches and spaces easier, Bilbo wanted to be out amongst the world beyond Gerbert's. Beyond kids he saw at eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>BREEEEEEVVV</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Bilbo cried, startling the bakery worker that was just bringing his plate. \"No, no, no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bag it up! I'm going to have a confounded working brunch yet again.\" Bilbo pulled out his pager, dreading the issue he was going to face at work.</span></div></div>",

Whereas most of the other chapters are about the antics of weight gain, the following chapters have the plot and mystery of Gerbert's at the forefront. This does not mean that there is no avenue for weight gain but the importance has shifted from there to explore story choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStories within this category are about the pursuit of truth, of getting to the source of what is wrong at Gerbert's and trying to do something about it. Alongside the other themes of this interactive (the weight gain and expansion) this puts them in peril more frequently than other characters. The What and How of the primary mystery will vary greatly amongst the choices following these chapters trading off with how the characters come to indulge themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome options may also focus on different storytelling techniques, which will be listed below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Security Guards</b></u><br>\r\nSurprisingly, Gerbert's requires a small and dedicated security force, for the protection of the young patrons and sensitive company assets. If only the security force was given the support, training and respect they deserve. They become the front line, so to speak, against the threats inherent to Gerbert Gerbil's. Further characters can be selected in that option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Diane Peakes</b></u><br>\r\nOccupation: sheriff<br>\r\nAge: 37<br>\r\nBody Type: stocky, imposing but soft<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rural county sheriff with Gerbert Gerbil &amp; the Cosmic Crew within her jurisdiction. She's had a credited career for her time on the force leading to her promotion to a young sheriff. Although since then, with crime at an all time low Diane has gotten quite soft. In both contexts, although her hounding sense of justice just needs a kick in the keister. She's an unabashed example of the cop loving doughnuts stereotype.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever is wrong with Gerbert's, she'll be doing what she can to solve it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Houston Tuttle</b></u><br>\r\nOccupation: Cosmic Crew Entertainment personal affairs and publicity<br>\r\nAge: 29<br>\r\nBody Type: chiseled, statuesque<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHouston is a fast track businessman who has found himself just below the upper management of Cosmic Crew Entertainment. This puts him under a lot of pressure but he gets through it with sharp smiles and a nose for finding quick solutions to problems. Often this means he puts in only enough effort to please the bosses. Sometimes it comes from his own distractions. He could find a better job than Gerbert's but he's becoming notorious as a chubby chaser for those staff and clientele in his age range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever is wrong with Gerbert's, he'll be doing what he can to cover it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>The Culprit</b></u><br>\r\n<i>Written in Second Person PoV</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know who you are, so we won't say it just yet. But everything wrong with Gerbert's? From critical breakdowns to the unhealthy, fattening food, that's your doing. The person the others see on the outside isn't important, at least in your mind, because we are following your mind. Gerbert's is yours, and you are prepared to keep it that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>The Entity</b></u><br>\r\n<i>Written in First Person PoV</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's nothing human at the core of Gerbert Gerbil's troubles. It's entirely supernatural. I should know. I'm the one behind it. Although my story can't properly be told without false pretenses. 'I' 'me' and 'my' are entirely elements to make my story feel relatable. There isn't an 'I' behind my influence, no sole manifestation that will explain everything. Maybe I'm an unexplainable force, the personality of the restaurant itself, or something else entirely. All I can do is persist. And try to change things.</span></div></div>",

And that's before getting to the parts of the job they never mention in the company packet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe security guards find themselves under considerable risk. They are the ones thrust into unknown situations when everything goes wrong. So learning to adapt is key. However Gerbert's can be quite deceptive as the majority of the time the establishment is quite quiet. With little to do and plenty of food about, it's not surprising for guards to take longer breaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are some security guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Douglas Stolz</b></u><br>\r\nAge: 33<br>\r\nBody Type: skinny<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDouglas had always wanted to be a police officer. Unfortunately for him he broke his foot in basic training. That brought the discovery that he had a bone density problem in his lower extremities and with it his dreams of being a cop had to be put to rest. Upon finding the job posting for new security at Gerbert's he jumped at the chance, although he did not know what he was getting into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Michelle Neith</b></u><br>\r\nAge: 28<br>\r\nBody Type: chunky but strong<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe well tanned 'Chelly' has already made a name for herself as a security guard at Gerbert's. She can appear no nonsense and quite stern, although she'll drop her stoic nature when she thinks no one is around. She's quite tough, which can catch people by surprise, although her metabolism isn't what it used to be. It seems like even from standing guard she's gained a few pounds just from the greasy air in the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Taylor LaBelle</b></u><br>\r\nAge: 29<br>\r\nBody Type: average<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new hire.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Douglas always kept his uniform as trim and pressed as possible. It wasn't much, with a meaningless cheap badge and the indigo broken up with starry patterned patches, but Douglas kept it presentable. It wasn't a cop uniform, the job Doug had longed to have if it wasn't for his bone density problems. Still, he kept to the job with the mindset of a law enforcement officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA job he should be thankful for, as Gerbert's was hiring when he left the police academy. At first Douglas wasn't sure on the job, being associated with such a cheesy, child targeted business. Who was ever going to take his security credentials seriously after guarding such a silly place like a space themed party center? It was the only option Douglas had for his chosen career, so he was going to make the most of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis other concern was interacting with the children. He had been a kid once, of course, yet Douglas felt he didn't relate to them all that much. Thankfully he was often on the skeleton crew shifts, usually the night watch and mornings when there weren't children about. The need for the night guard had surprised him when he first noticed the classified ad. His interview at Gerbert's soon showed why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor one thing, the pizzeria and arcade was surprisingly large. There was the dinning hall, three private party rooms, activity center, kitchen and other amenities. And most critical to watch were the expensive animatronics. Doug marveled at the characters when he first saw them. Gerbert Gerbil, the main mascot, a puffy furred gerbil in an old fashioned astronaut's suit. Hippo Don, former space gangster turned electronica musician. Moolia, a hybrid cow with yellow, pink and blue spots. And Fuchsia the Flamingo, the most articulated of the Cosmic Crew. These animatronics required the most attention, being the characters at the center of the restaurant's experience. The company feared anybody sneaking in to mess with the delicate systems at work with the animatronics, so a single night guard was required most nights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt may not have been a career in law enforcement but it was a step in the right direction. And the times Douglas was alone on shift were thankful ones. Truth be told he was trying to build up his strength for standing long periods. He had to rest his legs more than he felt someone of his age should. Even for a security guard it would be bad form to sit for the whole shift. A small part of him still hoped for better prospects than guard duty at Gerbert Gerbil &amp; the Cosmic Crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo how has the job been treating Doug?</span></div></div>",

Her usual routine had been squished down by her schedule at Gerbert Gerbil's. All her exercise had to be crammed into one intensely short workout, as punctuality was a key to keep getting paid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle was a well built brunette. Toned arms, powerful thighs. She was active in different sports in high school, happier times before the drudgery of an adult life. Of taking a security gig at the mascot filled eatery and arcade, a crappier job than she had anticipated. She needed to save her paychecks up if she wanted to move on with her life, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid,\" she huffed, \"cheap ass uniforms!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe uniform for the security guards, an indigo blue outfit much like a police uniform but with starry patterned pockets, was officially the worst uniform ever made. Clingy, starchy and static-accumulating at all times, it was always uncomfortable. And the fabric had shrunk after the first wash. So did her second one. Any more uniforms she would have to buy out of her own pocket, unless the clothes were irreparably damaged by her employers. She had yet to figure out a way to make that stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pants were tight going up her strong thighs, belt struggling to cinch. Michelle had a shapely, well muscled rear that fit these pants well before the laundry shrinkage. Now things were getting tight in the waist. Maybe it was the uniform. Or maybe the start of what would have been toned abs were covered by just the barest roll of fat. It didn't help that she was surrounded by customers eating pizzas, snacks and fatty deserts all day, the air was saturated with stale grease at the restaurant. Hence the need to keep up her exercising, she might get fat from the air alone at Gerbert's!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't help that her metabolism had slowed down since she was a teenager. As a champion athlete in high school she had eaten monster amounts of calories to get energy, leaving her fit with a perky set of breasts compared to others on her team. It was hard to pinpoint exactly where her metabolism started failing her, she had to be more conscious of what and how much she ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least the shirt wasn't nearly as tight as the pants. Although her clip on tie hid the few buttons across her chest that were starting to strain. Already the uniform itched and she hadn't even gotten to work yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say Michelle was not in a good mood when she clocked in for her shift. There were company policies about staff always having big smiles when dealing with customers, something Michelle gave an honest effort for when she started. But her patience had been wearing thin from the typical flack given towards the security staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother day at Gerbert Gerbil &amp; the Cosmic Crew.

Exiting out of the vehicle Diane Peakes stood at her full 5\u20194\u2019\u2019, a very full 5\u20194\u2019\u2019. She hitched her radio on her belt and proceeded to walk into the bakery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDiane!\u201d said a chipper middle aged man.

She had been a deputy sheriff for a few years before her predecessor had retired and she took on the full position. Not that Sheriff Peakes was bad at her job but crime in the county was at an all time low. Most of the time she just sat in the car with her deputies watching for speeders on the highway. Her time spent on such stakeouts had softened Diane, no one would tell it to her face but she had definitely packed on a few pounds. Most of it from getting a dozen doughnuts for breakfast each day (and being the one who ate most of them). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, however, was going to be different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Diane was receiving the box her radio squawked. \u201cSheriff, we\u2019ve got some more intell on an, um, incident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to go Lou.

Diane\u2019s niece had a birthday here two months ago. Otherwise Sheriff Peakes couldn\u2019t remember any other complaints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother squad car had already been on the scene once Diane drove up. Gerbert\u2019s was closed except for the morning crew. There may not even be customers today depending on how long this took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiane\u2019s number two, Deputy Ruben Lamport, ducked under the yellow tape. He was a square jawed man who always kept himself to full uniform. \u201cLooks to be a doozy here sheriff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBring me up to speed again, Ruben,\u201d Diane said after swallowing the last of her doughnut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s like this sheriff\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Most days, Houston felt lucky if he got to stay in the office. A feeling not found in most other workers. For the most part Houston actually liked office work. The corporate offices of Cosmic Crew Entertainment were not the biggest or most successful, although Houston stayed in a carved off little niche since coming to the company. He had to admit, many of the proposed projects were interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCosmic Crew Entertainment was the brains behind the Gerbert Gerbil franchise, which also went by the same moniker. It got by with the immense marketability potential from the mascots of the original family fun restaurant. Gerbert's hit everything that was popular with the target demographic right now. Kids loved space. They also loved animal characters. And with the inclusion of the arcade and playground it should be a winning combination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKey word, should.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause Gerbert's was facing a lot of problems. Anything that could go wrong tended to go wrong at the restaurant, putting reality at odds with the proposed expansions the office wanted to have for the franchise. Which brought us to the point where Houston had carved his niche.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn't earned a big desk yet although the ex-jock did have a small, modest office. He set the marbles of his newton cradle to clacking, the sharp sound helping him think. Houston looked like a guy that worked out or used to. He had played hockey, almost would have tried out professionally if not for a falling out with the recruiter. Still, anything that reminded him of the hard impact of the puck hitting the ice took Houston back, pushing his instincts into overdrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, Cosmic Crew Entertainment could be a difficult place to work for. Houston should know, he'd been scratching his shaved chin finishing up a report on past issues he had dealt with this year. He was nearly up to sixty pages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that these issues were small fries by any means. First deliveries to the restaurant would hit a snag. Then food quality was reported low, complaints from customers, high staff turnover. The equipment would break down, the kitchen had to be retrofitted twice, construction crews had to come back to finish jobs that hadn't been don correctly, then the animatronics started to break down. They needed more technicians hired, their single one needed more training, the health inspector threatened to shut them down (--Houston had a note here; Sally Norn was her name, wasn't it? Good figure, easy to sway, might be able to convince her otherwise if he invited her to dinner--) and their utilities were overdrawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, that was just one month and the first dozen pages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich really was a shame. Houston knew of several proposed projects in the works that looked interesting. Cosmic Crew Entertainment worked hard to innovate to keep attracting the kids. Such projects included new attractions, additional menu items, further merchandise and even talk of another TV show. But as the old adage in business went, you had to spend money to make money, and Gerbert's was too frequently in the red to make any headway on these new ventures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHouston sighed, leaned back in his chair. To his surprise he smelled the steam of fresh coffee hitting his nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like you needed some caffeine, Mr. Tuttle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Estelle, you're a peach, you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to be the only one who tells me that, Mr. Tuttle.\" Estelle was the floor secretary although Houston liked to imagine she was only his. Polite, friendly, always anticipated what you needed next. And she had quite a figure too. As Houston watched her leave, clutching the empty tray, he felt quite elevated. And it wasn't from the coffee. It was from watching Estelle's backside sway as she walked, she filled out that pencil skirt quite well. She had a pair of calves that made men wonder how the elasticity of pantyhose held out. And dare he imagine it, the waist of her skirt was looking a bit snug, with perhaps a slight pooch to her middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHouston could easily lose himself observing the other females in the office. Mainly Estelle. Doris in promotions wasn't bad either, nice rack, although she was quite the shrew when you were talking with her. This retrospection could go on for minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil his intercom buzzed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Houston--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh jezus Parsons don't say it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--we have a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn you, Parsons.\" Houston chuckled with a bit of a groan. As if he hadn't been hearing that all his life. And it only worsened when he became employed at Cosmic Crew Entertainment. \"What is it now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope you're ready for a trip, Houston,\" came the click back, \"they need you out in the field.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again?\" As said, Houston was lucky to stay around the office. So much for a coffee refill from Estelle.</span></div></div>",

It's one thing for people to say they want to be an artist, an actor, or an accountant. Nobody bats an eye at those choices. But when you get to talking, about your fantasies and passions, everyone gave you a wide berth. Worse, some looked at you with accusation. You learned to laugh, shrug it off. Downplay your intention into a joke, because if you hadn't someone would have done something about it if they had realized you were serious. They would think you a criminal, a lunatic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you felt there was nothing to be ashamed of. Once you had been there, that first time, you realized that Gerbert Gerbil &amp; the Cosmic Crew felt like home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike it was yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr rather, it was like the childhood you had never had. So many children flocked there, the town came alive when that restaurant was built. All so often, past the fliers around town and the commercials in-between the hit cartoon, you heard about the customers that went there talk about going to Gerbert's. How the mascots moved about on stage, so lifelike. How they roamed the restaurant, delighting the hearts of many. You just had to check it out for yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when you were there, something clicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou *got* what Gerbert's was all about. From the menu, the layout, the clientele and the infrastructure, the whole restaurant fit you like a glove. You felt more alive there than you had anywhere else. Others saw a display to bedazzle that childlike need for whimsy. Others saw a run-down, over ambitious dorky pizza joint with a strange them. You, only you, felt like you could do anything there. And you have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDone *anything* that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that's putting the horse before the cart in some respects. Launching into your exploits before establishing how you grew into that role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were awkward at first, even with Gerbert's to empower you. It took some time before you refined your method. But eventually you found that means of interface. Your exact relationship with Gerbert's.</span></div></div>",

They had hired guards to watch the place day and night. To protect the young patrons and protect the expensive equipment, animatronics and other assets. It would have helped them if they had competent guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Gerbert's first opened you allowed yourself three days, separate visits at random times of the month to be in attendance. You would have stood out too much, with no direct child or family relation to the restaurant's usual demographic. That day guard, the slightly chunky woman, almost pegged you on your third visit. But by that point you had succeeded at memorizing your internal map of the establishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had surreptitiously taken note of the security cameras. Estimated their range and coverage. Whoever must have built Gerbert\u2019s must have been in a rush or failed to recheck their notes. Many items in the restaurant\u2019s layout, from arcade machines to the play area, created many blind spots to hide from the cameras.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdd to this the seldom watched back entrance to Gerbert\u2019s that faced the abandoned strip mall and you had your means of egress. Laying in wait, catching a lucky break from the pothead that went on a smoke break allowed you to jam the door lock. It remained undiscovered late into the night when you entered Gerbert\u2019s after hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompared to the bustle of the day, with screaming kids and the bleeps of video games and the routine shows of the Cosmic Crew, the restaurant was dead silent when you entered. Perfect, a quiet time to marvel at your conquest and privately delight in the darkened, motionless mascot eatery that had so captured your attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stalked the back halls, keeping out of sight of the cameras as you added employee sections to your mental layout of Gerbert\u2019s.

Things you were very good at, even if it would pertain to the restaurant directly, you omitted from your first set of references.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour only goal was to get employed. And employed you got, since anyone with a pulse could be employed by that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe job was grueling, they had no real place to assign you when you first started out. That was fine.

Some attracted your attention immediately. Others earned your scorn, marked on an internal list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately your true job at Gerbert's was unimportant. You weren't thinking about occupation. You were thinking about fulfillment. Of starting to grow in confidence and meaning, staking your claim to the restaurant by finding that niche that was yours and yours alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you to stay later today,\" your boss would say. Everyone else would complain. Everyone would agree that you were never bothered about picking up extra work or shifts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" you'd say.

Even though you were beyond the age of the children that flocked to Gerbert\u2019s you neither looked too old to be there. There was an initial but poorly enforced policy of patrons requiring an appropriately aged child to chaperone if they were too old for the establishment. On the flip side this meant that children required some supervision from family or guardians. However this was constantly ignored as trying to manage multiple swaths of children was a nightmare for the staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found the best way to stay unnoticed was to stay quiet. Have a soft smile, be polite, don't do anything egregious to your being there. If anyone else were to ask what you were doing it would appear pointless. Wasteful. It helped that you tipped well, you weren't hurting for money. As long as you didn't raise a stink no one gave you a problem. In fact, you would go as far to say that you were a relief for stressed waitstaff, when kids whined and angry parents were set to raise hell when the elements of their progeny's birthday party were lackluster. You were someone to joke with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately your friendliness was a means to the end. Why be burdened with the responsibilities at Gerbert's when you could stay a customer. Food was decent, there was a variety of games at the arcade. Those two avenues were the most appropriate whenever a fresh faced employee was curious as to why you frequented the restaurant so frequently. Still, you'd stay in the back watching a Cosmic Crew animatronic show, even linger out the door of a private party room for too long to catch the routines of the mascots when they traveled the track to a personal visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't just the restaurant itself that drew your attention...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people that went there gained your fascination as well. For as much as some of the Cosmic Crew routines, especially the purpose of the 'Bellixie' character played by a staff member in costume, wanted to make sure kids stayed active that was hardly the case. Many more patrons fit the other end of the spectrum. The play pen would be sparsely populated compared to the bodies hunkered down to consume the widespread spread at Gerbert's. You knew how tasty half of it could be and you saw the obvious effects it had on clientele and staff. Besides children, the primary demographic of Gerbert's, there was a hidden second demographic only you seemed to realize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe establishment attracted fat people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that delighted you. From broad hips, full bellies, weighty backsides, full bosoms, tight clothes from the young and old, you liked it all. Each day there were new people to marvel at, new shapes to drive you wild. You started to learn the names of some regulars, bond over a like of the restaurant, allowing you to get closer and offer them the reminder of your purposefully half eaten lunch or save them the steps to get a soda refill. Many of the business crew developed stress eating habits as well, which you offered words of encouragement to lift their spirits along with encouragement to remind them how tasty something on the menu was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerbert's was a fat admirer's paradise. But that alone wasn't going to keep you off the radar. You had to pair your ambitions with something else.</span></div></div>",

Outside of their display platforms they are delicate, jerky things highly dependent on their connection to power and the computers that perform their sub routines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh wait, you were talking about the animatronics at Gerbert Gerbil &amp; the Cosmic Crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe animatronics aren't just state of the art. They behave far differently than what's expected for robots, they blend captivating performances with fine motor control and many other purposes. Gerbet's is outfitted with a special track in the floor, usually covered except for special times, that allows the dais for each animatronic to move about the restaurant. They are machines of metal, fur and feathers. Yet they appear so lifelike that many wonder if the animatronics do feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat can be said is that after the animatronics were installed they began exhibiting strange behavior. Let alone that there is behavior, beyond their preprogrammed personalities, is unexpected. They were meant to delight children, and the characters are popular to many. Yet there is still something unnerving about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStories within this category are about choice and the extremes of expression. Each Gerbert's mascot as a set personality, determined by cosmic Crew Entertainment to target children demographics, but the animatronics themselves are not the exact same characters. Something has happened to them, or perhaps it was always like this. Maybe their 'defects' are only noticed after hours, or perhaps they have become more pronounced in normal operating hours. In many ways, this is an exploration of how character is created outside of artificial character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most notable animatronics are as follows:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Gerbert Gerbil</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerbert Gerbil is a tawny, brave and heroic astronaut with a mildly outdated spacesuit who explores the cosmos in his rocket ship. As the main mascot of the restaurant and the in-universe stage shows, Gerbert is the upfront leader with his buck toothed grin. While the very face of the whole franchise detractors say his characterization is too generic and bland, nothing out of the ordinary as far as astronaut gerbils are concerned. Probably because no one pays attention to what happens when the Gerbert animatronic is \u2018off the clock.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Hippo Don</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippo Don is Gerbert\u2019s best friend, a purple reformed gangster hippo that now fancies himself a big shot musician with all the attention he thinks that career deserves. He remixes public domain soundtracks to new wave electronica-disco hits, unbearably cheesy to sit through. Although on the side of good, many of the Cosmic Crew plots are both caused (and paradoxically solved) by Hippo Don\u2019s former criminal connections. Some think is characterization is even better than Gerbert\u2019s and like his funny antics. Although in some perspectives, the gangster may not be that far removed from his pre-musician persona roots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Moolia the Cow</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoolia is a white cow with pink, blue and yellow spots. Originally a heifer from earth and accidentally swept up in Gerbert\u2019s adventures, several contradictory circumstances have made her alien to her species. She serves as the Cosmic Crew\u2019s manager of the ship\u2019s kitchen and personally endorses the entire restaurant\u2019s menu. The Moolia animatronic is outfitted with special freezers and mixers, able to serve the signature malts and other frozen treats to customers at designated times. Otherwise she has a bubbly and chipper personality that\u2019s often considered shallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Fuchsia the Flamingo</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuchsia the Flamingo is a long necked dancer that seems out of place in the Cosmic Crew. Her usual color scheme is her namesake color with purple and pink accents, much like the flower, although her feathers include fiber optic cables for color changing properties. She was originally pitched to encourage kids to stay active and dance, although is something of a failure in that regard. She ends up being the least developed personality of the Cosmic Crew, in some part pertaining to the misfortune of Fuchsia being the most complex animatronic and thus frequently breaking down. With unusual articulation points, ridiculous choreography routines and the aforementioned color shifting, there\u2019s a stigma of Fuchsia being the animatronic that causes things to go wrong. Yet despite being put in the background she has a cult following of fans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Hamster Louie</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHamster Louie is a sandy hamster and fellow astronaut alongside Gerbert, a rival ever since they were cadets. At least, that\u2019s the story nowadays. Truthfully Louie is a prototype animatronic before Gerbert and the others, originally meant to be the primary mascot until his characterization was scrapped in favor of newer models. Since then he\u2019s been looking quite thin and shabby compared to Gerbert\u2019s puffier frame, as he lacks critical maintenance and upkeep. The newest trend have been painting him as a villain character looking to discredit Gerbert Gerbil yet always doomed to fail. Although a villainous take on his character may have always been present from the beginning. He certainly has some sort of sway with the various minor animatronics in the restaurant.</span></div></div>",

It's time to blast off with Gerbert Gerbil!</i>\" These words were heard at the start of nearly every Cosmic Crew floor show. A chorus of children's cheers proceeded the opening of the curtain to the stage. There, front and center, was the namesake Gerbil himself in his spacesuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Gerbert was a Gerbil he was nowhere near the size of one. The animatronic was many tens of times larger than the small rodent of his species. With his retractable helmet he was the tallest of the mascots, even able to dwarf most parents in that regard. Only Fuchsia was said to be taller because of her extendable neck, although due to breakdowns that had been bolted back into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe music started up for the mascot's signature \"Cosmic Crew Fall In!\" song that introduced all the characters. With robotic precision the characters went through the programmed routine. For some kids who had never been to the restaurant before it was delightful. Others, the regulars, were starting to tire of the same jokes and lyrics. All the same Gerbert had many young fans. He was, after all, the star of Cosmic Crew Entertainment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>We h-h-hope to se-see you back real s-soon!</i>\" Gerbert waved goodbye with an iconic buck toothed grin as the curtain fell on the show stage, signaling the end of the fifteen minute show. While the crowd of children could be heard dispersing to the game corner or turning back to their meals, the backdrop behind the show stage lifted up. The dais of each animatronic moved back on their tracks to their maintenance stations, where a blue suited technician was talking to a much shorter, chubbier fellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God damnit, what keeps making that stutter?\" said the technician, angrily clearing his throat as he was immediately on Gerbert to open up a side panel under his helmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starting to think its the actuator,\" said Bilbo Dennings, the restaurant's main technician. Truthfully the only employed technician, as the company didn't consider hiring anyone else full time. Although there was too much on the little guy's plate with the constant work needed for the animatronics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like that will affect the voice box,\" the temp scoffed. In truth this was his third call out to the Gerbert Gerbil &amp; the Cosmic Crew restaurant. And it was definitely going to be his last. As he sought to find the right access panel there was a sudden jerk of Gerbert's eyes his direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good thing the backstage was soundproofed, given how much the temp technician swore from the surprise. Bilbo tentatively removed the fingers from his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of them are damn creepy, that's for sure,\" the blue suited man spat. \"Sooner I get paid the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilbo sighed. Yet another mechanic to wash his hands of the place. The short man had been hoping for a lunch break but he could sense that he was going to have to do most of the work on Gerbert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore his next scheduled appearance the two technicians did everything they could think of to fix the stutter. No dice, ultimately. The origin of Gerbert's stuttering voice box remained a mystery in what little time they had. Hopefully it wouldn't get worse. Bilbo could already imagine the comments to be had about the glitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout it all Gerbert just stared. He was an animatronic in low power mode. He could only stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Gerbert Gerbil's establishment was a very different place at night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole building was empty and dark, with only the night guard on duty. In the dark the arcade and game machines were monoliths, a low electrical hum heard in some places. When the building was this empty any sounds tended to echo across each room and hallway. Everything was shut down and closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*vvvrrrrrrrrt-*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, almost everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>H-H-Hey-y, hey Kids!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Gerbert was on the move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle Neith was disgusted with her luck. Here it was, supposed to be her weekend off but she had to fill in on the night shift. Douglas Stolz had come down with some sort of stomach flu and there was nobody else to step in for the night shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh!\" It didn't help that the night watch was two kinds of annoying. Dull and stuffy. Rarely did anything happen, the need for security was just the company's paranoia. Even if burglars from rival companies got in, how would they ever manage to cart off one of the animatronics? The giant machines were clunky, utter beasts to move when they weren't on their track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would it kill them to leave the air on overnight?\" Michelle itched at the tight collar of her indigo and star speckled security uniform. Budget cuts would be the likely answer she would get if she made a compliant. Stale air did little to make the uniform more comfortable. Michelle was starting to worry that the pants were starting to chafe between her well built thighs. She had quite the set of hips but at least she was fit. Mostly fit, She didn't have the metabolism of her teenage self, although the appetite remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe security booth she sat in was boring, nothing to do but watch the uneventful camera feeds. True, she cold look back over footage from the day's operations but there were no incidents to report on. All the power left on overnight was for minimal systems, she couldn't anything like turn on an arcade cabinet to find something to pass the time with. Much to her chagrin, all she could do was sit here and snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no surprise that night shift had a notorious reputation for midnight snacks. Make that midnight to morning snacks. The guards could bring their own and it was an unwritten 'benefit' that after hours employees could help themselves to anything staled out in the kitchen refrigerator. Much as the day shift could get annoying Michelle was a woman who needed action. She was tough, scaring kids and parents with poor attitudes alike. There was literally nothing to do on the night watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was when she choked on her doughnut when the introductory catchphrase of Gerbert Gerbil himself echoed throughout the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the--\" Startled, Michelle rose out of her slouch to set the camera feed to backstage. She counted the deactivated animatronics. Hippo Don, Moolia, Fuchsia...crap, she had skipped over Gerbert. Because he wasn't there. Utterly confused she accidentally knocked over a binder as she panned through the camera controls, trying to find any footage of the mascot gerbil astronaut inside the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha!\" Michelle huffed. There was Gerbert heading down the hallway towards the private party rooms on the other side of the building. The animatronics legs moved through a limited walk cycle. The motion came from the track underneath Gerbert's dais. \"What is he doing down there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Michelle was about to get up and investigate, she noticed a memo that had fallen out of the binder she had toppled over in her surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">To the Night Watch,<br>\r\nI wanted to warn you that because of the deep maintenance cycle I have set up to try and flush glitches out of Gerbert's programming, the animatronic may run through scheduled routines during the night hours. I'm not sure how many cycles it will take for the system to reboot. It should only be Gerbert that is set to wander through his routines. I apologize for the inconvenience. Make sure that the animatronic faces no obstructions along its track. If the warning lights don't come on please be cautious around the floor track in the animatronic's vicinity, same as how we warn customers during business hours. Please report any glitches or strange behavior you observe in Gerbert's reboot cycle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank You,<br>\r\n-- Bilbo Dennings</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle groaned as her nerves settled. Great, now she was going to have dorky Gerbert roam the building on his preprogrammed routines. That little munchkin Bilbo was going to owe her for the added tasks to her night watch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she supposed it was a break from the monotony of the graveyard shift. After putting Bilbo's memo back in place Michelle checked the cameras again. There was Gerbert inside one of the party rooms, waving to a table devoid of children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid machine.\" Michelle looked for the other half of her doughnut, cursing when she discovered it had rolled under the desk.</span></div></div>",

Hippo Don was a bulky figure, dressed in a yellow coat along with red and white futuristic looking shades.

Her blue spots glowed vibrantly. After she charged up power, a thick blue stream shot out of her udders. The blue wave splashed over each Cosmic Crew member. The fluid made them slippery enough that they fell out of the clutches of the asteroid creeper. There was an alien shriek as the tentacles withdrew into the craters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerbert stood up, shaking the blue slush off of him. \"<i>Thanks for saving us, Moolia! I guess the asteroid creeper couldn't handle the cold.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ugh! I feel horrible.</i>\" Both Hippo Don and Fuchsia were collapsed against each other, each seeing stars and patched up with bandages from the last time they had been seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Don't worry, I'll have you fixed up with an iconic Cosmic Crew malted milkshake!</i>\" Moolia said. \"<i>These malted milkshakes are an excellent source of calcium!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again frozen desert shot out of Moolia's udders, only this time topping off each of the malted milkshake glasses the Cosmic Crew had not been holding in the previous shot. There was the tri-split cut of each wounded Cosmic Crew member drinking down the restorative malted milkshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>That's great, Moolia!</i>\" Gerbert exclaimed as Hippo Don and Fuchsia struck revitalized poses behind him. \"<i>It's a good thing we had those medicative procedures programmed into your spare parts!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Parts?</i>\" Fuchsia asked, confused. \"<i>Moolia is a cyborg? I thought she was a mutated cow!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I thought she was infected with the Nutritious Drinks Space Disease.</i>\" Don added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Yes!</i>\" Moolia said as the tri-colored cow struck a cute pose, not confirming any of the possible explanations for her squirting frozen desserts. The Cosmic Crew shared a good laugh as they hopped back on their spaceship, blasting off into the end credits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, that is one weird show,\" said Vinnie Paulson, shifting on the couch as he scratched his mustache. He took another hint on his blunt. \"Most of the episodes have Moolia shoot something weird out of her udders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw common, I think it's funny,\" said Sandy Helder, motioning for her share of the joint. As she leaned over her gut almost toppled over the popcorn bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weighty pair were sunk deep into the staff lounge coach, of which there was barely enough room for their snack bowls with their combined mass. There was an unseasonal heat wave in the county, most of the usual child clientele was down to cool off at the town pool. Most of the staff had left for the door without business, with only a few like Vinnie and Sandy staying on. Vinnie, since he had started, took it as yet another time to light up on the clock without getting reported by Mabel Lynn, the manager. Sandy had offered the idea of watching the old Cosmic Crew cartoons on tape that the restaurant had stacked in the back room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinnie had become a bad influence for Sandy, a pleasant girl who worked in the kitchen, after he had introduced her to his friend Mary Jane. Now even the kind and caring cook was eager for any time Vinnie was sharing pot. And with getting stoned came hella' munchies for the big eaters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They used to show these cartoons a bunch over the televisions back when the animatronics were getting installed,\" Sandy said as she exhaled her drag. \"The kids like them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.\" Vinnie took back the blunt. It might have been the affect of watching cartoons while high, because Vinnie was starting to have strange fantasies about Moolia's udders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the crinkle of chip bags as Sandy hefted her bulk closer. \"You know,\" she said in high spirits, \"the Moolia animatronic can do the same thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinnie coughed hard. Once he managed to catch his breath he choked out a reply. \"No shit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy hefted herself out of the well worn couch groove. \"Yeah. Its a protocol saved only for private parties with the deluxe party package. Moolia will travel to your party room and dispense your frozen treats herself. Kids eat it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the less drug-addled mind this would be questionable feature for a children's animatronic filled restaurant. But damn if Vinnie wasn't having several pleasure centers crossed in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Moolia animatronic shared little with her animated derivative apart from the color scheme, a white heifer with pink, yellow and blue spots. Some of this was due to the fluidity of the animation, where cartoon Moolia had wider hips and prominent udders. The animatronic didn't have the same proportions although the udders were still sizable, if not as obvious. Vinnie had never imagined they were functional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how does this work?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a switch on her back to get her in vending mode,\" Sandy said, trying to reach around. \"Provided her tank is topped off from her refueling station.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Refueling station?\" Vinnie had no clue about any of this in the time he had been forced to find a job at Gerbert's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, get your cup ready,\" Sandy nudged him, as the Moolia animatronic changed modes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ready for dessert?</i>\" Moolia said in the same bubbly voice as the cartoons.</span></div></div>",

Instead of her prerecorded line, there was just a buzzing error sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You said it,</i>\" Moolia said at the designated time, the show routine oblivious to Fuchsia's missing line. \"<i>Why, on some planets gravity is so weak you can bound into the air!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point of the show Fuchsia was meant to unfurl her neck and limbs to their full length, to simulate loose gravity. Instead the Fuchsia animatronic contorted, the articulated parts scrunching together past the limit they were supposed to compact. Odd, grinding clicking could be heard from the strain of her motors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>And on other p-planets, grav-vity is so strong that it-t squeezes you d-down.</i>\" Gerbert continued. Yet again Fuchsia did the exact opposite, like a released spring her neck bounding up and lolling to one side, her magnificent beak unhinging in an unnatural way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boo!\" cried some of the kids in the audience, less than impressed. A few laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Gravity sounds like a great way to lose weight,</i>\" Hippo Don joked. \"<i>I just have to go to a planet where I would weigh less!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>B-But your mass doesn't change, Hippo Don,</i>\" Gerbert chided. \"<i>Your w-w-weight is determined by gravity's pull on your mass.

Fuchsia was meant to factor into a song to teach kids both about gravity and managing their own 'mass.' Given her difficulties during the show, her lyrics were all choppy and mistimed, if they hit the mark of her fellow performers. The jaunty tune from the other main members of the Cosmic Crew was almost drowned out by Fuchsia's breakdown, beak unhinging all the worse as it flapped about. Her fiber optic feathers went through the entire color spectrum in a random pattern, white to yellow to her namesake fuchsia to green to blue back to white black red orange purple and so forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>C-Come back soon for another Cosmic Crew show!</i>\" Gerbert waved at the end of the song, the animatronics falling back as the curtain closed. A show that was going to be postponed, the delay coming from some routine that didn't feature Fuchsia heavily was looked for in the programming. Meanwhile kids chided the breakdowns and stupid nature of Fuchsia's performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch was a common occurrence to the most ambitiously built animatronic, prone to the most glitches.</span></div></div>",

A show where the animatronic mascots sang and danced, told jokes, entertained the kids. Soon the animatronics would depart the backstage, the track taking them to photo opportunities or party appearances. Occasionally they would roam the restaurant as well to be sighted by other children going about their day of fun at Gerbert Gerbil's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttention. Audience. The awe of young minds. All devoted to the four main flagship mascots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while Gerbert, Hippo Don, Moolia and Fuchsia were lavished with this attention, there was another. A semi-forgotten animatronic. Hamster Louie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHamster Louie was left in the dark most times. A shabby looking hamster animatronic, his fur decrepit as it wasn't of quality material, his spacesuit archaic and old fashioned. His mechanical parts were more crude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it came down to brass tacks, as far as household pets were concerned there weren't that many differences between gerbils and hamsters. Both were small rodents with many varieties, the domesticated ones easy to take care of as an early pet. As far as demographics go hamsters were quick breeders with a population lead over gerbils. At least that's part of the reasoning when the idea of a space themed animatronic restaurant was first pitched, as the concept needed a recognizable character to draw the children's attention. Something cute from earth, like a little fuzzy pet, made into an astronaut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHamster Louie was that proof of concept. A posable, talking, expression making puppet powered by robotic parts. A little herky-jerky in his motion but that was to be expected as a prototype build. Something to entice investors, to display at the starting restaurant while the second model was being built.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet there was a change during the design process.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hamster Louie may have been a forgotten character, an unspoken figure in the Cosmic Crew mythos that received no mention amongst the cast and crew, although that didn't mean he didn't have influence. The other animatronics were locked into routines. Of course they were, they were robots. There were designed to fit a certain niche, programmed for certain actions in the name of entertainment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLimitations that Hamster Louie didn't have, left to himself. Louie knew how to stalk the unnoticed places, how to travel along tracks that had also been semi-forgotten. Perhaps it was a glitch, or lack of an update since he was a prototype animatronic. Maybe it meant something else entirely. But Hamster Louie was brewing up schemes for vengeance, vengeance against Gerbert and his friends who had stolen the limelight, and vengeance against those that had decided to scrap him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttitudes that somehow helped Hamster Louie bend other, lesser animatronics to his will. Less advertised then the iconic Cosmic Crew, there were other overlooked characters, robots, props and rejects. Ones that could be tasked by Hamster Louie for his nefarious plans. The denizens of the space themed restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch as the Alien Bots. Four alien shaped robots devoid of any costume or characterization, stated in different corners of the stage show and restaurant. Each only carried a two-letter designation. AV, FM, RC, SX. To the uninitiated the designations were meaningless. However each Alien Bot carried backup tech that controlled aspects of the multimedia uses at Gerbert's. AV for the televisions, video and cartoon displays. FM for the audio, music and sound effects. RC for toy, puppet and moving feature control. And SX for special effects, lights and lasers and sparklers and other elements used for the shows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo other interactive characters were Squigs and Heev. Squigs was the multi-tendriled alien thing that zoomed about the ceiling track supported by a tiny spaceship. Squigs was used to deliver prizes and presents. Heev was a clunky creature of metal, orange and tan, containing a helium tank and able to blow up a variety of balloons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were also the Rejects. A collective category for the non-spaced themed robotic units for other concepts not originally meant to be at the Gerbert Gerbil's restaurant. Staff had a nickname for each of them: Gumball, Casino, and Decaff. Gumball and Casino are the most similar, being mobile machines. To wit Gumball is a dispenser for namesake gum balls and candy, while Casino is a demographic inappropriate video slot machine. Decaff is quite unusual, being an ambulatory coffee bar with limited expression. Decaff keeps to the employee lounge while the rest are seen on the floor from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft to their own devices, these various animatronics and robots are not malicious nor benevolent. There's little within them to act out of their defined role. That changes when Hamster Louie sways them into devious aims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo which group was Hamster Louie using for a plot?</span></div></div>",

Well, that was mostly Brit's own doing. Her Hippo Don backpack, the purple hippo with his 3-D specks and yellow rain slicker, was looking mighty stuffed. Brit just had to go everywhere with her stuff, especially to Gerbert's, because she had all of her favorite toys in here, of which she was trying to reorganize when that left her abandoned in the main dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who needs stinkin' friends,\" Brit badmouthed as she rearranged her Gerbert, Moolia and Fuchsia figurines. The young girl may have not realized just how her personality could be off putting to others. Brit Tanner had <i>standards</i>. Everything had to be just right. She needed to have all of her Gerbert's toys with her when she came to the space themed restaurant with the animal mascots. Her food was to be just hot enough, with her favorite soda, and she had to win a new prize whenever she was here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo other kid in town could match Brit Tanner's collection of Gerbert's merchandise. Or if they did, they didn't flaunt it around the way she did. Brit <i>adored</i> the Cosmic Crew, owning everything from the toys, plush animals, t-shirts, clothing, cutlery, various knick-knacks and all of the cartoon episodes taped. It helped that Brit's parents were rich, richer than anybody around here at least, and she'd been spoilt from an early age to get whatever she wanted, expecting the best when she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTraits that made the other kids view her as a snob. While Gerbert's had become a favorite after school hangout, one that Brit would announce amongst her peers for the attention, no one ever took her up on her 'invitation.' Sure, they would come but they wouldn't come <i>with her</i>, not to hang out with Brit Tanner, leaving her dropped in the vicinity like a used napkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich often left Brit insulting her own generation whenever the other kids wouldn't spend time with her. \"Serves them right if I have a fantastic time and they don't,\" Brit said to herself as she smoothed out her white skirt and pink Fuchsia t-shirt. Anything Fuchsia related was high status amongst the elementary school crowd, or it should be, because of how the animatronic in chronic disrepair rarely had any of her own merchandise. The other kids were too plebeian to notice, to borrow an adult term.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why mother insists I need more friends anyway,\" Brit asked her Gerbert and Moolia figurines, last to be propped up in the zipper portion of the backpack. Posed in such a way that when she wore her backpack Brit's most treasured figures would look over her shoulder to see how much of a good time she was having.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat she spent the first part of nearly every visit complaining about her 'rotten' friends spoke to how much fun she usually had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, Brit was plenty independent. As she readjusted a Cosmic Crew hair clip in her blonde tresses she set out to spend an afternoon at Gerbert's just the way she wanted.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brit usually went about the Gerbert's establishment in a regular cycle. If she didn't have to visit the bathroom upon arrival she would first see how things were in the playroom, If the lines for the crawl tunnels or slide or ball pit were too long then it was onto the arcade. There were several arcade games she liked, either because they were easy or they were a prime source of tickets. Tickets which she saved up for prizes at the prize counter. And after that circling back to the main room for something to eat. Preferably the ooey-gooey breadsticks, while she watched the animatronics perform a stage show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attempted routine hit a few snags this time. When traveling the hall to the playroom Brit was almost run over by someone on the kitchen crew in a mad dash to get a pizza off to a private party room. It made Brit pout. Her birthday was still ages away and she didn't know of anybody with a birthday who hadn't invited her! And then in the playroom two boys had been thawing orbs from the ball pit at each other, other kids caught in the crossfire. Like Brit, as she shrieked and ducked, arms over her head so neither she born her beloved toys would get smacked with a ball. A security guard was hoofing it to break up the commotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a huff she emerged in the arcade, kicking a wayward pit ball back towards the rowdy kids. She needed a moment to recheck the contents of her overfilled backpack, setting it up on a prize display case as she double checked and triple checked everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was when she saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in a private display case was a toy of Gerbert Gerbil. Not just any toy, because it was a toy Brit hadn't seen before. It was almost authentic to the regular animatronic in a small scale, yet that was only the beginning of its features displayed on a nearby poster. The astronaut gerbil was in an improved version of his spacesuit, it looked like, with buttons everywhere that made it do different things. One cycled his helmet through opened, closed, and reflective layers. Another caused the lights on his suit to light up. Ones activated different functions on his space pack, like pop out jets or the hiss from the pressurization nodule. Another set of triggers activated punch and kick actions with Gerbert's limbs. And finally (so many buttons!) ones that spouted Gerbert's noted catchphrases. All while grinning even bigger with his trademark buck teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a child at Christmas Brit went up to the toy and tested a few buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm Gerbert Gerbil, heroic astronaut!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Always have fun with the Cosmic Crew.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Going farther than any gerbil has gone before.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrit was giddy with glee as she went to get her stash of previous tickets. \"How many tickets do you trade for the new Gerbert toy?\" she asked the lady at the prize counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None,\" came the bored reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou might as well have told Brit the Easter Bunny was dead. \"No tickets!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, Gerbert here isn't won with tickets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this was the prize counter! Everything here which Brit had at least one of if not two or four of was gotten with the tickets earned in the arcade games. Dangling a prize you couldn't win with tickets right here should be against the law. The toy was unique! Yes, Brit still loved her own toys but her regular figurines of the Cosmic Crew were barely posable. The new Gerbert toy was dynamic and cool!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing how much Brit was fuming, the lady at the prize counter said, \"He's a special prize for the winner of a contest we're going to have at the restaurant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Contest?\" Brit parroted, some of her dashed hope returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prize counter lady rolled her eyes, having gone through this same spiel a few times already. \"All you have to do is win a set challenge and the toy is yours.\"</span></div></div>",

It was a fancy watch that told her the date behind the hour and minute hands (except when it was 9:45). Three days. Brit would have to tough it out for three more days to work on her game strategy. That toy was going to be hers! No if ands or buts about it, if Brit was going to have to go through all that effort it was because the only proper end result would be her succeeding. A super cool one of a kind Gerbert Gerbil action figure? It would be the pinnacle of her collection! And really show the other kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, all this effort for one toy?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Saturday at 2pm was going to be the big eating contest with the newest Gerbert toy as the grand prize. And as Brit had heard more and more details about the contest the further her heart sank into her stomach. Which was really counterintuitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd heard of such eating contests before. Ones where participants had to choke down hot dogs or work their way through messy blueberry pies. The contest at Gerbert's was going to make those pale in comparison. Unlike other kinds of eating contests, which was about how many of a food you could eat, on Saturday it was just going to be one item.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid vs the Galactic Pizza Pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Galactic Pizza Pie was <i>huge</i> and that was not putting the term lightly. It may have well been a galaxy, Brit remembered one from her ninth birthday. It was so huge they needed a special oven to cook it. Normally the Galactic Pizza Pie was cut into squares, you could feed an entirely party of kids with it and there would still be leftovers! It had five toppings; pepperoni, sausage, green pepper, pineapple and extra cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they expected one kid to finish all of that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>[in all actuality, management probably expected no contestant to finish the whole thing, so it would come down to who ate the most rather than who finished first]</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrit's chances for claiming the toy prize may as well have been at the other end of the universe (filled with sauce and cheese). Three days was just to short a time to get ready for such a contest! Brit was a fit, clever and energetic enough kid, so had the contest been literally anything else she would have had a shot at winning. But an eating contest where the stakes were not steaks but the Galactic Pizza Pie? No one alive would be able to stomach that thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoping over these prospects, Brit returned to the main dining room. She heard the fading of music as the curtain closed on a Cosmic Crew show. The devotee Brit was so dejected she wasn't upset to have missed it. Resting her backpack up on a seat Brit struggled with the unnatural thought that she may <i>never</i> have that Gerbert toy. Some other kid would win it, they'll never have this contest again and no other chance to get the greatest Gerbert action figure ever would ever come up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGross hyperbole, in actuality, although don't expect Brit to have such forward thinking while her dreams were being slowly crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrit certainly didn't feel happy as she looked around the dining room, where other kids were content to eat. And eat some of them did. Brit wasn't blind, it was her own concepts of image that kept her from eating everything she wanted, she could tell that a certain kind of kid was attracted to Gerbert's. Not the chubby ones, the fat ones. Kids that ate too much on their plate and asked for more, Even now there were a handful of fat children about, any of them could be future competitors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that an idea hit into Brit's head. Winning this contest meant knowing someone who had a decent shot at finishing off a Galactic Pizza Pie. If Brit could convince another kid to eat in her stead, where she got the prize while the kid did all the work, then the Gerbert toy would be as good as hers. Things would have to go just right. Brit scanned the crowd of customers intently. Time was a-wasting.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It wasn't long before Brit saw a girl that matched her inner list of criteria. Sat in a booth across the way talking to an older person, probably a parent or older sibling, was a girl dressed entirely in orange. A light orange shirt and dark orange shorts that didn't entirely cover her belly. Brit could see that under the table a bit of the girl's skin was uncovered. Above the table the girl, with reddish orange hair that matched her color motif, had a mountain of fries in a big basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brit watched the redheaded girl did most of the fry munching, happily talking and giggling with the presumed family member. Brit felt herself teething her tongue in anticipation, waiting for her moment to catch the girl alone. Soon enough the older person headed to the bathroom, leaving the tubby redhead to eat her fries. Working up her courage, Brit walked over to the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting closer to the redhead, Brit could see that she looked to be about the same age as her. There was a smattering of freckles across her chubby cheeks. The girl had a wrapper laid out before her where she mixed ketchup and mustard together into an orange sauce with her fries before eating another. From what Brit could tell the fry basket was another party sized portion, of which the girl looked to be eating with no issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Brit ever hoped on winning the Gerbert toy, it rested on this girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-H-Hi,\" Brit asked awkwardly, catching the girl licking condiment off her lips. To Brit's delight the girl smiled and returned the greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello!\" It was a very jovial tone of voice. Brit pretended that her backpack was too heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if I sit here a moment?\" she asked. Luckily the girl accepted. \"My name is Brit Tanner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brit,\" the girl repeated. \"That's a nice name. My name is Greta Heinz.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta had an odd accent that Brit couldn't place. Once she was sitting she could note that Greta had more freckles than she had anticipated, along with bright green eyes. Greta twisted the wrapper around to offer the sauces. \"Did you want some fries?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sure,\" Brit said, taking a fry to dunk as she worked out a conversation in her head. Now that she was here she just needed to get Greta's interest without making her none the wiser. \"I haven't seen you before. Do you like coming to Gerbert Gerbil's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes!\" Greta said enthusiastically. \"Ever since we move my cousin takes me to Jer-bil's.\" Greta bounced a bit in her seat, having another handful of fries. Now that Brit thought about it, she hadn't seen this girl before but she had heard about some people recently moving to town, which must mean Greta's family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was perfect! It would mean Greta hadn't had any chance to have heard about Brit before, and she probably didn't know about the contest either! \"I like coming to Gerbert's as well too!\" Brit matched Greta's enthusiasm. \"Are you doing anything this Saturday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Greta asked, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because they're having a special contest at two,\" said Brit, trying to downplay the particulars. \"You have to try to eat this large pizza. There's this prize I want but I don't have the stomach for it. The only person who could win it would need to like to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrit had found herself a champion. During the explanation Greta had paused mid fry, ketchup mustard mix plopping back onto the wrapper as the chubby Greta sat there, a look of excitement spreading across her face. \"I like to eat! Do you think many would be there, at contest? I don't know anybody around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the clincher. Brit could wrap this naive foreign accented Greta around her finger. \"You know me now, don't forget. And if you win me first prize I'll be your best friend forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta smiled at that. \"Sure, I was hoping to meet a new friend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was step one of Brit's plan out of the way. Now there was just the event itself to prepare for. Brit made a show of needing to re-buckle her shoe so she could duck under the table for another look at Greta's belly. It was wide and plump, about an inch of stubborn skin refusing to stay clothed around the rim of her belly. Brit didn't know how much Greta had been eating but perhaps, on an empty stomach, she'd be a shoe-in to win that contest. And Brit would get the Gerbert toy.</span></div></div>",

Each of them meant for Courtney. A quiet girl that hid behind her glasses and bulky sweaters. Each note, of which there were varied others, indicating a life available to her family. A life away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney didn't know if she was a disappointment or undesired company from her family. They were always frequently busy and never around all that much. It made her reliable, self-dependant and able to keep house. And it made her very lonely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney mindlessly ate the two portions of mushu pork left. At age eleven she was a sizable girl, moon faced and rotund round the middle. Most of the time when she was left to her own devices she had nothing to do but eat. Her family, although absent, always made sure she was well fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney's family had immigrated to this country before she was born. While they had gotten some roots into the community there weren't many of the neighbors they knew personally. Courtney hadn't really gotten the chance to meet any kids her own age. She was a studious although painfully shy girl. Left alone in a quiet house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, her stomach still rumbled. She eyed the location of the spice rack with the promised money. Anticipating that she had the rest of the afternoon to herself, Courtney stood to retrieve the money and head to the one place that offered her some happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerbert Gerbil &amp; the Cosmic Crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was always easy to see the restaurant from a ways off. The building was painted with planets, stars and spaceships, the sign outlined in neon. The inside was just as visually stimulating. Compared to the quiet life for Courtney at an empty house it was never quiet at Gerbert's. The bleeps and bloops of games from the arcade, the crash of balls from the playroom ball pit, a diminished chorus of happy birthday from some far off lucky kid. Bright, neon colors and cosmic patterns as the checkered tiles and wallpaper hinted at glow in the dark paint. The smells, it was mainly the smells that always drew in Courtney whenever she arrived at the restaurant. The food, food she knew well. An americana hodgepodge from iconic pizzas, milkshakes, burgers, fried foods, desserts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a hint of a smile to Courtney's usually glum face. Gerbert's was always a more exciting place than her own life.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Courtney did love the food at Gerbert's, she was satisfied for the time being from the mushu pork she had eaten. Her main reason for coming here whenever her family left her alone was to see the other kids and families. She liked watching them although she was too scared to go up and talk to strangers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes Courtney felt like she was part of a group of friends, watching them all crowd around an arcade game to beat the high score, or trade their tickets for prizes at the counter. She'd even watched what the kids a few tables away were eating and ordered it for herself, just to pretend that she was sharing a meal with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Courtney couldn't watch the other kids for too long without them noticing. The young asian girl had learned to curb her watching with taking interest in some other game when tailing other kids in the arcade. Once some boys had noticed her watching and talking loudly about her weight and glasses so much it embarrassed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday Courtney saw a group of friends almost immediately. There were two boys and two girls, about her age, who looked to have just arrived at Gerbert's before she had, as they set their backpacks in a booth. They made a beeline to the arcade, Courtney shadowing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a black boy with short hair wearing a local softball jersey. He was arguing who amongst the Cosmic Crew was the better character, Gerbert Gerbil or Hippo Don, with a red haired boy with lots of freckles and green shorts. With them was a girl who looked an awful lot like the freckled boy, with her own red hair and freckles, a close sibling. And rounding out this quartet was a pale girl with brown hair. She was chunky, her purple dress was snug, although she was not close to Courtney's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls laughed at a joke Courtney couldn't hear. It must have been at the boys' expense, as they looked shocked and told the girls off by name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of the next several minutes Courtney had gathered each of their names. The black boy was Marcus, the freckled boy was Sawyer and his sister was Sabrina. The remaining girl was named Nadine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the cluster of friends went from game cabinet to game cabinet, with Courtney watching them, it looked like they couldn't decide on what to do together. Sawyer wanted to do a physical game like basketball hoops or skeeball, while Marcus and Sabrina wanted the first play of contrasting video games. Nadine complained about getting something to eat, as she was hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was in the midst of their argument about what to do that the freckled twins, Sawyer and Sabrina, spotted Courtney looking at them. At their prompting Marcus and Nadine turned around as well before Courtney could look away. She froze up, caught staring with baited breath as the other kids regarded her existence.</span></div></div>",

You like skeeball?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney reflexively nodded, although more out of panic than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool,\u201d Sawyer pumped his fist into the air. \u201cTie-breaker!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t even know who she is,\u201d his twin sister Sabrina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNadine bounded up. \u201cHi! What\u2019s your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-Courtney,\u201d Courtney mumbled just loud enough to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCourtney. Awesome,\u201d Sawyer\u2019s attention immediately turned in the direction of the skeeball games. \u201cThen we\u2019re decided on skeeball first. Hope you\u2019ve got a good arm Courtney.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were many games in the arcade that Courtney had never played before. Skeeball was one of them. She stared dumbfounded at the line of ramps leading up to the targets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy,\u201d Marcus said, although he sounded bored. \u201cYou want to roll the balls up to sink them into those holes. Those tubes in the back and center are worth the most points.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney nodded again, then realized she had to put money in the machine. However she only had the cash her family had left her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need quarters for this,\u201d Nadine chuckled. \u201cHere, I already traded mine and I don\u2019t feel like playing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney traded one of her fives for a handful of quarters. She was the last one to activate her machine, as Sawyer, Sabrina and Marcus were already playing. She watched how they shot the balls down the ramp before she tried it herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t have the best hand-eye coordination so most of her balls ended up missing their targets, falling down into the bottom hole for 10 points each. Marcus and Sawyer were highly competitive, with Marcus coming out with the most tickets after a round of plays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Sawyer whined. \u201cI was going to beat you this time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all in the wrist,\u201d Marcus said, although for him it was a hollow victory. \u201cCan we play something else? I\u2019m tired of skeeball all the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina was counting up her tickets, having edged past her brother in score. \u201cWhat does Courtney want to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Whatever you want to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you going to take your tickets?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d Courtney knelt down, tearing off the meager string of five tickets from the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s barely enough for a pack of gum,\u201d Nadine said. \u201cYou\u2019ll need more tickets for a good prize. I like the machines that give you prizes right away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut yeah, Courtney,\u201d Sawyer spoke up, \u201csorry for putting you on the spot earlier.

If she wasn\u2019t that good at games she wouldn\u2019t have any tickets for the prize counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is the capsule machine over by the playroom entrance,\u201d Courtney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were signs of delight amongst everyone\u2019s faces, which made Courtney feel like she was being included.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sawyer said, \u201cthat machine is cool!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd we\u2019ve got enough people for a race,\u201d Marcus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked over to the capsule machine. It was huge, taller than an adult, with a giant hopper of prize capsules at the top. Each plastic orb was a single color, opaque so you couldn\u2019t tell what was inside until you opened it. The machine was in low light mode until it was activated. Inside the case were numerous twisting paths, chutes, funnels, lifts and jumps that dispensed the capsules out the little doors on the bottom of the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney stuck in some quarters and twisted the knob, dispensing a capsule from the hopper. It went into a clear funnel with two twisting arms that slid from the side, keeping the capsule popping up and down in the sealed funnel. Soon Sawyer, Sabrina, Marcus and Nadine had their quarters inserted as well, more capsules joining in the mixing funnel. Above the coin slot there was a set of flashing lights pointing to a button labeled RELEASE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll pick Green!\" Sawyer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Orange,\" Sabrina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus took Blue and Nadine took Purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess that leaves me with Pink,\" Courtney said. It wasn't her favorite color but it was all that was left. Sure, a single person could hit the RELEASE button right away if they just wanted one capsule but the real fun was filling up the mixing funnel. Upon release the scrambled capsules would have to roll through several routes in a race to see which got to the bottom first. Kids liked to pool their quarters and bet which color would get to the bottom first. The prizes were almost ancillary; small toys, keychains, sticker packs or tasty tasty treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus hit the button. Whirring lights and a muted klaxon went off in the machine. The rotator retracted and the mixing funnel popped open. Each of their capsules dribbled down the splitter, some going along ramps and others in tubes. Blue bounced off a drum into a series of seesaw drops. The kids eyes darted back and forth, barely able to track their pick of color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the first capsule fell into the exit chute, soon followed by three others and a straggler. Which one ended up in first?</span></div></div>",

She rarely won at anything. More to the point, she never had the friends to play with up until now, that this group of friends invited her into their ranks. She stared at her capsule blankly, trying to comprehend this newfound joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And as always Sawyer is dead last,\" Marcus handed off the green capsule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up,\" Sawyer said, eagerly popping open his prize. Dead last had scored him a comet shaped bicycle reflector. Marcus got a rubber ball, Sabrina got a sticker pack and Nadine had already unwrapped the first of a handful of candies. \"*munch* Aren't you going to open yours, Courtney?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right.\" Courtney was snapped out of her deep thoughts as the rest gathered up the spent capsule halves, returning them to a bin on the side of the machine that asked kids to recycle the capsules. With both hands Courtney squeezed the middle of the capsule until it popped open. A faint glow came from inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that--?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina was awed, as was everyone else. Courtney was just dumbstruck as she took out her prize with one hand. It was a large, sparkling yellow star with a blue comet tail, brightening and dimming in an odd rhythm. If felt like a hard foam or candy coated gel snack, having more heft that Courtney had ever thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I see?\" Sawyer snatched it out of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis twin sister shoved him. \"Courtney won that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I just want to see it.\" He opened his hand. The star laid there but it was dull. \"Huh, why isn't it glowing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see,\" Marcus scrutinized it closely yet nothing changed. \"Maybe the battery went out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everyone had a turn looking at the star it returned to Courtney. The moment it entered her hand a faint glow emerged from the star again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is freaky,\" Marcus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney wasn't sure what to say. Having the star pulsating with light would get tiresome so she shut it back up in the prize capsule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does it only glow when Courtney holds it?\" Sawyer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney couldn't think of an answer. As much as she had always wanted some attention from kids she could call friends she was getting uncomfortable being the center of attention. After she had stored the star away the conversation soon turned to other topics as the group debated on what to do next. Withdrawing herself from the discussion, Courtney cracked open the prize capsule just a peek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe star was still glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't paying attention to what her new friends were saying anymore. There was something strange about this star, something weird Courtney couldn't place, leaving an unfathomable hollow feeling in the pit of her stomach.</span></div></div>",

It was just too unbelievable of a story, a hamster from outer space terrorizing you every night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet terrorize him it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddy Fairbank was a small, wimpy looking lad no greater than 8 years old. His dark eyes showed a lack of sleep, his hair was combed back neatly saved for one curl in the front. In his grey and black striped pajamas he had a hint of a drooping potbelly. Gotten from the cookies and other snacks he would squirrel away to his room. He needed something to keep his strength up during the nights when the terror from Gerbert Gerbil &amp; the Cosmic Crew came to scare him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddy wasn't like other kids his age. To anyone else, it would have been awesome living just down the block from the space themed family restaurant. Not for Freddy. He hated Gerbert's. He had always been scared of the place, even his first memory at the location was unnerving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be okay, Moolia.\" Freddy hugged the cow plushie closer to himself for comfort. The only thing Freddy liked about Gerbert's was his toys, although those toys were a scant few. The tri-colored spotted cow was the only survivor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGripping his flashlight, Freddy passed the beam over each entry point to his room. His was at the end of the hall and there was a door to either side of the room leading to different halves of the house. Just when he thought is was quiet again the chiming of the clock in the hall startled him. Three chimes. Three am. Yet there was another sound behind the chimes. Thumping. Something was coming this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery nerve wanted to keep Freddy bound at his bed. Yet he got up, stepped lightly towards one door. For a tense moment he strained to hear what was beyond the door. Ultimately he risked it and cast out his flashlight down the hall. Nothing. Just the pictures on the wall, the grandfather clock and closed doors. It was quiet. Too quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Freddy heard the monster <i>creeping up behind him.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddy turned to late to dodge the claw that grabbed him by the shoulder. There was a horrid fuzzy face with its mouth open, long teeth ready to gnaw off his nose. Its fur was mangy and its eyes covered by white film. A broken astronaut's helmet framed the monster's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddy screamed and screamed. His legs gave out from under him as he passed out, unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Freddy awoke on the floor, cold, his stomach in knots with a sour sick feeling. His neck ached from the poor position he had slept in after collapsing. Panic raced through his mind as he remembered the fright of the monster that followed him home from Gerbert's. The feeble light of day was enough to cast the fears to the side for now. His tummy rumbled, his teeth felt like moss was growing on them. To replenish his nerves he ate one of the snack cakes from his stash, then fastidiously hid away the rest of the snacks and empty wrapper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddy hoped for a good morning. He crossed to his closet, opening the doors to get dressed for school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster astronaut hamster burst out of his closet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddy had spent all of his screams last night. He crumpled into the fetal position, holding his legs against his pooching belly as he cried into the carpet. He hoped the monster wouldn't hurt him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Freddy heard the laughter. Familiar laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha hah, you're such a crybaby Freddy.\" The little boy looked up at his tormentor. He recognized the voice, the build, the true face behind the horrid mask once it was removed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chuck!\" Freddy cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You peed your pants again, crybaby?\" His brother Chuck Fairbank, older by a few years, stooped to check. Chuck was a beefy kid and the effort of scaring Freddy had worked up a bit of a sweat. Freddy recalled the embarrassing memory from the second night of this terror. His first attempt at staying awake was to drink a lot of soda. That proved to be a terrible idea, as the moment Freddy had been scared he lost control of his bladder, wetting the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chuck. Freddy. Breakfast time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a word about this, right crybaby?\" Chuck prodded his prone brother with a foot. Then he hurried off to breakfast. Freddy stayed in his room, trying to dry his tears until he was called for breakfast the second time. His mean bully of a brother had Freddy plenty scared. He couldn't say a word about being frightened, of the revelation that Chuck had been the one scaring him in a Hamster Louie mask for the past five nights. Freddy could only sit there at breakfast chewing on his food, trying to find some comfort, eating his fair share of toaster waffles close to the number that Chuck scarfed down.</span></div></div>",

Freddy wished he could just go straight home after school but there wouldn't be anybody at home. He wasn't allowed to stay home by himself. Since the bus dropped them off up the street, opposite from their house on the other side of Gerbert's, the family restaurant and arcade became the mandatory after school waiting spot. Waiting for his dad to get off of work. He had an important position in the company and had to work their for long hours. Sometimes Freddy had to wait at Gerbert's for an hour, sometimes longer. Worse of all, his dad didn't understand that Freddy was scared of the place. It was too noisy and unnerving for Freddy to attempt any homework.

Diego often wore red, rolling his r's due to his Spanish accented English. He looked the toughest out of the gang of friends, having a buff set of muscles not commonly seen on the prepubescent. \"What's so scary about Gerbert's? It's just the dorky animals in outer space, there's nothing scary about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's plenty to be scared of,\" said Willy McCulley, his hair matching the hint of red on his cheeks. \"When you're a snot nosed baby that looks like a shrimp next to one of the robots. First time my cousin came here she yelled her head off. Had to put a sock in her mouth to get her to shut up.\" Willy pulled at his green shirt. \"Otherwise, Gerbert's is kinda lame. I don't see why we keep coming here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bide your tongue!\" said Toby Garcia, his face crestfallen to the point it looked like he had jowls. \"Gerbert's is the place to hang. The onion rings are great, the malts are great, the pizza's great, the--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something besides the whole menu you keep stuffing your gullet with!\" Willy spat back. Although to be fair, Willy wasn't a skinny kid either. Yet out of all of the upsized troublemakers Toby was the tubbiest. The blue shirt covering his stomach almost pressed into the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, shut up Willy the food's great,\" Chuck said. Although not as big as Toby he was plenty big. And although he wasn't as nasty as Willy or as strong as Diego, he has all of their best (or worst) attributes rolled into one package. From his personality alone Chuck was the de facto leader of the little gang of bullies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, yeah, Gerbert is dumb but Hippo Don is hilarious. Although nothing beats Hamster Louie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hamster Louie isn't even a real character,\" Diego challenged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is too!\" Chuck retorted, chucking the remains of an onion ring at Diego. \"They just don't advertise him, see, but he's strung up in the back room. Made him the perfect character to scare Freddy with.\" Chuck wiped the grease off his chin thoughtfully. \"Although I need to find a new way to scare his pants off. Something that makes him cry even harder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got the gang of bullies to thinking. Well, three of them at any rate as Toby just kept helping himself to onion rings.</span></div></div>",

In the Vega family one's ascribed roles were deeply ingrained in everything the family did. As the oldest, Enrique had suffered through various talks with his parents about what it meant to be a young man, the older brother. What was expected of him, what he would become one day. His own life, having a job and family. More worringly, Enrique suspected that his father was even going to set him down for <b><i>that</i></b> Talk very soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmbitions and traditions that were too much for the currently twelve Enrique. He felt that he rarely got as many chances to be a kid as his friends with less austere parents. Enrique was expected to be groomed, polite, to never talk back to his folks and focus on the important things in life. Many of his toys were taken away or passed down to his sister, a sister who could still get away with childish antics. He couldn't have as much fun as his friends with more open minded parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he dreaded his upcoming maturity, for how his father put it, Enrique was allowed to ask for whatever he wanted for his birthday celebration. A reasonable birthday, rather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich Enrique feared he would never be able to convince his padre of having his thirteenth birthday at Gerbert Gerbil &amp; the Cosmic Crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnrique could still vividly remember the first birthday he attended there, his friend's 11th. To Enrique, and all of his friends at the time, Gerbet's was the most fantastic place could be. A restaurant filled with games and space themed decor, complete with the mind blowing mascots that moved about in robotic performances. Enrique remembered having the time of his life there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he could also remember his padre's disapproving eye. His father didn't understand the frivolity of a place like Gerbert's. He was very straightforward. Sometimes Enrique thought that padre had not had any childhood to speak of. Enrique's following exposure to Gerbert's was limited since that party, again for the importance of being the oldest child weighing him down. It made the restaurant quite the forbidden fruit in Enrique's upbringing. He felt that if he could have one last hurrah, one time he could be a kid before he was meant to mature quickly, he would be more accepting of his parents' teachings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow to broach the proposal of his birthday, though, was the real sticking point.</span></div></div>",

Enrique had hoped that catching his father at the brief morning time would help his approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like to go to Gerbert Gerbil's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis padre frowned into his breakfast. \"That is hardly the place for a young man like you to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOooh, Gerbert Gerbil's!\" Enrique's young sister Mercedes hopped in her seat. \"Por favor, padre, can I go to Gerbert's too!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnrique winced at Mercedes' interjection. She was about to blow it for him. Mercedes, plump and dimpled 'little' Mercedes received all the attention and freedoms Enrique felt he had been denied. In the Vega family it seemed that the sister did not have to mature as quickly as the brother. She could on spoiling from not only their parents but abuelos and other family relations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Vega looked critically between his two children, Enrique feared what his reaction would be. Finally he spoke. \"You may take Mercedes to the gerbil place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnrique was crestfallen. Of course a 'childish' place like Gerbert's was only appropriate for children like his sister. He hated been shackled to Mercedes as her chaperone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis father continued. \"If you take your responsibility seriously, we may talk about your celebration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnrique nodded.

He sighed. It was almost worse than not getting his thirteenth birthday as he wanted; a day having to mind Mercedes at Gerbert Gerbil's. He chance for his own party weighed down by having to cater to the whims of his sister. And Mercedes could get quite loud when things weren't going her way.</span></div></div>",

So he needed help from family. Not immediate family, for if pressed their mother would side with their father on most disputes. But there was somebody who could help change his point of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo surreptitiously, on the way home from school Enrique made a beeline towards Gerbert Gerbil's as soon as the bell rang. He could squeeze in his appeal before he was expected to walk Mercedes home from her school. It was that sweet-spot of time before Gerbert's got busy with after school kids wanting to grab a snack and hit the arcade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter entering the front door Enrique found the main office quickly. Much to the surprise of the supervisor inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enrique? Does your padre know you're here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuanita Suarez was a senior manager at Gerbert Gerbil's, his mother's sister. The two were very different especially in regards to height. Juanita was short. Very short. She was no taller than some of the common child clientele at Gerbert's, although she had the body of a matured adult. Perhaps her perspective helped her with her job, along with her no-nonsense personality when it came to task setting much like her brother in law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he doesn't know,\" Enrique admitted, \"but I wanted to ask you something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuanita crossed her arms over her chest, her sleeves a star spangled periwinkle befitting the manager's uniform. \"I'm listening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you could convince padre to let me have my thirteenth birthday here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mi sobrino,\" Juanita looked mock aghast, \"you know how convinced your padre is about this.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unlike the other chapters, assumed to follow characters around the everyday workings of a children's restaurant and entertainment venue, the option here is to play around with the setting. The location of Gerbert's is just as much a character as the human (and inhuman) denizens, as much the director of its own growth as any single person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStories within this category explore the alternate what-ifs from the establishment of Gerbert's being radically different. Of how the business has succeeded or failed and what reputation has formed in the public consciousness. And more importantly, how the avenues for weight gain change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDepending on the altered setting some characters may appear again in new roles. Or new characters may be created. Particularly in areas where the franchise is said to gain in popularity there's likely new mascots alongside Gerbert, Hippo Don, Moolia, Fuchsia and Bellixie. Yet the original mascots should not be forgotten about, as the banner of all these ventures is still Cosmic Crew Entertainment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Shopping Mall</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle has changed for this version of Gerbert's, the restaurant and play layout being nearly exact save for a key difference. Instead of being a standalone establishment, Gerbert's is housed within the local mega-mall. As such the main cast and crew would likely be the same (or different if you prefer) yet the proximity Gerbert's has creates new risks and tension. Without its previous isolation what would the feeding and horror of Gerbert's be like butting against more normal establishments? What conflicts are between the Gerbert's staff and that of the other properties? Then again, there's something to be said for the mall's food court. And anyone in need of an upped wardrobe size need only walk to the closest clothing store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Party Warehouse</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt <i>Cosmic Crew Parties Delivered</i>, why go out to book your child's birthday when the fun can come right to you? The business model has switched from attracting customers to a single location to renting out the animatronics to private affairs. The most advanced versions of the mascot animatronics are stored at this warehouse, capable of full ambulatory support for their entertainment routines. With the 'fun' being delivered right to your home, it leaves the party warehouse as a very utilitarian place. Although the catering floor is more or less normal the problems really begin at the designated animatronic housing and maintenance. Every problem that could be had with the animatronics is had for the repair mechanics and the overstressed transport drivers setting up each party. With this as the most isolated version of Gerbert's in some respects the traumatic issues the company begets are out of the public eye. As such personnel safety (and basic employee comfort) has fallen by the wayside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Horror Attraction</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGet your fright on at <i>Gerbert's Scarefest</i>, an up and coming horror attraction put on by new ownership. Based on the various permutations of the horrific crimes claimed to occur at the original Gerbert Gerbil's, fulfilling childhood memories is abandoned in favor of targeting a mature audience with subverted nostalgia. Whatever happened at Gerbert's was really bad. Although many say that with those uncanny, off-putting jerky animatronics the endeavor was doomed to fail from the outset. The proprietors of the horror attraction have strived for a mix of macabre atmosphere and restaurant authenticity. Just don't expect any competent cooks anytime soon, as what other amenities beyond the haunted walk are still up in the air. As for the main draw itself the utilities and effects are overdone and untested. Will <i>Gerbert's Scarefest</i> turn into the coolest haunt or the lamest tourist trap? Or more horribly, the latest terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Television Show</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the intellectual property of the Gerbert's brand is an animated cartoon following the mascot characters. The next show proves to be more ambitious, bridging animated shorts with live action performers and animatronic puppets, all set on a very far out 'Cosmic Crew Central Station.' Rather, a television studio's creation of a Gerbert's looking establishment set on an orbiting space station (orbiting what planet, again?). For a television show way over budget there's a delicious amount of cheese, be it from the break table or the mediocre performance, scripts and acting. In many ways having a part on Gerbert's is more of a career killer than a career launcher (we mean this in the figurative sense...we think...), thanks to the dubious life lessons the show aims to teach. Inconsistent continuity, unresearched science, unhealthy habits and the most inaccurate view of space? This will likely not be genius programming, rather a collective hissy fit for those having stardom go to their head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Amusement Park</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of failing, Cosmic Crew Entertainment's flagship franchise has been more successful than anyone could have ever expected. The crowning achievement is this small amusement park with planned expansion well underway, <i>Gerbert's Galaxy Spaceport!</i> Food and entertainment has spread out to include unprecedented attractions for the Gerbert's franchise. With this broadening of the brand many new mascots have been created, to say nothing of the many jobs created to cook, clean, repair and secure the facility. With an amusement park the reach of Gerbert's is bigger and better than ever! A credence taken to the heart of management, the bigger the better. Yet given the karmic imbalance due to the franchise park may not be too big to fail. Accidental doom (to say nothing of premeditated doom) can now hit the biggest scale of catastrophe.</span></div></div>",

It was a two and a half story mall with approximately a hundred and forty storefronts, stalls and shops. It was certainly the biggest mall in the region, the kind decked out in plastic tropical plants and a high vaulted glass atrium in the center. Surrounded by parking lots that went on and on and on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Gerbert's the mall already boasted an impressive variety of venues. There was the food court, specialty shops, attractions like a bowling alley and exercise club. There had been three other restaurants connected to the mall, offering causal dining in contrast to the food court's grab and go service. Crosscreek Glen Mall attracted all kinds of shoppers. Families went there for their purchasing needs and perhaps eating out. Teens flocked to the mall in their cliques if they weren't looking for part time jobs. Kids were drawn to the child friendly shops and play area. There was also a dedicated nursery to mind the young, impatient toddlers while their families were working through their shopping list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, Crosscreek Glen Mall was not prepared for Gerbert Gerbil's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo other restaurant was as intricate. You had full dining, an outer space theme, in house arcade, animatronic mascots along with myriad infrastructure, office space and utilities for the inner workings of the party center. Gerbert's existed as its own microcosm within the mall's amenities. And they could host birthdays there. Upon their grand opening birthdays had been booked out for eight months solid, with more coming throughout the year. Add to this the Gerbert's gift shop next to the entrance, selling some merchandise and toys while keeping the exclusive stuff as arcade prizes to entice patrons to spend their coin on the games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gerbert's had beat out two other lucrative properties looking to lease the mall space, the restaurant looked poised to singlehandedly take Crosscreek Glen Mall to the next level of retail outlets. Nearly five months of renovations had taken place to overhaul the space for the future Gerbert's layout, making mall visitors curious as to what was going on at the establishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople flocked to check out the newest mall property, seeing the shows starring the signature Cosmic Crew: astronaut Gerbert Gerbil, funky-pop musician Hippo Don, desert making Moolia the Cow and vibrant Fuchsia the Flamingo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho's to say, maybe the restaurant was going to be a success?</span></div></div>",

The positions hiring weren't interested in a high school drop out. She was desperate for income.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eighteen year old fidgeted in the booth where she was told to wait. Lainey had shoulder length auburn hair and a lanky build, although currently she was hunched over, feeling sick to her stomach. What if she struck out at the entire mall? No other places were hiring, she wouldn't be able to make rent. Her only chance now lay in the most expansive restaurant Crosscreek Glen Mall had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all honesty, Gerbert Gerbil and the Cosmic Crew kind of creeped Lainey out. The oversized animal animatronics with their stiff movements and uncanny expressions just didn't sit right with her. She was objectively trying to ignore them, hoping her chances of employment weren't hampered by disliking the mascots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't help that she hadn't eaten all day. Money was tight and she promised herself she wouldn't splurge on a meal until after she had secured a job. The greasy air filled with the smells of pizzas, fries, and onion rings did little to help Lainey curb her appetite. Her gaze was starting to loose focus as she stared over to another table where a kid was halfway through the pepperoni special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Burges?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Lainey stood quickly, scraping her knee on the underside of the table. She winced in place of a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Greg Pierce, head of operations and security.\" A middle aged man shook her hand. \"I'm overseeing the hiring today, if you'll just follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLainey was guided through the twisty corridors of the Gerbert's restaurant at the back of the mall. Seating, arcade, kitchen and all jutted next to each other as Mr. Pierce sidestepped into a cramped office space. He closed the door, making the air hot and stuffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why would you want to work for Gerbert Gerbil's?\" Mr. Pierce asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLainey plastered a smile, going back over what she had rehearsed. \"It just looks like a fun place! Being able to make kids and families happy with your service.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was really her last choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Pierce sat back in his chair, contemplating Lainey's response. \"We'll need to complete some final paperwork but I'd say you're hired, Miss Burges.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs eager for work as she was Lainey was still taken aback. \"Really? Just like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're looking to fill several positions in staff,\" Mr. Pierce said. \"I tend to vouch for younger staffers, as they can show a lot of promise and can be trained into core members of the team.\" He had an odd small that Lainey didn't notice, euphoric that she had finally found work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a bad time for her stomach to gurgle nosily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to Lainey's embarrassment Mr. Pierce had heard. He chuckled. \"How about a slice as we finish up your interview? We like to keep our employees happy, so there's some generous lunch break options when you're on the clock. We're also in negotiations for some benefits with the other storefronts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day was a blur of forms and early training. Much of it Lainey wouldn't recall after the taste of the pizza. She had three slices: cheese, sausage and supreme. More than what she had been able to eat recently. After smelling it all the time she had waited for her interview the taste was heavenly. It left her with a warm, comforting feeling in the bottom of her stomach. It looked like things were about to change for Lainey Burges.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To say the job at Gerbert's had changed Lainey's life around was an understatement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver her first few weeks Lainey had learned the ropes of working at the animatronic filled restaurant. She had worked openings and closings, entering the mall in the off hours either to help begin or shut down the business for the day. She had learned to take orders and deliver food, how to wipe down the seats and arcade cabinets. There was constant activity and the needs to clear up after messy patrons, the kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLainey approached her work with zeal however. Not only was she getting a paycheck she was getting decent meals again. She had been living half-starved since she had dropped out of high school and cut ties with her family. Working at Gerbert's, as noisy, stressful and cramped it could be, had its share of perks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe staff were encouraged to know the menu to best provide suggestions to customers. Lainey could build up one combo plate once per shift for her break. She still hadn't been able to taste everything yet! From the multitude of pizza varieties, the burgers and sandwiches, chicken and scores of sides available, no two meals were exactly the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdd to this the generosity of strangers, as Lainey was still new on staff so she had trouble remembering names. A nice, over plump cook in the kitchen had noticed how starved Lainey had been, so she would slip the teen extra portions on her lunch break tray. The end of shift brought with it a lot of staled out food, still perfectly edible but considered unattractive to customers. It wasn't surprising then that many staffers would take leftovers home, a detail Lainey had picked up from observation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting used to the animatronic movements and performances was still a challenge. Lainey saved her best fake smiles for whenever she had to regard the company mascots with enthusiasm. Getting through those uncomfortable moments gained her the personal reward of milkshake she had hidden in her company thermos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two weeks, the lanky teen was starting to get the hang of working at Gerbert's. Despite her apprehensions around the mascots, Lainey was a lot more confident and lively. A slight physical change was present as well. Tucked within her employee uniform was a hint of a potbelly from all her recent snacking.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as Lainey was getting used to working at Gerbert's in the mall, a new challenge threatened her confidence. It started innocuous at first, so subtle that Lainey didn't realize she was the center of giggles belonging to the children patrons of the animatronic restaurant. Soon it couldn't be ignored, she'd be dropping off a tray for a party of kids and she'd notice their mischievous eyes darting away whenever she would meet their gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas Lainey at the center at some sort of joke? She tried asking coworkers about what could be so funny but nobody gave her a straight answer, Most of the adult staff were better at hiding their mirth at Lainey's expense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Lainey would have to do is look down. Really look down and realize her stomach was no longer as flat as she remembered. Everyone was getting a chuckle over how Lainey's budding potbelly had increased in size, some love handles beginning to crest the waist of her pants. Lainey had never been a girl to gain weight before and she was currently oblivious to the implications of her abuse of the employee lunch program since she started working at Gerbert's. Fat approached the lanky teenager's frame with confusion, only settling around her belly thus far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven tied back by her uniform's apron Lainey's new belly jiggled constantly. She wore thin shirts and every shimmy was visible to customers, particularly the kids who would be eye level with her stomach. Lainey must have gained a dozen pounds or so, not used to such greasy and constantly available food before coming to work in the mall. This was the closet the high school dropout would get to the infamous occurrence that happened to college freshmen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Lainey knew is that the laughter and snickers seemingly at her expense was beginning to stress her out. Although she kept to her designated hours for lunch, whenever she would circle back to the employees only area on her rounds she would nibble at the food she had set aside for her upcoming lunch. Her burgeoning potbelly didn't want for much, as the frequent nibbles typically led to getting fresh portions come lunch. Thus Lainey was grazing about two meals or so over the entire course of her shift, although she thought she only had the one meal on her break.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The real trick about Cosmic Crew Parties Delivered was that few people knew where it was. Of course it had a billable address for tax records and public notices needed for a company. It was just that nobody ever went there unless they worked there. After all, 'Parties Delivered' was right there in the company title. Of course you never went there, the party came to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach facet of the company had it's own floor of the warehouse. All rentals were carried out by the dedicated phone lines in the administrative office, also handling payroll, marketing, internal affairs and all the other bureaucratic needs a business needs. Next came the catering floor, with a big industrial kitchen and fully stocked pantry and freezers to pump out pizzas, cakes, sides and other treats to feed at party. Inventory had its own floor as well, a warehouse of Cosmic Crew plushies, toys and other presents to wrap up for that special birthday boy or girl. Then you had the maintenance floor for the animatronics. The main cast of Gerbert Gerbil, Hippo Don, Moolia the Cow and Fuchsia the Flamingo had their charging stations with reams of replacement parts. Sure, it took a long while for the animatronics to charge but these were state of the art. They could move and walk on their own without power cords, relying on clunky internal batteries. Sure they were massive but that allowed for multiple kids to crowd in on the photo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCosmic Crew Parties Delivered had a motor pool with its own fleet of trucks. One set of trucks was used solely to transport the animatronics. The others were for catering and gifts. Most parties were a two truck delivery. The drivers and handlers would set up the venue, oversee the party, and then bring the animatronics back home to recharge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes this sound like a lot? That's because it was. While the warehouse looked normal from the outside, nigh unrecognizable as being the home of Gerbert and friends without the small sign by the front door, the rest of the floors were underground. Few knew how far deep, most sticked to the elevator instead of the stairs. That elevator could take awhile to go from floor to floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too ambitious to fail. A tad too ambitious. All this warehouse space and they only had one set of the Cosmic Crew animatronics. Sure, there were plenty of spare parts to build more but only the sole set had managed to work. Management was aiming to expand gradually, keep to exclusive high paying customers until they could branch out to multiple markets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost ironically, the party warehouse with a business mission to create joy and wonder for children's birthday's was a joyless place to work. All the magic, as it were, happened at location when the private party tucked into their spread and saw the animatronics roam about to meet the kids. The warehouse was solely a business. No customers came here, few if any decorations lined the halls. For the skeletal staff meant to work in such an oversized facility, some could forget that the Cosmic Crew brand was meant to inspire minds to the far reaches of space. The warehouse was just the opposite, the most mundane industrial bunker you could have on earth, a seemingly normal place save for its fantastic wares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking at Cosmic Crew Parties Delivered, whenever you weren't on assignment you felt cut off from the rest of the world.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Whoever had initially proposed the ideal of this attraction was ludicrous. Seriously, Gerbert Gerbil &amp; the Cosmic Crew? Who actually remembered that franchise? Let alone, for those that did know of it and knew the lore about the tragedies that lead to its downfall, who would want to remember it? Missing children, unsolved crimes, plenty of urban legends surrounded that moniker. That dead bodies were stuffed into suits, the pizzas were made with real human meat, a malevolent computer virus had locked down the whole facility. Dead at night, just when you thought you were alone, you saw the glow of the old restaurant's neon in the distance and heard the alien music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoppycock and conspiracies that drove a set of hard core fans to mull over the mysteries that went nowhere, of puzzling reactions to the former Cosmic Crew Entertainment's real agenda. A niche market at best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the rebuttal. It was so obscure, the stories about what really went wrong at Gerbert's so myriad and divorced of the franchise (even morphing into other, similar scary stories) made it perfect for a horror attraction. Animatronics? Scary as hell, just with how off they looked. A restaurant theme? Well, unnerving people with food was easy to do and a Halloween staple. Heck, even if that fright fell through people could still be charged for pizza slices and hot dogs, so that was a plus. A specced themed ex-children's party center? Well, the rest of the ideas for the attraction just about wrote itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus became Gerbert's Scarefest, meant to launch new ownership of the character copyrights into fright flinging superstardom. That is, if the star up company wasn't way over budget on trying to scrape this haunted experience together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other main problem was that the original Gerbert's had been demolished. You didn't find anything associated with it around anymore. Maybe if you were lucky, some novelty cups and a stuffed toy prize left rarely used in the back of a closet. To say nothing of anything that was proven to belong to the restaurant, such as a particular video game cabinet, uniform, or the holy grail of subverted nostalgia itself, a complete animatronic frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this and more plagued Gerbert's Scarefest from the beginning. It takes a consistent level of followthrough, or rather insanity, to see such a project from start to finish. Lucky, bigger things had been done before with even smaller budgets. Some other unassociated unused building was used to house the attraction. A mock layout of the original restaurant was built into a maze. Simple creepy sights and scare zones were eked out with sweat and elbow grease. To complete the tour outside the exit was going to be the concessions, which snared any newcomers towards the ticket both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerbert's Scarefest was a rush build. It turned out most of the props had been collected or salvaged before hand, which made the installation easier. Still, no true building contractor had touched the horror attraction. If the haunted house was meant to scare people working there would be a nightmare.</span></div></div>",

We're watching the dailies in twenty minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActivity was nonstop on the set of Cosmic Crew Central Station, the latest series in the Cosmic Crew Entertainment media library. For fans of the classic cartoons of Gerbert and the gang, along with fans of the iconic restaurant, it was going to be one of the biggest shows ever. The studio had managed to construct a sleek looking space station for the primary set of the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interior was built somewhat like the main dining hall of the Gerbert Gerbil's restaurant, only in a round room with other features of the space station branching off. Everything was decked out in red trim and chrome, both retroactive and futuristic in the design. And like many filmed sets, all cleverly built to provide the illusion of television. The sets were built on raised platforms to allow for the puppet and animatronic controls to be built underneath. Tracks, wires and cables needed for more of the articulated characters were hidden out of sight of the camera shots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA good looking set for its time. It would help if the shooting schedule wasn't so stressful. Based on early viewership the studio was trying to crank out as many episodes as possible, making the actors and technicians almost work nonstop. To say nothing of the animation department, under even worse deadlines to get the animated sketches finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut like they say, a production is only as good as its crew. Although this was their first television show for several in the cast and crew, the main studio operatives were no strangers to the requirements to keep filming going. Makeup, lighting, effects, sound tech, and set design ran smoothly. Owing to the long hours demanded at the studio the break table was lavish. Nearly as expansive as the Gerbert's restaurant menu. While the televised segments had their bit product placement for the franchise food nearly anything could be found for the break table after a few days. A modicum of comforts that kept cast and crew happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like the show could only get bigger and bigger for its new season. Which would hopefully distract everyone from those nasty rumors spreading around the studio. Every production had its own share of problems, no show was ever perfect. Be they factual or not Cosmic Crew Central Station was said to be plagued with many stange occurrences and breakdowns. They said never to work with children or animals in this business; however, that adage should be expanded to never work with animatronics. Even like human actors and operators they could flub up in eerie ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut seriously, all those issues the show faces are unfounded. Right? ......right?</span></div></div>",

An animatronic family restaurant with arcade, play area headlined by an astronaut gerbil? From its first implementation it was a novelty. Add some merchandise and a cartoon show featuring the mascot characters and the franchise for Cosmic Crew Entertainment became an unprecedented hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anything, the business was the comeback king in the face of failure. Be it crime, lackluster operations, lack of safety or a stigma of hauntings, the Gerbert's brand found a way to find new venues. And the crowning project of all was the plans for the theme park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a wonder it was never thought of before. An amusement park with food, rides and attractions was just an expsanion to the original concept of family dining &amp; entertainment that made Gerbert's what it was today. Building a park is far more expensive than building a restaurant, even one as complex as Gerbert's with everything that needed to be scaled up for a larger space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the anticipation of fans everywhere, <i>Gerbert's Galaxy Spaceport!</i> soon launched in a county not too far from the original restaurant location. With half the park built on a lakeshore boardwalk, it was a modest start in terms of attractions. Several rides, a couple roller coasters, other things to see and do. But the real money maker was the core of corporate's business structure. The food. Knowing the tastes of their customers and the ease of setting up the food stalls first while the rides were still being worked on, no expense was spared on getting the park's dining options ready. There were people that came to the amusement park just for the food alone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last, the fun experiences with Gerbert Gerbil &amp; his Cosmic Crew could reach an untold number of visitors, with guests and tourists increasing by the day. After all the struggles and turmoil for the franchise, hype for the characters had reached their peak. Nothing else could go wrong now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept when it does.</span></div></div>",

It began as a Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s fanfic but shifted into creating original material in that vein. Characterization and world building are encouraged, pertaining to the dark secrets the party center hides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore we begin, a few guidelines:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Pre-2000\u2019s aesthetics:</b> Gerbert\u2019s was built (and is generally written) in an ambiguous late 70s to mid 80s to early 90s timeframe. Although the technology present at the establishment will be advanced for its time, on the whole the function and aesthetics are rooted in analog first and early digital second. This means that cell phones are not as widespread, personal computers are quite sizable and the internet is just starting to reach consumers with dial up sluggishness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Gradual Gain:</b> the weight gain and expansion of the characters may be unusual at times although it should strive for some realism. This means no major gains from a single meal and other blatant displays. However you are free to use time jumps in your options, or delve into the surreal in dreamlike or hallucinogenic sequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Write Your Best:</b> there are no precise word count minimums, although you should write more than a paragraph in your entries. I encourage you to write your best. I may pass through chapters to catch typos although I won\u2019t overwrite your additions.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThat being said\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike other weight gain interactives this story also delves into horror. Events can be perilous for characters and end messily. However, if the material becomes too graphic or explicit I will tone down or outright delete the chapter.
