Joy screamed. \"Hey Joy\"! I replied. For as long I've known Joy she has always lived up to her name. \"Did you know someone's getting adopted today?\" Joy asked. \"No... Who?\" You ask. \"I don't know? I just heard about it this morning. After you get ready meet me in the dining room\".<br>\r\n\"Okay\". You reply. <br>\r\nI finish showering, brushing my hair and teeth I head back to my room. I put on a grey tee-shirt, blue jeans, socks, and black sneakers. As I walk out of my room and see a worker before me. She pulls me aside and tells me. \"After breakfast come to the office with your belongings! We have some people we would like you to meet\"! I go down to the dining room and meet Joy by the doorway. I sit next to her and everyone starts to eat. After breakfast I call Joy and tell her. \"I think I'm the one who's getting adopted\". \"What really that's great isn't it\". I shrug. \"I guess\". \"What's wrong\"? Joy asks. \"I've just never really felt like I needed parents or anyone\" I reply. \"Don't say that. Your always going need someone. Like me\"! She said with a big smile on her face. A smile then ran across my face. \"Thanks Joy\"!<br>\r\nYou run up to your room and start packing. Once I finished I walk to the office door with my belongings. I open the door and see two Charizards. They were lean but well-built and tall. The first one wore a regular white tee-shirt, jeans, and flipflops. The other one wore a sun dress and flipflops as well. I walked in and introduced myself. \"Hello, My name is Noah\". The one in the sun dress response. \"It's nice to meet you Noah! My name is Rose and this is my husband Jon. We're really looking forward to getting to know you\"! </span></div></div>",

I walk up to her and hear her say. \"I'm going to miss you Noah\"! Tears started to run down her face. I embrace her in a hug. \"I... I'm going to miss you too Joy\"! I let her go and say. \"But I know we will run into each other in the future. I know we will so just wait for me\". As soon as I finish my sentence Rose and Jon walk out of the office with the worker. \"Are we all set\". Rose asked. \"Yeah\". I replied. \"Goodbye Joy\". I then left the building with Rose and Jon. I got into their car and we drove off. I looked back at the building that use to be my home. Now I have a new home, a new family, and a fresh start.

I continued to watch stuff pass by through the window. \"Noah\" I heard. I look away from the window, Mrs. Rose stared and asked. \"Is there anything you would like to eat.\" I realized it was close to lunch, so I nodded a yes. \"Is there anything you would like.\" Then I replied. \"It doesn't matter, anything is fine.\" Then I went back to watching objects and people passing by.<br>\r\n       Jon pulls in at a diner.

Shade from large trees, and dappled sunlight shown through cracks between leaves, were casted upon the newly paved street. Jon pulls up to the driveway, and parks the car. I exit the car and walk around the broad, lush green yard. Everything I saw looked new. <br>\r\n\"Noah, come and get your bags.\" Rose spoke. I make my way back to the car and retrieve my two bags. I carry my bag and myself to the door. we walk in. I saw two 8-foot doorways on my left and right, a staircase on the left wall, and a hallway with two doors on the left and a doorway on the right end of the hall.<br>\r\n\" We'll show you to your room.\" Jon said. We make our way upstairs. Then turn right to the end of the hall. Rose opens the door on the left and we enter. I roam around the cool, blue room. The bed was in the corner on the left with a nightstand next to it. left to the bed was the closet. on the right side of the room were windows, a tv stand with the tv, and a desk up against the window.\" We'll leave you to unpack. Don't hesitate to ask for anything.\" Rose said. They left and I began to unpack. I hung up some shirts and pants in the closet. Then shelved some books. It wasn't a lot. I never had a lot of anything, out there in the world or the orphanage. It took me about 5 to 10 minutes put everything I had away. \"So, this is it.\" I thought to my self. I sat at the desk.

I got nervous, and saw two young, athletic looking charizards. I expected them to be charmeleons. It felt like they were glaring at me, but their stares didn't seem to have interest in them, it looked like they never care. \"I shouldn't get in their way.\" I thought to myself. Keeping my composure, a \"Hi\" left my mouth as I looked up at them, \"man, they're tall.\" I thought to myself. \"Hey, kid.\" Jack spoke, \"mom, dad, I'll be heading to my room.\" Jack walked past me and upstairs to his room. \"Nice to meet you Noah\" Monica said plainly, \"hey mom, dad, I'll be going over a friends, is that okay?\" \"Sure\" both Jon and Rose reply, Jon added, \"Be back by dinner, Okay!\" Monica walks out the door. \"I finished unpacking, Sir, Ma'am.\" I stated. \"That's great, relax and make yourself at home, I'll get started on dinner.\" Rose replied. I walk back up to my room, and sat at my desk. I pulled out papers and pencils, and began doodling. \"Hey kid bro, whatcha doing.\" Jack spoke as he stood in the doorway. \"Oh hey, I'm doodling\" I replied. \"Cool, I'm heading out to meet with some friends, you want to come with.\" he said, but I can feel some type of intent coming from him. \"Oh, thanks, but I'll have to pass on that.\" I tried to respectfully decline, but he kept insisting. Then Jon came out of nowhere, \"you should go with your brother Noah. It's important socialize outside the house.\" \"Fine\" I replied, know something shady might happen, might as well get it over with. I get up and leave the house with Jack. We both get to a park nearby, and meet up with some of his friends. </span></div></div>",

I work out of my home, get paid very well, and can spend a lot of time with my family. My desk is in the far corner of the room. Opposite of it is a filing cabinet, which holds all my files. A window allows light into the room, and I can see the backyard from here. I can see the trees and all their grace. On my desk sits my flat screen monitor, my keyboard, and some pictures. Underneath it is my computer's tower. The pictures on my desk contain pictures of Mendi, Zack, and myself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'll have to change that soon</i>, I think to myself. <i>(IYNH) should be in these, too.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Mendi rushes into my room. She's covered in sweat and out of breath, as if she ran through the entire house.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Mendi, what's wrong?\" I asked, becoming worried. She's doesn't freak out like this unless somethings really wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't find Zack and (IYNH),\" she says, trying to catch her breath. \"What if something happened to them? What if their hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's think about this,\" I say, trying to keep calm. \"Did you search the entire house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, from top to bottom,\" she answers, still frantic. \"I couldn't find them anywhere. Oh, Lord. What if-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped listening at this point and tried to think of where they would be. I remembered the trees in our backyard. They could have went outside to play and didn't tell us. I looked out of the window and saw that they were outside of the bunch of trees. Zack was lying against (IYNH), who was lying against a tree, and looked to be asleep. His black hair laid against his forehead. He sat criss crossed, his back against the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if-\" Mendi started again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their asleep against a tree,\" I interrupted, with some amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Mendi said, as she came stand next to me and looked out the window. \"Aw.

Mendi as always been crazy about taking pictures of our family. (I was barely able to stop her from taking pictures of Zack's changes.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked outside and sat near the boys. I took a good look at (IYNH)'s face. Since he was asleep, I wouldn't be able to look into his eyes without being able to wake him. So I had to rely on his facial expression to tell me how he was doing so far. His face seemed brighter than it did when i met him at the door. What made this more evident was the slight smile he had on his face. He was really happy here. It warmed my heart to see him like this. However, now that he was asleep, he seemed different. His face lacked that defensive look it had when I first met him. His face looked unguarded and he looked relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Suddenly, he shifted to the side and fell away from the tree. Out of instinct, I reached out and, gently, caught him. I laid his head against my shoulder, not wanting him to fall over again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found it!\" Mendi yelled, as she ran outside with the digital camera in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh,\" I responded, holding one of my fingers in front of my mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw,\" she said, when she say (IYNH) laying against my shoulder. \"Now I feel left out. Wait, I have an idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed a button I couldn't see and balanced the camera on the birdbath, the lens pointing at us. Then she ran and sat beside me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say 'cheese,\"' she said, as she leaned against my other shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheese,\" we said as the camera took the picture. Luckily, (IYNH) and Zack didn't wake up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you can take them inside now, but let them sleep,\" Mendi said, walking to the camera. \"They're building a bond right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" I said, as gently picked up (IYNH), who still had Zack on him.

I lower (IYNH) onto his bed and stand back up, as Mendi tucks him in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet dreams, (IYNH),\" Mendi says, as she kisses him on his forehead. (IYNH) smiles slightly in his sleep. Then he says something I never thought I would hear him say for a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good...night...mommy,\"  (IYNH) whispers, in his sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could practically see Mendi's eyes welling up in tears. I place a hand on her shoulder and escort her out of the room. (The only way i was going to get her to let (IYNH) sleep now.) I can't help but look back and smile at (IYNH) though. He's starting to feel a place in our family and it made me feel good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nYour P.O.V.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sunlight on your face causes you to wake. You yawn and stretch as you sit up in your bed. You step out of your bed and, with a sleepish stumble, walk to your dresser. You grab your clothes and walk out your door, intending to take a shower. Still half asleep, you think that your still in the orphanage. Being so you walk down the hallway and run right into the wall where the bathroom door would be if you were at the orphanage. (Definitely not a morning person.) You look up, confused, as you rub your forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a morning person, huh?\" Mark laughs, while helping you up.With a sleepish nod, you yawn again. \"Come on. I'll walk you to the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" you mumble, as you follow him down the hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are,\" Mark says, as he leads you to the door not far away from where you hit the wall. \"Try to hurry. Breakfast is almost ready and we can't eat until the entire family is at the table.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K,\" you mumble as you walk into the bathroom and lock the door behind you. You quickly take your shower, the morning haze fading from your mind. You walk from the bathroom to the kitchen with only one thing on your mind: food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brother!\" Zack yells, as you walk into the kitchen. He runs over to you, and you, getting in the swing of things, bend down and open you arms. He runs into your arms and hugs. You pick him up and start to walk to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, kiddo,\" you say, as you put Zack in his chair. \"Sleep well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just gives you a hyper nod and a huge smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's the straggler,\" Mendi says, as she puts a plate with pancakes in it in front of you and Zack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say?\" you ask, shrugging. \"Mornings and I don't exactly see eye to eye.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour family laughs as Mendi takes her seat and you all begin to eat. All throughout the meal you smell something weird, but can't think of what it is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, whose turn is it to clean the dishes?\" Mendi says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's Zack's and (IYNH)'s turn,\" Mark says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" you say, you gather the dishes and stack them on top of each other on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got the pan,\" Zack says, as he goes to the stove. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you notice that the smell is coming from there. You look at the stove and notice that the flame is still on. Mendi must have left the stove on. The smell was the gas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zack! Don't!\" you yell, as Zack stands a stool reaching for the handle of the pan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rush to the stove...</span></div></div>",

Out of instinct, you grab the handle of the pan with your left hand. A slight stinging sensation goes through your hand, but it doesn't hurt enough to where you have to remove your hand from the pan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you release Zack's wrist and the pan, Zack looks at you with fear and worry. As you shut off the stove, you look at your right hand and asses the damage done to it. The area that should be burned is already a light pink, healing much faster than it should on a normal human being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(IYNH)!\" Mendi yells in worry and a panic, as she and Mark rushes into the kitchen. Her panic worries Zack further, making him look as if he is going to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see,\" Mark says. His voice is calm but there is worry in it and in his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright,\" you say, hiding your hand behind you. 'What will they think if they see that it is already healing?' you think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see,\" Mark repeats. His voice is stern, but still holds worry for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember when your parents would speak to you like that. It was usually because you wouldn't let them help you with something. You decided from a young age that you hated that tone of voice. So, to stop from hearing it, you became what parents would call a \"good boy.\" You did whatever they told you with no hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was more of an instinct than a habit when you stretched your hand out to Mark, palm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(IYNH), I'm sorry,\" Mendi says, as Mark takes you hand, gently but firmly, and flips your hand over. \"I must have left the stove on. I'm so sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, the pink on your hand is fading into your skin's normal color. It is at this point that you notice Zack looks scared, worried and lost, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you see the confused look on Mark's face (odd, you expected him to look shocked or scared) you decided to let her know that your not hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No blood, no fowl,\" you say as you show her your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is it not burned?\" Mark asks, as Mendi looks at your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Zack says, as he recovers form his shock. \"Let me see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remove your hand form Mendi's (she grasped it in shock at its healing) and show it to Zack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool,\" he whispers, as he looks at your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't answer my question,\" Mark says, looking more curious by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heal quickly,\" you say, shrugging your shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(IYNH), why don't you and Zack go play? I'll take care of the dishes,\" Mendi says, looking at you with a look that screams 'I'm sorry.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet,\" Zack says, as he drags you out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack drags you into his room, closes the door behind him, and looks at you awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brother,\" he begins, \"can you...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You remember that it is School Picture day, and thus is probably why your brother is so excited for today. You get out of bed and stretch, looking outside to see the very overcast weather outside. You sigh and smile, as you realize that the weather is probably the true reason your brother is excited, as that means that he could evolve before pictures are taken. You decide to put on what is your best shirt and pants, even though the shirt is a bit big on you (It was made for the body shape of a Goodra). You then straighten up your hair, which is mostly in the shape of a Goodras back antennas along with your hair in front combed to frame your face. You realize that, since there is a good chance of both rain and your brother evolving, you decide to put on another shirt underneath your own in case he dose evolve. You also get some shorts that can fit him once he does evolve. Funny to think that for most of their childhood, Goomys and Sliggo go are naked until they evolve into Goodra, and then they have to get used to wearing clothes. You grab your backpack and head down stairs to the kitchen for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see your brother waiting at the counter in his seat, jiggling back and forth. You see your dad finishing up making breakfast. Being a Goodra he is pretty tall, and very wide, even for a Goodra. He has a unique colorization of light and dark green, and his eyes have star like pupils. He serves you and your brother your breakfast. \"Eat up now, both of you!\" He says with a smile, he then looks over and leans in to ask \"did you...\" you nod before he finishes his sentence, as you and he have been planing in the event that he does evolve at school, as you always had prepared a shirt and pants for him once he had started middle school. He nods and breaths a sigh of relief, \"well, it's better safe than sorry.\" he says, turning around to grab something, and you notice he is wearing no pants... again, netting you a good look at his expansive rear. Your brother snickers at this. Your dad also laughs as well, \"sorry, I had just gotten up as well, so I could only get my shirt on. And don't laugh too much son, once you evolve you will have to deal with the fact you have to cloth yourself, and that your rear will end up as big, if not bigger, than mine.\" You nod just before he looks at you, letting him breath another sigh of relief. You both finish eating breakfast, and now you are getting ready to head to school. \"Hang on, hang on, I'll drive you there, and I'll pick you guys up after school.\" Your dad says while he is trying to get his pants on. \"Ok then dad!\" Your brother responds, knowing that today has got to be the day he evolves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive at school 25 minutes earlier than if you two went by bus. \"Have a nice day!\" your father yells out as he drives off. Your school is a basic two story school, though it is confusing to walk through. You both buy some snacks so the first two periods you both aren't starving by the time lunch rolls around. On your way to class, your brother stops in his... erm... trail? ahh... never mind. He stops following you, tuning his antennas toward the nearest window, which is far from where you two are. \"What's wrong?\" you ask. \"It's raining.\" your brother responds with a smirk on his face. You sigh and give a face, tired of his enthusiasm every time it rains. \"Oh don't give me that look, You, Me, and Dad are very sure that today is the day I evolve.\" You silently damn his ability to see clearly with is radar system and continue walking to your first class, which is...</span></div></div>",
