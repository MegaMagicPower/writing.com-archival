Your name is Mayfair, and you are a beautiful elf maiden. As you change out of your night clothes, you think about visiting your boyfriend, who, sadly, lives quite far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter slipping into your daily clothes (you have multiples of the same outfit), you walk into you den, just thinking about what to do. You haven't seen Vince in a while, and it is tempting to see him again. Problem is... the roads that lead to the village of Monuna, at the base of Demon's Peak, is quite dangerous, especially for an unprotected elf maiden like yourself. Sure you may possess magic, but it's all healing types. You sigh in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man... this stinks. If only my boyfriend lived here, that would make things much easier. *Groan*\" You look out the window to see a Spikey, a fiery wolf monster, prowl the perimiter of the village. The village is protected by a barrier, but you know for a fact that once you step outside of it, it's anybody's game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the winter, while you were collecting winter herbs for your healing tonics, you were ambushed by a pack of Spikeys, and was devoured alive by the Alpha Male. As you weeped inside the stomach of the creature, thinking it was the end, something odd happened. Oh, sure, you digested, but you awoke in your bed, although lacking any clothing. You thought you had died, but there may be something different about you than the other elves. You seem to die after being digested, but you always wake up in your bed, unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment... maybe this odd ability could aid you in trying to see Vince. If you are revived after being digested... then you are, possibly, immortal! Or at least damn lucky. Either way, you might stand a chance at surviving this trip. You snap your fingers, and smirk, \"Heh, no problem, if I can't die like that, then I can make it to Monuna without dying!\" But then a dark thought passed through your head... What if it doesn't work that way? What if those few times were just a wierd act of God? You gulp and shudder to think of actually dying in a monster's stomach. But you gulp down your fears and decide to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter visiting the local store to get some supplies (the trip will take at least half a month, give or take), you swing your pack over your shoulder, take one last look at the village (in case you do die), and head out. After about an hour of hiking, you come to a major fork in the road. Which way do you go?</span></div></div>",

But you think about your unusual ability, and swell with confidence. Bravely, you march on, but you get unnerved when you hear a low snarl. Turning sharply, you look around, nothing within your eyesight. \"Relax Mayfair, you're being stupid. Sure, I may look like a tasty snack... and I probably am... but that isn't gonna stop me from seeing my boyfriend! Just keep moving, and you'll be fine.\" Taking one last quick glance behind you, you move onward, but a pair of blood red eyes gleam at you, then they dissapear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy nightfall, you make it to a small stream, and decide to camp for the night. As you unpack your stuff, you look around nervously. You know you are vunerable outside of the elf magic barrier, and you know that anything could pounce while you sleep, and you hope nothing does. After unrolling your sleeping bag, your large ears quiver as they hear the soft rustle of leaves, and a snap of a twig. You snap around, beads of sweat on your forehead... something is near!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFealing around you, you grab the small sword you bought earlier, and brace yourself to defend yourself. You hear the leaves rustle again, then the soft hooting of an owl, your eyes darted from on spot to another. Suddenly, out of the bushes comes...</span></div></div>",

' you can't use a blade mayfair your more mage if anything.' he always said when you tried to practice sword play.  the squirrel was looking at you as it  moved closer. it went over to your booted feet and started biting your toes. \" ow hey your to small to eat me now stop it.\" you say kicking it.  the squirrel flew half way arcross the campsite as you laid down.  you once again heard the squirrel comeing back and you woke up. it looked at you with sad eyes. ' oh are you alone little one do you want company?' you said patting your sleeping bag. the animal ran up to you as you hugged it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe next morning you and the squirrel woke up. \" ok little one if you wish to come then come just don't delay me any further.'  the animal jumpped into your back pack as you walked further into the deepest part of the area. you started to sing a tune as you walked and notice the path was getting smaller. then you came to a big cave. \" is this the cave that leads to my boyfriend?\" you say looking around then out of nowhere a giant bat came out of the cave. it looked at you hunger. ' m,y dear sweet elf what might you be here in the bat cave?\" it said with a vampire like accent.  you looked at the huge black bat. it was like most bats in your village but much bigger and it could talk what a great combination. you never liked bats that much he your boyfriend that is always drove them off during the night. but the barrier did that now but it was not the same. \" i'm mayfair i come from the small village down south and i wish to go through here to get to Monuna a village over demon peak.' you say but the bat does not move. ' miss this cave leads to no village demon peak is not this way your compliantly  off course. \" you looked at the bat. you knew your boyfriend came this way you just knew. you had a good sence of direction you did not need a map to find anything. the little animal came out of your pack. ' oh a tasty squrril and a lost elf my this will make a great breakfest i am sure.'  you started to walk back as the bat started to fly towrds you. \" don't move i have a sword i can kill you just like my lover vince can.\" you say and the bat stopped. hearing vince's name had effected him. \" did you say vince as in the warrior vince oh dear oh dear.\" you looked at the bat. \" yes and i want to see him he is at a village at the base of demon peak but from what i am told it is more over the peak.' the bat looked at you. \" vince is a demon to us he kills us all the time he is a monster.' you laughed. that sounded like vince he was a very great swordsmen and would not sop a fight until his victim is dead. the bat looked around. ' ok the man you are looking for is somewhere on the other side of this cave but demon peak is very far after this cave.' the bat said as he flew off.  the bat dropped a map and you looked at it. ' ok so after bat cave i have to go through like 3 more things till i get to demon's peak then i have to go over the peak and then ugh a desert just great and the village is in the middle of it.' you sighed. \" vince better be thankful about this beacuse if he is not we are through and i mean it this time.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou and your animal friend entered the cave. the map did not tell you where you should go in the cave only what was after it. you hit a fork. </span></div></div>",

' sorry sugar cakes but i'm not like those other predators i know how you warriors act.\"  the plant wrapped his vines around you.

' just get another man we elves have long lives if you die you are wasting what the gods gave us.\"  you turn around to lilly.

' hey can i come with you it is boring here.\" you look at her. ' as long as you understand you may die i may be able to come back after getting eaten but you can't.\" lilly giggled and told you to wait a few minutes. she came back with a bow and arrow. as the two of you walked down the path lilly started talking. ' an adventure with just us girls.\" you sigh. lilly thought this was just a joke you knew it was curel but you hoped something would eat her sooner rather then later. the only reason she called lilly a friend was beacuse she felt sorry for her. lilly was the town's slut she had slept with every man in the village at this point except vince who was off limits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou both walked up to a lake. ' i need to sit down mayfair.\" said lilly and she took off her shoes they were not boots like one should wear on a journey no they were normal sandels. \" can we rest here today i'm pooped.\" lilly asked and you sighed. \" we only just started i need to get back to that bat cave.' lilly looked shocked. ' bats I hate bats lets go somewhere else.\" you looked at lilly. ' no the cave is the only way to demon peak as long as I don't meet that plant again we should be good.\"  lilly got up. ' i have a map and if we go through the marble plains we will get to demon peaks.' you look at the map but it showed that the plains lilly wanted to go to was a longer path and had to go through snake forest and a swamp. \" I don't want to get eaten by a snake lilly.\" lilly stomp her foot.

' how do you know this gift is not just for female elves.' she did have a point it could be beacuse you were a female elf that you could reform but that sounded silly. you kick the  dragons nose and he wok up. ' who dares awaken the red dragon of the north/\" he says and looks at you. ' mmmm tasty female elves i have not eatn some of you in a long time not sence dragons were banished from the areas around your village.\"  you did remember hearing about dragons and elves liveing together but that came to an end in the dragon elf war 100 years ago.  \" we want you to swallow us both.\" you say. the dragon said nothing but he picked both of you up and opened his mouth.  he tossed both you and lilly onto his tounge and lilly laughed. ' oh this is gonna be fun.' you sighed. you had to deal with this alot sence you found out you could reform so this was just tedious.  the dragon swallowed and both you and lilly entered  his thorat. ' man dragons sure eat faster then anything else that has eaten me must be beacuse of thier size.\" you say as both you and lilly neetre the dragon's stomach. \" ok the bet is on if I don't reform well i die bt if I do it means only female elves can refrom.\" lilly said and you sighed at how stupid this was as the acid covered both of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou woke up in your bed.

So she lowered her body, into a crouching position, and sprung.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slammed into you, sending you flying backwards, dropping your sword. You hit the ground painfully, but the worst was yet to come. Before you knew it, her serpent tail had coiled around your thin frame, holding you tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... no... please...\" you moan, but the naga shakes her head, \"Nope, you're my little bed-time snack, farewell. But before I devour you, I prever my food... umm... without any outer shell, hehehe.\" She loosened the coils around you, but still held you tightly. Then, she started to remove your clothing, in an almost seductive manner. Soon, you are naked, and still in the crushing binds of the naga. \"No... please, I beg you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naga ignores your plea, moves her lips close to yours, and gently kisses you goodbye. Opening her lips, you head is slowly inserted, and she gulps. Her jaws widen as your shoulders enter her mouth, your head snuggly in her throat. As she gulps again, she gets to your elven breasts, which are larger than a normal elf maiden's. She teases you a little, licking your now hardened nipples, causing you to squirm. Then, she gives a powerful swallow, sending you more than half way to your doom. She grasps onto your legs to keep you from sliding down further, and starts to lick your vagina, causing you to moan. All too soon, you climax and she continues to swallow you down. Once she gets to your feet, she licks them, then gives the final gulp, and down you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe licks her lips and fingers, just loving your flavor. You flail as hard as you can inside her snake body, but to no avail. \"Hush little one, it'll be all over soon. *Belch* Ooh, excuse me.\" The naga slithers away, with your struggling body inside her. You start to pray, begging that you will survive this whole ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou...</span></div></div>",

As you get ready for battle, you feel a blow to the back of your knees and suddenly you are falling on your back.  !@#$, you were watching her top so much you forgot she has a tail, which snuck up behind you and now has made you pay for not paying attention to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As you land, the sword goes flying from your hand.  You flip over to get up and recover it, but the naga now grabs you by the feet.  You try to kick free, but the kicks seem powerless, and now a coil of snake lands on you.  A moment later you are helpless in her coils.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You protest as she starts removing your pants, but to no avail.  \"Clothing is just so bland.  You'll taste much better without it.<br>\r\n   \"Now don't you worry, I'll guard your stuff and it will all be here when you get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Then you will just eat me again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Only if you take a long time to get here.  You are a big meal and I'll be too full to eat you tomorrow.  You can sleep besides me in perfect safety.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  She pauses to lick a foot with her tongue.  \"Excellent flavor.  You are going to make me very happy.  So now let's see if I am going to make you happy too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   With that, you feel her push your feet into her mouth.  Stuck face down with snake coils blocking your view, you are pretty much limited to what you feel, tho the naga makes some grunts that sound like a muffled \"Delicious\".<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n   But when she pauses at your hips, your terror turns to indignation.  \"No!  I'm not that kind of girl!\"  A claim the naga ignores, and continues to use her tongue to prove you are.  As she plays with mound and lips, you feel your excitement building, and when her tongue slips into your crack, you climax rather forcefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Satisfied with this, the naga positions your hands onto your pussy and resumes eating.  You recall the saying \"When rape is inevitable, relax and enjoy it\".  A stupid idea in your view.  Rape isn't inevitable until you relax.  Still, even bad advice is right sometimes, and this seems to be one of the times.  So you start playing with yourself.  You quickly come again, a tiny one compared to the gusher the naga caused, but still pleasant.<br>\r\n   The naga pauses again to play with your breasts and you again explode.  Then she swallows the rest of you, as you frantically work to come yet again.  You are fully settled in her belly before you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"My, that was a wonderful meal.  I do want to thank you for that.  Now you hurry back.  I'll be waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You don't answer.  The whole experience has taken a lot out of you, and there is little air in her stomach.  Even staying conscious is difficult, and then impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You are relieved when you waken to find you are no longer in her innards.  This is home as before.  Still, that was a day shot, and you are little closer to your man.  Well, you will just have to try again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You encounter some odd looks as you once again buy supplies you had just bought and once again exit the town, without having returned to anybody's knowledge.  However, nobody wants to be too intrusive and so you are back on the road and at the intersection again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    But now which way to go?  Can you trust that naga not to just eat you again?  If she will keep her promise to help you, the problems of your journey go way down.  In comparison, the journey will be downright boring.  But nagas are known liars, frequent and determined liars.  There is such a large chance she is just going to eat you again.  But of course, something else will likely eat you on the other paths.  Is the devil you know better than the devil you don't?    <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

She is not as grateful as you think she should be, but she does break off a small piece for you.  Might even be your share by weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You chatter as you eat your dinner and get ready for bed.  Especially about your boyfriend.  She has never had a lover she felt worth running down.  Of course the snakes just ignored her once they were done, and the elves and humans got this idea she was going to eat them, a completely false idea ... well, some of the time.

She is still a big girl, but if she hid her snake parts, the viewer would not think her unnatural.<br>\r\n  Well, not too unnatural.  Those boobs rubbing into yours are distinctly impressive.  Distinctly sensual as well.  You are finding it hard to concentrate on much else.  And finding it even harder to remember you should.<br>\r\n   Indeed, why not have a little fun with her?  You need to give Sly some reason not to eat you. And you have to admit this is a rather... no, make that quite, pleasant way to do so.  So you start to rub back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Sly's immediate reaction is for her hands to dive to your muff, a tad fast for you and you try to protect yourself, a bit half-heartedly at first, and then not at all when she starts hitting the right spots.  Soon you are gasping from passion.  Then you are waking every critter within a mile.  <br>\r\n   Sly is not pleased with this.  \"I should have realized you were a screamer.

A moment's hesitation ends with her grabbing your ears and shoving your nose into it.  A bit tentatively, you set to work.<br>\r\n   Happily she is already rather excited, and greets your gentle probes with pleasure.  As you become more confident with your touching, her excitement rapidly increases, and she quickly climaxes, something that causes you to pull away, but she insists you return and swallow her discharge, an order you are reluctant to obey, but carry out.  It doesn't taste that bad actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    She caresses your head as you finish up and says \"Guess we got away with it.  But I suppose we had best call that a night.  There will be other chances to have fun.\"  You aren't sure how much you want that fun, but you have to admit Sly is something nice to cuddle up against to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It takes little time to pack in the morning and set out on your way.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   For a moment you debate whether to flee or fight.  After all, you can outrun the naga and whatever is approaching can fight her while you escape.  But it might consider the naga too tough and simply come after you, when you would be all alone.  Or maybe ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   But when considering fight or flight, you don't have time to consider.  You decide right away, or it is decided for you.  And now you see your \"decision\" burst into the clear, and you wish you had run right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It's a Saber Tiger!  A huge cat, with fangs big even for his terrible size.  It uses those teeth as slashing swords to cut terrible wounds in prey as large as it is.  It can kill elephants with those fangs.<br>\r\n   Which means it normally would be no tremendous danger to you.  You just aren't enough meat to bother with hunting down.  So if you had a good lead, you would get away.  But now it is too close.  If you ran, it would behave like any cat and run you down.  But if you stand, it will have to be close to the naga, which will be attacked, and where a casual swipe by a claw would turn you into meat.  You seem to be able to survive being eaten, but being cut into chunks?  You don't want to find out.  Even a yes answer is a bad one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The naga has good reason to fear it.  Her normal tactic to win is slow strangulation.  But in that time, the tiger can slash time after time and almost cut her in half before she can choke it unconscious.  The best she can hope there is a double loss.  Most likely she will faint from blood loss long before the tiger gives out.  <br>\r\n   But the naga does not seem panicked.  Rather she seems very worried, but hopeful she will get out of this alive.  As you cower behind her, you realize her plans.  She holds up a large coil of herself.  If she can drop it on the tiger's head as it approaches, she can prevent it from attacking her before she can strangle it.  She has to strike just right, but she probably is pretty good at finding the right time to strike.<br>\r\n   The cat seems to think so too.  It circles, waiting for an opening, and possibly for Sly to get too tired to hold that loop in position.  Sly and you circle in the opposite direction, hoping it will simply decide to look for easier prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    No such luck.  The tiger suddenly darts forward, too fast for you to react.  Fortunately Sly is faster and throws her look at the approaching cat.  <br>\r\n    When you finish blinking, it at 1st looks good for your side.  Sly has taken some nasty wounds, true, but she seems to have the Tiger in a death grip.  Those powerful coils will soon crush the life out of the cat.<br>\r\n    But the tiger is not weak.  With a sudden burst of energy, it jumps backward, jerking the naga roughly forward.  You can only guess the exact way, but Sly's coil loosens enough for the Tiger to pull its head free and retreat out of the naga's range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Now the fight is all but over.  The naga's wounds are too large.  She has to tend to them or die, and she can't tend to them while menaced by the tiger.  It is simply a matter of the cat waiting a little.  The naga is doomed.<br>\r\n   Or she is doomed if you don't do anything.  You are a healer, and you can cure the naga's wounds, bad as they are.  That's no problem.  The problem is that you will have to get in front of the naga to do so, and if that cat attacks at that moment, you will be ground round.  You are not counting on recovering from that!<br>\r\n  Definitely safer to continue cowering until the cat claims its prize and then it shouldn't pay any attention when a small morsel slips away.  <br>\r\n   But you are a healer!  All your sympathies are with the wounded, no matter how justly wounded.  You're not sure you can live with yourself if you don't cure the naga.  <br>\r\n  But will you live at all if you try?<br>\r\n  Well, this time you had best decide fast and agonize later.  The naga is losing strength with every second.  </span></div></div>",

You are going to have to leave your safe spot and get right out where that cat can turn you into lunch in the blink of an eye.  And there is no help for it.  You just would not be able to live with yourself if you let someone die when you could prevent it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Quickly you get in front and apply your hands to the wounds.  Thankfully you are not fully in front.  There is still a coil of naga between you and the tiger.  But if the tiger attacks, you are probably still right on the bulls-eye, and one of its fangs would go right thru you, and likely well into the naga as well.  You ending as 2 or more pieces seems entirely possible.  So your only hope is that it doesn't attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Which it doesn't, at first anyway.  Possibly it deems you something strange, and strange means to be cautious.  What you don't know can kill you.  And a human helping a naga has to be very strange, and thus very dangerous.  You definitely hope that is what the cat is thinking.  But as your healing magic takes effect, hope is all you can do.  You must stand here, without any way to defend yourself if it does attack.  Otherwise the healing will fail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   After what only seems like forever, the wounds are closed.  The healing is successful!  A bit tired, but thrilled, you dart behind the naga again, and return to keeping it between you and the tiger.  <br>\r\n   A standoff continues for a few minutes, but the cat eventually realizes the naga is not getting weaker like it should have. It can't understand this, nor your role in causing it, but it can see it faces a healthy naga, while it is just a little tired and hurt, that little bit maybe being just enough to allow the naga to win the battle if it attacks.  Predators do not survive by attacking foes that might kill them.  After another minute, the cat moves off and out of sight, to find something easier to kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I thought I was a goner there.  What did you do?\"  the naga asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I'm a healer.  Curing people is what I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You made those killing wounds just vanish?  But that's impossible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"just difficult.  I have never had a patient or wounds as big as you, but some of the elves I have cured have been a lot closer to death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Whoa, having you around is going to be useful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, thanks.  I'll find it nice to have you around too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The rest of the day passes peacefully, and you make camp that night, and you don't notice the way Sly is looking at you, at least not until she acts...</span></div></div>",

Probably she just wants sex tonight, and hesitates to simply demand it since you saved her life today.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   She really ought to hesitate, at the least.  Maybe last night was not all that horrible, even fun, but you expect to be asked at the very least, and you want your man to be the one doing obscene things with you.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n   So when you have doffed your clothing and are about to get in your bedroll, you think you know what Sly is up to, and turn to tell her \"Look, we are not having sex tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"That's right, at least technically.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Huh?\"  You hadn't expected her to agree with you, so you stand there a bit stupid, trying to figure out what she means, for a moment, a moment that ends with a massive naga coil hitting you and twisting around you.<br>\r\n   The next thing you know, you are hopelessly in the naga's coils.  \"I got to thinking.  If I am to guide you all the way, I'm going to get pretty hungry, and if I eat you then, you will just have to start the whole journey over again.  Much better I eat you now, and stock in a layer of fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"But you could catch something along the way.\" you protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Maybe, but that seems chancy.  This way is certain.  And you do taste so good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"But you aren't even done digesting me from before.  There's not room for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Oh I can expand my stomach quite a bit.  You would fit in fine.  But I have another way to store food, which you may find ... ah, interesting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Her human part moves to your pretty feet, placing her pussy right in line with them.  Then she thrusts you forward, impaling herself on your toes.  Now she starts using you as a huge phallus, thrusting you in and pulling you out, part of the way.  She is slowly and erratically pushing you deeper and deeper.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"But I'm too big to fit in there.\" you try to object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   With no effect.  \"Honey, you will fit in fine, and very pleasantly.\"  This last at least is true for her.  She is quickly aroused by her use of you, and quickly climaxes, which barely slows her down.  Instead, she starts to use mouth and hands to excite you.  And while your body inside her cunt excites her more, you are also getting arounsed by the contact.  That is not as successful as her own coming.  But even if she comes 4 times to your once, you are finding it hard to resist.  Eventually you don't.  It's not the rocket of last night, but still very pleasant, and enough to ruin your attempts to resist.  You both manage another climax by the time the only part of you outside her is your head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Now meet me back at the old campside and I should have enough food to get me thru the trip.\"  Then your head is thrust into her slit.  There is no way to resist after than and you soon drift off to sleep, hoping you will awake elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You do, back in your home bed again.  So again, all you have lost is time.  But again you have to replace supplies, and to meet the curious stares of those who find your goings, and lack of comings, increasingly curious.  Your friend, Gentlefoot the ranger, even asks a few questions.  You fend them off, but you do hope you don't get eaten again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Soon enough you are back on the road, and again at the crossroads.  And again wondering if the protection of that fickle naga is worth having.  </span></div></div>",

A distinctly dangerous distance of course, but in distance, it is pretty close.  Possibly some of the villagers even know it is here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You thank Sly for guiding you and turn to approach the hut, a distinctly unimpressive hovel.  That is when the naga strikes from behind.  Suddenly the light is gone and something warm and wet is over your head.  You quickly guess the Naga wants another meal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    First, she wants to strip you, and your breasts are soon exposed to the breeze.  Also exposed to her mouth, and she starts sliding you inside as she continues to strip you of all clothing.  The contact of her mouth to your skin proves highly sensual.  You can feel your nipples harden as she swallows them.  And when she gets down to your box, you climax as her tongue licks your bottom.  You come yet again as she reaches your toes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As you settle into her belly, you revile her for this attack, pointing out she had said she already had enough food.  \"Well, I wanted to make sure. And it's been a couple of days since I ate you the 1st time, so there is more room in my belly now.  Besides, I don't know what will happen with the witch.  I had best get a meal while I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"But this will be the last time.  \"I'm full now and won't need to eat again before you get to your boyfriend.  So you just hurry back here, and we'll see what the witch has to say.  And if you need my help, it will be here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    There is little you can do about the situation and soon you drift off again, hoping this time too, you will awaken in your bed.  Which you do.  So it is back to getting supplies and having yet more villages looking at you oddly.  Gentlefoot is particularly persistent with her questions.

And while you would like to fight, you do need the witch's help.  So there really isn't much choice.  \"What must I do?\"  <br>\r\n   Fortunately, the witch doesn't care if she has an eager partner.  Your reluctant agreement is enough.  She sits down and raises her dress, revealing that her legs and vitals are surprisingly well preserved.  Not too much of a surprise.  The saying is that women dry up from the top down and and even a quite ancient woman can have a set of legs that rival a teenager.  Not a major factor, but this is not as bad as it could be.  \"Now get your face between my legs, girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You get down on hands and knees, and she grabs the back of your head and shoves your face into her snatch.  \"Lick it\".  You hesitantly do so, and are shocked when she quickly gushes out a good deal of liquid.  She issues an order to swallow which you deem it best to obey.  The stuff proves to taste better than you had feared.  Good is perhaps an exaggeration, but you will be lying if you tell someone this really disgusts you.  <br>\r\n   The witch climaxes again, but is not willing to let you quit, and so you continue to kiss her snatch, until you feel something cold on your's.  Turning, you see something that might be a large cat or a small dog [but which you fear is neither] licking your honeypot.<br>\r\n   As you start to stop it, the witch grabs you and forces your head back between her legs.  \"My little boy wants some fun?  Go ahead. There is enough of her to share.\"  You beg for mercy, but instead your nose is forced into her cunt and you are forced back to work.  <br>\r\n   The creature has a large tongue and applies it to your box in a very stimulating way.  You feel your excitement build despite your resistance, and then you climax, just as the witch does.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   This earns you a moment of respite.  But only a moment.  Then you feel the creature climbing atop you, with obvious intent.  Again you beg to be spared, but only get ordered to get the witch off again.  Your efforts to dislodge the rapist are equally futile and he is quickly in position.<br>\r\n   Then he is in you.  The witch muffles your cries by shoving your face into her muff.  For a moment you resist, but then you feel the creature shoot off in you, and then start pumping again.  \"He will not stop until I get off.  So get to work, you little slut.\"  Reluctantly, you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Thankfully her excitement builds rapidly, but less thankfully your own does too.  You try to resist, but without success.  All three of you explode in massive climaxes that leave you exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Well, you at least.  \"My, that was fun.\" the witch says.  \"Now I... </span></div></div>",

Your frantic blows to dislodge it prove that it has been secured.  You keep on futilely struggling, but you are horrified to see the witch's cookery is working.  Your firm limbs are becoming soft and rubbery.  Your blows that at least made the pot ring now land like soft bread, and then like dough.  Soon you are just part of the boiling liquid.  <br>\r\n   At this point the witch takes off the lid and stirs the soup, a process that leaves you quite dizzy and well mixed with the broth.

She likely knows the dangers you have faced, and knows how to avoid them too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Once you are well on your way, you start explaining.  \"I have this strange ability, or defense, or something.  Every time I am eaten by the monsters in this wood, I wake up healthy in my bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"That is marvelous good fortune.  Do you have any idea how you gained such an ability?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"All I really know is that I awake in my bed.  It was a complete surprise the first time, and I have not gained any idea how I did it since.  Nor can I be sure it will continue to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"It is still an ability everyone would envy you for.\"<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n   \"Now I had hoped to use that ability to get to my boyfriend, but as you have seen, I don't get very far before I end up in some creature's belly.  All too often that has been a naga named Sly.  She has promised to help me, and she may actually mean it, tho mostly she has helped herself to me as food.<br>\r\n   \"But we decided to go see the witch, who did promise to help, but only after cooking me into a soup.  Now she said to get her help, I will need to bring a friend this time.  So I am hoping you can help me out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"You are not thinking to let the witch eat me, are you?  I very much doubt I will reform.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I don't think the witch has treachery in mind.  The witch spoke of needing an agent to do some selling.  So she can hardly eat you and expect you to do any selling for her.  <br>\r\n    \"Still, I am not sure what she is up to, and I guess you will be taking a risk.  So you had best be careful.<br>\r\n   \"But I do need somebody to help me and you are both my best friend and the one who is best able to dodge any threat she may have in mind.  So, can you help?\"</span></div></div>",

Given the treatment you have received so far, you fear the future holds worse for you than for her.  For all you are suffering, you really hope your lad appreciates your struggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It does not take long to reach the witch's place and you approach reluctantly.  But Gentlefoot comes to a dead stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Hail to the house.  We enter in peace.  We pledge no harm nor intent to harm to those within so long as the same is pledged us.  We shall not...\"  The list of this promised to do or not do is a long one, but eventually Gentlefoot ends with \"By your magic, so do we pledge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   For a moment, there is silence.  Then you hear the witch say \"By my magic, you enter in peace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You look a question at Gentlefoot.  \"I am not sure, but it seems that a long pledge of peace like that in some way binds her.  Maybe she would lose her magic if she tried anything.  Maybe her magic would fight her.  Or maybe there is a streak of nice buried deep, very deep, in her.  Anyway, those who make such pledges tend to come out of the hut again.  Not as many of those who don't do.<br>\r\n   \"And yes, I knew of the witch.  I have scouted her hut many a time.  If you had not been so eager to keep your secret, I could have warned you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Which would have saved you a lot of trouble.  Still, you are not sure you were really wrong.  The village might well have reacted by blocking your attempt to get to your man.  And the wilds might not have been quite as dangerous as they were.  So maybe you were right, or at least forgivably wrong.<br>\r\n   Gentlefoot doesn't think so.  She clearly thinks you made a fool of yourself by not coming to her right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Inside the hut is as before.  About the only difference is that the witch is busy stirring the cauldron instead of getting ready to bar the door.  Hopefully that means you can leave if you need to, but you wish you knew whether her smile is because she is being friendly or because she has two victims now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Very good.  I have the potions about ready.  Now drink this.\"  The potions she offers is not as suspicious as it could be, but it still worries you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"What does it do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"It contains your magic of reforming.  For a normal elf, it would mean he or she would reform in the village after being devoured.  In your case, it will strengthen your ability, and allow you to choose where you reform at any place you have been before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"That would mean I would not have to start over each time.  Eventually I will make it, no matter how many times I am eaten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Probably.  There is a chance you will fail to reform each time.  A low chance, but a chance.  If you are eaten often enough, you will stay eaten eventually.  I can't say what the odds are, but I think you should make it.<br>\r\n    \"Now we need to test this, by having you reform again.  So do you want to be boiled down into soup again?  Or let my little boy here swallow and digest you?  </span></div></div>",

I should have enough potions to create them for as long as desired, but a 2nd kettleful will change that from probably to certain.  So strip, and into the cauldron with you. Just think about where you want to be when you wake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As you do as told, the witch turns to Gentlefoot \"Now for normal elves, this potion means they will survive being eaten and will reform at their homes.  You do not need to fear most of the creatures of the woods.  Being eaten will be just an annoyance.  You will be able to just let the monster eat you and then get back to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Gentlefoot is skeptical.  \"Assuming this works, a quite serious if, that means we would be reduced to the level of grass, casually eaten by whoever wants to.  That is not role for elves.  We should be ruling the woods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You don't seem to be doing much ruling, do you?\" counters the witch.  \"Most of you cower in your village, and of those who do venture out, many do not return.  Unless something changes, your village and all in it will die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"We will find a way.  We have already made progress.  When first we arrived here, we were not even safe in our village.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"But even that safety is not very safe.  There are monsters around here that could defeat your guard. So far, none have tried, but one could at any time.<br>\r\n   \"You are risking your life and the lives of all you hold dear.  Better to be the live grass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Gentlefoot pauses and finally says \"I must think about this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   In the meantime, you have been getting into the pot, which is hot, but not as bad as last time.  Indeed, there is something almost pleasant about it, even erotic...  You resist, but eventually your hands steals to your mound and begins to caress.  It is not long before your excitement starts to build, and then to explode.  You sink back in completion...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You wake to find yourself right outside the witch's hut.  It seems her potion works.  So you pick yourself up and re-enter the hut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Gentlefoot and the witch are glad to see you, and apparently they have come to an agreement as to the next step.  After congratulating you on your success, the Witch turns to Gentlefoot.  \"Now we must test this on a normal elf, which is you.  So you have the same choice she did.  Do you wish to try my pet?  or the pot?    </span></div></div>",

It is hardly an enthused choice, but as little as she, or you for that matter, like the idea, Gentlefoot agrees the witch is offering what may be the salvation of the entire village.  The forest is just too dangerous and something must be done.  Even if they can keep the deaths down to a survivable number, it is too high, and they may not be able to do that. So if the witch can save them, her potion must be tested, and if that means she must risk her life, that is what she must do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   So off come her clothes, revealing an excellent figure.  You do prefer boys, but now that you think of it, if Gentlefoot is available the next time your lad suggests a three-some, maybe you won't be that down on the idea.<br>\r\n   The familiar is way more enthused than you are, happily opening a huge mouth and wagging both tail and a surprisingly large tongue.  Gentlefoot seems willing to be gentle food and lies face down on the floor to await her fate.<br>\r\n   Which is not at all long in coming.  The familiar rushes to her feet and gulps them down.  He then starts slurping up her legs as he seems to reach some state of bliss.  But as he reaches the juncture of her thighs, he slows down and Gentlefoot's cry of protest tells you that huge tongue is being used in a way that she had not expected. But it is too late to stop, even if she could stop it now.  So she can only verbally protest and beg for mercy.  <br>\r\n   Mercy that is not granted.  He continues to play with her box, and his effort are soon rewarded.  However reluctantly, Gentlefoot is getting excited, and then cries out with a convulsive release.<br>\r\n   The familiar resumes dining and you watch his stomach expand as more and more of Gentlefoot vanishes.  As he reaches her voluptuous breasts, he pauses again and his tongue comes out to lick both of them rather tenderly.  And again Gentlefoot is unable to withstand his efforts.  She comes to a gasping completion.<br>\r\n   Satisfied, the beast finishes its meal.  You watch as Gentlefoot's scared face vanishes inside.  Then all that is left are some clenched fists, which are swallowed quickly too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Now we need some exercise to work off all that food.\" the witch announces.  \"So he can sex you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Wait!\" you protest.  \"That was not part of the deal.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"It also was not forbidden by the deal, Honey, so you screw him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"But your pledge...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You re-entered without a new pledge.

Reluctantly you start to strip, a process that meets with the approval of your assailant.  His huge tongue hangs out as he pants.  Staring at it, and remembering the uses it can be put to, you can't quite suppress the thought that this violation may not be entirely disagreeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The familiar seems to have similar thoughts, and growls at you to hurry about removing your pants.  With little choice, you do as told and are soon standing before him completely nude.  You try to cover what you can, but that is quite inadequate.  <br>\r\n  The monster now approaches and starts to sniff your fragrant softness, a boldness that please him more than you.  A second later, you are wishing he was still sniffing, as that enormous tongue gets put into action and strokes over your loins.  But even as you are wanting him to stop, you feel your body betray you and start wishing for him not to.  Your excitement builds, and goes over the top with humiliating speed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Now he thinks it is time to return the favor, as he pulls you down until you find yourself facing his maleness.  It is way too big to fit in your mouth, but your opinion is not being consulted.  If it can't all go, as much as can fit will.  You unwisely open your mouth to protest, and that tool is shoved into the opening.  Then he proceeds to buck, pushing as deep as he can as rapidly as he can.  Fortunately he comes quickly, tho also massively enough to keep you gagging for some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    But while you have been choking, he has been getting into position, and as soon as you can draw a clear breath, he lands on your back, shoving you onto hands and knees. A moment to get himself into position, and then a massive thrust and he is in your secret center.  <br>\r\n   Once again your screams of pain all too soon become screams of pleasure.  You are riding a towering wave, and it crashes in a frenzy of simultaneous explosions.<br>\r\n   After a moment of mutual relaxed completion, he limply pulls out and the assault is finished, a fact you are not going to admit you are sorry about.  Fortunately nobody asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The witch announces \"It's working.  your companion will be reforming in the village in the morning.  Then she will return here to get the potions.  Once the elves see how useful they are, I shall move into the village and rule as queen.  All will have to submit to my rule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Rule by an evil witch... That's not a good thing I've brought on my village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"The alternate is slowly or rapidly being killed and eaten until there is no more village.  And that is an alternative they still have, but won't take.  So no, no matter how vilely I rule, and it may not be that bad, they have cause to bless you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"But you are no longer needed here.

You are my toy until your girlfriend returns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You try to resist, but the witch is amazingly more powerful than you would think a little old lady could possibly be.  You can barely delay being tossed onto her bed, much less prevent it.  Nor can you do anything to stop her from tying legs and arms to corners of the bed.  In a moment, it is clear you are at her mercy, which she doesn't have much of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Stripping her clothing off, she reveals a body that has not suffered nearly as much from time as you would have expected.  Not that you have much time to admire it.  She jumps right onto the bed, and you.  Sitting atop you looking at your toes, she bends forward until all you have in your vision is her portals of womanhood.  Then that is on your face.  \"Love me\" is her command, and one she carries out on you as you surrender and do as she wants.<br>\r\n    Her torso moves, stimulating your aching breasts and her needy mounds.  With you licking and lapping those warm centers, it is not surprising that you both quickly climax.  But this is not enough for her and you repeat the process, slower, but with the same wonderful result for each of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   So the day, and night, and morning pass in depraved fashion.  On those rare times she must rest, her familiar assaults you. But now comes the hail from Gentlefoot.  She is alive and well.  Some what reluctantly the witch frees you and Gentlefoot is allowed to enter, to report full success, and that the village will welcome her as ruler once her potions test out with other elves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"They will, but to speed up the process, I will need more base stock.  For that, I need to boil you down.  Strip, and climb into the pot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Once assured she will once again reform in the village, Gentlefood does as told, but turns to you.  \"How about joining me?  We need to protect the entire village, and you will create  many potions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The witch agrees.  \"Yes, she can help out that way.  But I can't command her.\"  Turning to you, \"So girl, do you want to help out your village once again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The pot is hot you know, and this will delay your reaching your boyfriend another day, but your village does need the help...</span></div></div>",

Well, small cost compared to what would happen to most people.  Even to you, being cooked down to a soup is a daunting prospect.  But you can survive it and your home can use the help.  With a sigh, you approach the pot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    It's a bit embarrassing getting in when both you and Gentlefoot are nude, but not nearly so much as afterwards.  The pot may be big, but not when 2 healthy young lasses are in it.  You are forced close to Gentlefood, and then when the lid is placed on, the two of you are quite tangled together, in ways you would normally consider quite shocking.  But there is no room to get in a more decent position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Nor is there desire after a minute either.  Somehow your thoughts turn erotic as the water heats up.  Is it something in the spices the witch has put in here?  Or is that you are in intimate contact with a beautiful girl you have always had feelings for?  Or...?  Oh bother, all that really matters is that you are feeling these feelings.  Now will Gentlefoot object if you sorta, kinda, accidentally touched her a bit intimately?<br>\r\n    The question is answered by her touching you first.  A split second first, but still first.  You don't spring back.  [Not that you can in this small pot, but...]  And Gentlefoot moves forward.  You touch her again, in an \"accidental\" way, and then in a way you can't excuse as an accident.  Then you are locked in an embrace, and passionately kissing.  Your hands start to explore each other's bodies, gently, and then eagerly, passionately.  Your bodies press together and move in brazen ways.  <br>\r\n    You really can't say, but quite a bit of time may have passed when you start feeling different.  Then you realize you are climaxing, massively.  You collapse into Gentelfoot's arms a moment before she is struck by the same joy.  <br>\r\n   <br>\r\n   But as you slightly recover, you realize something is different.  Your limbs have become soft, almost fluid.  As the witch said, you are being boiled down to soup and you have but a few minutes of consciousness left.  What better way to spend it than in making Gentlefoot?  And you are quite successful at it.  Gentlefoot screams in joy twice before you drift off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    When you wake, you are where you had expected, outside the witch's hut.  Her magic has worked.  You can now reform where ever you have been before.  This will make your trip to your boyfriend a whole lot easier.  You wave in thanks to her hut and then resume your journey, hoping she will be kind to your village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You have not gone far before you meet Sly the naga, who demands a full report on your time with the witch.  She is quite pleased to learn you can reform as you go now.  \"Wonderful, I can guard you and eat you and we won't lose much time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You are not as pleased.  Being naga food is not how you want to reach your man, but the only way you know to suppress her appetite is to appeal to a different appetite, which you are not eager for either.

Maybe if you just take a few steps in that direction....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSly grabs your upper arm and simply shakes her head and grins happily, almost enjoying your naivety. \"You have been with that witch for quite a while.\"<br>\r\n\"I..we..had to make sure the potion worked,\" you offer in your defense. \"And I had to wait for my friend from the village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSly pulls you closer and coils the end of her long muscular tail individually around your ankles and legs; she isn't exerting a lot of pressure or hurting you, but still enough to make it quite clear you're staying exactly where you are. \"Oh, but it sounds like you were doing more than just that,\" she says as you feel her slightly shift her coils to gently rub against your inner thigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squirm a little and manage to give yourself at least a small fraction more room, \"She..she wanted to do other things first, I really didn't have a choice,\" you offer in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSly tightens up her coils on you just a bit and continues to snake them around your body, now up past your waist. \"But you had <i>fun</i>, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting cooked alive, with the added insult of having the cook and her familiar have their perverted way with you, isn't exactly what you would call fun. But as you feel Sly press her coils now against your body and rub gingerly against your crotch you can't help but recall your similar pleasant experiences with the witch and think that maybe it was not all <i>that</i> bad. Even still fully clothed it feels nice to have Sly rub up against you. \"Hmm?\" she says, still waiting for an answer while she rubs her tail more forcedly against your shorts. You try to wriggle around and put some distance between you and her probing tail, but to no avail. \"Yes..I did, \" you answer honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSly leans her head in closer to you and traces the outline of your pointy elven ear with her forked tongue, \"You enjoyed spending the last few days there then?\" she hisses. You let out a barely audible moan as you feel the rough fabric of your shorts firmly pressed against your clit. You protest less and less. Your attempts to push away her rippling coils become weaker and weaker till you just give up and feel your knees start to buckle just a bit. Sly gently nibbles on your ear, perhaps to get a taste of things to come, before asking you again. You nod in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you feel the coils around you tighten painfully as you let out a sudden gasp of pain. Your muscles tighten, your back and knees go rigid, at least as much as you can in your confined state. Your arms and hands go taunt, desperately but fruitlessly trying to free yourself. The coils slither fast and forcefully up to your chest. \"AHHH!!\" is all you can express as she tightens her grip around your ribcage and forcibly expels all the air from your lungs. She rises up to her fullest height, dangling your tightly coiled body in mid air. You try to kick violently but mange to only just barely wiggle your feet. Your attempts to scream vocalize nothing but very faint unintelligible moans. As you gasp for air, she places her hands on her snake like hips and angrily says, \"Meanwhile <i>I</i> had to wait out here all this time without a single thing to eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as suddenly as she lifted you off the ground, she completely relaxes her tail, letting you fall quickly to the ground with a dull thud. You quickly get to your knees and clutch your chest with both hands as you pant rapidly for oxygen. Before you can fully catch your breath, Sly starts to wrap her tail around you again, but making sure to give you generous amounts of room to breath and be comfortable, almost as if she were only trying to help you to your feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize she is set on eating you now, regardless of how you may feel about it, and you may as well go peacefully. \"Okay, okay, just please let me go.\" Sly relaxes the coils around your body, allowing you to step out into the open. You raise your arms above your head and take in a deep breath, which stings slightly, to try and make yourself as skinny and easy to swallow as possible to mitigate some of the discomfort that naturally accompanies being swallowed by the 20 foot naga. Closing your eyes hard, you begrudgingly say to Sly, \"I'm ready.\" Your pulse quickens and your stomach tightens as you anxiously await the inevitable; you just hope it will be quick. A brief moment passes before you feel Sly tug at your shirt, \"Ahem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill bracing for the worst, you narrowly open one eye to see Sly with her arms crossed across her chest, but smiling pleasantly. \"You're forgetting something,\" she says with a slight giggle as she gently tugs at your shirt again. You lower your arms and start to undress. For a natural predator, you can't help but think Sly is a little picky about her food. As if sensing your indignation at having to not just be eaten, but having to strip down beforehand Sly suggest you think of it as simply being food preparation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay down your clothes neatly for your return and retake your previous stance. Sly slithers over greedily behind you and positions her mouth over your hands. She holds your elbows in place as she guides your hands into her mouth. You feel your fingers slide harmlessly over her teeth and onto the soft pallet of her tongue. The palms of your hands feel the bumps and cervices on her tongue as she lowers her lips onto your wrists and toward your forearms. As Sly repositions herself slightly to accommodate your wayward hands down her throat, the rest of your arms slide in effortlessly. You close your yes even tighter as Sly opens her jaws wider to take in your head. Suddenly you feel her lips move over your forehead, down your face over your shut eyes and nose, till they encompass your own lips, and eventually sliding over your chin and down to your neck. The cool breeze of the forest on your face has been replaced by the moist, hot, and humid innards of Sly's mouth pressing against your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSly pauses a moment to open her jaws even further for the not so easy task of cramming your shoulders, and ultimately the rest of your fair skinned body, into her waiting digestive track. With a little straining and shifting, she works one of your shoulders into her mouth and then the other. Accommodating your large breasts require Sly to open her mouth a little wider as well. You can't help but squirm a little as your nipples rub against her teeth on the way on, but Sly holds you firmly in place. Once your breasts are safely in place in her mouth, her jaws relax a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this junction your hands, arms, and most of your head are well into the naga's throat. Your body, from fingertip to your breasts, is covered in saliva. But Sly pauses a moment to let her saliva glands secrete a little more to make sure you slide down easily. Not so much for your comfort, but more for hers you imagine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSly lowers her mouth further down your body, above your navel and dramatically shifts position. She grabs you by the waist and turns your body upward while she lays on her back such that she is no longer lowering her mouth over you body, but that you are being lowered into her mouth. Admittedly, this does make things easier for both of you. Once your upper extremities are swallowed it is very difficult for you to remain standing on your own two legs while being eaten. However, you imagine you must look very silly with your head deep into a naga while your hips and legs hang outside sticking up in the air. You can feel a breeze on your feet. For Sly it is much easier as well as gravity does part of the work from here on in, and she merely has to sit back and relax while fitting the rest of your body in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot passing up the opportunity to play with her food a bit, Sly runs her fingers over your pussy lips while her jaws start to expand to let your hips into her mouth. You squirm a bit and Sly lets out a muffled noise, which you imagine a giggle sounds like with a full mouth. She spreads your pussy lips with her left hand just enough to insert a finger. Deep within the naga you moan loudly and the sound reverberates from the naga's thoracic cavity. She stuffs your hips into her waiting mouth and holds on to your legs to prevent you from sliding down any further. She sucks on your hips for a while, lathering up your pussy with saliva, till she lets go of your legs. You can feel the contraction of Sly's esophagus, forcing you down deeper. Your heels slide in next, and after she straightens her body, your toes slide in with a loud slurp as Sly smacks her lips with satisfaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll lubricated up, your body effortlessly plummets into Sly's waiting stomach. You crash head first with such force that Sly's abdomen shakes. \"Hehe, be careful in there, I don't want you to give me indigestion, \" she says. Your body tosses and turns as Sly rolls over on to her back and looks fondly at the giant bulge in her stomach. She rubs her belly with a gleam of satisfaction, \"I'm sorry I hurt you earlier dear, but you see I really was quite famished.\" You can only let out a muffled response. \"What was that, honey?\" she says with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirmly settled in her stomach, you curl up into a ball and hug your knees. Either from the lack of oxygen, or from the already starting digestion via hydrochloric acid - or whatever it is that nagas have - you loose consciousness and start to pass out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce (if) you awake alive, do you want to....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You awaken, thankfully, safe and sound not far from where you and Sly just were. As you walk back eager to resume your journey, the cool breeze on your naked body, you suddenly realize there is a serious downside to being able to awaken at any place you have previously been. Every time you have awakened in the past, you're completely back in your fully natural state. That is to say, without any clothing or gear of any kind. And this time is no exception, but this was never a  problem before. Back when you awoke in your own bed back at your village, you would just put on a new set of clothes. Even at the witch's hut, you took your clothes off before being eaten or cooked alive. It was a simple enough task to retrieve them later. You breath a sigh of relief knowing that you can again easily retrieve your clothes that you left near Sly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what if you are not so lucky next time? After all, most monsters don't really care what their prey is wearing; they just gobble them up as is. Sly just happens to be particularly picky about her food, or maybe, you think, she just likes seeing you naked. If something were to eat you fully clothed, and you awoke near by, you'd have to find some other ways to get clothed. After all, it's not like you could go politely ask whatever ate you to return your garments that were fully settled in the beast's stomach. Still, you think, that may not likely happen. After all, Sly was here to protect you from just that - being eaten by other monsters. \"Other\" being the operative word here, since Sly clearly still enjoys having the monopoly on eating you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop dead in your tracks as a much more serous problem dawns on you. Your naga companion may be well fed, but you certainly are not. Your only source of food and supplies before, was the village. You had always restocked your supplies after you awoke safely at home before setting out again. If you're going to wake up in the forest from this point on, you lose that luxury. How are you going to get food and water now? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew this trip was going to be arduous when you decided to undertake it, but you come to the realization that things have not been going all that well, and you're barely making that much progress. Your very first day out you met the manipulative naga, Sly, who is content to help you only as far as you can keep her appetite, both sexual and nutritious, satisfied. The witch you met shortly thereafter may have given you the ability to reform wherever you have been previously, but as you realize now, it comes with some potentially troublesome drawbacks. Not to mention that your prolonged stay with the witch resulted in a very angry and hungry naga that blamed you personally for your tardiness, resulting in a less then pleasant one-way trip into her ravenous stomach. All of this would be more tolerable, you guess, if you had actually been making suitable progress towards Monuna, but as it stands you have barely made any progress at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return to the clearing were you and Sly were. You try and cover your nudity as best you can with your hands, partially out of embarrassment, but mostly cause you don't want Sly to get any ideas. Thankfully though, she doesn't appear to want to start anything. Still lying on her back, with an immensely satisfied look on her face while she  hugs the large bulge in her serpentine stomach that used to be you, she looks over and says \"Welcome back\" with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take your clothing and quickly get dressed behind a large tree to obscure Sly's view, while you explain to her your recent concerns about your newfound ability to awake where you please. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you elves were great at foraging for food in the forest?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"We are, \" you say as you finish dressing, \"but I'm not really familiar with this area,\" you answer. <br>\r\nSly rubs her belly with a slight moan, \"I don't know how you can stand those berries, fruits, twigs, grass, or whatever the hell it is you people eat.\" She looks over in your direction and traces her lips with her tongue, \"Elves are so much more yummy!\"<br>\r\nYou take two frantic steps back, as Sly quickly offers, \"Oh, don't worry, I'm stuffed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach lets out a jealous growl. You need to get something to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you want to...</span></div></div>",

It's odd in a way.  You very much want to avoid being eaten despite it not harming you, and despite enjoying it, sometimes immensely.  It sounds rather crazy when you think about it, but if you are offered the choice of riding in comfort in Sly's belly or walking, you are not going to hesitate to exhaust yourself and bruise your feet.  <br>\r\n   So Sly can rest and not eat you quite so often, and you start hunting for your rations.  And you are lucky right away.  You are hardly out of sight of Sly [Well, technically out of yelling range, but...] when you stumble onto a virtual garden.  Indeed for a moment, you wonder if it is the witch's garden, but while you are not really far from her home as a healthy young elf measures distance, you are quite far as an old lady does, particularly one who could put her garden a lot closer to home.  So you move in and start gathering all sorts of great plants.  This is too good to be true...<br>\r\n    The tentacle wrapping itself around you confirms that.  As you desperately try to get free, you spot the huge plant in the center of the \"garden\", a plant with a large bulb that you realizes is a digestion chamber that will soon be full of elf, and berate yourself.  You knew about this danger and have been warned of this sort of thing.  You were even warned that there had to be a reason all these delicious plants have not been eaten, and that reason was likely very dangerous.  But did you stop and look?  No... You just rushed in like a fool, and now you are being dragged off to be converted into plant food.  <br>\r\n      Well, what to do about it?  To your surprise, you start undressing.  A second later, you realize the wisdom of this.  Your chance of escape is low, but you can at least avoid damage to your irreplaceable clothing.  Being digested in the nude may be a lousy result, but it is still better than being digested and having your clothing ruined as well.<br>\r\n     By the time you are close to the digestion chamber, you are quite nude, and your clothing is safe, at least compared to you, tho not without some damage.   You wonder if you blew your chance to escape, but you doubt it, and you were very unlikely to get away without disaster to your outfit.  Time to be food again.<br>\r\n     At least the plant doesn't have thorns in its 'throat'... Ouch!  Correction, it has no thorns as long as you don't try to move away from digestion.  Which means you have to stay still and not move your hands down to play with yourself.  And your sliding into the the plant is too  stimulating to make doing nothing a desirable choice.  \"Lips\" slide over sensitive body parts until you really want to do something...something not too painful...  Finally you find some wiggling that gives you a little relief without too much pain.  Then you sink into blackness...<br>\r\n     You wake again well away from the plant, which may be a mindless plant, but you somehow see it as grinning at you and smiling over its delicious meal.  You glare at it, to no effect of course, and and then get down to recovering your clothing.<br>\r\n     Happily, the plant is too full to want a second course, and you have no problem getting both clothing and as much food as you can carry.  One might say you came out ahead in the encounter.  You don't agree.  You still see the plant as just like that lout who goosed you when you couldn't do anything about it.  Like with him, about all you can do is give the finger as you march indignantly out of sight.  <br>\r\n    You return to Sly just about dark, who merely mutters, \"Got plenty, eh?  Well, we can start moving in the morning then.  Right now... You just cuddle up against me...\"</span></div></div>",

Much more likely that she wants to drive you, and be driven, to heights of passion that will leave both of you exhausted, and likely hungry in her case.  But what choice do you have?  You have already decided you need her help if you are to reach your goal, and if she is getting more out of this than you expected, she is still vital to your reaching Monuna.  \"Vince had better be grateful for all of this...\" you mutter as you strip and put yourself in Sly's curls.<br>\r\n   \"You mammals.\" Sly laughs.  \"He is going to do a lot of perverted things to you, and then you are going to suffer months of being sick, awkward, and uncomfortable.  That will be followed by hours of unendurable agony, and that is the easy part.  You will be a slave for decades for your ungrateful little masters.  If you were at all sane, you would be running away from him, not working hard to get to him...  In fact, why don't you forget him?  The two of us could have a great time together.\"<br>\r\n    \"You could anyway.\" you retort.  \"Eventually I am not going to come back from being eaten.  The odds are pretty good if I am just going to get eaten a few times, but if we shack up, I'm dead.  <br>\r\n    \"And sane or not, we mammals do consider that program a good deal, and I'll take it over the alternatives.<br>\r\n    \"Besides, can you really call your own behavior all that sane?  I've heard some stories about Nagas acting crazy where their lovers are concerned.\"<br>\r\n   \"Well... It doesn't really happen that often.\" Sly tries to qualify the point, \"but yes, Nagas have done foolish things and been too trusting of false lovers at times.  I suppose it could happen that I will up in the belly of some snake I misunderstood the intentions of, or my hide end up a trophy on the wall of some lying man, but every girl makes mistakes like that...<br>\r\n    \"But that doesn't need to concern us now.\" Sly changes the subject, \"We need to make sure our relationship is a close one...\"  <br>\r\n    Sly's arms reaching around you makes clear her definition of \"close\", but you choose to 'misunderstand'.  \"I don't see how it can get much closer than being swallowed, and you said you were full.\"<br>\r\n    Sly laughs.  \"I'm comfortable full.  If I really need to, I can eat a lot more.  One time, when I hadn't eaten in far too long, and when it looked like hunting was going to be bad for a long time ahead too, I was lucky enough to trap 6 women in a cave.  I swallowed three of them and stuffed the other three in my womb to eat later.  I had a serious bellyache, but I got thru a time when a lot of other nagas starved.\"<br>\r\n   \"Do you have to talk about eating people?\" you grumble.<br>\r\n   \"People eat rabbits and chickens, and I eat people.\"  Sly responds, \"There's no big difference... or at least none that I want to talk about when you are in my arms...\"<br>\r\n   Looks like you are not going to divert her with talk.  Still it is not hopeless.  Maybe you can still keep her talking until she is too sleepy for other things.  But the odds are looking bad, so maybe it is time to switch tactics and seduce her.  Hardly your preference, but if you set the schedule for the fun and games, you can at least limit the damage.  Not as good as not being damaged of course, but it's at least easier to achieve.  <br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

' so your his lover huh had alot of issues with that one always picking fights with me always getting in my way.\" you giggled. \" i need to find him i miss him so much why would he be here and not in Monuna?\" you asked. the cheif said nothing. the wolf looked at you. \" there are strange things happening in this vally you never seen this place before but your lover has seen it all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" maby it was beacuse of those black things?\" the fox general said. black things you remember 4 years ago a black cloaked thing killed your father.  \" those hooded things that suck the very soul out of you those things make me sick they should stay on the other side of the peak.' the wolf commander said. \" i heard rumors one is here in this forest if it is true we must end this fighting and take care of it before it destroy both tribes.\"  so he came to that villae beacuse thats where the black things are it kinda made snence. he always liked a challenge you remember the day your dad died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou were crying by his grave and he walked up holding his sword. \" i could not kill the bastard it was like he was not alive.\" you looked at him. he had that serious face he always had when he fought but it did not go away this time. \" mayfair i'm sorry i'm to weak i could have saved yur daddy but i did not.\"  you looked at him. his face was dissaponted. he wanted to be the best warrior in the village but he failed. \" your a great warrior you know that.' you say and he kisses you. \" i love you so much if anything happened to you i would kill myself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nback in reality the foxes and wolves were trying to deiced what to do. \" we should form a untied party and find this hooded black thing before.\" the cheif said. you sat in the back as the fox grunts and the wolf commander talked. this was getting stupid you wanted to find your boyfriend but one thing led to another. now here you are beinf led into a battle. the fox general looked at you. \" can you fight?' you shake your head. \" what can you d then?\" you explain your healing arts and how useless you are. the fox general looked at you and gave you a sword.

The Black Forest is known of the packs of Shadow Monsters and the Shadow Fox Clan. You think for a moment... maybe you can ask on of the Fox Clanners to guide you through the forest? Probably not. You have no idea where they live, nor you doubt that one would pass up on sexy elf maiden flesh just to help you. But then you think of something, what if you can compromize with one of them? Maybe? Regardless, you move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in the day, the Black Forest is pitch... well, black. It is hard to navigate in such a dark and dense forest, but you keep moving. Finally, when you know it is night time (the forest is even darker, if you can belive it), you unpack your stuff to rest. The small camp fire barely lights up the small clearing. \"Damn, it's dark. Even with this fire, I won't know when a monster shows up until my head is in its mouth. Maybe this wasn't such a good idea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear a rustle of leaves, and swift footsteps.

The two were soon dueling with their tongues battling in each other's mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"mmmmm...you taste so good....Mayfair....mmmmm...\" the panting fox stated, as she made Mayfair lay down on the ground. \"Now...we play....then.....we eat....no?\" The fox woman then began anew her kissing of Mayfair's mouth, while pawing and squeezing the elf's heaving breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayfair just laid back, while her body was taken over by the enormous feelings of joy and pleasure that coursed thru her tortured body.

You just have one problem... almost everyday, you end up inside any creature's stomach! But for some reason, everytime you are digested, you are revived back in your bed! Your main goal is to get to the far village of Monuna, at the base of the tallest mountain in the area. However, you have to avoid getting eaten by anything, because maybe one time, you might not be reborn. If you are eaten, then pray as hard as you can to survive. Good luck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is mostly Monster/elf vore, but I will allow other creatures, such as mermaids, to swallow you. Perhaps I wasn't too clear on what I said about sexual moments... When I said that, I meant that either a humanoid male seduces her, or when she is being swallowed, they can lick her breasts and so on. No monster sex!!! Take advantage of my gentle nature, and I will be forced to delete any chapters. Also, no gay/lesbian/underaged sex aloud, got it? Good. And please be good with spelling and grammer, it drives me crazy. Enjoy!</td>",
