Due to your constant absent-mindedness, you have just been kick out of your old place after one of your experiments\u2019 when wild. With nowhere else, to turn you are forced to ask your great grand ma for a place to stay. Standing outside of the boarding house she owned, you knew you were about to head in to a strange and possibly dangerous place. The home of a FAE, a species of secret mythical women of incredible beauty and powers who prey upon humans especially males. While no one outside of the FAEs\u2019 are to know of their existence, you are one the few who do. <br>\r\nIn fact, the only reason you are still alive after you had discovered the FAE, was that the FAE you discovered were members of your own family (Your grandmother and Great Grand Mother, as well as your Favorite aunt Sonja.) While they were supposed to eliminate you right then, they decide against it after finding out that not only are you immune to most of the powerful Charms and spells FAE use to bait their prey, but also you were completely fascinated into discovering a way for prey to survive after consumption. Realizing that you could actually do such a task, under the order of your Great Grand they were to let you live. In hopes that one day, you would finally discover a way to make it so the males of your family can survive their lovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo as you head to the door and knock, you can only hope your family is home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
