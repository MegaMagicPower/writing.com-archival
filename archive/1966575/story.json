Not that this has stopped the Normal-type in the past-- she simply pushed in, forcing a rather loud <b><i>PFFFBBBRRRRT!~</i></b> from her backside.

Anyway, Eevee had a gut absolutely full of gas today, because she loved letting it build up and pressurize throughout her whole day. The other awake Eeveelutions understood quickly what was going one, and came to watch the surprise. Once Eevee's rear was aligned with Espeon's snout, she slammed herself down on her victim. At the same time, some of the others grabbed Espeon's limbs to restrain her in place. Espeon suddenly woke up, realized what was going on, and tried struggling to no avail. There was no way she could match the strength of some of the other Eeveelutions, let alone 5-6 of them holding her down. When Eevee was ready, she pushed out all of her accumulated gas, resulting in a 20-30 second ripper. These fumes were trapped in the small space between Eevee's butt and Espeon's nose. For Espeon, there was no escape. She thrashed side to side but still couldn't get herself away from that god-awful smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next in the story?</span></div></div>",

After wheezing out some of Eevee's gas from her lungs, she stood up on all-fours in front of Eevee, releasing her grasp from the other Eeveelutions and focusing it on that smug vee to flip her upside down and keep her floating in the air. \"As much as I hated doing it, I used some Physic  to compress and store gas for anyone who decided to lay even a little toot on me..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEevee tilted her head and flicked her ears confusedly and worriedly. Espeon's belly didn't look bloated at all! How much gas <i>did</i> she store in there, exactly? \"Ummm, Espeon? I'm sor-\" She suddenly fell to the ground, yelping at the impact. She was on her back and glanced up at Espeon, who was already hovering her rear over her by the time she looked. \"I said I'm s-\" Her speech got incredibly muffled as her face was immediately sat on before she could even say the magic words.

After every meal, Flareon would begin to get <i>really</i> gassy, and despite her best efforts, she would release several stink bombs in their den, much to the dismay of everyone else.

Suddenly, a painful ache in her belly brought her out of her slumber and drew her attention. She knew this meant that gas was building up inside her, and would soon be demanding a way out. This made her worried, since Espeon approached her that morning after her first gas bomb and told her that if she did this again, they would have to kick her out of the den for the sake of the rest of the sisters. Flareon was very fond of her room, but she knew that if she didn't act quick, her gas would explode out of her and she would be left without a home. She considered her options: 1) Get out the den and far enough to relieve herself without disturbing her sisters, 2) Try to hold it in until it subsides, or 3) Just ingore it and hope for the best. She knew the bathroom wouldn't contain all her gas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to feel the pressure in her bowels and butt grow in intensity, which meant that time was running out.

She couldn't fit either of these on her behind by herself, but she was growing desperate. Her stomach was gurgling and bubbling nonstop, and her butt felt overfilled with gas. She was beginning to tremble because of the bloating. She crossed her hind legs and shook her butt in a dance of desperation. She had to act fast, or else she was gonna blow.

First of all, her gas could easily push the tape off. In addition to that, she would be unable to further assist the tape in stopping her gas.  However, a cork was more effective.  It would be much better at plugging up her butt, and she could clench her butt to help keep it in.

Eevee was a possible choice, and so was Umbreon and Vaporeon.  Umbreon and Vaporeon were probably much more understanding, and would help her out.

Sylveon smiled, but as they watched the show, she heard a grumble come from her sister's belly. She promptly scooted away a little bit, knowing what that grumble meant. Flareon however, did nothing. Usually, she would hold her belly, excuse herself to the bathroom, or sit on her tail, but now she didn't even react. Sylveon took a quick glance at her sister's butt. She was always fascinated by Flareon's booty, as it was the biggest out of the sisters. She occasionally catches Flareon caught in walkways due to her behind.

Umbreon positioned herself so she could feel the full impact of Vaporeon's next blast. Vaporeon closed her eyes and frowned in concentration, ready to unleash a monster from her bowels.

If you wanted any iota of publicity, you would be crazy not to show up and mingle a bit. One particular guest was Espeon, the leader of Team Evo-- an exploration team consisting entirely of Eeveelution siblings. He was a rather charismatic Pok\u00e9mon, and would normally be eager to be up-front and socializing!... but there was a problem... The Psychic-type groaned lowly in discomfort, his twin-tipped tail flicking nervously as he glanced uneasily at the crowd of other explorers who had shown up. Vaporeon had thrown a nice lunch together for him, sure, but he'd forgotten to consider that maybe it was a bit too much to eat right before a sophisticated event like this. His belly grumbled and churned softly, working diligently away at his meal... It wasn't much of a problem at first. A bit of indigestion was nothing new for Espeon, after all! He managed to get some small talk in with a few other Pok\u00e9mon, and it wasn't until he wrapped up conversation with a rather cool-headed Scolipede that he felt a low pressure beginning to bubble up inside him... his cue to slip out and find somewhere private for a little bit. Before he could actually act on that thought, though, he heard a small voice call out from his right, \"Hey! Hey, you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A friendly-looking Zigzagoon dashed up, practically hopping in place once they got close. \"You're that Espeon that drifted in with the other Eeveelutions, right?\" they asked, sporting a big grin. Espeon silently cursed his luck, but kept his cool, responding simply with, \"Mmhm.~ The one and only. Have we met, perchance?\" In response, Zigzagoon just shook their head rapidly, and barked out, \"Nope! Spotted one of the others out in the market! You all seem like a nice bunch!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before Espeon could say anything in response, a dull ache in his gut reminded him of the growing pressure bubbling within. The Eeveelution decided that it was best to excuse himself, but barely managed to get out, \"Excuse me, I really should--\" before the Normal-type continued with questions such as \"So, where are you guys from? You siblings? Best friends? Somethin' else?\" and a plethora of other questions that just gave Espeon's tummy trouble more time to get worse.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0By the time the purple-furred Psychic managed to get a word in and excuse himself, he'd inadvertently allowed quite a bit of gas to build up. Enough, in fact, that he was finding himself feeling rather bloated, and wasn't quite sure if he could keep his gas in until he got out the door and somewhere private. A single wrong step, and he could kiss his chances of being known as anything more than \"That one Espeon that stank up the whole Guild Hall\"... Even so, waiting was just going to make things worse, so Espeon began carefully and methodically making his way to the entrance, trying to avoid socialization, and for Arceus' sake, trying his best not to fart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Once he made his way out, there was nothing stopping him from ducking into some well-hidden alcove and \"de-pressurizing\" as loudly as he pleased while preserving his dignity. Unfortunately for the lovely, lilac-furred feline, fate threw him another curveball as another friendly face approached, eager to chat. This time, the one holding him up was a Luxio. He didn't particularly have time to chat at this point-- the Zigzagoon from earlier had already gotten him dangerously close to gassing the place with all the small-talk they'd dragged him into-- but... he could possibly buy a few minutes just so that he didn't seem rude by brushing off a conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the Electric-type came close, Espeon took a calculated risk, using Psychic to... ahem... <i>bottle himself up</i>, so to speak. It wasn't an ideal solution, of course. It didn't do anything to stop the indigestion that was causing him to be so gassy in the first place, and it required quite a bit of concentration to maintain, but he could keep it up for a good while... at least, that's what he thought. He took initiative in initiating conversation this time, starting off with, \"Well, hello. You're certainly a friendly face, coming to talk to me out of the blue like this.\" The Luxio tilted their head and smiled, their tail swishing back and forth as they gave their reply. \"Of course I'm going to talk to you-- you're new in town! Word spreads quickly, you know.\"<br>\r\n\"Is that so? I'll have to keep that in mind before I get into any trouble!\" the Eeveelution joked in response, giving a little chuckle. The Luxio seemed to find it kind of funny, too, but cattish curiosity soon took hold, and they inquired, \"So, are you a lone explorer, or are you part of a team?\" Once again, however, before Espeon could formulate a response, another cramp of a higher magnitude gripped his belly, an audible bubbling of protest sounding off from it and coaxing another uncomfortable groan from Espeon himself. His conversational partner, reasonably concerned, completely dropped their prior question in favor of, \"Are... are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon's gas pains...</span></div></div>",

There wasn't anything he could do about it-- <u>he was going to fart,</u> and everyone was going to think of him as some disgusting, unmannerly gasbag forever. Fortunately, just moments before his Psychic weakened to the point that all that pent-up gas could escape, Espeon felt a wave of relief wash over him as the cramps left him as quickly as they came. He took a moment to regain his composure, but that moment of panic, along with the fact that he felt even more bloated than before (and his belly showed no signs of slowing down the gas production), clued him in to something-- <b>he legitimately couldn't afford to dally around for another minute.</b> Another pang like that and his reputation was as good as ruined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0First off, he reassured the Electric-type that he was, indeed, just fine and dandy (a baldfaced lie), then brought up that he needed to leave and that he was sorry for cutting their conversation short.

He waited for a good minute or two, just making sure that nobody had followed him... then, growing impatient for fear of those dreaded aches returning in force, Espeon let his concentration on his Psychic slip. Almost immediately, a loud <i><b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">Bppppffwwwwrrrt!</font></b></i> thundered out, followed by a couple smaller <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><i><b>Pfffrrrt...</b></i>s</font> and a <i><b>brrRAAAAPPffff...~</b></i> that was comfortably in the middle volume-wise... the feeling of relief for Espeon's poor tummy was immeasurable, but his little hiding spot already <i>stank</i> just from those smaller blasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Espeon...</span></div></div>",

Not only was it quite nice, but sunlight was also his main source of nutrition!  Every day for the past week, Leafeon has been sitting in the sun as his way of food.  While his method was more than enough to sustain himself, it also left his stomach the most sensitive it has been for a long time.  Just the smallest of meals would likely have very gaseous results!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Feeling satisfied, Leafeon stood up and began to make his way back to his cave that he shared with his brothers. It was a little cramped, but it didn\u2019t bother Leafeon much. What <b>did</b> bother him was all the  farting his brothers partake in. Espeon was the only other one who shared his distaste for their farting, though Espeon\u2019s dislike of it was a lot stronger. Sometimes, one his brothers have a really gassy day, and completely stink up the cave! Fortunately, no one has been that gassy since Umbreon had all those burritos. Leafeon still shivers slightly from the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The cave was just in sight, but something caught Leafeon\u2019s eye. A bush full of Pecha berries were just to the side of the path. Pecha berries were Leafeon\u2019s favorite, but he knew that they were also going to make him gassy. And, after going a week with just sunlight for food, his stomach is certainly extremely sensitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Just what will Leafeon do?</span></div></div>",

Even before he evolved and learned how to photosynthesize, the berries had always been a bit of a guilty pleasure for him-- in spite of their succulence and delightfully-sweet taste, they had a nasty habit of stirring up a fair amount of gas in his gut. It was probably a family thing, as most of his siblings felt the same effects from them as well, but... well, he figured that it wouldn't be <i>too</i> bad if he only had a few.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Grass-type approached the bush, carefully plucking a particularly plump-looking berry off a branch and tucking into it. Every bit as delicious as he remembered! After scarfing down that first berry, Leafeon chowed down on a second, and a third... it was a couple of bites into his fourth before an audible gurgling from his belly tipped him off that he might have overdone it a bit, and that maybe it was a good idea to quit... After some brief deliberation, Leafeon decided that it was best to stop after berry #4, and finished it off as quickly as possible, letting off a very light <b>uuurrrpfh...</b> afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Despite his better judgment (considering he'd just loaded up on Pecha berries), Leafeon finished his trek to the cave, giving a little glance around upon his entry. He wasn't gassy quite yet, and had confidence that once the berries stewing in his stomach DID start stirring up trouble, it'd be more of a slow burn. He only had four, after all... that couldn't possibly cause TOO much of a disturbance. Now, to see who else was present... Glaceon... Sylveon... Espeon! Leafeon perked up as he noticed the presence of his closest brother, sidling up to him and engaging in small talk, almost completely forgetting about the fact that his belly was practically a ticking time bomb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow hard do those Pecha berries hit once Leafeon starts feeling their effects?</span></div></div>",

In the middle of one of Espeon\u2019s rants about nothing in particular, a monumental amount of pressure emerged deep within Leafeon.  It all came from nowhere!

He was very thankful for his whole body being covered in the tree's lengthy shade because any sort of discomfort could cause his now bloated stomach to act more agitated than it already was! Sylveon, being the adorable Pokemon he was, convinced a wandering Pokemon trainer to give him the fast food meal they were about to devour for themselves:  A beefy hamburger complete with melted cheese, crunchy lettuce, juicy tomato slices, spicy onions, and tasty ketchup, along with some crispy fries as a side and a large orange soda to wash it all down. To say that he enjoyed it would be an understatement, and an even bigger one for his stomach's satisfaction too. It viciously churned away at the greasy food before it turned into intestinal gas, way more that Sylveon could actually handle. His belly was the size of a basketball and burbled softly while he moaned for help, hoping that someone would aid him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut alas, was he <i>really</i> in any actual danger? Heck no! Sylveon just loved deceiving others with his seemingly cute demeanor and he had just the plan thought up.

He couldn't wait!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike, 'honest to Arceus' couldn't wait. His belly was getting tighter by the minute and it was only a matter of time before he would legitimately need help.
