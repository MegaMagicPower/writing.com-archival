Pumpkin started to mimic her father and began to suckle on her hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pacifier that Carrot suckled on soon dropped out of his mouth and fell onto the bed.

It's eleven in the morning.\" Drool began to escape from his mouth and it slowly made its way down to the chin. He began to place his hoof into his mouth and began to suckle on it. He lay back down and kicked his legs a little, with that, the blanket soon was kicked away from Carrot enough for Pumpkin to see he was wearing a thick white diaper nicely taped around him. The front of the diaper had colourful designs with teddy bears, bottle, rattles and building blocks on the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrot soon stopped his kicking and began to lean forward again, he gave Pumpkin a dopey smile.

He wiped his wet hoof on the blanket, leaving a small stain of drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumpkin's smile and excitement quickly dropped.

She pointed at Pumpkin's dry diaper. \"Baby no go potty.\" Her mother pointed out in a childish tone of voice. Cup Cake kicked the blanket off of her and revealed more of the diaper she was wearing, which too, was wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I go pee-pee in my diaper.\" Cup Cake pointed at her own padding. \"See?\" She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumpkin couldn't help but smile at the sight of both her parents.

Pumpkin couldn't help but be astonished at the sheer size of the adult sized highchair that Pinkie Pie was in. All three ponies had bibs on with a little catch for any food that falls down. Pinkie wasn't like her usual self in the highchair, the party pony seemed to be rather calm after the whole ordeal with the fridge, she's always a greedy baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCup Cake turned to face the two babies and the overgrown foal sitting in the highchair next to them. Her back was the resting place for a food tray that had three large bottles and three jars of baby food, one being a little larger than the other two. Pinkie Pie noticed the food and began to squirm around in her chair, her tail swished from side to side and a grin swept across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh! Ooh!\" Pinkie Pie reached out for the big far of baby food. \"Me! Me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCup Cake ignored Pinkie's pleas for food and trotted over to her children, she smiled at both of them and placed both jars onto the plastic tray. \"Num-nums for babies.\" She turned to Pinkie Pie and hushed her. Pinkie's smile dropped and continued to watch the two foals be given their breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumpkin watched as Cup Cake turned the food jars upside-down and allowed their contents to fall all over the plastic tray. Pumpkin was confused by this at first, normally her mother would bring a small bowl and a spoon over and hoof-feed them herself. But there wasn't a bowl, or even a spoon, Pumpkin was confused for a moment until she noticed her brother picking up the apple mush and started eating it with his hooves, more fell into his bib than his own mouth but it looked fun. Cup Cake didn't do anything to stop the babies at all, she looked at them and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumpkin copied her brother and happily gorged on the food in front of her, she knew to take it slow or else it would fall down into her bib. She stopped for a second to watch her mother walk over to the breakfast table, sit down and then proceed to suck her hoof for a good minute or two. Pinkie Pie also sucked on her hoof and proceeded to wet her diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs both babies were filling up their stomachs with delicious mush, they didn't know that their father had entered the kitchen. Carrot Cake walked into the kitchen with a brand new diaper on and walked in and sat at the table. He stared at his wife who was still sucking on her hoof, he smiled and looked at Pinkie Pie, who was also doing the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, baby.\" Carrot smiled at Pinkie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.\" Pinkie smiled back. She her hoof out of her mouth and leaned against the plastic tray attached to the highchair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrot didn't even have to reply to this. He knew what Pinkie Pie wanted and she was going to get it. He trotted over to the table and picked up the large jar of baby food and twisted the lid open, he then went back over to the high chair and placed the food on the tray for Pinkie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie grabbed the jar without even thinking and began to suckle on the top like a bottle. Carrot look on with a smile before heading over to the babies and patting each of them on the head. He tapped Pound on the head and rubbed his mane with a smile, only to get food on his hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached over to Pumpkin to see she had finished her food first, he undone the straps around her and let her down from the highchair, placing her on the kitchen floor and pushing a pacifier in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good baby.\" Carrot chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumpkin saw no point in waiting around for her brother or even Pinkie Pie to finish, despite how fast she guzzled down her food which will leave her with an upset tummy.</span></div></div>",

The foal soon left the kitchen with her pacifier still in her mouth, she suckled on it slowly and headed straight for the front door, which was still left open when she found the amulet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sights on the new Ponyville were nothing but spectacular. All of her planning, ideas and wishes for a happier life for the grown ups has paid off. Pumpkin took her first few steps outside the Sugarcube Corner's front gates and noticed a few ponies, specifically grown ups wandering the streets with the odd colt or filly following the grown up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like her parents the magic had spread to the rest of the town's inhabitants and gave them a much stress-free and happier lifestyle thanks to the magical blast she had summoned earlier. Grown ups of all different kinds wore thick babyish diapers with the same designs her parents wore with the children also wearing the same, just a little smaller for their size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome had pacifiers in their mouths which some suckled or let dangle around their necks, some wore onesies, bonnets, sleepers and others carried toys, bottles, packs of diapers and some of the younger ponies were being pushed in large strollers while very few walked alongside what seemed to be their parents. Pumpkin stood in awe at the handy work that her magical powers allowed her to perform, this was perfection in every way. Ponies seemed to be smiling everywhere, grown ups smiled, talked and sat in the middle of the road to hug and play together with whatever toys they had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumpkin knew that if she was going to find the right amount of ponies to have fun with, she'd have to find a group of foals like her. She knew the layout of the town, thanks to her mother taking her on trips around to almost every building when it came to delivering cakes. A place with lots of foals and toys would be the Ponyville school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foal began to head towards the Ponyville school in order to see how the children had begun to adapt to their new lifestyle. One that she thought they needed the most after the grown ups made them abandon their diapers and care-free life.</span></div></div>",

Her excitement to see the faces of the older children was going to be the most interesting and most satisfying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe outside of the school didn't really look that different from the last time she saw it. The outside of the school didn't really look that different, it looked the same as it always did and there was nothing that Pumpkin could pick up on that made it feel different in any way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumpkin reached the school doors and opened them slightly to enter the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering the classroom, she noticed that the interior of the school had been changed considerably. All of the boring desks, whiteboards, posters and other educational equipment found in a normal classroom had been removed in favor of crudely drawn images made by the children who are in the school. Large plastic containers filled to the brim with toys, building blocks and toy carriages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former students, now foals were all scattered around the room, all wearing diapers and different assortments of baby clothing made for their sizes. Fillies and colts all played together in groups, some played with the toys, chased each other or went into a changing line which was found at the back of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumpkin eyed up a trio of fillies all sitting in a corner, each playing with a pair of toys. The three fillies were all wearing thick white diapers which had the same babyish images on the front just like the other ponies she had seen. One of them had a pacifier in their mouth and sat on a pillow, rocking back and forth with a smile on her face.</span></div></div>",

The three fillies who were always trying to find their cutie marks in order to grow up, a shame, Pumpkin shook her head. They shouldn't be trying to grow up, they should be playing out in the fields with their toys instead of trying to find those pesky cutie marks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplebloom and Scootaloo seemed to be sitting beside eachother both playing with a selection of toys that were scattered out the classroom. A small pile of select toys were chosen by the two and brought back to this very corner they all played in. Save for Sweetie Belle, she lay on top of a large pillow resting her head with a pearl white pacifier in her mouth which she contently suckled on. Pumpkin noticed her eyes seemed to be a bit heavy, the white filly must be having her own nap-time despite the other fillies and colts still playing their games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumpkin got up close to the other two fillies and noticed they had some toy blocks, which both Scootaloo and Applebloom all piled up together to make a tower. Until Pumpkin decided to boop the tower with her hoof and knock it down, causing some of the blocks to fall on top of Scootaloo. The pegasus filly shook her head and looked at the little foal, looking surprised to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pumpkin!\" Scootaloo stood up, her diaper crinkling all the way and toddled over to the foal and wrapped a hoof around her, bringing them into a hug. Pumpkin smiled at the two fillies and dropped her pacifier right next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna play?\" Applebloom asked. Pumpkin couldn't resist a game of blocks, she looked at the blocks and saw Scootaloo placing one block on top of the other. But it was too slow for her, Pumpkin giggled, she charged up a wave of magic in her horn and a light green aura of magic swallowed the blocks and levitated them into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blocks flew above the fillies heads as they both gasped in excitement. Applebloom was so excited that she leaned back and fell on her back, giggling all the way. The blocks soon quickly placed on top of each other in just a few seconds and Pumpkin seemed satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo stuck a hoof in her mouth and looked at the tower of blocks, she then looked at Pumpkin and silently nodded. The foal moved forward and happily pushed the blocks over from the bottom, they all soon fell down on top of Applebloom who was still lying down on the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Pumpkin and Scootaloo soon erupted into a burst of laughter as Applebloom lay still with the several blocks still lying on top of her. However, the apple filly was lying down for a different reason. She pushed one of the blocks away from her and picked up Pumpkin's pacifier and placed it in her mouth and started to suckle on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tee-hee.\" Scootaloo giggled. She looked at Pumpkin and then looked at Applebloom. \"Stinky filly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplebloom began to make grunting noises under the pacifier and her legs began to idly kick. At the seat of her diaper, a mass began to form which pushed out from the bottom, Pumpkin realized that she was messing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for Applebloom to finish what she was doing, she stopped and sat upwards to look at the other two ponies who just watched what she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh.\" Applebloom blushed. \"I did a stinky.\" She drooled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo giggled. \"Stinky filly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stinky filly.\" Applebloom nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fillies didn't really seem to make anything of the stinky diaper, they just continued back to their games and most importantly: the blocks. Pumpkin also continued to play, using her magic to create another tower using the pushed down blocks. The repetition never sank in for the fillies, the blocks falling down and landing in a different position every time seemed to be the most amazing thing since sliced bread for Applebloom and Scootaloo.</span></div></div>",

She really liked playing with these fillies, they all had great personality and were extremely playful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumpkin took back the pacifier that Applebloom took, by waiting for the filly to drop it out of her mouth by being unable to concentrate on more than one thing at once. She climbed to the top of the pillow that Sweetie Belle slept on and sat next to the unicorn filly with the pacifier in her mouth. The food she had back at the Sugarcube Corner was now taking its toll and she began to feel tired from all the walking she had done from her home to the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foal leaned up against Sweetie Belle's stomach and rested her head up against her. Pumpkin got a much better view of what was going on in the classroom now that she was in a higher position, even if it was just a pillow. One of the grown-ups that Pumpkin recognized was trotting over to her group. Miss Cheerilee slowly made her way over to Applebloom and Scootaloo who was also wearing a diaper with a pacifier in her mouth. She dodged the playful students and made sure not to trample their tails or even the toys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheerilee had a purple pacifier in her mouth with a bright yellow shield around the edges, her diaper was that of the rest of the ponies she encountered. A thick white disposable with babyish images on the front. The teacher wore a pair of glasses, which made her look much more older than she actually was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplebloom and Scootaloo stopped what they were doing and looked at Cheerilee, who was sniffing the air and recoiling in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Cheerilee prodded Scootaloo's diaper, feeling nothing out of the usual. \"Who did the stinky?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh.\" Scootaloo shook her head. \"I'm dry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Applebloom?\" Cheerilee prodded the apple fillies diaper and felt some kind of mush down in the back. She smiled. \"A-ha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplebloom's ears went down. \"I didn't do stinky!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuh-uh.\" Cheerilee nodded. \"Time for a changie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww...\" Applebloom groaned. She kicked one of the toy blocks in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumpkin had seen this type of thing before, in fact, she's experienced having to go for a countless amount of diaper changes. As time passed she learned that diaper changes were necessary and were sometimes good breaks, even to avoid an awful rash. But to her surprise, Cheerilee picked up Applebloom by the scruff and lifted her into the air. Pumpkin's mouth dropped wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplebloom was lifted into the air, diaper sagging down to the ground, Cheerilee grabbed the filly by the neck and carried her over to the changing table on the other side of the room. Pumpkin rubbed her eyes, she couldn't be seeing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few times where Cup Cake had done something like that to Pound, but not to a big filly like Applebloom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis new world was strange, yet beautiful at the same time.</span></div></div>",

Pumpkin had noticed that some buildings, specifically the restaurants had replaced all of the chairs and tables with high chairs. Pumpkin noticed a unicorn pony sitting in one of the restaurants in a large high chair being served a bottle of milk and a small bowl of what appeared to be baby mush. The pony reached into the bowl without thinking of how dirty he would get and shoved the food into his mouth, giggling at the sight of how dirty was getting. A pony shortly came to clean him up with wipes and soon cleaned up the high chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumpkin had noticed that Scootaloo stopped right in her tracks.

And to see the a group of adults sitting together in a park via a large circle playing a game of chase and duck duck goose despite their thick diapers making them waddle as they ran made her giggle at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey soon reached the quieter parts of town, mostly the suburbs and the little apartments where all of the inhabitants of Ponyville lived. In the middle of this part of town was the library, a place where one of Pinkie's friends lived with a baby dragon.

Pumpkin first noticed that Twilight's room seemed a little bit more like foals room than one who is a grown up, several rows of books seemed to be missing and replaced with foal supplies and posters that screamed education and reading were replaced with crude drawings of several ponies that even she couldn't make out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of the room were scattered toys, several empty bottles and food jars which were stacked on top of a food tray and several foal themed dresses made for the size of a grown up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumpkin had begun to see even more changes to the world as she knew it when she noticed a giant crib sitting in the place of what would usually be a bed made for a grown up. Twilight Sparkle and Spike were sitting inside the crib, surrounding by stuffed toys and toys with a mobile hanging from the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike was lying down in the crib on top of a plain white changing mat, his legs wildly kicked in all directions as Twilight put the finishing touches on his diaper. Using her magic, she taped up the drake and tapped his bottom with her hoof to sign that he was finished. The dragon crawled off the changing mat and picked up a dark green pacifier that was lying beside his pillow and stuffed it into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight levitated the changing mat and placed it outside of the crib, upon looking where it was going to land, she noticed Scootaloo and Pumpkin standing in the middle of the room. Scootaloo seemed to be interested in one of the toys that was on the ground whilst Pumpkin looked at Twilight and Spike with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scootaloo? Pumpkin?\" Twilight smiled. \"How nice to see you both.\" She climbed out of the crib and waddled over to the duo, wearing a thick purple diaper with the image of the royal crest on the front instead of the usual babyish imagery that Pumpkin noticed on all the other ponies. \"I didn't know you two were in the library. Do any of you need a changie before I put the mat away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumpkin tilted her head at first, confused for why Twilight was speaking like her old self barring some changes in vocabulary. It had been evident that all the other grown ups and children spoke using small words as babyishly as possible. It wasn't a problem for Pumpkin at all, just confusing and somewhat jarring at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked at Scootaloo and rubbed the filly's mane with her hoof and follow her action up with a smile. \"Do you need a changie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...\" Scootaloo didn't know whether to answer or not. Her diaper didn't feel wet, nor did she feel any weight at the back in case she had messed herself. \"Dunno.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight craned her head down and noticed the fillies diaper was now wet, to the point of almost leaking. \"It's a good thing you got here when you did or else you'd have an even bigger accident. We wouldn't want all of your pee-pee leaking out now, wouldn't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo blushed at this information and slowly trotted over to the changing mat. Pumpkin jumped off the fillies back and watched her drop down onto the changing mat, squishing her near-leaking diaper as she sat on the water-proof layer of the mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My goodness.\" Twilight giggled at the filly. \"Somepony has done a big potty in their diaper, haven't they?\" She trotted over to Scootaloo and used her magic to undo the tapes on her diaper, soon the diaper was balled up and Scootaloo's nether regions were cleaned up. The filly raised her backside into the air as a diaper flew underneath her and taped itself around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All done.\" Twilight sang. \"Why aren't you in the daycare, little one?\" Twilight lowered her head and nuzzled the filly. \"Did you escape?\" She cooed, speaking over Scootaloo's giggles. \"Such a smart little foal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumpkin also smiled at this. If it wasn't for her then Scootaloo wouldn't have made it out to begin with, but it was part of the fun and games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big filly! Big filly!\" Scootaloo cheered, before shoving her hoof into her mouth. She was soon levitated into the air and placed into the crib, alongside Spike who was getting comfy by sitting on top of his pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight turned to see Pumpkin sitting on her own, still smiling well after the change had finished. \"Come here, Pumpkin.\" She gestured for the foal to come over.</span></div></div>",

Pumpkin looked down, and sure enough, she had wet herself without even noticing. She smiled, realizing that she was having so much fun with this new world that she didn't even know she needed a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight undid the tapes of the diaper and wiped Pumpkin's nether regions as she repeated the process as she did with Scootaloo. As Pumpkin was being changed, she looked over at Spike and Scootaloo in the crib. Scootaloo was hugging a stuffed rabbit while Spike dazed off, suckling on his pacifier. Pumpkin was glad her magic also affected non-ponies. A baby dragon not being allowed to be a baby? That was just silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go Pumpkin, a clean diaper for you to go potty in.\" Twilight chirped, nuzzling the foal. She turned around to levitate her pacifier into her mouth, and Pumpkin noticed her diaper was wet and messy. Pumpkin giggled. Looks like she wasn't the only one who needed her diaper changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Twilight began to suckle her pacifier, Scootaloo was getting a bit reckless, aggressively chewing on the rabbit's ear as Spike joined in. She looked up to see Pumpkin in a fresh diaper and spat out the rabbit. \"Play!\" She yelled excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you like to play, filly?\" Twilight smiled through her pacifier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to see Dashie!\" Scootaloo beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Dashie should just be finishing her nap.\"  Twilight mused as she sat down, squishing her messy diaper as she did so. \"What do you think, Pumpkin?\" She titled her head at the foal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering her word was final, Pumpkin decided to go to...</span></div></div>",

Pumpkin didn't realize that her magic also extended to other creatures besides the regular ponies, it seemed that Spike was also affected by the magic and too wore a diaper, suckled on a pacifier and from the looks of it, had a ton of drool escape the pacifier's sides and hang on the edge of his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight soon closed the crib's door and looked at the three foals, Pumpkin being the only one to even acknowledge her as the other two were playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stay right there.\" Twilight giggled. Her horn began to glow and a nearby pacifier began to float over to her mouth, she grabbed the nipple and began to suckle on it. She soon waddled over to the door and left the room, unaware that her diaper was both wet and messy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumpkin climbed over the sheets and the pillows to continue watching Scootaloo and Spike play with an oversized plush bunny, Scootaloo leaned forward and wrapped her hooves around the plush and embraced it into a big hug. Spike on the other hand spat out his pacifier and laid his teeth into the back at the bunny and teethed on the bunny's tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But the fact that it's been a good ten minutes and Twilight still hasn't returned, Pumpkin was going to be very kind and not use her magical powers to open up crib doors to let her and her new friends out to explore the rest of the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe Twilight had gone into another room and changed her own diaper? After all, it was full. But could a grown up, now turned adult foal take so long? It seemed likely but strange for such a smart pony, even if she now acquired the intellect of a three year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumpkin didn't pay attention to the other foals in the crib but found her peaceful thoughts were soon snapped by a loud bang. It seemed that Spike had crawled over to the foal and slammed his toy pirate ship into a nearby pillow, causing several pieces to break apart and end up under the blankets. Pumpkin giggled at the toy's destruction and moved closer to the wooden bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to the bedroom soon slowly opened, causing a smile to appear on Pumpkin's face, Twilight Sparkle soon entered the room with a brand new diaper and the same pacifier she stuck in her mouth. This time, she wore a bib around her neck and a little piece of velvet which was attached to the bib encase the pacifier were to fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.\" Twilight spat out of her pacifier and waved at the three foals in the crib, Scootaloo and Spike soon turned to see the former librarian enter the room with a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the foals, besides Pumpkin stopped what they were doing and soon toddled over to the crib bars. Spike even stuck his claws through the bars and tried to reach for his caretaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look who came to visit!\" Twilight trotted further into the room and pointed a hoof back at the door, the door opened a little more to reveal...</span></div></div>",
