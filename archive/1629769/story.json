Don\u2019t believe me?\u201d said Emma as she gave me an odd look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you check that folder of yours\u201d said Emma as she looked at the folder that I was holding. I opened the folder and to my shock, it was there. \u201cThere you see\u201d she said as she patted me on mine left shoulder as she left.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I asked as I noticed some sort of strangeness around me. \u201cJoe! The boss wants to see you in her office\u201d said Emma as she looked at me. I went off into the boss\u2019s office and sat down on a chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoe\u2026I\u2019m sorry but I have to let you go\u201d said Gina, the boss as she sat on her seat all high and mighty. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d I said as I didn\u2019t believe what I just heard. \u201cLike I said I have to let you go due to downsizing\u201d she answered. Just then, I felt the ground below me disappear. <br>\r\n\u201cRight then, I believe its best that you should leave now\u201d Gina said as she stood up and showed me out of the office. As I stood up and walked pass her, the two of us noticed that something was odd but shook it off. I went to my desk and began to pack my things. \u201cHay what happen\u2026Joe?\u201d asked Emma as she looked at me and saw that I was packing my things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been fired Emma\u2026god! What else can go wrong?\u201d I said as I picked up a box with my things inside. \u201cOh the company are gonna miss you\u201d said Emma as she hugged me. \u201cThank you, well then, goodbye, hope to see you around sometime\u201d I said as I walked out of the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked out to the car park and put my things in my car, got in and began to drive my way home. As I was driving, I felt like taking a detour home so I took the long way by along the seafront. As I was driving, I noticed that it was getting really dark as night was beginning to fall. I also noticed that there was hardly anyone else driving along the road; I looked out at the sea and began to see something strange. <br>\r\nOut in the far distance, something was shining throughout the darkness and it was growing bigger and bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped the car, got out and tried to get a better look the object that he could see. The shiny object was getting even bigger and was beginning to give off a colour which I could make it out as a dark green. I was beginning to panic as the green object slowly turned into what I could tell was lightning but it was coloured green. The lightning was heading towards me as I suddenly headed towards my car but before I could get in I was struck by the green lightning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t tell what happened next as I found it very hard to breathe then moments later everything went black.<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s been; it could have been hours or days but I heard something,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, sir?\u201d said a female voice. I woke up with my eyes still closed. \u201cHuh? Wha\u2026where am I?\u201d I asked as I opened my eyes and found myself back in my car at the seafront. \u201cYou\u2019re at the seafront sir\u201d said the woman again. I looked at the woman and noticed that she\u2019s a policewoman. \u201cOh thanks for waking me\u2026what time is it?\u201d I asked as I looked up at her. The woman looks at her watch and answered, \u201cIts just five minutes past seven\u201d \u201cOh thanks officer, I will go then\u201d I said as I started my car up and began to drive off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck was that thing last night?\u201d I thought as I was driving up to my drive through. I got out and entered my house. As I was wandering around the place, trying work out what I just been through, I noticed something strange about the house, it was like something was out of place. I went upstairs to take a shower and changed into a pair of clean clothes.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAt that moment, I didn\u2019t know that my life would turn upside down as the people I know and love will treat me differently. I first learnt this when I went to speak to Alexis, my girlfriend. </span></div></div>",

I have to revamp my resume, find a new job, but especially, I have to inform my girlfriend on what happened at work today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis: Welcome Home baby, you had a hard day at work?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hated to be the bearer of bad news, but I should always stay truthful to the ones I love<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe: Alexis, I have something to tell you........ I lost my job today apparently from downsizing<br>\r\nAlexis: Oh Baby, come here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis was always a good girl to me. She was beautiful. She's 5'8 with thick long legs, firm booty, and DD breast. A good friend of mine introduced me to her and we have been dating ever since. I was so lucky to have her. She does however like to tease me sometimes on \"little\" things here and there. Alexis walk up to me and hugged me to provide me comfort. I happily took in her embrace<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis: What are we gonna do<br>\r\nJoe: I'll have to start from scratch, till then, we'll have to cut spending a little till I can find another job<br>\r\nAlexis: OK, were are both still young I know you can do it. I'll look for a job myself to help around in the house as well. Times are tough these day.<br>\r\nJoe: I understand<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us kissed and caressed each other. I didn't talk about the storm since I thought it was just my mind playing games on me. I was too depressed to do anything further so I simply rested. I have a hard time ahead of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n__2 weeks later__<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis: Joe, your sisters are coming over for Spring Break. They seem to want to stay here for the week<br>\r\nJoe: Alright<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis walk over to the table where Joe was using the computer to look at companies to apply for. He has applied toward several jobs without having one call back yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis: How's the job hunt going?<br>\r\nJoe: Not so good, I'm starting to get frustrated with no responses<br>\r\nAlexis: Aw, Its okay my little Joey you'll get something soon with your education.<br>\r\nJoe: You know I hate it when you call me Little Joey<br>\r\nAlexis: Ha, as long as your an inch shorter than me, I'm gonna call you pipsqueak for as long as I want \"giggle\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt a little depraved when she said that. I always did like taller girls, but not when they make me feel small. All of a sudden I felt a high vibration in my ears as if I had an Ipod turn up in my ears. The ringing hurt my ears. I closed my eyes and ears from the vibration. After the ringing stop I I somehow reheard the conversation in my ears that made me confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis: how's the job hunt going?<br>\r\nJoe: What? I just said its bad with no responses<br>\r\nAlexis:Sorry, I must not have heard you. its okay little Joe, You'll find something soon<br>\r\nJoe: You know I hate it when you call me that, stop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stand up frustrated by her words, but when she stood back up, I opened my mouth at what I just saw. I had to look twice to see if it was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis Ha, as long as your 4 inches shorter than me , I'm gonna call you pipsqueak for as long as I want \"giggle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe: What the F****<br>\r\nAlexis: Oh Joe, I'm just teasing, I actually have a surprise for you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood there confused out of my mind. Why is she this tall? We always were eye to eye mainly, and both of us are wearing just house shoes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe:Your taller than me Alexis!<br>\r\nAlexis: Yea Joe, I've always been taller that you, ever since we met that first night<br>\r\nJoe: What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to sit for a second. Maybe sitting down and thinking would get my mind together. Last time I checked I was only an inch shorter.(She must be playing with me, I'll just go along with it). As I calmed I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe: You said u had a surprised?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis: Oh, yeah Guess what Joe I ---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I kissed her out of joy, causing her to blush a bit. \"Now I just need to find one for myself.\" I said, a little saddened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry pipsqueak, I'm sure you'll find one soon.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexis...\" I moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember, you're 4 inches shorter than me. If you do ever outgrow me, that is when I'll stop, but that's not going to happen.\" She said with another giggle.

If you do ever outgrow me, that is when I'll stop, but that's not going to happen.\" 6 inches?! That would put her close to seven feet tall at that point. I was 6'2\", something was up.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking around the room I found that everything seems more than a little off.  The ceiling seemed just a bit higher, the couch a mite longer, and the chair I had been sitting in had its cushion up to the middle of my thigh instead of my knees as usual.  As if that weren't enough to clue me in Alexis stood in front of me with a stern look on her face.  I knew she was 5'8\", she loved teasing me about it, but how could that explain me looking at her chin right now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joe?  Hello, Earth to Joe?\" she called, and snapped her fingers sharply above my head.  I dropped out of my daydreaming and looked her in the eyes, letting her know she had my full attention.  \"You know, maybe if you put half the effort into looking for a job as you did staring off into space you'd probably have another one by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on babe, you know I'm trying my hardest,\" I explained, though ringing in my ears drowned out my own voice by the end.  \"My resume is tight and all my references are good, but these days people can look you up online so easily.  I mean, you're six inches taller than me, and it can be rough for a 5'2\" guy on the job market.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six inches?  Five foot two?  Have you been engaging in a bit of wishful thinking?\" Alexis said while she suppressed a laugh.  \"Try eight inches, pipsqueak, you barely even break the five foot barrier.\"  Again the ringing turned up, and Alexis said the same thing again with some slight differences.  \"Try ten inches, pipsqueak, you haven't quite broken the five foot barrier.  Should we go get the measuring tape and find out if your dreams have come true though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood there, mouth agape, and looked up at Alexis as she shot higher in the sky.  No, she wasn't growing, I thought, I must be getting smaller.  But I remembered being taller just a few minutes ago, didn't I?  After a moment's thought I reached a decision.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Sure, let's get measured,\" I agreed.  \"I feel like I've been making a lot of personal growth lately, and my height might have shot up to match.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure,\" Alexis chortled.  \"Maybe if you put some of that personal growth towards getting a job instead of imagining that you're wearing lifts you'd have one by now.\"  The ringing returned, and I did my best to shake it off while following Alexis to the nearest doorway, a tape measure in one of her hands and a pencil in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go first,\" she announced, and stood rail straight against the doorway.  Carefully she placed the pencil atop her head and made a hashmark on the wood, then stepped away.  She pulled out a length of the tape measure, locked it at 6', and held one end to the floor.  \"See?  5'8\" just like always,\" she proclaimed.  \"Your turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI strode over to where she had been standing and took the same spot, back as straight as possible.  Alexis, pencil in hand, stood right in front of me, and I looked up at her.  \"Look straight ahead, big guy,\" she said.  \"I don't want to accidentally mark you too tall.\"  I obeyed and looked forward, moderately surprised to see that the collar of her shirt beckoned down at me.  Gingerly Alexis placed a hand atop my head and scratched a mark on the wall, then lightly pushed me away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?  I'm a foot taller than you, just like it's always been,\" she proclaimed.  A foot?  That would mean I was 4'8\" now!  \"As usual, I'm right and you're wrong, you should be used to that by now.\"  The ringing crept into my ears again, and when it subsided Alexis announced the measurement again.  \"See?  Four and a half feet!  I told you, just as tiny as ever.\"  Alexis beamed with pride and went on, her voice barely audible over the ringing.  \"I know you have your heart set on five feet, pipsqueak, but you have eight inches to go and you're getting a bit old for a growth spurt that big.  Maybe you should just cave in and call the circus, I heard they've been looking for a new midget.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis giggled, and I looked at the tape measure still fully extended.  The mark she had made for me wasn't at the 4'8\" line anymore - it was down at 4' even.  She bent down in front of you, putting her face right in front of yours.  \"Aww, don't be mad,\" she said.  \"You know I'm just teasing, and I know you like it.\"  She gave me a quick kiss on the forehead and stood up to her full height.  Whereas maybe ten minutes before she was an inch taller than me if that, now I was about eye level with her navel.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked past her to see a clock, having not really been aware of the time, and said...</span></div></div>",

Weightlessly, I fell forward, face first into Alexis's soft stomach.  I held back tears and huffed loudly, trying to stop my body's visceral reaction to the absurdity surrounding me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon honey, it's okay, I was just kidding.\" Alexis's arms immediately wrapped around my head, burying it into her navel.  \"I'm surprised you're taking it so hard, you're usually excited when I tease you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right, I used to love her playful torts.  I wanted so hard to tell her what was happening to me, but whatever it was seemed to be rewriting history.  My entire paper trail, at that very moment, probably listed my height at 4 feet even, and if I started to flip out about it, I'd probably end up in an asylum.  Until I could figure out a way to stop it, I'd have to keep it all a secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reluctantly pulled my head away.  \"Oh, no, it's not you Alex, I guess I'm just shaken up over the whole job situation.  Come on, let's go lay down cuddle a bit, it'll take my mind off of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis smiled and ruffled my hair, \"Whatever you say, Joey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing after that freak accident truly reassured me, but being cuddled up against Alexis came close.  Her arms stretched around me and pulled me into her soft breasts.  The rising and falling of her breath gently rocked my head, and for a moment I honestly felt like I could get some good rest, but the apprehension swirling in my mind refused to allow me to let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis had already fallen asleep.  I nestled closer to her warm body.  Would she still find me attractive like this?  She had given me a kiss before we had laid down.  Was it as passionate as last night's?  If nothing is changing about the world except my size, then her love for me should stay the same right?  Then again, she had been treating me more diminutively since the storm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Jesus, Alexis, please don't abandon me...I need you...' I hadn't meant to say the words out loud, but they came out in a broken whisper regardless.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis moaned in her sleep and tightened her grip around me.  Hopefully I was just being silly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...</span></div></div>",

You remember what that's like, don't you?  Or has it been so long since you've worked that you've forgotten about things like being a responsible adult?\"  I cringed at her last sentence, though I could barely hear it over the ringing.  This was probably going to cost me a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wrapped my arms around Alexis's legs and looked up at her pleadingly.  \"Come on, just one night?  It won't be too bad, and I want to spend some time with you before you go off and become some big-shot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis smiled down at me and ruffled my hair.  \"Oh, all right,\" she said.  \"I guess if you're the size of a child you're going to act like one sometimes too.  She walked over to the couch and laid down, then patted the cushion where she wanted me to sit.  As soon as I did she wrapped her arms around me and pulled me close, making me feel small against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea popped into my head, as it was clear neither of us was really paying attention to what was on.  \"Alexis, do you remember how we first met?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do, it was so funny I don't think I'll ever forget.  You were walking around looking lost, so I leaned down in front of you and asked you where your mom was.  You said you didn't need her, but if I wanted to take you home I could.  I'd never been asked out by a three foot tall mouse of a man before, so I went along with it.\"  There was a slight buzzing, and she reiterated, \"I'd never been asked out by someone three feet shorter than me, so I figured why not?\"  She kissed the top of my head and continued, \"At first I just thought it'd be a funny story for my friends, but you've always been so sweet I can't say I have any regrets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat, so she had three feet on me now.  At this rate I'd be a bug by the end of the week, and what then?  Alexis always hated bugs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe show ended and she pushed me off the couch, then stood up herself.  \"Come on, that's enough for me,\" she said.  \"You should come too, I don't remember where your step stool is for the bed.\"  She walked toward the bedroom and I followed, looking up at her butt shaking back and forth as she walked.  Once in the bedroom she picked me up and put me on the covers, then crawled under herself, wrapped her arms around me and fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

I had slept for seven hours, but I still felt completely dead.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to me, Alexis's arms and legs stretched out to what, at my new size, seemed like a terrifying size.  I had been with Alexis for a long time, but now the entire world felt foreign, like the expanding limbs under the blanket with me were from some sort of alien creature, much less my girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, her familiar form popped out from under the blanket all the same, and she lazily padded her way over to the bathroom, mumbling her good mornings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI listened her to wash her face and brush her teeth, wrapping the extra blankets around me tightly.  Her footsteps filled my ears moments later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, look at you, you're like a bite-sized burrito under there.\" Alexis cooed, which was followed by another ringing in my ears.  The blankets felt just a touch heavier suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm going to stay in bed for a bit longer, my head hurts a lot.\" I groaned, which wasn't entirely untrue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you think that's best, Joe.  Just don't hurt yourself when you get out of bed.\"  Alexis gave me a quick peck on the forehead and then continued her morning rituals.  I dozed in and out of sleep, only awoken in full when her heels clicked loudly on her way out the door.  \"Feel better, champ.  I'll see you tonight.  And maybe return some of those emails, we could use the money.\" She said, before clicking and clacking down the stairs and out of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChamp?  Emails?  What in the world was Alexis talking about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laid in bed for a brief while longer, before the buzzing questions in my head proved that sleep was no longer an option.  To buffet my fall I threw the pillows onto the floor before hopping out of bed and wandering though my now enormous bedroom looking for my laptop.  Finding it on the floor, next to Alexis's desk, I popped it open to check my emails, finding that the inbox was a great deal fuller than it used to be.  The first message caught my eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Subject: Mr. Enron, please consider appearing on our local show.\"  It was from a local television studio which filmed a popular morning show.  Why the hell would they want me on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Mr. Enron,\" The email read, \"Given your status as the shortest American, we would love to interview you on AMD Morning Hot Shots.  Please contact us at...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortest...American?  No.  Fucking.  Way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy tiny fingers, spread out like a child's at a grand piano, flew over the keyboard, searching for confirmation.  Wikipedia's article on shortest people held true to the email.  There I was, listed at the bottom, far from the shortest person in the world, but short enough to be mentioned: 'Joe Enron, Shortest American, 29 inches. No interviews ever given.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this kept up, I would eventually become the shortest man on Earth, and then keep smashing through barriers.  Would history keep rewriting itself like this?  How would the world rationalize if I was ant sized?  Would I be a medical marvel?  Would I be Alexis's little bug boyfriend?  Or would history and memory rewrite themselves so that I was never known, just a pest living in Alexis's house?  If it could make her remember a past that never occurred, could it make her remember a past without me at all?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore importantly, would my actions bow affect the way this weird reaction worked later?  If I went on that talk-show and gained some modicum of fame, would it be harder to be rewritten as never existing?  </span></div></div>",

So, she said that she was six inches taller, so then, I realized, that I shrunk three inches to 5'11\" and she gained two, where before she was 6'3\" now at 6'5\". But... Why did she think it was always like that? Maybe... It was that storm! Yes, that is the only reasonable cause to this. I wanted to tell her, but then I realized, what difference would it make? Everything was already set in motion, so all I could do was get use to the fact that I would be shrinking and my girlfriend would be growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">--1 week later--</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been a week now since the whole ordeal.

I watched her as she left in her car, she said she would be helping pay for my house as well, her job was a good paying job, which was good for both of us. As she drove off into the distance, I headed back inside, sitting on my couch, wanting to do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't know what to do at the moment. The whole shrinking and growing thing was on my mind, was it only her that would shrink me and grow herself? Or could this happen with other people as well? I got up, trying to think of something to do. I decided I would just get out of the house, walk around a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided just to walk around my neighborhood. Nothing to event full was happening, some people where outside on their lawn, while other were inside or away. As I was walking, I wasn't paying attention and ran into someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry shorty.\" I headed a female voice from above, looking up, I saw it was a very tall girl. Naturally tall, at 6'6\" maybe, looming over my now 5'11\" body. \"I didn't see you there, be careful not to get crushed.\" She said as she walked off. Suddenly, the ringing in my ears was back. I tightly shut my eyes, waiting for the ringing to die off. After it had subsided, I open my eyes, seeing that the ground was closer now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter seeing this, my eyes widened as I quickly headed home. As I entered my house, I got a pencil and measuring tape and went to the bedroom. Standing back to the wall, I made a mark where my current height was, then using the tape, I measured it. To my horror, I found my new height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"5'7\"..\" Was all I could say, I had lost 4 inches just from that comment,mad I could guess she grew four inches, now around 6'10\". Why was I caring for her height? It's not like I would see her again... As I left the room, I realized that some things would soon be out of my reach. So I got my wallet and headed to the store to buy a stepstool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got to the store and got my stool, a three step, as I know I would soon need it. As I got to the register, the lady saw it and asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I little on the short side, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I guess.\" I said not wanting to be rude. And just as predicted, the ringing was back, after closing and reopening my eyes, I had shrunk again. I quickly got my stool and headed back home, where I promptly measured my self again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"5'5\" Was what my new height was.</span></div></div>",

I know it's inevitable that I will still shrink. I could always just stay in the house and not shrink any more, but I needed to get out. I decided I would visit one of my friends, something to just pass the time. So I headed out towards my friends, as I reached her house, I knocked on the door, waiting for her to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and I saw Meagan. Meagan was a kind woman, we had been friends for a few yeas now. She was somewhat short, being only 5'3\", even though I was shrunk, I was still taller by only two inches. But I had a feeling that it would not last for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey shorty.\" She said while she gave me a hug, that was new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I now shorty?\" I asked, though I already knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, because I'm almost as tall as you, and, well, I'm short, that's why.\" She said with a smile on her face. That's when the ringing was back,as I closed my eyes and reheard the conversation. \"Well, because I'm as tall as you, and, well, I'm short, that's why.\" I opened my eyes, and I found that I was now looking eye to eye with Meagan, where as I was looking down a bit at her. I guess she grew an inch while I shrunk one, now making both of us 5'4\". Only I was just a bit taller though, I guessed it was my shoes, they boosted my height a bit, while she was wearing flip flops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well come on in shorty.\" She said happily while heading back in. The ringing was back and as it subsided, I saw everything was bigger again, I had no idea how much I shrunk. But I'm sure I would soon find out, as now Meagan <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meagan, how much taller are you again.\" She turned around, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"4 inches, remember?\" 4?!\" That would mean I'm now 5'2\" while she is 5'6\"!  I had now shrunk A whole foot while a bunch of women had gained a few inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry, just forgot for a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine shorty.\" She said, causing me to shrink again while she grew. I can only guess that I'm 5' now while she is 5'8\". And the height difference was only going to keep increasing I figure.</span></div></div>",

I had only realized that her and my clothes had been keeping up with the growth and shrinkage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their good, still haven't found a job.\" I said. I tried to just pretend this wasn't happening, the size changing. I just pretended its normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As, don't worry shorty, I'm sure you'll find one, especially one for your height.\" She joked, but those two jabs shrink and grew us dramatically. I was maybe now 4'6\" and she was 6'2\", if this kept up, she would soon be taller than that 6'10\" girl. We continued talking, she called me shorty every now and then, atleast the size change wasn't so bad anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, I decided I took enough. I said my goodbyes and she said hers as I left. I could only guess I'm probably below 4 feet, but I'm not to sure. Meagan was around 6'8\" now. As I got home, I quickly measured myself. I found my new height to be 4'1\", meaning Meagan was now 6'7\". I sighed to myself, I don't like this. But it was something I was going to have to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got my self dinner, having to use the stepstool to get the plates and ate. As I went to bed, something felt strange, it wasn't the fact that the bed was now huge compared to me, no. It was something else. I soon found out yesterday as I ran into another girl.</span></div></div>",

Maybe I don't need to be called short directly  in order to shrink. Atleast I was still human sized, but that wasn't the strange feeling. I decided I needed to try and walk of the feeling. I quickly got dress, which it seems all my clothes had kept up with my shrinking body, which was good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I got out and began to walk, I noticed my neighbor was out walking as well. Rachel was a cute girl, we quickly became friends when she moved in. She was wearing a sweater, pants and ballerina flats, which where her favorite kind of shoes. She was short, tall compared to me now, but only at 4'3\". Now I was even looking up to the shortest of my friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed me, she waved and I waved back. She then made her way towards me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey pipsqueak!\" She said while giving me a hug, having to bend down a little in order to do so. Now even she was calling me short. But, as she was hugging me, it felt as though her body rubbed agisnt mine, as of she was moving upwards. I didn't hear any ringing though. As she stopped the embrace, I saw that she had grown, but I had not shrunk. She seemed to be 4'5 now. Maybe that what the feeling was, now the girls would grow, but I stopped shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was happy, but then I realized that I would soon be towered over by girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So shorty, what are you doing out here? Taking a small walk?\" She said with a giggle as she rose up half a foot, now 4'11\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I am.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if I join you on this small walk, shorty? I promise I'll walk slow so you can catch up.\" Her barrage of friendly insults kept growing her. Easily becoming 5'9\", this was going to be a long day. We continued to walk, with her making fun of my height every ow and then, only adding to her own. But the time we were done walking, she was at a towering 7'4\" putting me eye level with her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed to go, she bent down to give me a massive hug, picking me up even! As she put me down, she called me shorty again, making her 7'7\". She then left, leaving me alone again.</span></div></div>",
