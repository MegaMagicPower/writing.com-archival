Well no one knew she could talk with animals except the animals. She never told anyone. Because they probably would't believe her and think she was kind crazy. If they did believe her they would maybe think she was some kind of freak.<br>\r\nShe just finished filling the bowls with food for the animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go. Lunchtime everyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh could I perhaps have a bit more?\" Russel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Russel why do you want more. This is what I normally give you since I started working here. Why do you suddenly want more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... It's my instinct.\" Russel said. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I thought you instinct was to curl to a ball.\" Blythe said and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's only when I'm in danger.\" Russel said. \"We hedgehogs hibernate. Much animals that hibernate try to gain some weight around now so they have something to live on while they are asleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Russel, you have a owner. During the winter you're warm inside a house. You don't have to hibernate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. But it's just my instinct to eat more to gain some weight.around now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful Russel or else you get fat. You can better stay slim. Humans also try to stay slender.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that?\" Minka asked excited like always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well slender people are beautiful.\" Blythe said. \u00cft's also more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure about that?\" Minka asked. \"Don't people think fat girls look good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't think so. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinka fast jumped to a high place in the pet store and returned with two magazines.<br>\r\nMinka fast looked through them and opened both of them on a page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I once go those magazines. They're full of paintings from famous painters! I wanted to look through them to improve my art but I also found those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlythe looked. One painting was from Rubens with a painting of a fat Lady. The other paintings were from Bortero where all man, woman, kids and even animals looked obese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems like humans like fat girls.\" Minka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minka this was painted over a century ago.\" Russel said pointing at the painting of Rubens. \"Back then people perhaps thought different about fat people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But those paintings are still famous!\" Minka said excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlythe started thinking. Those painting still were famous. Could it be that people like fat girls. Or was Russel right and did they only liked fat girls in the past. Or did some people liked fat girls. Perhaps. She never thought of that. The people in those paintings did't looked bad. After all they were world famous.<br>\r\nShe even started thinking: was she perhaps too thin. Would she look better if she was fat. She never thought of that but why not?  Perhaps she did look better fat.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

'How am I going pretend being FAT?' she thought to herself. she starts to feel tired. Blythe takes out her headphones she yawns and she falls asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlythe wakes up an hour later she then gets an ides how she'll pretend being FAT, she starts to get all the pillows in the appartment and brings them to her room, Blythe changes into her sweat pants and a large hoodie, she starts to stuff the pillows in her clothes making sure that she put the pillows in the rigt  positions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlythe waddles to her full lentght mirror to check herslf out</span></div></div>",

If I say yes there's a chance I will stay fat. Perhaps that does look good but suppose if I change my mind. I heard gaining weight is easy but losing it is a lot harder. So if I do this... it's probably forever. I need to think carefull about this. Just like getting married... or getting kids. Those things are forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked outside. So many different people. All shapes and sizes. Slender, normal, chubby, fat. However some people said that in the future many people would be obese. Obesity seemed to be a growing epidemic. <br>\r\nBlythe thought a moment about that picture from Rubens. Why would't people like fat girls? This looked pretty good. But stuffed with pillow's was of course a lot different from the real thing. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well I don't have to become obese right now. I can of course first just get a small jelly belly. Make my belly just a bit bigger and see how that turns out and if I like it I can still make it bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stretched herself once, and thought about what to do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well first I have to return all the pillows back to their rightful places.\" Blythe mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled the pillows out of her clothes and then she...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had the end of it resting on his stomach to keep it in balance while he was checking things of from it. \"Has he always been this <i>chubby</i>?\" Penny Ling asked herself, and that's when she started to remember something from her past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was small her parents had told her that it was traditions for panda females to get together with the panda male that had the biggest belly since it was a sign on good status. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell happen to be a hedgehog but if he got a big enough gut her parents wouldn't probably mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that in mind Penny Ling thought about what she should do now. Should she tell him about how she feels about him and ask him to gain weight for her, or should she keep it secret for now and try to extra feed him without him noticing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich one should she choose?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a couple minutes of weighing the two options, she decided that she'd try to fatten him secretly. She'd tell him when the time was right. She didn't want to chance it by flat out asking him if he'd get fat for her! What if he was against the idea? He'd never gain if she forced the topic! But how would she feed him without him knowing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day at lunch, Blythe had layed all of their bowls full of pet chow on the ground for them to dig in. Penny Ling eyed her bowl. She was hungry, but she was going to sacrifice her food to a good cause. Once Russell was done eating, she'd say she wasn't hungry and ask him to eat it. It was the perfect plan!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced to her left. Russell's bowl was placed right next to hers today. What luck! When Russell approached, marking off a couple checkboxes before setting his clipboard down to eat, Penny Ling watched him. He ate as any other hedgehog would. One, maybe two pieces of kibble at a time. But she couldn't help herself in enjoying the view of Russell eating. She imagined him getting larger as he ate. Getting cute, chubby cheeks, thick appendages, a round butt, and most of all, a big belly for her to snuggle up against.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snapped out of it when she saw that he'd finished his food. Now was the time to put her plan into action!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Russell?\" She asked in her soft, sweet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Penny Ling?\" Russell responded attentively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not very hungry today. Would you mind eating my food so it doesn't go to waste?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell was feeling awfully full. He'd had his required amount of necessary nutrition for a hedgehog at lunch. But he couldn't stand to see any kibble be left behind. It was wasteful and - Russell shuddered at the thought of the word - <b>unclean!</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would hate to see it uneaten...absolutely. I'll eat it\" Russell decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made his way over to her bowl. It was much larger because pandas needed more food naturally. He wasn't sure if he'd be able to finish it, but he'd have to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began eating again. It was slow, but steady work as he made a small dent in the amount of food. He was stuffed to the brim, but he felt that he had to keep eating. He'd always had some excess weight on him, but he wasn't like Zoe or any of the other pets. He was never needed for anything that required him to look good. Aside from that one pet photography thing and Blythe's fashion shows, he could look however he wanted. So he was ok with eating \"that extra donut\" every once in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis, however, was too much for him. His already chubby belly was beginning to bulge outwards unnaturally. It was being filled with food. It was almost like he was force feeding himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe eventually finished off the entire bowl. He stood up and saw the aftermath of his binge. His taught gut was protruding and was tight with its capacity being tested. H4 would have to ignore it. There was organising to do in the shop. But it desperately needed some sort of relief from this discomfort. Which should he do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Trying to get his mind of from his complaining gut Russell decided to do his daily morning report (That he always did after having breakfast at the pet shop.), but when he was trying to pick up his clipboard he found himself stopping halfway down. At first he didn't get why it was happening, but looking at himself he could see that it was his well filled belly that was in the way. He had to instead bend over to the side and pick it up with only one hand to get his clipboard. \"Huh, I have never seemed to have <i>this</i> much difficulties picking something up.\" Russell thought casually as he held it in front of his face and started his daily inspection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked around the pet shop, checking things out, and putting little marks on the empty spaces on his list, Russell couldn't help but feel like his inspection was being a bit more <i>difficult</i> to do. What he didn't seem to realize (Or maybe being to much into his work to notice) was that the increased size on his stomach made his whole walk cycle much more staggering. His tiny feet had trouble trying to keep everything balanced while still walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking on as he waddled around Penny Ling thought that his walking reminded her of young panda males that they too also had slight problems walking with their bodies not being full grown yet. \"He's starting to become a real panda male more and more.\" Penny Ling thought happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting everything checked up Russell was to have a quick meeting with the rest of the group to tell them how things where. Luckily for him everybody seemed to be hanging together right now (Saving him the trouble of gathering them all to one place), and all he had to do was to get their attention. He started doing a slight \"cough, cough\" to get their attention, but the only one that seemed to be looking at him was Penny Ling. (Mainly because she had been doing nothing but that all day.) He decided to take a deep breath and cough even louder, but right as he was about to cough he could feel a great air pressure build up inside of him. And before he knew what was happening he let out a huge \"BUUUURRRPPP!!!\", and <b>that</b> got their attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, nice one dude.\" Vinnie the gecko said, while the others tried to keep themselves from laughing at Russell. He wanted to have their attention, but not like this. Nonetheless they where all looking at him now, so he should just get it over with. \"As you all know I have been once again taking on the very important task of making sure that every single item in our daycare center is still under the same perfect quality as we are suppose to have \"hiccup\". Russell said while suddenly getting a nasty hiccup that interrupted him. \"It must have come from that embarrassing burp I just had.\" He though, as he decided to continue like nothing had happen. \"If we start by looking at out food supply we can see that there seems to be a slight bit missing \"hiccup\". \"And looking at our pet toys everything seems to still be whole and in once piece \"hiccup\". \"Finally I have to tell that Blythe is in school today and will be coming back around 15:30 \"hiccup\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was really frustrated how this hiccups never seemed to stop and how it was interrupting him every time he tried to speak. Looking at his friends he saw that they once again seemed to be almost laughing out loud at him, but why? He suddenly got another hiccup and at that moment they all started to burst out with small laughter's. Even Penny Ling couldn't help but giggle a little at it, whatever it was. He could see Vinnie pointing finger at him while laughing, or more exactly at his middle. Looking down Russell got another hiccup and saw how it caused his saggy gut to jiggle for a moment. Realizing that it had been doing so every single time he had hiccupped during his talk made Russell feel <u>really</u> embarrassed. Feeling that he was getting to embarrassed for himself to handle Russell called the meeting over, and ran of to be alone. While the others still fun it funny over the show that Russell had been giving them, Penny Ling started to regret what she had done and felt sorry for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt that she should do something that would make him feel better, but what? She could either go and try talk to him, trying to comfort him. Or maybe she should just try and feed him some more food, but she know that he's very smart so she had to trick him in another way to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should she choose?</span></div></div>",

If she told him yes, that would hurt his feelings more. If she told him no, that would be lying to him. And she adjusts felt awful about lying to anybody.

Every square inch was going to be loved by her. And soon, there'd be more to love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, it was dinner time at the pet shop. As usual, everybody congregated where the good was and began eating happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell had just finished putting away some comedy props Pepper had left on the floor and he was oddly hungry.

It needed to be relieved of its discomfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe plopped onto his backside and laid his paws on it. Surprisingly, it seemed to loosen fairly quickly. It was less taught and more soft. \"Maybe,\" he thought, \"my unusually excessive meal caused my nerves to send messages to my brain warning it to digest faster otherwise, it could be potentially harder to work it off later.

Russell decided to continue reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>While the other looks so thin as stars in the sky, you are filled with so much mass.<br>\r\nI makes you more interesting, more powerful, and more...</i>HOT?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up again quickly he could see Penny Ling still looking only at him, but now he could swear that before looking up she had been having her focus on his middle more then his face. He was also sure that she had moved even closer to him then last time he had checked. He started to feel a bit sweaty reading this, but he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>But still, no matter how wonderfully round you are you can still become bigger.<br>\r\nAnd there would be nothing else that I would love to do more then to make that happen.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he felt one of Penny Ling's paws touch his more then normally round stomach, but before he could tell her to take it of from him she started to rub it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that happen Russell got <b>really</b> torn about what to do. Penny Ling was clearly right now touching him in what was for him \"a very private spot\", and he would very clearly ask her to stop this instance. That is if what was happening to him didn't feel <u>sooooooooooooo</u> good. Her belly rubbing was so amazing and relaxing, and he could feel how he was just melting down into the park bench they where sitting on. He still had some parts left of the letter to read, but this was also happening very sudden and he might want to have time thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do?</span></div></div>",

He didn't want to risk hurting Penny Ling's feeling and making her cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to his surprise she didn't seem to cry, she just sat there all quiet. And just as Russell was about to lean over and ask her how she felt, she suddenly looked at him and shouted \"NO!!!\" at him angrily. She had been doing so much work getting to tell him her true feeling, and showing him just how much more beautiful he would look with extra weight to be turned down now. He was <u>HER</u> dream guy, and she was <b>NOT</b> going to let him leave her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Penny Ling?\" Russell asked, sounding really scared now. As the panda girl stood up on the park bench and looked down on her overweight lover, Russell could first now feel how all of those extra pounds he had been gaining this day was really weighing him down into his seat. \"You are my greatest love,\" Penny Ling said, with tears starting to form into her eyes.\" \"And I don't want anything more then for us to be together and for me to feed you, and massage your big belly.\" She then reached down and started rubbing his belly with one of her arms, to which Russell both felt comforting and terrifying given the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew he had to get out of this and get help, so when Penny Ling for a moment took her hand away from his belly he took his chance to escape. Before Penny Ling understand what was happening Russell took off and jumped of the bench. He wasn't prepared on how fast he would be falling, and when he hit the ground he did it with his stomach first. It did damp his fall, but also gave him very bad stomach pains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill that was nothing he could think about right now as he had to start running while Penny Ling took her time climbing down the bench, or at least that what he <b>thought</b> would happen! After only getting a couple of meters away from the bench he could hear a loud thud coming from behind. That was the sound of Penny Ling doing what he did and jumped of the bench instead of climbing, but unlike when Russell did it she was much more balanced and landed straight on her feet. Looking behind him he could see her taking off after him, and with great speed! \"Of course! Since she's been having her extra couples of body mass for probably a longer part of her life, she's much more adapted on moving around at a greater speed. Which means that I need to RUN FOR MY LIFE IF I WANT TO GET AWAY!!!\" Russell thought as he once again went from intrigued to scared over the fact that Penny Ling could run around with her fat like it was nothing, while he was almost tumbling over with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that neither he or Penny Ling had much experience of this park lead to him quickly thinking out a plan that simply involved him trying to take as many detours and shortcuts he could in hope to make her momentarily lose sight of him. The only problem with it was that since she was almost able to catch up to him he wouldn't be able to take his next sudden turn without her seeing it. If he took a left turn to a bush and then a right behind a tree she would see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until when he was running through another bush that he accidently feel down into a ditch next to a river bridge that he saw a chance of hiding for real. Moving much more quickly then he had managed before Russell crawled under the bridge and kept still. He could hear the sounds of Penny Ling emerges from the same place he had, and he hoped she instead would see the bridge and just assume he had crossed it and follow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould that happen, and would Russell be safe?</span></div></div>",

So he stood, stiff and unmoved, waiting her her next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny Ling still had a determined look on her face. And it looked like she was going to do whatever she had in mind no matter what. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what Russell was wondering the most was why the cotton candy was so massive. He didn't even know cotton candy came in such large proportions. It was easily larger than Penny Ling and himself combined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You turned me down!\" She said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Penny Ling, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be quiet!\" she interrupted his protests, \"You <i><b>WILL</b></i> be my adorable, rounded Russell! And I'll do anything to make it happen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny Ling ran to him in a frenzy. He tried to take off the other direction to run away, but was again tripped up by his weight. He landed hard on his stomach and face, but that wasn't what he was worried about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny Ling was stressing above him in no time. Russell looked up at her, seeing her silhouette against the sun. She grabbed a huge piece out of the cotton candy, ripping it from the rest. Then without ado, she shoved the handful into Russell's unknowing mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt tasted sweet, but that wasn't going to make him like it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swallowed it, although he didn't want to. He, being a smart hedgehog, figured out her plan fairly quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was going to force feed him and make him fat whether he liked it or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny Ling grabbed handful after handful of the fluffy confectionary. She then proceeded to stuff it in Russell's little muzzle. There was no pause in between swallowing and another piece getting shoved in his maw. He groaned with discomfort, but not because of the feeding. It was because if the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis already plump frame was getting a bigger paunch than before. He felt it pushing against the ground uncomfortably. It was so taught, that compressing it on the ground by laying down on his stomach wasn't a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was getting a little food baby in his stuffed gut. It wasn't too visible from his laying position, but from his audible pained noises, Penny Ling knew it was working. So she sped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Russell was just taking every hurt causing bite because he wasn't in the position to resist. His stomach was protesting loudly from being too full. He felt like he was going to just pop from being too full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny Ling knew it would soon turn into fat, as back in her days as a wild panda (before she got rescued), she saw alpha male pandas stuffing others until they were utterly massive, and in turn, immobile. It would turn into fat any moment now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell's gut was ready to blow, one more swallow and he was sure his stomach's walls wouldn't be able to take the filling of its capacity. But then, he felt an explosive BWOOMPH behind him. He blushed madly, his cheeks becoming beet red from embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny Ling stopped her feeding to revel I'm the adorable, embarrassed look on his face. But then she realized why. She giggled, fueling his embarrassment more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe contents of his stomach had turned to jiggly, wobbly, bouncy fat. But it spread to one place in particular...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell had a huge rear. Suddenly, it had grown from non-existent to absolutely gigantic. His blubbering bubble butt bounced and bounded. It was now easily bigger than all of Penny Ling, his tail becoming hidden in the mass of flab. The two massive, orange domes of quaking fat were quite the eye candy. And Penny Ling was eating it up. He was truly beginning her glutton.</span></div></div>",

His stomach and chest was now puffing out a couple of inches, and he looked like he had about 20 extra pounds on his frame. His limbs and head had also signs of extra weight, but nothing was as clear as how his Hawaiian shirt was sitting really tight around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other thing that had changed drastically was the pet shop itself, or rather the playroom for the pets. Without Russell to look after everything things quickly became unorganized, and then a total mess. At first the other pets where just happy to get to do whatever they wanted, but after only a few days of having a hard time to find their favourite toys, and clean food and water bowls they weren't as happy anymore. They actually started to miss the way things where when Russell was in charge, and after a week like this they have had enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling that they needed to talk to him the remaining six of the main pets went over to talk to Russell. He was still sleeping on his bean bag, and they could see how his big stomach was rising and lowering as he was breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Hello Russell?\" Pepper asked carefully, before Vinnie shouted \"Hey! Russell dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other pets first thought Vinnie was being to loud, but Russell seemed to think it was nice enough wakeup call so they let that slide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes? What did you want?\" Russell asked, rubbing his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We came here to say that we regret asking you to change yourself.\" Vinnie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that without your organisations skills the whole pet shop have become a huge mess.\" Pepper added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if I'm not mistaken you two where the one that said I should <i>Let loose some</i> and <i>Become more fun</i>. Russell said, making Pepper and Vinnie regret a bit what they had said earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But can you come back and make everything be put back in order again?\" Pepper asked, having the rest of the pets backing her up pleading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I kinda like living like this.\" Russell said and stretched his arms backwards, almost causing the buttons of his shirt to pop off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No please!\" Pepper begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more fun Russell! Give us back the old Russell!\" Vinnie plead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you get back <i>old</i> Russell...\" Russell said while getting of his bean bag and walking up to them, \"When he never left you in the first place!\" He then said and ripped of his shirt and pulled out his clipboard and pencil from behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So wait, you just pretended to be fun Russell all this time?\" Vinnie asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely my friend.\" Russell said calmly. \"I knew that if I simply <i>pretended</i> to be this character during a long enough time, it would easier make you all understand just how much we actually need rules and orders to make a society like ours work.\" Russell was explaining, while the rest of the pets where getting bored by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's say this instead.\" Vinnie interrupted. \"If we all try to not make a mess of stuff we don't have to listen to Russell telling us all this. Does that sound good?\" He asked, and had the other 5 pets agreeing with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they went of to start cleaning up their own mess Russell just accepted the fact that they had all learnt their lesson in their own little way. \"But in the big whole of it everything seems to be back at normal now...\" Russell thought until a he heard a small \"Bump\". Looking down he saw that the sound was his clipboard hitting his fatted belly. \"Oh, right. That.\" Russell thought as he realized he had still gained those extra pounds during his \"lazy\" week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problems. No problems.\" He thought, \"I can just lose these as quickly as I got them.\" but it wouldn't be as easy as he thought since...</span></div></div>",

He was drinking just as much as before, and his weight didn't go down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had gotten used to the feel of a snug Hawaiian button down shirt around his wide torso. So, he found where he'd taken it off and put it back on. He felt odd without it, so feeling the tight fabric was pleasant to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another day of relaxing after that, this time, without the book. For some reason, relaxation was now activity enough for Russell. Downing his party drinks kept him occupied, which didn't exactly help his weight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week later...</span></div></div>",

A lazy person would do nothing but eating junk food and play video games, he on the other hand used his time to read very insightful books and drinking his party drinks that while having a small amount of sugar wouldn't hurt him as long as he walked about 20 minutes a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's what Russell had missed. It didn't matter if he planned the most brain training of readings and held himself to the least \"deadliest\" of the \"poisons\", if he didn't do any kind of physical activities he would still end up continuing gaining weight, which he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe extra weight was mostly being stored into his midsection, but he even spotted a few extra chins and even his arms and legs could be considered a bit more \"chunky\". One of the more clear signs on his weight gain has to be the Hawaiian shirt he's still wearing getting even more tight around his body. Being also that hedgehogs has it very natural to gain extra weight for hibernation Russell just felt that this was just even more relaxing and pleasant for him, just packing himself up for winter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomebody that wasn't as happy with the progress of things where the other pets in the pet shop. This wasn't how they remembered their friend to be, and while he might have been a bit strict and rule bound before, he just felt so \"gone\" now just reading his books and never even looking at the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I really can't help but getting worried that your friend over there is slowly disappearing from us.\" Zoe said worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding he? As much as he has grown he's easier to spot then ever!\" Pepper joked, but quickly saw that nobody found it funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pepper is right. Russell used to sometimes run all around the pet shop even more then I did to inspect that everything was like it should be, but now he looks vey soft.\" Minka added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I think he looks kinda cute this way.\" Penny Ling said, before seeing everyone looking at her and her comment. \"Did I say that one out loud?\" Penny Ling asked, blushing a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To quote our dear friend Buttecream <i>anywho</i>, what shall we do about our friend Russell?\" Zoe said, trying to get back on track with their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe out answers lays in how to properly express a fitting solution that could satisfy both sides.\" Sunil said, making all the other pets speechless for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, that was some very large words coming from you Sunil.\" Vinnie pointed out, with the other pets agreeing to it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well since Russell hasn't been well...<u>Russell</u> for a long time I thought that the most proper thing to do is to let somebody here take on the role of becoming the new Russell, and I think that that role would fit me pretty well.\" Sunil explained, to which Vinnie quickly replied \"And why shall you have that? I can talk just like that if I want to. Watch! By analysing the data found in the sub-particles of the terrains gravitations field we can concluded that the substance of the samples are not radioactive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vinnie you just can't quote Star Trek and think that you just know the words they are saying!\" Sunil said, irritated by Vinnie's failed attempt to sound smart. \"And you know you words?!\" Vinnie said back, getting really up close to Sunil until Zoe separated the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we all focus on what's most important right now?\" She asked, and pointed towards the small mountain that was their friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Sunil and Vinnie agreed that she was right, and all six of them made their way to Russell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce closer to him they could see just how much bigger he had grown since last week. He was easily three times his normal weight, and his stomach now didn't only work as a bookrest but also as  table to put the book on when he felt for a nap. Right now he was just reading so it was much easier to get his attention this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, Hello Russell.\" Zoe said, sounding unsure of ha to say after that. \"Yes?\" Russell asked, looking up from his book for a moment. \"We where just being a bit worried about your new lifestyle.\" Pepper said. \"And that you barley walk around.\" Minka added. \"Or used your clipboard and pencil.\" Penny Ling said, holding said clipboard and pencil in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To put it simple for you we think that you might have become a bit more <i>soft</i> then what we remember you being.\" Zoe said. Russell thought for a moment before asking. \"Haven't we have this conversation last week?\" \"Yes, and you said you where going to stop with your act and go back to your old self.\" Zoe said back. \"And that's what I have done.\" Russell said, patting his stomach to show (Mostly in denial) how he was back at his former, only slightly chubby self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you have barley changed.\" Pepper said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might even be <b>bigger</b> then before!\" Minka added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that you doesn't look good like that.\" Penny Ling half said before getting shy once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I'm really that far off I suggest you give me some sort of proof to it.\" Russell said, in a demanding tone, and just at that moment...</span></div></div>",

Instead, it crashed against the wall opposite him and fell to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that proof enough for you?\" Vinnie asked smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell have him a glare, putting up a front that he was mad at that comment to hide how evidently true it was. He didn't think he'd gained that much. I mean, he was still in his bean bag chair. Yeah! That was a good argument!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm clearly not THAT big considering I'm still able to fit on my bean bag chair,\" he counteracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe goes around back to check. Behind him, there was only a sea of butt. His huge, orange, round rear seemed to have completely enveloped the whole been bag his entire fat body used to fit on. \"Sweetie,.I'm afraid that's not the case\" she began, \"it seems your...derriere is now replacing it with two bean bags.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Russell called out, the sudden burst of voice making yet another button pop, wizzing right by Sunil, making him scream and duck out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed shows under his orange cheeks indicating embarrassment. Vinnie laughs, \"Haha! Oh man! You've popped two whole buttons, you fatty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, instant karma came about, a third button popping leaving only one left. But that button hit Vinnie square on the forehead. \"Ow!\" He called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you finally believe that you're fat?\" Pepper asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I've out on one or two pounds of excess adipose...\" Russell admitted, still not recognizing his whale like body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One or two? You're a blob, man!\" Vinnie called out, getting back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell figured out that if he were to exhale quickly, the last button would probably hit him again, so he did so, and it did. Perfect shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't think so. What if I'm happy here, with my nice drink and little umbrella? And soft been bag chair to sit on\" Russell said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think that bean bag chair is the thing that's soft\" Sunil commented, walking around to see Russell's new, big butt for himself. He poked a gelatinous cheek curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell blushed, madly embarrassed that another guy just touched his rear. \"Hey!

The place also had a reception desk, and the chinchillas took and hide under it while thinking out a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So like, where are we suppose to go to find him?\" Cashmere asked, in way that really made her sound like her owner.

What kind of way would be the perfect one to completely humiliate this fashion modelling wannabe?\" Velvet asked her sister, who still looked as clueless as ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me give you a clue.\" She said before pointing her paw to all the food related things filling up the three level high trolley. \"It has something to do with food.\" She added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCashmere really looked like she was getting something out of it. Her face was making grimacing, she made grumpy noises of her struggles to think hard, and when she finally looked like she was about to get it she said \"I have no idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter face palming herself Velvet decided to be as clear as possible. \"We are going to feed the hedgehog as much of all this food as possible so that he can't even fit the clothes he's suppose to wear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I get it now.\" Cashmere said after few second of imagine it in front of her.

From small little cookies and candies, to triangle shaped sandwiches, to some fruits and berries. \"And he also said that there was even more under the sheet.\" Blythe thought, as she a hard time knowing what Russell would like out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlythe looked over at Russell to ask him if there was anything special he would want to eat, but as she did so she was treated to the saddest, most begging eyes of any pet she had ever seen. Russell's hunger pain had just gone to the next level and he just wanted to eat something, it didn't matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this Blythe turned back to the guy and said \"I think I keep the whole trolley for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy was first a bit surprised by the little girl's request, and seeing this Blythe added \"He wont eat it all. You can just come back later and take away everything he didn't eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy just accepted Blythe's offer and leaved the trolley in the room as he left. Seeing how incredibly starving her hedgehog friend was Blythe took a cheese and ham sandwich, and was about to feed him when Phoebe (Mona Autumn's overly stressed assistance) suddenly entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blythe! I need you quickly!\" She said in her typical stressful and nervous manners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Blythe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Mona. She did some last minute changes to the photo shot, and need you to go through those changes with her.\" Phoebe quickly answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what changes is that?\" Blythe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bunch of stuff. The lighting's for the shot, the theme for the clothes, how many different outfits to show. I can also give you a written list if you need to.\" Phoebe said, and pulled out a five foot long list of the changes that Phoebe had made for the act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I need to have Russell with me for this?\" Blythe asked, seeing that it would be very bad for Russell to sit in a meeting for so long without having to eat anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no pets. This thing is something only you is needed for.\" Phoebe quickly answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could this wait for a moment? I need to feed Russell.\" Blythe pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Sorry. We need to go now.\" Phoebe said, and took Blythe arm and started dragging her out the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlythe put the sandwich back on the trolley and said to Russell \"Can you take care of your own feeding?\" Russell simply answered back with a nod, and seeing that Blythe took and cooperated with Phoebe as they both went out door and closed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Russell was all by himself with more food then he could ever dream of, that he would be able to have all for himself. Or at least that's what he thought before suddenly the two chinchillas jumped out from under the cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you two?!\" Russell asked, being very surprised by the sudden company he now had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we? We are Cash...\" Cashmere said before her twin sister stopped her and took over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are just two young Chinchilla girls, that wanted to have a chance to meet a real pet fashion icon in real life.\" She said, while acting like a stereotypical \"valley girl\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well I'm sure Blythe doesn't mind me having a little company in my loge.\" Russell said, feeling like a really hot model, even having his own groupies getting into his loge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Russell was still taking in the fact that he might be that popular, Cashmere leant over to Velvet to ask \"Why are you like, acting so strange?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm acting the way I do because if he thinks he's a real ladies man, he will be much more easier to manipulate.\" Velvet explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I see.\" Cashmere said, before she decided to walk over Russell to try it out herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would you like if we two took and like, stuffed you so much so you couldn't even move afterwards?\" Cashmere asked, sounding even more \"stupid\" then her sister had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me what?\" Russell asked confused, and Velvet was quick in trying to save the plan from failing from Cashmere's lack of subtlety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What my sister means is that an attractive hedgehog like yourself shouldn't need to have to do simple stuff like picking up the food to eat, when he can have two loving fans to do it for him?\" She said, truing to sound and act as flirty as possible for him. (Doing things like stroking him stomach with her paw.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis whole thing really started to make Russell feel very \"light-headed\", and he could only see logic in everything she said. \"Of course I should let you two do it for me, when you want it so much.\" He said, starting to like more and more where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. You just lay down in your big comfy sofa, and we will serve you greatly.\" Velvet said, winking at Russell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting himself comfy Russell took and saw how the two Chinchillas very quickly climbed up the side of the trolley and came down with the food that was on the top floor. \"Good thing they where here. I don't know how I would have done to reach that.\" Russell thought, as his food as arriving to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of the Trolley was like mentioned before Cookies, Candies, Sandwiches, Fruits, and Berries. And the two Chinchilla twins decided to start with the fruits and berries to warm up the hedgehog's appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you please open your mouth so we can feed you?\" Both Chinchillas asked in harmony. (Almost sounding like a hypnotic rant from two sirens.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing lost in their lovely voices Russell took and left his mouth hanging open, making it easy for Cashmere and Velvet to stuff it with Blueberries, Strawberries, Grapes, and even a few pieces of Apples and Bananas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce nothing more could be filled started to work on chewing and swallow his food. This proved to be slightly difficulty (Given how much he had been taking into himself at the same time.), but after a few powerful chews Russell had managed to make some of it soft enough to send it down to his stomach. And once that was done he could chew and swallow the rest of it much easier. As for the next rounds of fruits and berries (Which this time consisted of pineapple and melon slices, and Raspberries and cherries.) he simply asked to get feed smaller portions at a time and then he could get it all down with no problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the juicy start of his feast, the twin Chinchillas started to hand over the triangle shaped sandwiches. These things where a bit bigger then the slices of fruits he had earlier, (One sandwich being about the size of a whole apple.) but he could still feel his stomach having some empty room left so he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese sandwiches where even more tastier then the fruit from before, coming in tastes like...\"Olives and Salad\", \"Eggs and Caviar\", \"Cheese and Ham\" and so on. As he ate the space in his stomach was quickly starting to get filled. He knew that as a hedgehog he was able to keep himself stuffed with lots of food in order for hibernation to winter, but since he was a pet he had never been in need to prepare himself for that and therefore never really tried to reach his limits, until now. Looking down he could start to see his stomach grow out a few inches as he was finishing down another sandwich. \"I might have to reconsider going on a diet after this.\" He thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he had gulped down all the sandwiches there was, there was only the small cookies and candy left for him. \"Good thing too, cause I start to feel like I have reached my limits.\" Russell thought, as he clutched his stomach that was now standing out one or two feet. Since the cookies and candies was much smaller then the sandwiches it went down with little problems, but for as long as it went on the more painful his stomach felt. \"Good thing this is almost over.\" He thought as he got the last candy pieces feed to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it was all eaten he once again held tightly onto his very stuffed gut, and started rubbing it to make it feel better. Suddenly he felt a shadow covering his light, and looking up he saw that it was the two Chinchillas looking down on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much for everything you've done for me, but I think I need to rest now.\" He said as nicely as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me your feeling finished already?\" Velvet said, pretending to sound chocked over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now when we have only started.\" Cashmere added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Started?\" Russell asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. There is more food waiting for you under the sheet of the trolley.\" Velvet said, pointing towards the food treasure that it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much, much more.\" Cashmere said, trying to sound really dramatic like her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell didn't know what to do right now. On one hand he had these two beautiful ladies wanting to hand feed him everything he wants, but on the other he felt like he wouldn't be able to eat much more. There was only so much he could take before it would start to hurt for real, but seeing their pleading eyes was also pretty hard to ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would Russell say to them?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Their charm got the better of him as he said \"Can I have some more please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing quick to the point Cashmere and Velvet went over to the Trolley, and seeing that everything from the top floor was taken they decided to start going for the \"Bigger stuff\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see what's await under here?\" Velvet said as she reached under and pulled out a plate with spaghetti and meatballs, and Cashmere pulled out a bowl of tomato soup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of these things where much larger then anything he had been eating before, and Russell felt that he wouldn't barley be able to eat even one of those things. Yet they both also where still very warm and smelled absolutely wonderful. Having to say no to them would be such a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong, my dear?\" Velvet asked Russell, who forgot that he had lost himself in his thoughts for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine. I just...I just don't know if I can take it all in. It is a lot after all.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But who said you need to eat everything? You can just settle with one bite.\" Velvet said, making Cashmere confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One bite? But weren't we trying to make him really stuffed?...\" She asked before getting a angry look from her sister to tell her to be quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a plan for that.\" She whispered to her twin before going back to Russell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I could take one bite of that Spaghetti and Meatballs dish.\" Russell said, licking his lips in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give me a few seconds.\" Velvet said, and turned her back to Russell to \"fix\" her dish up a little. Once she was done she turned back, but now with the loose end of a piece of spaghetti in her paw. \"I thought that you could just put this one in your mouth, and then just slurp the whole part of it in. Doing that wont require you to chew once.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell had to agree that just slurping up and swallow one small piece of spaghetti would work well as a way to taste it, and it wouldn't be any problem having some small room left for it in his stomach. But what he hadn't counted on was that Velvet (while having her back turned against him) had taken and knotted all the pieces of spaghetti into one long string. He was going to take it all in, one way or another. (Plus she had also tied around the meatballs.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the small end of spaghetti into his mouth, Russell started to slurp it down. He wasn't doing anything but swallowing, but the thing was touching his tongue as it went down his throat, so he had some chances to taste it. \"Small but satisfying.\" He thought as he swallowed, and swallowed, and swallowed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until he had been swallowing for 20 seconds straight when he thought that something wasn't right. Looking down he could see what looked like a long rope of pasta with no clear end in sight. He wanted to just pull it out of his mouth, but given how much had already been taking in by him that would be an impossibility. He just had admit that he was tricked and had to finish it, whether he liked it or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he swallowed he felt that it wasn't all bad. It was after all just spaghetti. He was pretty stuffed, but he could probably fit that in too without any problems. That's when he felt something larger then a spaghetti straw entering his mouth. It turned out to be one of the meatballs. It was very big, and his jaws couldn't move with it blocking up the room. So he had to just swallow it like everything else. Russell could feel it making a huge lump in his neck, (And later how it entered his already bloated stomach.) and he know he had at least 8 more of those to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued this process of swallowing whole spaghetti and meatballs until he had nothing at all left on the plate that it used to be on. Once done he clamed his stomach feeling REALLY full now. It felt painful and was so big and round. It was almost like a hibernation for a decade that he had in there, and there where still something left to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget about your soup.\" Cashmere said delightful, as she walked up to him with the big bowl of soup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe really didn't want to have more but he didn't want to come of as rude either, so when looking at the chinchilla lady all Russell could say was...\"I have no spoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded stupid when he said it, but it made some sense inside his head. You need a spoon to eat soup. No spoon, no soup right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrong! Almost immediately after saying that Velvet gave a whistle, and showed Russell and Cashmere a funnel she had found under the sheet of the trolley. \"Looks like we have found something that could substitute for a spoon.\" She said, in an almost diabolical way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell gulped a little as he now realised he had to even eat the soup. He could try to just simply get up and run away, but being feed so much really made him feel so weak and tired. It was hard even lifting his stubby arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little to no resistance Russell got the funnel shoved into his mouth, and the twin chinchillas both helped out lifting the heavy bowl over their head and aiming for the wide open part of  the funnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open wide, and prepare to eat.\" Cashmere said playfully, before they started poring the dish right into the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was even more of a torture to Russell then the spaghetti one was. The soup itself was tasty to eat (And also very warm relaxing.), but after already feeling like there was almost no room left inside of him this dish here was making sure to fill him up properly. Letting the liquid soup take up those little empty spaces that could be found that no solid food pieces could fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the spaghetti process where he could eat at his own pace, Russell now had to constantly swallow at all time to not risk getting anything of the soup in the wrong throat. He also this time got less of a chance to taste, (given the stress he felt eating.) but from what he did taste it was pretty decent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter three minutes of none stop soup eating the bowl was empty. and Russell was more full then ever. Now his stomach was so round and swell as it could possibly be, and he felt like he could almost explode if he got something more to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please no more.\" He begged his two feeders, who really took their time admiring their work so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say Cashmere? Should we stop or feed him more?\" Velvet asked her sister, who replied \"Well, we have one more level of trolley that we still haven't used yet. So maybe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would happen next?</span></div></div>",

As quickly as they could they ran back to the trolley and hide under the sheet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they got hidden Blythe and the trolley guy returned to the room, only to both stop in shock of what they saw. All over the floor was crumbs from cookies and sandwiches and empty plates and bowls. And also a very, <b>very</b> stuffed hedgehog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Russell?!\" Blythe asked, shocked over seeing her friend in this state. She immediately ran over to comfort him, seeing he wasn't feeling very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blimey!

She hoped that rubbing and massaging his gut would make it feel better, and it seemed to work. Russell started to feel more relaxed, and the hardness of the food inside started to get softer as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who did this to you?\" She asked him, hoping he could answer her. But Russell was very weak from all the eating and he tried to show Blythe by pointing towards the trolley where Cashmere and Velvet was hiding, but as he did the guy in charge of it had started rolling it out, and when Blythe herself turned around to look the trolley had already left the room and the guy had closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Russell, no matter who did this to you it has to wait. What's important now is that we try and do something about <i>this</i>.\" Blythe said, and poked a finger into the very fat belly of Russell, who blushed a little over how much of \"chubby guy\" he was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf they would want this to still work Blythe and Russell knew they needed to think out a plan, and fast.</span></div></div>",

All we needed was a little bit of a female charm, and then we had him eating out of our hands. Literally!\" Velvet said, and laughed a little at her own joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they saw Brittany and Whittany still sitting there with their cell phones, they knew that they just needed to return to their cage to make it look like they had never left in the first place. They rushed in and closed the door, and the sound of them closing it was the first thing that got one of the twins to look away from her phone for a moment. Looking down she just saw their two pets, looking like they where a bit restless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whittany!  Cashmere and Velvet looks a bit bored.\" Brittany said to her sister, that first now also looked up from her cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can understand them. I'm that too.\" She said, sighing over how long time they had been sitting here waiting for their turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry sweeties.

Having these two beautiful things as our pets makes me feel so warm inside.\" Brittany said, sticking in a finger in the cage to feel the chinchillas soft fur.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight at that moment Phoebe came rushing towards them, telling them to come and have their photo shoot now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, finally!\" Brittany said, taking the cage with the chinchillas with her as she and her sister made their way to the photo room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To bad we also have to see Blythe and that hedgehog looking porcupine thing taking the spotlight from the true pet talents.\" Whittany complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can always hope that some kind of accident happens to them on stage. Like if he misses a cue or something.\" Brittany said, while the two chinchillas in the cage where giggling over what they where going to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think there will be much more problems then missing a cue from them.\" Velvet said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the photo shoot Blythe had asked if she and Russell could be after the Biskit twins and their pets, and the photographer seemed okay with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo first up was the Chinchillas, that got a very straight on and simple photo shoot with some very simple outfits. (They where mostly something small to be posted as an article in the paper, and not the main thing.) As they got their pictures taken and their owners getting interviewed, Blythe tried her best to fix the problem with Russell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring their walk here Blythe had done nothing but massaged Russell's food filled middle to ease his pains, and it seemed to have worked great. All the food inside seemed to be digested now, and his stomach felt like it could relaxed now. But it had one bad effect, and that was that all the food had been transformed to fat now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had always been a bit chubby and had a bit of a potbelly, but that used to be it. Now he has three extra chins, thick tights that was constantly touching each other, a big blubbery butt, a couple of man-boobs on his chest, and a belly that was sticking out two feet and hanging down his to his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I suppose to now Blythe? I can't go out there modelling like this!\" Russell said, sounding surprisingly worried about his chances as a model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can try to loosen up <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One last photo girls!\" The cameraman said, as he took a picture of the Biskit twins both holding their chinchilla self in their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, finally.\" Whittany said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's leave now.\" Brittany added, and the both twins where starting to head for the exit door when their pets started to act strangely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brittany, my pet is, like acting crazy here.\" Whittany said, with her sister answering \"Yeah, mine too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at their pets they saw that they where pointing toward the photo set, and then at their owner with pleading eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whittany, I think they want to stay and watch when Blythe and her, thing is doing their photo shoot.\" Brittany said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea why they want that but I guess they also think that Blythe will just fail, and wants us to see when it happens.\" Whittany said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are kinda smart that way Whittany. I suggest we do as they say.\" Brittany said, as they all decided to stand in the background and watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Blythe and Russell, your time now!\" The cameraman said as Blythe came in with a dressed up Russell in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell an outfit that included a green checkered sweater, with a pink and yellow striped scarf, and a pair of purple tights. (The theme for it was 1980s.) And his added weight was really being seen in it. His stomach was being pushed out from the sweater and hanging over the tights, his legs and butt was super detailed in the tight tights, and while Blythe added the scarf on as a way to try and hide his extra chins all it did was to make it even more obvious as it was tighten around his fat neck rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put him down on the set, and I will do the rest.\" The cameraman said, and Blythe had no choice but to leave Russell for his fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he saw the camera lens and the spotlights all having their attention focused on him, Russell could feel more then ever how incredibly fat he looked in these clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...start posing!\" The cameraman said, and Russell knew this was it. The moment of total embarrassment. Even thought he could have just fled the place and just forget it all, some part inside still wanted him to do his best. So against his better judgement Russell tried to do several of the poses he and Blythe had practiced, but he soon found them pretty hard to pull through thanks to his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was striking a pose all he could feel was how the flab from his stomach, jiggling by the sudden movement. And trying to show off his \"Strong backside\" he knew that the camera was only focusing on his wide bottom. But the crown achievement in embarrassment came when Russell was down on his knees to do the picture that would be on the cover for the next issue of the magazine. His stomach fat hanging down was once again a huge focus for attention, and in an effort to try and \"hide\" it Russell tried desperately to pull down the sweater and cover it all. (Even though if didn't even reached over his bellybutton.) The warm lights from the lamps where also starting to make Russell sweat a lot as he tried doing his covering act, only embracing the image of him as a real \"slob of a pet\". And to top it all of when Russell tried to help his sweater reach by bending forward he could he a loud \"RIIIIPPPP!\" coming from behind. Glancing over his back he saw what he sadly hoped not was true, but it was. He had just made his pants burst open from behind. Even though the camera would not be able to see that it still made Russell blush that his butt was so big that it had just broken his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd right in the middle of it all with Russell trying to cover with his sweater, belly flap hanging loose, lots of sweat covering him, eyes looking back at his cracked pants, and blush red cheeks he heard a \"CLICK\" sound, and knew that the cameraman had just made this moment the cover photo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe embarrassment levels knew no limits as Blythe was allowed to now go in and pick him up again. Russell felt like he had just let Blythe down, but more importantly himself down. As they walked towards the door they where both being laughed at by the Biskit Twins and their pets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the problem Blythe? Didn't the clothes fit?\" Brittany said in-between laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you feed him to much before shooting or something?\" Whittany added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have I done Blythe?\" Russell asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Russell, it's not that bad.\" Blythe said, trying to cheer him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it was Blythe! Once that number gets published I will be the biggest laugh in the whole pet world!\" Russell said, and almost started to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow would things end for Russell? Would be victim for the fashion industry, or is there any hope left for him to still shine?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Picture here of how Russell in the pose that becomes the cover of the magazine.)<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://d.facdn.net/art/marx50/1413684138/1413684138.marx50_awdangruss.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://d.facdn.net/art/marx50/1413684138...</a></span></div></div>",

Not only did people love his \"Fat Style\" and all the other pets would want to become as fat as him, but now their own owners were forcing them to join the trend. (Whenever they wanted it or not!) Also given their small sized compared to their human counterparts they could to pretty much nothing to stop their force-feeding from happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the Biskit Twins themselves really didn't like making their pets big for any other reason them to follow \"fashion\", they couldn't know if they where force-feeding them right. \"Whittany.

Well, I did use to wear a Red Cap with a white lightning bolt on.\" Russell said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must have looked really cute with it.\" Penny Ling said, making Russell blush slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" Russell said, wanting to get back to the story.  \"Since it was all so new and strange to me I got pretty nervous, and once that happen I got pretty hungry. So when the sweet Mrs. Twombly said that it was lunch break I of course headed quickly towards the bowls to get something to eat. The food we got that day was probably the same things we get everyday, but having this strange (but kind) woman pouring a whole bowl full of pet food for me felt like the strangest thing yet. I don't know if it was the sheer amount of food in front of me, or that I was allowed to eat as I pleased, or...\" Before getting interrupted again, but no by Penny Ling this time, but Vinnie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, when does he actually start to eat? Or did he just stand there thinking all day back then?\" Vinnie asked. and he got wacked in head with a rubber chicken by Pepper in response, who told him to be quiet and let Russell continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said,\" Russell continued, ignoring what just happen. \"I was so taken by all the food that was put up just for me that I didn't know what I should do. That's when all of you run passed me and started eating your portions like there was no rules on manners at all.\" He could at this point see that most of the pets didn't seem to like what he said of their eating habits. (Except for Penny Ling that was just listening trustfully to him, and Vinnie who was still thinking more about the rubber chicken hit then what Russell was saying.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that there is anything wrong with that of course.\" Russell said, a bit cold sweaty before continuing. \"I on the other hand didn't have that kind of eating in my mind at all, and was just wondering if it would be okay with me also eating like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's when you Vinnie told me that it was completely okay for me to eat in any way I wanted.\" Russell said, looking directly at him while saying this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did? I don't remember that.\" The gecko said confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must have been all of those hit with Pepper's rubber chicken that has made you lose some memory.\" Russell pointed out to his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get me started. She hits for just about anything I say or do. She's so short circuited that way.\" Vinnie said, and got immediately hit again by Pepper, who shouted \"No I'm not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So with Vinnie telling me that everything is fine with me to eat like I want, I completely jumped into the food pile and chowed down like crazy!\" Russell said, barley even believing that he used to eat so wildly as a kid. \"I probably didn't even ate to not be hungry any more. I just ate because I could. I remember getting full and just continuing! I remember crawling into the bowl to get the very last crumbs of snacks! I remember...Wow, I did have a bit on an eating problem back then. No wonder I became so...\" Russell said, before looking at the others, and getting slightly red faced over telling them all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I have said enough for now.\" Russell said, and that's when Penny Ling asked. \"But are you really sure that this was all of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Russell asked back, and Penny Ling answered \"I just think that something that happen from the first day on the Pet Shop to now must have involved some more events then just one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking for a short time Russell did remember a second incident that could have helped with him getting the body he now had, but what was that?</span></div></div>",

When he stood to face her his face was only seeing her chest area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about a whole head shorter then her! (And given their pretty big head that said something.) As he looked up at the panda looking back down at him, Russell felt very, very little by comparing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! My name is Penny Ling. What is yours?\" The Panda female asked him, and suddenly Russell felt that his otherwise huge library that was his brain, was now very short of books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Russell.\" He finally managed to figure out to answer her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Russell. It was nice meeting you, but now I need to learn what all the other pets here has for names.\" Penny Ling said and walked away from Russell, who tried to say something more to her, but he ended up silent again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did I have such problems speaking to her?!\" Russell asked himself. For him it was true mystery to why he couldn't just speak to her like he did to any other pet, and the strange warm feeling inside of him only made it harder for him to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe harder he tried to think, the simpler his thoughts started to become. And in the end he had ended up thinking like he was a caveman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Penny Ling. Big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me also needs to be Big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eating Food makes me little Big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eating much food will make me BIG Big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with that logic Russell decided to head for his food bowl, in order to make himself bigger and therefore give him the courage to face Penny Ling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made his way to his food bowl with the plan to eat as much as he could and get bigger, but he had no plan on what to do when his bowl would be empty. That's when he saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlaced right next to his food bowl stood a huge Pet Food bag, just left in the open. (Apparently Mrs. Twombly had gotten a phone call just when filling up the food bowl, and left the bag standing there.) Seeing it Russell knew that all he needed now was something sharp to open up the bag, and he could start his \"grow spurt\". Looking at his quills on his back Russell knew just what to use to tare a hole in the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breaking off one of his hundreds of quills Russell tore up a hole to the bag (in about face level to him), and then just open wide and let the food pore down his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all started coming down like an avalanche towards him, and he just stayed there and tried catching all of it into his mouth. He thought he could take it, and at first he was right. Just swallowing it all down, and feeling himself growing out from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after some time he started to feel full from it, and when he tried to move away from it he was still taking in a big stream of Pet Food. He wanted to get big, but first now he seemed to realize that this wouldn't help making him any \"Taller\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finally felt to flow pressure get weaker Russell pulled away his mouth, and saw just how much \"Taller\" he had become. His belly had now grown out a whole feet in front of him, and he could in one way become taller, but only if he decided to rest on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was a dumb idea.\" Russell thought as he started to massage the pain in his overfilled stomach.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what did you remember Russell?\" Penny Ling asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up from his memories Russell got reminded that he was suppose to tell his friends another memory, but if he said this one he would have to reveal his true feelings for Penny Ling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh....Remember this one time when I took a small piece of Pet Food Candy, after I already had a pretty big lunch portion.\" Russell quickly lied up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an awkward silence for a short time, before Vinnie said \"Lame.\" about Russell's story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven thought the other pets thought that was an unnecessary comment from Vinnie they too also would like to hear a bit more exited story from Russell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what does Russell say about that?</span></div></div>",

Alone\" Russell said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need to sit down because standing too long is too much exercise for you, fatty?\" Vinnie commented before once again, for the tenth time this week, he got whacked on the head with a rubber chicken from Pepper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" he cried, \"That's not the reason?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, you idiot, he needs to be alone and you should respect that\" Pepper chastised him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He needs to be alone so he doesn't have to talk about how fat he is?\" Vinnie tried again, resulting in another whack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just shut up and let's go\" Pepper grabbed his wrist and dragged him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell went to his favorite bean bag chair, sitting down and beginning to reflect as the rest gave him his space. But Penny Ling walked over for a moment, saying one thing before she left \"When you've had your alone time, I do hope you'll tell more stories. I like hearing about your kid/teen life. Especially on the topic we were on\" and with that, she smiled sweetly and left. Did she mean just general little kid stories? Or...him being fat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever, for now he went back to thinking about that day<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remembered Little Russell was still massaging his overgrown, stuffed gut. Fingers kneading into the tight fullness that was apparent in front of him. But as he did that, Penny Ling once again caught his eye. She had found a place to sit down and was just getting a good look at the pet shop now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell forgot all about how big he was. He began to sweat a bit. Why was that particular pet doing this to him?? He almost forgot his own name earlier! Wait...What was it again?.........Russell! Right. But the name he couldn't stop thinking of was Penny Ling's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found himself walking towards her, shuffling rather as his belly prevented smooth motion in any way. He didn't even know what he'd say to her. How was he going to talk to her if he couldn't plan ahead!? But there he was now. Next to her. Not knowing how to start, his mouth uttered a feeble \"Hi Penny Ling\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Russell. Russell, right?\" she asked reaffirming that she got it correct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis brain was failing him. He just nodded his head \"Yes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, pardon my asking, but did you get...a little bigger since the last time I saw you?\" she asked sweetly, not wanting to offend this future friend of a pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd forgotten about that. \"A little, yeah\" That was such a dumb answer! He needed to kick this conversation in gear! Ask her something about herself! That was a great way to start not awkward conversation. \"So, you're a panda\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep\" she responded, still somehow maintaining a non awkward air to her answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was even dumber! He needed to get out of there, plan up a better conversation and try again tomorrow...or chicken out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am going to go now\" he couldn't be more frustrated at how NOT smooth that was<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok! Bye, Russell\" she waved cutely<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing her say his name made his stomach get all fluttery every time she did so. He waddled away, back to where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat stomavh flutter was unfamiliar to him. Was it hunger? He just ate all that food...But maybe that's what it was<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell thought about it, as an adult, on the bean bag chair. It was from that point on he associated love and Penny Ling with eating and food. Probably how he sustained such a gut in his current state. But he couldn't quite remember what he did after that on that day.</span></div></div>",

(And not a little but a lot!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was snoring so much that his mouth was open really wide for most of the time.

Especially that last part turned out to be more and more difficult to do as time went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was because of the spell from earlier giving it's slow effect. The spell had been reversing how Sunil's body worked so that every time Sunil did something that would burn his calories he wound actually gain them, and vice versa. This had the effect of all Sunil's sweaty running, passing, and kicking was starting to make the changes happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunil's stomach started to expand slightly. The same was happening to his arm, legs, rear, and chest. All of this only helped him get more slower in the game, (with his body becoming more heavier and all.) which only made him try harder to keep up with the other pets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour of playing he was still looking a lot like he started, with a new found small pouch of a stomach being the most obvious change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the question is, does he notice the changes happening on his body?</span></div></div>",

(That is in Mongoose pounds and not human pounds.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing he had to be quick so the other wouldn't see him in this ridiculous shape Sunil took and waved his magic wand and said another chant to make the spell work. \"Good bye forever belly.\" He thought as he casted the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again there was a small lightning burst from the wand, and a small explosion with smoke when the spell was cast. After clearing the smoke around him Sunil looked down, expecting to see his problems (Like his extra weight) gone. But what he saw the exact opposite!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only was his belly fat there, but there was even more of it now! (It had gone from 10 to 20 extra pounds!) And not only that, but he could also see and feel that both his hips and butt had now also outgrown slightly. And if that wasn't enough, by just staying still long enough Sunil could actually see how the fat in his body was increasing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I can fix this before the others finds out!\" Sunil thought, when he suddenly heard a voice from a distance. \"Sunil are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! That second blast must have alerted the others about me! What do I do? What do I do?!\" Sunil thought in pure fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had two options.

He could just simply had said that he had forgot the hat, but for some reason he instead said. \"I was...freezing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody looked strangely at the covered Sunil, and Russell was the one to say \"But it isn't so cold inside here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well, that's because...\" Sunil said as he felt his panic growing bigger and bigger inside of him. \"I lowered the temperature in the room slightly, but then regret it. But by then I was already freezing so I had to cover myself with my cape.\" Sunil's final explanation finally became said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the pets looked a bit sceptical, but luckily for Sunil Zoe said \"Actually, I too seems to feel that slight cold in the room now when he says it.\" which made the other pets drop their suspicions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like all of our questions are answered now, so I think I will go to do other stuff.\" Sunil said, and started to walk away from the group. (Trying to make his half walk/half running look as natural as possible.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking behind him he saw how the other pets also seemed to return to their normal lifestyles. and he hoped that nobody was suspecting what had actually happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid they?</span></div></div>",

(All in his good way of trying to help Sunil lose his weight.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what Vinnie didn't know was that the original failed spell that Sunil had put up had made his whole metabolism was reversed, and doing exercise was only going to increase his weigh!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the dance was much more sweat given then the soccer Sunil could feel his weight gain like crazy! His flabby belly felt like it was stretching down and getting bigger. His chest was starting to feel much more ticker, and his butt was feeling like it was growing even more outwards from his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking on Pepper could in horror see how her Mongoose friend was turning more and more into a slob the more he and Vinnie danced.

The counter spell finally worked!\" Sunil said, and was jumping up and down of joy. (With his body jiggling a lot because of it.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad that you managed to fix it!\" Pepper said, and hugged him hardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm happy that my best friend is happy!\" Vinnie said, and join in on the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunil and the others where so happy over the moment that it wasn't until Pepper and Vinnie let go and Sunil looked at himself when he noticed that he still had all that extra weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there's also <i>this</i>.\" Sunil said, and poked his fat belly. \"What am I suppose to do to get rid off this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should do some exercise and diets? It would probably only take a week.\" Pepper said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we can be right next to you, and help you in every step.\" Vinnie added, putting his hand on Sunil's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or...Maybe I can use another spell to make myself thin?\" Sunil asked, and he got immediately answered with Pepper and Vinnie both shouting \"NO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just kidding.\" Sunil said and laughed a little, before seeing on Pepper and Vinnie's looks that they didn't took it as a joke. \"Sorry.\" Sunil then said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n............................................................................ ...........................................................<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the following week Sunil went into his hard training. He had Vinnie help him with preparing weights, and building obstacle courses. He was also the one ready to give Sunil encouragement and water when he needed it. Pepper's role was to create Sunil's diet, and watch over him to NOT break it. (Something that Sunil thought Pepper enjoyed doing a little to much, as she seemed to like it when she got to use a big bicycle horn to honk him with every time he was about to not follow it.) Despite all the hard work he was being put through Sunil still was happy, cause he knew that his two friends where pushing him, without ever trying to hurt him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a whole week of constant workouts and diets Sunil could show everyone that he finally had managed to get rid of all that extra fat he had been packing on. (He had even managed to get rid of the small extra pounds he had wanted to loose in the first place.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was admiring his new body Pepper and Vinnie walked up to him, and Pepper asked \"How are you feeling now Sunil?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels great to be this thin now.\" Sunil said, then he had a small pause, and then he also said \"But it feels even more great to know that I have you two friends that always was there to help me when my bad problems only got worse, and to finally help me get back to my normal self again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Sunil:\" Pepper said, and she and Vinnie went up to him and hugged him again. (The only difference this time being that they both managed to reach around his waist this time.)</span></div></div>",

Every time he tried to get her attention she always seemed to just miss that he even was right next to her. He really would want to do anything just so that he could at least have her see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wished someone could help me talk to her!\" Sunil said out into the room, in hope that someone would answer him. And luckily (Or maybe in this case, unluckily.) somebody had heard him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one hearing him was Vinnie the Gecko, Sunil's best friend. And while he always was prepared to help his friend, he could also be a bit of a trickster at times who likes to play jokes on others. And this was one of those times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked up to Sunil from behind him and said \"Hey Sunil.\", making him jump up in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Don't sneak up on me like that.\" Sunil said, not liking surprises like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for that, but I heard your problem and I want to help you.\" Vinnie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? How?\" Sunil asked, filled with joy over the thought of having his problems fixed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this moment Vinnie knew that he could tell Sunil any lie he wanted, and he was going to have much fun with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what heard Pepper say to the other female pets she likes Pet boys that are <b>Big</b>.\" Vinnie said, and Sunil at first didn't get what he meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean when you say big?\" He asked the Gecko, who quickly had a new lie to explain that with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pet's that are big in size. You know, big.\" He said and held his stomach in his hands to show what he meant. \"Haven't you seen the way she has been looking at Russell lately?\" Vinnie added, making a bit of jealousness appear on Sunil's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She did?\" He said, barley able to believe what his friend was telling him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What shall I do so that she will look at me instead of him?\" Sunil asked Vinnie, who calmly answered \"Get bigger then him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how will I do that?\" Sunil asked. (he wasn't know to think a lot for himself when under stress.) Thinking that this was almost to easy Vinnie told him to simply \"Eat. A. Lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you mean I shall get fat?\" Sunil asked. \"Yes. That is the same thing as getting big my friend.\" Vinnie said to him. \"If you get bigger then anyone else you will have nothing to fear, and you will ha no problems talking to Pepper.\" (Vinnie almost thought he should work as some kind of professional encourager, given how good he seemed to be with Sunil.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven thought Vinnie had sounded super confident when he said all this Sunil still wasn't sure. He wanted to dare talk with Pepper, but did he really need to change his body so much for that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he choose?</span></div></div>",

And that's why as soon as you are finished with one bowl and goes to the second, I will fill up the first bowl again.\" Hearing that made Sunil regret a little opening his big mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at Pepper playing with the other female pets Sunil knew he still wanted to do this, and he decided to start eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he eats the first two portions nothing was a problem for Sunil, it wasn't until he started on his third portion when he started to feel like when he had eaten enough. Still having his eyes on the prize (That was Pepper) Sunil continued pushing his limits. At the fourth bowl his belly started feeling a bit hurtful, on the fifth a small lump was starting to be made on his waist, and after a sixth bowl he now had a smaller potbelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunil was starting to feel pretty stuffed now, and was clutching his belly with both arms to try and make it feel better. He didn't want to eat anymore, but he also knew that if he stopped he wouldn't have a chance with Pepper either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what does he do?</span></div></div>",

I've heard you are a Mongoose, but now you should be called a MOONgoose!\" Pepper said before slapping the belly again, and laughing at herself. \"But I think I shall quit now.

I was just trying to be funny, and it sorta backfired, I guess.\" She said, while using her tail to whip his tears away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for crying.

(At this point his belly was so big that it had grown the rope he was tied with to move over and under it.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they made their way on their walk Sunil asked Pepper if Vinnie might actually pop if they leave him like this, and Pepper calmed down his worries saying that if anything would pop it would be the ropes holding him together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Sunil immediately felt more calm, and told Pepper that he had been having some \"Feelings for her\", and that he thought she would like being with him if he had a bit more bulk on him.

So she went to get some food for them. He approached the huge kibble bag they always used to feed the pets. But this time it was empty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that just won't do! This is the only bad we've used to feed them for two and a half seasons-I mean years! I guess we'll just see if we have any other bags lying around in stock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't want to take anything that was for the customers because then she'd lose money. There had to be another bag around there somewhere!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was just about to give up, the last place she checked was where she found one. In the storage cost they hadn't used in years, there was a small bag that had collected dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe checked for an expiration date, but couldn't find one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess this will tide them over until I go out and buy some more!\" She reassured herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only enough in the bag for one pet. She decided she'd give it to Penny Ling because naturally, as the largest, she'd need more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cut it open and poured the contents into Penny Ling's bowl. Then, she left for the provider to buy more pet food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what she didn't see behind the dust on the bag, was that this was extremely fattening kibble.</span></div></div>",

This wasn't going to be easy to say. \"Listen!\" She said, and all the pets stopped to pay attention to her. \"We happen to be short on pet food, and there was only enough food to fill the bowl of Penny Ling. You others have to wait while I'm out buying some more.\" Mrs Twombly said, before taking her purse and leaving the pet shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other pets felt disappointed and irritated that Penny Ling to all the food that was left to herself as they walked away to do other things. Penny Ling know for her kindness and generosity would gladly have shared her food with the others, but the other thing she was known for was that she liked to eat a lot, and that had to do with her having a large appetite. And right now she had a very big hunger inside of her, so all she could think of was to start eating the food that was in her bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat down and shoved the first kibbles into her mouth she felt that the taste was a bit different, but nothing that really bothered her for the moment. She continued eating and could feel as she ate that the kibbles felt more different then the one she was used to. They had a much more \"sugar filled\" and \"fatty\" texture to them. Not that she complained, but it was very different from the much more nutritious kibbles she and the other pets where usually feed with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was about halfway through her portion she could strangely feel like she was already very full. Taking a break from eating she looked down and got shocked by what she saw. After only having been eating a half bowl of food her stomach had grown out half a feet in diameter! It was so round and wide that it looked like if she had been eating two full bowls of food. (Which she had done one time in the past.) \"That's strange, I usually doesn't get that full that quickly.\" Penny Ling thought, while stretching out her hand to feel her belly. \"But I guess that those kibbles where even more filling then I thought...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she had put her hand on her belly she stopped thinking about everything. She had been expecting the skin of her belly to feel hard and taunt because of the food, but what she instead felt was soft and flabby. There wasn't any food inside of her anymore, all of it had been turned into body fat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sudden surprise made Penny Ling scream of shock for a short moment, before she covered her own mouth, not wanting to make a scene. Had she seriously gain so much weight from just half a bowl? Looking down she poked her belly, and shaked it around a little to prove that she wasn't making this up. She then looked over at the still half filled food bowl and wondered what to do. If she had gained so much by only eating half of it, she didn't want to know how big she would get if she ate it all. But she was also feeling a little bit hungry still, but was it worth it when it did such strange things to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will she do.</span></div></div>",

There was nobody else in the store, except the guy behind the counter, and he was just sitting there reading a magazine with headphones on. She smiled wider, before looking down at her massive belly, which protruded at least two feet in front of her. It grumbled with a strong hunger. She patted it with a pudgy paw, promising to get it something filling. Of course, she had no money, but stealing food is ok when you're as hungry as she was, right? Right. She waddled over to a big display box full of donuts. She couldn't quite tell how many there were in there, so she decided she'd just count them as she ate them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne, two, skip a few for the sake of the reader,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSixth-two, she thought as she rolled onto her back and licked her frosting-covered lips. There were Sixty-two sugary, frosted, cream-filled, delicious donuts in that display case. And now they were all in her huge bloated belly. She glanced over to the behind the counter guy, and yep. Still distracted. Good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grunted, and rolled herself up off her back into a standing position, and panted a few times from the effort. She then made her way over to the slushy machine, and put her mouth on the spigot, and turned it on. As she felt the sweet, chilled, sugary liquid run down her throat and into her stomach, she felt it expand slowly as she drank. Filling up like a water balloon. She didnt stop when she got a brainfreeze, and only took her mouth off the spigot when the whole tank of slushy was empty. She sloshed her massive body to the ground, and began to pat and rub her stomach while panting. Her shape could be described as spherical, as her entire body was a big ball of fat with about a two and a half foot radius. Excluding, of course, her big sloshy belly, which protruded three, maybe four feet in front of her now. She was also starting to notice two big squishy fat deposits on her chest, and two more on her backside. Of course, her newfound boobs and butt looked a little small compared to the rest of her. Just to be safe, she looked over to the counter guy and yep, still distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*huff...puff* Hoo boy,\" she said. \"Im pretty huge right now... And I feel a bit tired out for some reason.\" She looked around at all the food left uneaten in the store. She bit her lip in consideration, and felt her five chins bunch up as she thought about it.</span></div></div>",

She placed her large, soft paws on the ground, grunting as she hoisted herself up. She strained under her own weight, lifting one leg and slamming it back down in front of her, her obese nearly spherical body sloshing and wobbling from the force of her stomping foot. Repeating this process, she managed to waddle forwards, her gut gurgling and sloshing all the while, as she made her way up and down the aisles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate <i><b>everything</b></i> in the entire store. It was truly a sight to behold, the sloshy slovenly skunk stomping around, stuffing everything she could get her greedy little paws on down her throat. She would swallow up dozens and dozens of candy bars, of each and every variety. Probably more than a hundred, and definitely more bags of chips than that, ripping them open and pouring them into her waiting mouth with gusto. Her bulging stomach groaned as it churned all those calories she chugged down into pounds and pounds of flab, which only served to make her even rounder, and bigger. She chased all the snacks down with a ton of liters of soda and energy drinks, And all the coffee she could get out of the coffee machine. Good thing too, she needed the energy from the caffein to keep lugging her fatty frame around, as it continued to grow with every indulgent gluttonous bite as she gorged and gorged. As she stomped her way to the last aisle, her body having grown enormously as she had started to sweat from the effort of moving her huge mass, she found to her delight that this was the freezer aisle. Her eyes widened with delight as she licked her lips eagerly, tasting some of the crumbs and chocolate left over from her messy eating, She had become so round that she could barely bend over, but for ice cream she managed, her fat sausage fingers pulling open the door of the freezer. She shoveled cartons of ice cream of every flavor along with like fifty cakes into her muzzle, slurping and snorting all throughout her binge, so wrapped up in her eating that she barely even noticed when she kept growing, and growing, and grew so big that her gigantic fat ass bumped into the shelf behind her. She cringed as she heard the crashing noise of every shelf behind her falling over, crashing into the next one, like a lot of big dominos, so loud it even drowned out the sounds of her own eating. She quickly slurped down the last cake, and wobbled clumsily up to a standing position. She slowly, laboriously turned around, stomping one big fat foot at a time, until she could see the damage. Twenty shelves, once all lined up, now all on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll....empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPepper smirked, rubbing her gargantuan body and letting out a loud, satisfied belch. \"Talk about prop comedy- This new gimmick's a knockout! It'll have everyone on the floor! Man- I should write that down.\" She mused to herself- before remembering something. She turned to look at the counter, her seven chins and soccer ball sized cheeks jiggling from the speed of her head turning. But no, that guy was still just sitting there, back turned, reading with headphones. Now this was getting silly- there's no way he didn't hear that. Pepper stomped over to him, raising her big fattened up footpaws and slamming them on the ground, sloshing her huge ball shaped body side to side as she slowly waddled forwards. She was about as big as a smartcar, except her body was a big orb- just noticeably wider than she was tall, so packed full of food that she looked inflated, aside from some notable outliers which made it clear that it was all just fat, like her soft wobbling chest or bouncing love handles and massive rump, though they were all rounded and bulging in their own right, so they fit cleanly onto her sphere like form. Her footpaws hand grown fatter too, to the point where all of her toes looked like big soft baseballs, and her soles were sweating as much as her armpits, butt crack, and all her folds. Even for a skunk, her body odor was bad- In eating so much and becoming so fat, she'd totally let herself go and had also become a huge slob. Not that she minded- if anything it just gave her more stage presence. Besides, flatulent humor is always funny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe approached the guy at the counter- and he <i>still</i> ignored her! If he didn't hear her, or smell her by now, he should've at least seen her massive rounded dome of a shadow looming over him. That's when she realized why he was so unresponsive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleeping on the job, huh?\" she laughed to herself, shaking her head with a smirk. She wobbled and stomped her way into a closer position- confirming that yes, he was in fact asleep. \"Now that's some bad work ethic- And look where it got him, his whole stock got eaten!\" Pepper licked her lips.  She was so big now, she felt like the only things about her that didn't get fatter were her eyes, nose, mouth, ears, and tail. And those almost looked out of place now, a small normal sized skunk face buried in such huge cheeks and so many sweet sweet chins. Not to mention her tiny little tail next to those gigantic butt cheeks. She looked back at the sleeping guy, smirking to herself. Someone'd have to punish him for doing such a bad job of scaring away thieves...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Minka was having a bit of an \"Art-Struggle\". No matter what she did or tried to do, she wasn't making any kind progress with her art making. In fact, she wasn't making any art at all. Looking at the empty canvas in front of her she thought of the time Sunil had challenged her in a painting challenge, and had ended up with nothing painted at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not turning into Sunil now, right? I can't imagine myself ending up having no more inspiration left!\" Minka though, having a small panic attack inside her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she thought of either put something on the canvas or completely give up, Mrs. Twmobly called \"Lunch Time all pets!\". Suddenly hearing a loud growling sound coming from her stomach Minka realized that she was so busy trying to find her inspiration, that she had forgot to even have something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that she probably would think better if she got some food inside herself, Minka decided to take a break and join the other pets for lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all the other pets had their bowls filled with the usual pet food, Minka found her to be the only one without any. \"Huh, what?\" Minka asked, and turned to Mrs. Twombly for answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Hello little Minka.\" Mrs. Twombly said as Minka walked up to her. \"You are probably wondering where your food is, right?\" She asked the little monkey, that simply nodded back to her. \"Well you see, I actually got a <i>special</i> thing in the deliverance today...\" She said, and  turned around to get something for Minka. \"And I think you will like this.\" She said, and handed over a bunch of bananas to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was anything Minka loved to eat it was bananas, and Mrs. Twmobly knew it. So when she happen to get a bunch of 10 bananas, she knew the little primate would like it. Getting a hold of the bananas Minka hugged it like it was a stuffed teddy bear, and Twombly couldn't help but smile at the sight. \"Your welcomed, my little friend.\" She said, before leaving her to eat in peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time to start Minka immediately started to scale one of them, and fill her mouth with it. Then she chewed a few times, and swallowed the whole contest down. It took two of these routines to take down one banana. After having only 3 she could already feel how it was starting to feel her up, but she wasn't done yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing pretty rare for her to get such treats to eat, Minka wanted to take them all in. No matter how stuffed she would end up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor each banana she ate up she could feel how her midsection was expanding out, and once she was all done she felt like she was carrying a whole lot of baby monkeys. (And she also <b>looked</b> like she was carrying little ones.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill knowing she had \"trying to make art\" to go back to, Minka took and carried her big monkey belly back to her art corner. Once there she dipped a paintbrush and was about to try drawing something when she fell backwards by her huge weight, and got the brush right on her belly. As she grabbed the pencil and dragged it of her body, she got up and looked in the mirror how much damage it had done. That's when she saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paint pattern on her belly looked like the start of a real art piece! And using it on her own expanded body meant even more room for her to paint then what any of the flat canvas could give. It looked more beautiful then anything else she had done before, and she needed to try to do more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding her true inspiration now Minka immediately started drawing even more things on her food filled belly. Once she had covered every inch of her well rounded middle with paint Minka had one of the pets take pictures of her with Blythe's phone. (She had asked Blythe for permission first of course.) Once the picture was taken she washed all the paint of her, just so she could draw something else on it, that she could take a picture of, and so on, and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing this for while Mink started to get very tired, and decided to take a \"quick rest\". This quick rest turned out to become several hours of sleeping, and when she finally woke up she found out that...</span></div></div>",

So yes, I forgive you for eating my food while I was sleeping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you so much Minka. You really let a huge weight of my back.\" Russell said, and patted is his well feed belly before walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did an idea formed inside Minka's head, and that idea was.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

(Not that she could any way since she was in school.) And while the other pets seemed to have funny things to do, these two dudes where just hanging alone. It wasn't until an idea popped inside Vinnie's mind when things started to get interesting. He loved his idea so much that he just had to tell Sunil immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sunil!\" He said excited. \"What is it?\" Sunil asked, sounding as bored as can be. \"I know something really funny we can do.\" Vinnie said. \"And what's that?\" Sunil asked, sounding more interested this time. \"We should do a series of small challenges against each other...\" Vinnie started. \"Yes?\" Sunil asked curiously. \"And the one that loses a challenge...\" \"Yes?!\" Sunil asked really excited now. \"Have to eat an extra bowl of their pet food!\" Vinnie finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe expected to hear Sunil say something like \"You are a genius Vinnie!\", but all he got was a confused \"What?\". \"Don't you understand?\" Vinnie asked Sunil, who only responded by shaking his head from side from side. \"The looser...Has to eat...An extra bowl...of food.\" Vinnie said, trying to be as clear as possible when saying it. \"But what's the punishment in that?\" Sunil asked, \"If anything all it would do it to pack on a few extra pounds on our frames.\" \"EXACTLY!\" Sunil said loudly, almost making Sunil fall over by surprise. \"So you're saying that it's either the honour of winning,\" Sunil started, \"or getting fat? Yes.\" Vinnie finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't get what's the point of it.\" Sunil said, \"And I don't think I want to be a part of it.\" He started walking away until he heard Vinnie say. \"In that case I win on walk-over. Chicken.\" That made Sunil stop dead in his tracks. He really didn't like when somebody called him \"chicken\". Just as Vinnie wanted Sunil was walking back to him, and first when he was up close face to face to him he said \"Bring. It. On.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me se if I had understand this now.\" Sunil said. \"We both do a challenge, where the one lose has to eat an extra portion of their regular food portion, and then directly after that one has to choose the new challenge both pets has to do?\" \"That about right.\" Vinnie said. \"Can the one how has to eat take a moment to rest before the next game?\" Sunil asked. \"Nope. No resting in his hardcore fight.\" Vinnie said, making Sunil have some doubts that he quickly tossed aside. \"Then so it will be.\" Sunil said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you got the idea for this, I'll let you pick first challenge.\" Sunil said to Vinnie, who started immediately to think out something good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what will their first challenge be?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"A burp contest!\" Vinnie finally said. \"A burp contest?\" Sunil said a bit surprised. \"Yeah. One burp. One chance. If you blew it, you lose. Simple as that.\" Vinnie said, trying to make it sound like a really awesome thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only got one question.\" Sunil said. \"And what's that?\" Vinnie asked. \"Is it the one burping loudest, or the one hold his burp out for longest that win?\" Sunil asked. \"Loudest. When it comes to burps, the volume is always the most important. You can easily hold out a burp longer the small you make the sound, so the louder the better.\" Vinnie said, sounding like he was an expert on how burps and competing with them works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One last question.\" Sunil said. \"Oh, what now?\" Vinnie asked, starting to get a bit annoyed over Sunil asking so many questions. \"How are we suppose to make that loud burps? It's not like I can make myself do it on demand.\" Sunil asked. \"No problems bro. I just so happen to have exactly what we need to fix it right here.\" Vinnie said as he dragged Sunil with him to another room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And voila!\" Vinnie said as he unwrapped a drape that was covering something big. Under it Sunil saw two big bottles of soda. Each one carrying half a gallon of its bubbly consistence. \"Have you been keeping those hidden for a long time?\" Sunil asked. \"I planned on using them when we where having a horror movie marathon night, but I think they will come to good use now.\" Vinnie said. Sunil walked over and placed his hand on one of the big bottles. \"And how much of these are we suppose to drink? Are we going to share one half each from the same bottle?\" Sunil asked. \"Nope.\" Vinnie simply answered. \"You can't seriously mean that we are suppose to chug down a bottle each of soda?!\" Sunil said, to which Vinnie simply said \"Yup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen. I can try to drink at least half of what's in it, but you can't really believe that our bodies can store it all?\" Sunil asked, while Vinnie was making his bottle fall over so he could easier drink from it, plus the pressure it was building up inside would make it quicker for him to drink it. \"Suit yourself, if you don't want to really win it's your choice.\" Vinnie said before knocking the capsule of the bottle, and starting taking in all the soda. Once again Sunil had a hard time being called a quiter by Vinnie so he quickly tipped over his own bottle, knocked of the cap on it, and started to take in the soda as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven thought if Vinnie or Sunil would ha wanted to quit right there, they couldn't. The sheer force of the soda pushing itself down their throat, made them forced to stand there and drink until it was all gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the soda stopped coming Sunil stepped back to get some free space to breath, and started to noticed a \"slosh\" kind of sound coming from him. Looking down he saw that he was now carrying a large water balloon for a belly. It stood out about half a feet, and it felt like he was a part of a waterbed, with it jiggling with his every movement. Looking over at Vinnie he saw how the gecko was trying to get every single drop of soda from his bottle into him. It wasn't until he literally licked the top of the bottles neck cleaned when he decided to join Sunil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now what?\" Sunil asked, while putting his hands on his soda filled belly. \"What do we do with this?\" \"What do we do? We create one heck of a burp with this.\" Vinnie said, and shake his own inflated middle. \"And how are we suppose to do that? \"Sunil asked. \"We need to do a lot of exercise to build it up inside. To make the soda a part of our system, and lose all the extra fluid inside.\" Vinnie explained. \"And what kind of exercise do you suggest?\" Sunil asked. \"I don't know what you will do, but I'm going for something like...this!\" Vinnie said and started doing what looked like a rumba dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunil got all lost in how Vinnie's big round stomach moved by the dance. How is swinged from side to side, how it was all shaking like a massage chair by Vinnie's moves, and how it seemed to shrink a little by all the sweat Vinnie got out of his dancing. Sunil pretty quickly snapped out of it, knowing that if he just stood there Vinnie would win for sure. So he started too to try and do the same thing Vinnie did, but since he wasn't a self trained dancer like Vinnie he just focused on moving his belly a lot. He even used his hands to grab and shake it, trying to move it as quickly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinnie speed up the moves to swing his belly around, and Sunil did his best at shaking his own like mad. It didn't take long for the pressure to build up inside both of them, but it was Vinnie how got his one starting first. Releasing a huge sound burp that made the whole room shake a bit, and could even be heard by the other pets in the other room. It only lasted for ten seconds, but it was enough to leave its mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over Vinnie, could see that Sunil still hadn't got his burp started, and that was putting even more pressure on him to do better then Vinnie. It wasn't going to be easy, since Vinnie's burp almost seemed to be able to break glass. But he was still going to give his best, since he never gives up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he could feel something click inside of him, and he could feel the great pressure inside rise up and travel towards his mouth. With almost no time to prepare himself Sunil gave out his try in the burp contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut is it enough to beat Vinnie?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sunil's burp started promising, reaching really high levels of volume as it went on. Things started to shake a little, and the sound of it started to hurt Vinnie's ears. Still both of these things happen as well when Vinnie had his go at it, making it very hard to distinct who had the loudest one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunil's burp was getting louder and louder until suddenly the sound...disappeared! Must to Vinnie's surprise he took his hands of his ears to see that while Sunil looked like he was still giving away his burp no sound seemed to come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for a short while before even Sunil's burp came to an end. \"What happen?\" Vinnie asked. \"I don't know. I gave my all, and still no sound came out.\" Sunil said. \"Well, I guess that make it pretty obvious who won then.\" Vinnie said cocky. \"I guess so.\" Sunil said disappointed over himself, and he was about to go and have himself a punishing extra portion from his bowl when the other pets arrived into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on in here?\" Russell asked as they walked in. \"Oh, we're just having a little burp-off between us guys.\" Vinnie said casually. \"So that was the strange sound we heard coming from this room.\" Penny Ling said. \"Wait you all heard Vinnie burp from the other room and with closed doors?\" Sunil asked, surprised that Vinnie managed to make his <b>that</b> loud. \"Yes. It. Was.\" Vinnie said, loving to rub it into Sunil's face. \"I made the one that was <b>that</b> loud, and Sunil didn't even manage to make a sound with his.\" \"Oh, but he did.\" Zoe said. \"What?\" Both Vinnie and Sunil asked surprised. \"Zoe is right. While we all clearly heard your burp Sunil, Zoe started to shout in pain of something high volume bothering her ears. It seems that Sunil managed to burp so loudly that it reaches supersonic levels \" Russell explained. \"And I'm the living proof that Russell is not making this up.\" Zoe added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your saying that Sunil actually managed to be <i>louder</i> then me?\" Vinnie asked shocked. \"It seems so yeah.\" Russell simply answered. \"Vinnie felt really stupid now, bragging so much to Sunil over him beating him, and now it turns out Sunil is the one who beat him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, are you not feeling a little <i>hungry</i> Vinnie?\" Sunil teased, really loving how the tables had turned for Sunil. \"What does he mean? Didn't we have lunch just recently?\" Minka asked. \"It's a part of the game that the loser of each challenge has to eat an extra bowl full of their  own pet food.\" Vinnie said. \"Wait a minute, did you say each challenge? Is there more then one?\" Russell asked confused. \"Oh yes! And if Vinnie loses again he's forced to eat another bowl of food immediately.\" Sunil said, grinning over the thought of Vinnie losing several challenges in a row, making pretty much a blob of himself. \"Can't he just say no?\" Penny Ling asked. \"If he do he loses the whole game.\" Sunil said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let me see if I get this straight.\" Russell said. \"You two compete in a bunch of challenges where the loser of each one will be force to eat a whole food bowl full of the representative own pet food, and the whole thing will go one until one of you two can't stuff your bodies anymore?\" \"Pretty much, yeah.\" Vinnie and Sunil both said. \"That's probably the most un-intellectual and the most nonsensical thing I have ever heard. Plus it's a good waste on pet food.\" Russell said. \"Yeah...Can I be in the audience?\" Pepper asked. \"What?!\" All the three male pets said surprised. \"I think it would be really fun to see how this ends.\" She said. \"I would like to see how wins as well.\" Penny Ling added. \"I myself would prefer to see two hunky men fight for a beautiful girl's hand, but seeing two boys stuff each other until one gives up could work to.\" Zoe added. \"And Russell could be the referee.\" Minka said, which came as a surprise to Russell. \"ME?\" He asked at first, but then said \"Well I guess being in charge of making sure that all the rules in these games are being followed correctly seems like the most fitting position for me to have.\" \"Dude. How did this little thing that was only about us doing some fun, now involve every single one of the other pets?\" Vinnie asked Sunil, who only could shrug his shoulders as a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happens now?\" Vinnie asked. \"I think you where about to go and eat your punishment.\" Sunil answered. \"Oh yeah, I forgot that for a moment.\" Vinnie said, before noticing all the other pets putting all their focus on him and Sunil. \"So I guess I should do it now.\" Vinnie said, as he started to walk over to his food bowl with all the other pets following him. Once there Russell started to order Minka and Penny Ling to refill Vinnie's food bowl, he even took and measured with ruler to make sure it was just around the edge of the bowl. Once everything was done he stepped back and let Vinnie make his way to his bowl. It felt really weird having everyone staring at him while eating, but he couldn't pull out now so he started to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first things didn't seem so bad. He always love to eat, and he felt he had a little room left inside since the lunch. It wasn't until he was halfway through when he started to feel full for real. His eating pace got slower, and it really started to feel like his stomach was starting to run out of room. Still he continued eating, as it was a part of the game. As he was eating he could hear how at first Minka and then the other girls and Russell started to do a chant for him. \"eat, eat, eat,\" they all said in a way to show their support to him, something he gladly took in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he had managed to finish his bowl, and he had to sit down to fully take in what had happen. His stomach now stood out four inches, and felt as full as ever. If there was one good thing about it, it was that the soda from earlier and the dry and hard pet food from now was mixing together nicely inside of him. Making it easier and quicker for it to digest, and some of it was already starting to become fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Remember how you said <i>no breaks in-between</i>?\" Sunil said to Vinnie, who was stroking his well filled belly. \"Since you lost you get to choose again what the next challenge will be, so what will it be?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinnie really didn't want to force down another portion of food inside himself again so soon, so he needed to make sure to pick something that he definitely would win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some thoughts Vinnie decided to choose...</span></div></div>",

Go!\" Pepper started them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunil, not one for being timed, panicked for one of those minutes before he finally calmed down and started to think rationally about this. What did he notice around the pet shop that was odd or amusing to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Vinnie was coming up with joke after joke after joke. And about eight minutes in, he looked like he was practicing some sort of dance for his act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell, stopwatch in hand, gave it a little 'click.'  \"Time is up!\" Russell called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who should go first?\" Penny Ling asked, while preparing herself a seat on the ground to watch the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's flip a coin\" Russell said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are coins up in Blythe's room\" Sunil suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOOOR we could use the one I have!\" Minka said excitedly, pulling a coin out from behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm scared to ask, but...why?\" Pepper inquiried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found this on the sidewalk when we went to the park and I like shiny things so I picked it up and looked at it and played with it and just saw how shiny it was and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We get it!\" all of the pets said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, whatever\" she shrugged it off, tossing the coin to Russell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Minka\" he thanked her politely. He then asked the two contestants which side of the coin they wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will take heads because I am the one with the brain rather than Vinnie\" Sunil said, taking smack to Vinnie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, ok. I see. I guess I'm tails then\" Vinnie responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussel flipped the coin. Heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who goes first, Rusty?\" Vinnie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sunil. And you know I hate it when you call me Rusty!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, Rusty\" Vinnie rubbed it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell shook it off, only knowing that if he got angry again, it would only egg him on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take the stage, Sunil! Can't wait to see what you've come up with\" Pepper said encouragingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed a microphone next to him and gave him a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, um, hi.\" Sunil started. \"Well, I guess I'll get right to it. Um. You guys know how Blythe bakes cakes right? Oh, haha, that rhymed. Well, anyways, I saw that on her apron, there's a huge pocket for placing things on her torso. And may I ask, what is the purpose of that? If you put anything in it, you'll either have too dirty of hands to pull it back out, or it will just rub up against your face! What an I supposed to do? Put my salmonella laden spatula in there so it can coat my face with raw germs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunil actually got a pretty big laugh from that joke. He gained more and more confidence as he went on, with more and more observations that he made funny!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he made his way off the stage, Vinnie followed him as overconfident as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did the chicken cross the road?\" Vinnie paused, waiting for someone to ask. Realizing nobody would, he kept going. \"He didn't! His brother crossed the road!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of dead silence before the crowd laughed hysterically. Sunil was at a loss for words. They laughed at THAT?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That joke was so bad that we laughed at your failure!\" Pepper said through chuckles. That's a form of comedy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinnie kept going on like that, with each terrible joke being laughed AT rather than actually being funny. Then he closed it with a dance and him falling right on his stomach. Which hurt really badly because his overstuffed stomach was not happy to be compressed against the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that concludes our little comedy competition\" Russell said, putting the microphone away with the rest of Pepper's things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Pepper, who won?\" Penny Ling asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Sunil's observations were interesting and dead on about how funny the world can be. A lot of intellectually and thought went into that. Good job.\" Pepper then turned face Vinnie. \"And you were just so bad that we laughed. And your physical comedy was spot-on too!

Once I'm done eating you will get it!\" The gecko said, before storming of towards the food bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe asked for the others to quickly fill up his bowl so he could get it done quicker. When it was all set and done he started to eat, and with great speed to.

No! I'm not saying that! But I think that when Vinnie said art he meant <i>painting</i> art.\" Russell said, trying to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOOHHH, that kind of art...Okay I can help judge on that.\" Minka said, finally accepting her role as guest judge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally.\" Russell said, before going of with Mink for a second to talk out the rules for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they did that Vinnie struggled to get up on his two feet again.

He really felt he needed to win this, or he wouldn't even want to think about how big he would be after three meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he manages to finally get up Russell and Minka returned to tell the rules. \"The rules are this. Both of you will each have half an hour to make a real piece of art for us. You will both have the same amount of paint and cloth to work with, and there's nobody that can help you in any way during the challenge.\" Russell started, sounding as professional as he could. \"After the half hour is gone we will both take a closer look at your final paintings, and after our own taste and judgement decided who is the winner.\" Minka added, trying mimic Russell's way of standing and talking when he said his part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other pets prepared the two competitors stations with paint, brushes, and an easel with cloths to paint on. Sunil and Vinnie both made themselves ready and was standing next to their stations as Russell and Minka told them to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they started both of them had plan thought out for it. Sunil was planning on making something of traditional kind from his home country India, while Vinnie was trying to get that raw and gritty look from spray-painted urban city walls on his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they where painting Minka and Russell took the time to walk around them, and get a closer look on how they both where working. Looking over at Sunil they saw that he was working in a calm pace, and the movements in his painting seemed to be with much confidence. \"Looks pretty promising Sunil.\" Minka said. \"Thank you so much Minka.\" Sunil said, glad to hear that he seemed to be looking good for victory already. \"Any certain plans for what it will be?\" Russell asked. \"Oh, nothing special. Just some fine memories from home.\" Sunil said, as Minka and went over to Vinnie while he continued painting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver at Vinnie they saw a completely different situation. While Sunil was working with elegance and calmness, Vinnie was much more chaotic in his painting. Much of it had to do with his food filled stomach sticking out so much that Vinnie had to paint with his arms stretched out to be able to paint with out his stomach touching the sheet. Still he seemed to get the kind of motive he was looking for to his painting, and Minka and Russell decided to not interrupt Vinnie as he was already under so much hard work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two judges where in the middle of discussing who seemed to be the best painter they all heard a loud \"CRASH!\" coming from Vinnie's station. Looking at it they saw the big bellied lizard laying on top of his painting that was smashed on the floor. Apparently what had happen was that during his stressful painting Vinnie must have trip over a paint tube he had dropped on the floor earlier, making him loose his balance and fall right on top of his unfinished painting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH NO!\" Vinnie said, as he quickly tried to get up and see just how ripped apart his painting was. \"I can't put something like this up!\" He said loudly to himself. \"Does that mean I win on walk over?\" Sunil asked the judges, with Minka saying \"No. Vinnie still has some time left to put up something quickly for us to judge.\" \"But he has to do it quickly since there is only five minutes left of the challenge.\" Russell added, showing the small amount of time left on stop watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinnie was unable to know what to do during the small time left. He had very little paint left, but most importantly he had ruin the sheet that the painting where suppose to be on. He just looked around stressfully, hoping to find something to work with, and it wasn't until he looked down on his big paint splashed belly when he got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick, give me full size mirror!\" Vinnie shouted, and immediately Zoe was standing next to him holding a mirror that manages to catch all of Vinnie's body. \"Hold it perfectly still.\" Vinnie said as he started painting. \"Hey, isn't that against the rules for Zoe to help him?\" Russell asked, with Minka quickly replying \"No, not here. I think Vinnie is making something <i>very</i> interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time started to end both pets really made those last minutes count as they would soon be judge on it. \"5,4,3,2,1, and stop!\" Russell counted down and shouted, making both Sunil and Vinnie drop their paintbrushes to shoe they where finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So lets start this by having a look at Sunil's painting.\" Russell said, and Sunil quickly lifted off his painting and turned it around to show them what he had done. On the painting the other pets could see a lot of stuff going around in it. There was Pets, people, markets, buildings, cloth lines hanging out from the windows. There was pretty much a lot of things looking very Indian in this picture, and it also had a frame around it that looked like window frames. \"Wow, so many different colours!\" Minka said, sounding really impressed. \"And what exactly would you call this piece?\" Russell asked Sunil, who simply answered. \"A window to India.\" \"Very good Sunil, very good.\" Russell said, before he and Minka decided to move over to Vinnie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what do we have here?\" Russell asked, as all they could se was Vinnie standing with his back turned against them and no painting in sight. \"Well, at first I was planning on painting something in the same way as Sunil did. But when a little accident happened I had to improvise with something of my own.\" Vinnie said, before turning around dramatically. \"And that something was my own body.\" Vinnie said, showing all of the pets that he had used the last minutes of his time to paint his artwork on his belly. It was filled with all kind of cool symbols and catchphrases, painted in a neon like purple colour. The natural green of his own skin made for a nice contrast to the coloured words, and given it's size it might even be a (literally) bigger piece of art then Sunil's. \"And check this out.\" Vinnie said before he started to give his belly some small shakes. The shaking of his body made the words and symbols move in pattern that gave the impression that his art was coming alive. Sunil didn't look to convinced of winning this any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm pretty speechless at this point.\" Russell said, while Minka just starred at Vinnie's belly like it had the answers to all the questions of the universe. \"Come on now Minka. We need to go away and decided who wins this challenge.\" Russell said, as he had to drag the pink monkey away from the gecko gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we need to decided who will win this art making challenge...\" Russell started before getting interrupted by Minka shouting, \"Vinnie! Vinnie must win!\" \"Yes. I know that you really admired Vinnie's...art piece, but there's one thing about it that I think you may have overlooked.\" Russell said, which made Minka confused. \"What? He had the most original, and amazing work of the both of them.\" She said, with Russell quickly saying \"Yes, but he also had help making it.\" \"What?!\" Minka asked shocked. \"He had Zoe holding up the mirror so he could easier paint himself, and the rules clearly said that they where not allowed to have any kind of help while making it.\" Russell explained, which made Minka pretty sad. \"I guess that's true, but does it really have to be so?\" She asked, \"Vinnie was the one that was in disadvantage during the whole thing. He had a big food filled gut that was just in his way, and when it even made his original panting get destroyed he didn't let it stop him but instead made one heck of an amazing thing to show us. Are you really going to let all of his hard work not count?\" Minka asked in a great speech to Russell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Russell very unsure of what to do. He was the one to always follow what the rules said no matter what, but Minka's passion for wanting Vinnie to win made him feel like this might be a time to actually go against them. How will it end?</span></div></div>",

Even Sunil thought that Vinnie's unique belly art was worth winning, and he was mentally preparing for himself to have his first meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the group Russell looked as neutral as he could to keep it a secret, while Minka looked very, very sad over their decision. \"Before giving our decision we would like to say that both contestants made some really amazing art, especially you Vinnie.\" Russell said looking at Vinnie, \"But still this is a competition with rules, and you Vinnie broke the rule about not letting anyone else helping you in any way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this made Vinnie's self-confidence of him winning drop in a second, and everybody else could also quickly guess where this was heading. \"And having Zoe help you holding the mirror for you made you automatically lose the contest, and therefore gives Sunil the victory.\" Russell said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody got both very shocked and very disappointed over the decision they had made, even Sunil couldn't feel completely happy over him once again winning. Feeling sympathy for them Minka told them \"I really tried to make him change his decision, but he wouldn't listen to me.\" in a try to make Russell feel guilty, but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you coming to the food bowls?\" Russell asked Vinnie, who just answered (sounding very defeated) \"Yeas, but I seriously think I might burst if I eat anything more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was on his way to go and do something he was used to by now, Zoe suddenly grabbed is his arm and said \"It's my fault you lost this challenge. Let me do it for you.\" \"You would?\" Vinnie said, taken by Zoe's sacrifice. \"Just look at you, there's only so much your poor body can take. I can survive getting a few pounds extra, I'll just go on a short diet afterwards.\" Zoe said and walked over to the bowls, and asked for her bowl to filled to the brim with dog-food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other pets did that, and she was about to have her first bite when Russell suddenly said \"Stop!\". \"What is it Russell?\" Zoe asked, felling a bit irritated over being interrupted just when she was mentally prepared to do it. \"I just realized that eating Vinnie's food for him also is classified as a rule break, and therefore the most fitting thing for you to do is to eat <b>two</b> portions of food as punishment for Vinnie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that made Zoe regret a bit more that she took Vinnie's place, but it was to late to go back now and she would just have to swallow it. (Literally)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started eating, and find it not to difficult at first. She ate at a steady pace, and as the food disappeared she didn't feel too much of a resistance from her body. But just like with Vinnie earlier the pain where just around the corner, and when she was about three fourths done she felt her body starting to ask her to stop. She understood first now that Vinnie hadn't been overreacting earlier with how bad pains he was feeling, and as she ate up the final pieces from her bowl she remembered she still had one more portion to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith even more force this time Zoe continue stuffing herself with the dog food, as she ate her second round. Many of the pets where just looking in awe that Zoe, the one thinking about her figure the most now was getting belly about the size of Vinnie's. With small breaks for breathing and burping to give room Zoe pretty much gave up any attempts of keeping her dignity while eating, starting to eat more and more \"messy\" just to make it end quicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten minutes of nonstop eating Zoe feel back with a one foot tall, 4 pounds heavy, filled to the limits belly, and gave the biggest burp in her life to all of them. Feeling to tired to even move she looked over at Vinnie and said, \"Please Vinnie, win the next challenge. I don't think I have the power to come in and help you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling responsible for Zoe taking that bullet (or rather buffet) for him, Vinnie felt he needed to now once and for all beat Sunil in something. And after some thought he decided to pick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling more regretful of taking Vinnie's place Zoe forces two portions of food into her small Chihuahua body. Leaving her very, very stuffed, and Vinnie to chose the next challenge.</span></div></div>",

Each competitor will pick a game from both consoles and they'll compete against each other in all four games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good\" said Sunil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since Vinnie picked the challenge, Sunil will pick first.\" Russell said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.

They would show off their best skills and Russell would decide who was better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunil went first, doing some average ollies and sometimes a flip or a grab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinnie was utterly astonishing.

Sunil knew he'd lose this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey played a capture the flag match against each other. Vinnie expertly shoot every CPU on Sunil's team that came his way, nabbed the flag within the first minute, and ran back even faster. Everyone was impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was Smash Bros. Vinnie picked Solid Snake and Sunil was Pit.  Vinnie was spamming harder than ever, as he want really a Nintendo person, but Sunil went to town on Vinnie. With a couple masterful smash attacks and well timed shielding and recoveries, Sunil won by two kills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it was time for Mario Kart Wii. Vinnie picked Wario and Sunil was Koopa Troopa. The random course which was selected was Daisy Circuit and they both stated off evenly. The CPUs were set on hard and Vinnie was barely maintaining a lead over the 3rd place Sunil. Vinnie was on his third lap and nearing the end, but Sunil got a blue shell. He sent it off as fast as he could, but Vinnie was pretty close to the finish line. What happened?</span></div></div>",

After just one more piece of kibble was swallowed, he felt like he couldn't eat anything else ever in the world ever, according to his hyperbolic brain's wording.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, his ego wouldn't let him quit. So he ate, with his stomach pushing farther and farther outwards. It hurt, but he kept eating until it was finished. He fell on his back, his scaly stomach, stretched beyond his comprehension.

Lets do it!\" Vinnie responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's just one problem here.\" Russell said, interrupting the two competitors. \"What?\" They both asked. \"Well, since the last one ended in a tie, there isn't any way of knowing who should get to choose.\" He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two rivals where pretty struck by this. If nobody got to choose, then what would it be of their contest?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what should we do?\" Sunil finally asked. \"If there is anyone else here who has a suggestion for a challenge, then perhaps we can that pet choose.\" Russell said, and looked over at the rest of the group who had previously only been observers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all got a bit unsure on what to suggest. None of them was even prepared for this to happen, so they where all without ideas. \"Doesn't anyone of you have at least <u>one</u> suggestion?\" Russell asked irritated by the lack of imagination from his fellow pets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long pause Penny Ling carefully stood up and said, \"Maybe a Ribbon dancing challenge?\" She looked at all the attention she got, and was afraid that she had made a bad suggestion. But to her own surprise she first heard Russell say \"I nobody else has anything better to give then I think Penny Ling's suggestion will be the one to choose.\", and then \"And would you Penny Ling be prepared to take on the job as guess judge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had never in her life been in the position of judging others so she was kinda afraid at first, but then said \"Okay. I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent.\" Russell said happy, and then asked \"Could you then first teach the two of them the bases of Ribbon Dancing, before they build up a routine?\". \"Oh dear. This thing give me more responsibility each minute, but I think I can do that as well.\" Penny Ling said, before walking out onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took her orange coloured ribbon, and gave Vinnie and Sunil (As well as the other pets) a simple lesson in how to try and find a fitting combination of body movement and ribbon twirling. And while Sunil looked like he was trying to catch every single step and movement Penny Ling made, Vinnie had a bit more harder time keeping his attention to her. (If wasn't that he didn't care, he just preferred to discover his dancing skill on his own.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And most importantly don't forget to find a routine that fits <b>your</b> style.\" Penny Ling said, before taking a bow for her lesson. As she got applause from the other pets, Sunil and Vinnie walked away to start practicing their routines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sunil was trying to do all the things Penny Ling had done when she showed, Vinnie was just sitting down thinking on what to do. As he saw Sunil jump around and do pirouettes in the air he knew he wouldn't be able to do anything like that as long as he had a 2 and a half food portion filled belly. If he tried he would just fall forward on his first try. \"What to do, what to do?\" He thought and looked at his tail, (shaking to a tune he was having in his head) and then suddenly had an idea. As he was practicing Sunil suddenly heard a loud \"Ripppp!!!\", and looking behind he saw that Vinnie had ripped off the ribbon from the stick it was suppose to sit on. \"What have you done?! Do you want to lose?\" He asked shocked, and the gecko answered back cool. \"Just wait and see.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now time for the ribbon dancing contest to start, and first up was Sunil. He started doing his dance and the judges seems to like it, or rather half of them. While Russell thinks that Sunil's dancing is almost as good as Penny Ling's was, Penny Ling realized that it WAS just as good as hers, because he had copied it! Every movement and every grace he did was mimicking after what Penny Ling had done to show them what she wanted to see. It was very impressive technically, but it was just much unoriginal. It made number very boring to Penny Ling, and at one point she almost yawned <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Sunil was done it was time for Vinnie, and as he entered nobody could see where his ribbon was. It wasn't until he turned around when they could see that he had taken the ribbon and tied it around his tail, making it look like it was six feet long. He then started his routine and unlike what Penny Ling and Sunil had done this was as far from traditional ribbon dancing that you could come. Vinnie's act had much more of a street groove going on, and it was much more focus on him swinging his tail then moving the rest of his body. (Mostly because of his stomach.) Giving his tail had such great flexibility he manage to give a pretty impressive and unique show. This time the roles where reversed as Penny Ling loved what Vinnie had done with her act, while Russell looked really upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter both of them had preformed Penny Ling and Russell went of to have a discussion. \"I don't know about you, but I think it's pretty obvious you should win.\" Russell said, which Penny Ling saying. \"I also know who it is.\". They then decided to both say it loudly to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell: \"Sunil.\"<br>\r\nPenny Ling: \"Vinnie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both got very surprised that they bot had chosen the opposite pet to win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Penny Ling, but I think it should have been pretty obvious for you as a ribbon dancer to see that Sunil did the most <i>authentic</i> ribbon dance.\" Russell said, sounding like it was preposterous for Penny Ling to think otherwise. \"He did, but he also did it exactly like I did mine during the lecturing.\" Penny Ling explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't help! He was still miles above that <i>freak show</i> Vinnie was giving. I mean how can anyone look at that and be expecting to call it a ribbon dance?!\" Russell said loudly, expecting Penny ling to join him in his critic. \"At least his show looked interesting! It really looked like he had taken what I did, and made it into <b>his</b> own act.\" She shouted back, almost wanting to leave the room because of her partners stubbornness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't just argue all day, we need to decided now which one it is that wins.\" Russell said. \"I'm not changing my vote!\" Penny Ling said with crossed arms, and Russell did the same saying \"Neither will I!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they both knew that one of them would have to, and after a long time there was a winner. And the winner was...</span></div></div>",

He could feel how his insides where doing their best at digesting as much of it as possible in order to give room for the new food coming in, and that had the effect of Vinnie's body taking on a few \"Changes\".

While trying to tell himself not to get affected by Penny Ling's weird acting, he had forgot to answer her question. \"Shouldn't be that hard to tell her.\" He thought, before looking straight into her beautiful eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Penny Ling asked again, remanding the otherwise punctual hedgehog to answer her question. \"I-I-I...\" Was all Russell could say, being to lost into Penny Ling's eyes. It didn't make things better that she was walking up closer to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I think we both know that Vinnie's act was the one that had much more <i>excitement</i>.\" Penny Ling said, while putting one of her paws on the chest of Russell once she was close enough. (Russell was to stiff to even try and resist.) \"And the way he moved was so much more <i>masculine</i>, despite that he might have a bit of a gut.\" She said while dragging her hand across Russell's chest, and patting a little at his own gut. \"And finally I think he has by making his own routine proved to be the <i>smarter</i> pet.\" She said, making her comments on Vinnie to on purpose match a strong sides of Russell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you agree?\" She asked, having her face being really up close to Russell now, making him blush more then ever. \"I-I-I...\" Was once again all Russell could give as a respond, as Penny Ling took and put one of her fingers on his cute little nose and gave him a light push. Having no control over his body at all Russell just feel back onto the floor, with Penny Ling standing over him and looking down. \"I guess that means I managed to convinced you to let Vinnie win?\" She asked, with Russell just giving a light nod as a respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater both of the judging pets returned to the group to deliver the news. \"A-After much discussion we both finally agreed on that the winning pet is...\" Russell said, being a bit nervous that the other pets would know what happen when he and Penny Ling where all alone. \"Vinnie!\" Penny Ling filled in happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinnie took the news with big sheer, while Sunil felt so disappointed over himself. \"Oh, oh, oh, Sunil has to eat. Sunil has to eat.\" Vinnie chanted around Sunil, who was trying his best to ignore him. \"Soon you will also have THIS!\" Vinnie said, lifting his big belly and shaking in front of Sunil's face. \"I know, I know! \" Sunil said, being both upset and a little nervous about doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't known for taking big portions, and having eaten that half portion before felt for him like enough for a dinner to his body. So having to eat two more half portions felt like more then he had ever tried before. Not wasting any time Sunil started eating from his food filled bowl, and could already feel how his somewhat full stomach was already asking him to stop. \"This was not going to be easy.\" He thought sadly to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ate and ate, stuffing his face as full as he could, chewed with great force, then swallowed it all down to get stored inside of him. He was really regretting that he said yes to this stupid thing. Getting three fourths done he started to feel his stomach getting so big that it was giving him pains, and as he finally ate the last bits he had now a two feet big furry belly. It wasn't as big as Vinnie's four feet scaly belly, but it still felt abnormally big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResting on his back while clutching his stomach like he had seen his comrade do after eating, Sunil could hear the sound of Vinnie walking up to him. \"So?\" The giant gut gecko said. \"Are you giving up weakling?\" He asked mockingly. \"After eating less then you have? Never!\" Sunil responded. \"Fine, then pick the next challenge.\" Vinnie said and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking for a moment Sunil decides to choose...</span></div></div>",

And something that had to do with physical skill?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunil realized their confusion and decided to elaborate, \"Paintball requires a lot of strategy, as well as the physical part I'm not particularly good at, BUT Vinnie isn't looking too good in that physical department either, is he? He will also be a much LARGER target than I\" He said, rubbing it in Vinnie's face that Vinnie was overweight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, dude? I don't care about your stupid insults! I'm actually starting to see that I can do anything even with a gut like this!\" he said, lifting it up from the bottom for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? I guess we'll find out during this challenge, then!\" Sunil countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we will!\" Vinnie said loudly as the two both strode over to Russell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RUSSELL!\" They both screamed at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell naturally finched, dropping his clipboard. Normally, he was used to the two's crazy behavior, but he was still on edge about the events that previously occurred...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, Rusty. Chill out\" Vinnie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we would like the rules to the competition now so I can crush this-this-idiot of a reptile!\" Sunil insulted Vinnie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Vinnie retaliated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys! Calm down!\" Russell ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey immediately stopped bickering. They were used to Russell having a sense of authority over them. They had found it best in previous times to just listen to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all,\" Russell began now that he had their attention, \"Don't EVER call me Rusty. You know I hate that. My name is Russell and it should stay that way. And second, the rules are very simple. The both of you will have one gun filled with exactly six paintballs. The one who's been hit the most loses. And we can tell who's been hit the most because there will be different colored splatters where you got hit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes perfect sense to me,\" Sunil agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going down, mongoose!\" Vinnie taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooo, I'm so scared, fatso!\" Sunil said with mock fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're on your way too,\" Vinnie said, placing his hand on Sunil's new, food filled stomach and patted it twice for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe patting on his stomach upset it and hurt, as it was still unhappy from being fed so much, but Sunil ignored the pain. If he showed it, he showed weakness in front of his competitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pepper, if you'd please find some toy guns in your prop box. Minka, go get your paint. And Penny Ling....\" He got mentally blocked by the reminder of what happened earlier. He stood as stiff as before, his eyes unintentionally locked on her, and wide eyed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny Ling picked up on what he was getting pretty fast. Russell was an open book and everyone knew it except Russell himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go fill up some water balloons with paint, right?\" she asked, knowing full well that he would freeze even more when she talked to him all seductively. And she'd heard Russell be in charge enough that she figured out his train of thought and what he would have said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell was indeed going to tell her to do that, but again, all he could do was nod stiffly. He hated it when his brain wasn't functional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, the guns were all set up and the two pets had taken shelter behind the fake fire hydrant and under the small slide that came out of a 'hiding place box' as Sunil always called it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell had gotten over his dysfunctional state when Penny Ling had gone off and done what he WOULD'VE told her, but it worked out anyways. He paid it no mind anymore. Now was the time to be a logical referee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you two ready?\" He called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two pets stuck out a visible thumbs up sign since they didn't want to give away their hiding spots with sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you'll begin in 3..2..1..GO!\" Russell shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPepper had found an airhorn in her prop box when she was looking for the guns and she got a mischievous idea when she found it. She put get idea in to action right after Russell said go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blared the airhorn directly behind him, causing him to scream and curl up into a ball and roll away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, this caused Sunil to scream too (all the while, Pepper's laughing uncontrollably at how well it worked) and that gave away his position to Vinnie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I've got you now\" Vinnie spoke quietly to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunil knew what he'd done, so he had to find a new hiding spot fast! He ran out from where he was looking for a new spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Vinnie peeked out from his hiding place and saw him out in the open, Sunil's back facing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be too easy...\" He said as he lifted up his gun and took a shot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hit Sunil right on his rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt scared him so much, he jumped a good foot in the air (even with his added poundage) and sped to another hiding spot. He was better at finding then faster when he was scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe peeked out to see where Vinnie was. Vinnie was far too fat to hide behind the fire hydrant, so half of his belly was open for him to shoot. Vinnie didn't know this however, still used to being lithe and able to hide behind anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunil aimed his shot and fired. It hit Vinnie directly on his gut. Dead center of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AW MAN!\" Could be heard throughout the pet shop. Sunil knew he scored a perfect point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinnie waddled out from the fire hydrant, knowing he wasn't safe there. He bounced over to where the hamster tubes were. He put his top half in, but the bottom of his belly wouldn't fit. He pushed harder, but all he got was more resistance from his enlarged gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunil saw his chance. He lifted his weapon and shot Vinnie right on his back. Sunil shot two more, each hitting one of Vinnie's buttcheeks dead on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinnie blushed heavily while Sunil smiled of confidence and payback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinnie gave up on the hamster tubes. He squeezed his way out and began to run behind his bed. Most of his stomach was still visible. Sunil took another shot and it hit right on Vinnie's three chest hairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinnie knew that was five shots that hit him out of six, but then, he saw the tire swing and got a great idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly waddled to the tire swing and climbed atop it. He began to sing back and forth fairly quickly, using gravity's pull on him as an advantage to get the swing going faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunil took his last, blind shot at Vinnie. He couldn't tell if it hit or not. But while Vinnie was swinging, he could get Sunil from one of three different angles at him, which meant he really couldn't hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinnie shot all five of his remaining paintballs at Sunil. He was moving too fast to see if they hit, but they were both out of paintballs. So he hopped off the swing while it was still moving and landed right on his belly. It was a soft landing, but embarrassing nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting the two right next to each other for examination, Russell began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being scared out of his spikes, he had seen the hits to their bottoms. Being a good judge, he walked behind Sunil and saw an orange splatter on his backside. That was one for Vinnie. He walked over to Vinnie. He saw the shot on his back in blue paint. He also saw the pink splatter on his left rump cheek. But Vinnie's task was deliberately covering the right one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell, not one for personal etiquette, just wanted to see if the point counted and to be a good, factual judge. So he simply grabbed Vinnie's tail and lifted it very far upwards, exposing his other purple splatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinnie however, was not as green in the face as bright red with embarrassment. Russell just grabbed his tail, which was kind of a private area for him and was looking right at his rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank god Russell left to look at their fronts again. And he saw...</span></div></div>",

My butt isn't that big. Is it?\" Sunil asked, and felt on his very enlarged butt checks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...you are maybe a little wide on the back.\" Penny Ling said, and giggled a little on how big Sunil's two rump half's was compared to his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I just found out what to make rap parts about.\" Vinnie said, looking at Sunil's enlarged behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I have found mine.\" Sunil said, staring at Vinnie's big hanging stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay every pet! Listen up cause I have to tell the rules!\" Russell said. \"The rules here is that each side gets <u>Three</u> verses each to try and beat their opponent, using nothing but pure words.

I can do that.\" Zoe said, and Russell was just about to start the rap when she added \"But only if you could let me be guest judging this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking he was going to go solo on this one Russell turned back and asked, \"Excuse me for asking, but why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't take this wrong, but since music of all kind is a bit more of my alley I thought you might need my option in this in order to get the most fair result.\" Zoe said, and Russell was pretty impressed by her very logical reasoning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That actually sounds pretty right. Sure Zoe, you can co-judge me on this one.\" The hedgehog said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thanks, Russ.\" Zoe said, and Russell had to admit that while he hated when Vinnie called him \"Rusty\" from time to time, he did like the way \"Russ\" sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, if there is no more interruptions I would like to start this now...\" Russell said, and just in that moment Minka jumped down from the swing tire she was sitting in and landed right in front of Russell, scaring him slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH! Don't do that Minka!\" Russell shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry for that. I just wondered if I could start the challenge. I saw this on the internet once, and I really want to try doing it.\" Minka said, sounding very excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh, fine.

He wasn't as disappointed of eating more as he was that he could now stomach it. He was so fat now, that his belly was used to food intake, and it was 100% ready for more. He sighed, finishing the portion surprinsingly quickly, his already sumo sized gut flopping outwards into an even larger dome than before. His stomach was now covering his.knees fully, all while rounding out in front of him to the point where he couldn't reach around himself anymore. And his newfound chest could easily warrant a bra at this point in time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to win something. Something that'd get Sunil fatter and eventually fatter than him. Then he'd feel better. Besides, Sunil's fat was distributed much less flatteringly than his own...or so he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinnie was sure that Sunil would be as embarrassed about his fat as Vinnie himself was. But Sunil, although still crazy embarrassed if anyone pointed out his big behind, was beginning to show a bit of affection for his enlarged butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, Vinnie needed to win a challenge. So, surprisingly, he chose...</span></div></div>",

It was already pretty pronounced...now it had to get bigger. He made his way over to the bowl, pseudo-confidently. He ate, feeling very full, but it was less painful this time.

It was round, yet at the same time drooping from its own weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunil once again looked at his bottom, cheeks getting beet red again from embarrassment. It was so big and fat!

(Except for his natural fur coat of course.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sunil is the winner!\" Russell said and held up Sunil one arm like it was the end of a boxing match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great shooting Sunil. Who know you had such a good aim?\" Russell asks Sunil, who just blushes slightly over the compliments given to him and answers. \"It's  actually not so hard to aim when your opponent is <i>literally</i> as wide as a Barnyard Door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to admit that a bigger belly indeed makes a easier target.\" Russell added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to mention that trying to aim while swinging in the tire probably wasn't Vinnie's smartest idea.\" Sunil added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true, he isn't really the sharpest knife in the draw.\" Russell said, having a really good time talking about everything wrong Vinnie had done during the paint ball challenge. (Not notching that Vinnie was still standing there, and they where saying all of this with their backs turned from him.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, I'm still here.\" Vinnie said, making Russell slightly embarrassed for making fun of Vinnie while he was still present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's funny that you are still here, since you should be <b>over there</b>!\" Sunil said, pointing towards the food bowls. \"That's where you punishment is after all.\" He added in a cocky way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked over Vinnie was REALLY upset over Sunil now! It was one thing losing again, but having to get mocked also was to much. Next thing he WAS going to win!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got over to his food bowl he could see that the other pets had filled it up for him. With this eating he would have had three and a half portions of food since this started! \"I just hope I don't burst once I'm done.\" Vinnie thought half kidding, and half serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing used by doing this now Vinnie wasted no time chowing down on the pet food. He could already after a few mouthfuls that his body didn't want more, but he know he had to go against what it said and continue eating. His belly was already standing out four feet, and he could just feel it grow even bigger. \"How can it even store so much food?\" Vinnie thought as he ate, and the answer to it was that not all of the food he ate was still in his belly. It was there, but just not in his stomach sack. All of the activities he had been doing in-between eating's had lead to him digesting large parts of the food inside of his stomach. Now instead some of it had been made into fat that was now being put onto his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad he stopped to look at himself in a mirror he would see that he was now had...several chins, a chubby chest, a blubbery butt, timber tights, a thick tail, and finally a stomach that was now so used of carrying so much food inside that the fat had made sure to keep the same big round shape permanently. (Even if Vinnie had no food inside of it, it will still look like it does now.) He was defiantly not the same slim and slick gecko as he used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Vinnie didn't think about any of that. All he had in his mind was to finish eating, and then win the next challenge against Sunil. \"Just wait Sunil. You will soon be the one eating!\" Vinnie thought, as he ate mostly out of anger now instead of him just having to. (Which proved to be a good motivation to make him finish without any breaks.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was done eating Vinnie stood up, now having a gut that stood out at an incredible 5 feet! (And some of that back fat he also had was adding up a couple of extra inches.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking more determined then ever to win Vinnie decided to skip all tactics, and instead go for something that he know he would win.

His big hanging gut, his wide waits and hips, his thick arms and legs, and massive butt and tail made him one large lizard to bet. He was easily three times Sunil in pure weight, and his added pounds even gave the impression of him being slightly taller then Sunil. (But that was just Sunil's own fears making him think that.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Time for rules.\" Russell said, starting to like doing this before every challenge. \"In sumo the rules are really simple. The two challengers steps inside a small circled formed area, and it's the first one that pushes out it's opponent from the ring that wins. You are both fully allowed to do what ever it takes to get the other one out, just try to not be to violent.\" Russell explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And don't forget your <i>Mawashi</i>.\" Penny Ling added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mawa..what?\" Russell asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Mawashi is a belt/loin cloth like accessory that all sumo wrestlers wear during matches.\" Penny Ling answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why would they need that for the game?\" Russell asked still confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To give them both something to take a grip on to easier push of drag one of them out.\" Penny Lign explained, before leaning over to Russell to whisper. \"And also since it would look really weird seeing them do a sumo fight naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussell was REALLY confused now over Penny Ling since Sunil and Vinnie had done pretty much everything else in the nude (Not to mention that they are all without clothes all the time.), but he decided to not ask any further but just roll with it. \"Could you and the other girls help put on those Wamashi's...or what you called them on the boys?\" Russell asked Penny Ling, who simply gave a nod in response and walked over to the two fighters together with the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Penny Ling showing how to do it Zoe, Pepper and Minka all helped in putting on a Mawashi on both Sunil and Vinnie. For Sunil Penny Ling could do it on her own, but with Vinnie's big size he needed the help from all the other girls to reach around and strap it on his frame. (Both Sunil and Vinnie also felt it was pretty awkward having the girls putting on these thing on their crotch areas.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they where dressed for sumo Russell draw several lines to make the ring. (Going after an image in a book he had in his hand while doing it.) Once done both fighters where told to stand in the centre of the ring to prepare for the start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding there Sunil could once again see that Vinnie was much more \"equipped\" for this challenge then he was. By only standing ready for the fight Sunil could see that there was no way his tiny arms could reach around Vinnie's waist and grab his Mawashi. \"If I can't figure out some smart way to beat him I will lose for sure!\" Sunil thought scared, looking at the huge creature that was his friend, ready to take him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it going to be an easy victory for Vinnie, or would Sunil in some strange way actually win?</span></div></div>",

So, he ran at Vinnie with a war woop. Then, he made contact with Vinnie's blubbery belly. He bounced right off of it and landed on his back on the ground in front of Vinnie. Vinnie gave a cocky grin, he had this one in the bag. Vinnie turned around. Sunil was extremely confused. All that did was provide him with an unflattering view of the gecko's massive derriere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Vinnie began falling backwards. Then Sunil understood. He tried to scramble out of the way, but Vinnie was falling too fast. The huge, green mounds of fat he called a butt landed right on Sunil's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the watching pets elicited a simultaneous vocalization to sympathize with how unpleasant that had to have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunil squirmed frantically, and muffled screams could be barely heard by the spectators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinnie felt the vibrations of the scream on his behind. It was surprisingly like a massage to his behind. He could relax there all day. But he had a contest to win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give up?\" Vinnie asked conceitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA muffled scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother muffled scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.\" Vinnie said, lifting a buttcheek for Sunil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue mongoose frantically scrambled out and ran out of the ring at lightning speed, horrified with his previous experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vinnie wins!\" Russell called out. The pets cheered for the gecko who'd finally amassed a victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess what that means?\" Vinnie asked Sunil pompously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunil sighed, \"I suppose that was a legitimate win, Vinnie. I will eat\" He then dejectedly walked to his bowl with another portion in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hesitated a little. As he reached for it, he had second thoughts about going through with it. But he knew this is what he signed up for. \"Bottoms up\" he thought, as he flipped the dish upside down, letting it fall down his throat. His bloated stomach surged directly outwards with the food and he now sported a belly as big as a basketball. Little did he know that if he ate again, the fat wouldn't particularly go to his stomach...his destiny was a bit more pear shaped...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Sunil got to pick the next challenge. \"I say we compete in a-</span></div></div>",

Unless he could think about something this would be over very quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when he noticed something. He noticed that the Mawashi Vinnie was wearing looked to sit a bit loose around him. \"Since I had Penny Ling doing mine and Vinnie had the other girls doing his, his one must have not gotten as tightly strapped as mine.\" Sunil thought, feeling just how tightly his own sat around both his front and back. That's when a light started to come up in his head. \"I think I just found a way to beat Vinnie, even if the method I will use could be a bit <i>below the belt</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Russell shouted \"GO!\" both fighters grabbed the sides of the other ones Mawashi, but instead of doing what Vinnie was expecting him to (Pushing and/or pulling) Sunil took and dive for the floor. While still holding the belt/loin cloth tightly in his grip Sunil managed to pull the thing of Vinnie's body, and leaving it dangling around his ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinnie's first reaction to this was to release the grip of Sunil's Mawashi and start covering his \"private parts\" with his hands. (Even thought just like we said in the last chapter Vinnie and all the other pets where mostly \"naked\" all the other times.) While doing that Sunil took the chance to untangle the knot the Mawashi had, making it one long belt instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith it Sunil then took quickly and made a new smaller, tighter, knot around Vinnie's ankles. With it finished Sunil backed away to really see what he had done. He had managed to successfully tie together Vinnie's legs so that he couldn't even move from the spot he stood in. Thanks to his large belly he couldn't bend over and untie it either. What's worse was that he was standing very close to the edge of the ring, and it wouldn't take much for Sunil to make him lose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith just a very carful push Sunil sent Vinnie tumbling backwards and out of the ring. The force of the heavy Vinnie hitting the floor actually made the ground around them shake a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe what just happen, but Sunil is the winner!\" Russell announced, both he and the rest being very taken by the \"David beating Goliath\" story that they had just witnessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one having the hardest time believing what just happen was Vinnie, who was so sure he had picked a challenge only he could have won. \"How did that Sunil even do that?\" He asked himself, as he got help getting up and getting untied. \"You can think about that while you take your fourth portion.\" Sunil said, as Vinnie made his way to the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost getting used being here now Vinnie went down eating, getting more food stored in his stomach, that was being turned into more fat, that was making his already heavy body even heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt even more humiliated then before since this was the game he had been having all the odds for him to win, and just because he lowered his guard that mongoose came in and made him lose. But he was going to show him. This time he was prepared for that trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce finished (And having gained about another feet of belly length.) Vinnie said that he wanted to challenges Sunil to another game of Sumo, but that's when he heard a Russell saying that he couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why not?\" He asked, both upset and confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because that goes against rule 48 in the \"Sunil VS Vinnie: Food Fight\" rulebook.\" Russell said, and hold up a small book with a cover picture of Sunil and Vinnie in a fighting pose against each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, when did you have time to make that one?\" Penny Ling asked Russell, who calmly answered \"I did some writing on it in-between challenges. Minka helped me with the cover.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always ready for any requests!\" Minka added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what was this rule 48 thing?\" Vinnie asked, still not being answered to why he couldn't pick Sumo again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rule 48 says, and I quote. <i>In a game of Food Fight a competitor can't pick a game that either he/she or his/her opponent has picked before, but must in stead choose a completely new game. This in order to keep the game more interesting as time goes on</i>.\" Russell said while reading from the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I can't pick Sumo, or any other stuff that I know I'm good at?\" Vinnie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it has been chosen before then no.\" Russell said plain and simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah man.\" Vinnie said, having to think out something else now. Something neither he or Sunil had done before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some thinking Vinnie think's he has found something that hasn't been done yet, and says...</span></div></div>",

Really?\" Vinnie said, sounding disappointed over his opponents choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I have never heard about this before could you please tell me what this thing is?\" Russell asked Sunil, who looked like he didn't know what he had just suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...You all know how in typical Rock, Paper, Scissors you just use your hands to do the items, but in <i>Extreme</i> Rock, Paper, Scissors you use real items.\" Sunil said trying to sound as convincing as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting.\" Russell said quietly to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And instead of doing the ordinary way with the rock beating the Scissors, the Paper beating the Rock, and the Scissors beating the Paper. In my game you instead take an item and uses it on the item where it would be considered the weak one. Meaning that if you choose the Rock you must use it to beat the Paper, the Paper will try to beat the Scissors, and the Scissors will try to beat the Rock. And it is the one first beating their stronger item that wins.\" Sunil said as he finished his explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe really hoped that what he had just made up would work, because he couldn't for the heat of the moment figure out anything else that he and Vinnie could do for challenges. At first it didn't look like nobody was going to get it, but then he they heard Russell speak up saying \"I think this is pretty genius.\" It was just what Sunil needed to hear, since Russell's words made the other pets go from \"unsure\" to \"liking\" Sunil's challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to give Sunil and Vinnie each a rock, a paper, and a couple of Scissors.\" Russell said, as he once again took upon himself the role of the judge for the contest. it didn't take long for the other pets to gather around a two similar size and shaped rock, a equally large piece of paper, and two couple of scissors that was in the right size so the pets could use them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You both first choose one item, and then on my signal you both start to like Sunil said <i>beat</i> the stronger item.\" Russell said, before letting Sunil and Vinnie walk over and choose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Sunil had been the one choosing it, he was still as clueless as Vinnie was. He just wanted to choose something unexpected and make it sound awesome, and that had now made him standing next to a rock, a paper, and some scissors wondering what to do with them. Seeing that Vinnie had already chosen the rock. To thinking more then that \"Paper beats Rock\" Sunil picked up the piece of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You both starts on my signal.\" Russell said, before giving the count of three to them. On three he also said \"GO!!\" and both Sunil and Vinnie hurried towards the opposite items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinnie was quick to attack the paper, hitting the paper with the rock until he had managed to cut it into two pieces. \"I WON!!!\" He shouted, celebrating his second victory in a row. But his cheers where quickly broken by Russell saying \"I don't think so.\" \"WHAT?!\" Vinnie shouted. \"If it was so simple as cutting it in two it wouldn't be much of a challenge, wouldn't it?\" He asked Vinnie, who answered with half mumbling \"No it wouldn't'.\" \"But what do you think would be enough of a challenge?\" He asked, with Russell picking up a very small piece of paper. \"If you can make all the pieces this small I would say you are the winner.\" Russell said, giving Vinnie the small piece. \"Oh, man.\" He said, knowing how much work it would take for him to get the whole paper like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunil on the other hand was just stunned. Looking at the pair of scissors and then on the paper in his hand he had no idea how to be able to \"break\" them. \"It would probably have been easier to cut through a rock with the scissors.\" He thought as he tried to figure out what to do. Literally minutes went by, and while Vinnie was doing his best to cut down the paper into tiny bits with his rock Sunil still wasn't any closer on find the solution to his challenge. He walked over to the scissors and tested how good the jaws would work when something finally striked him! The screw. The screw holding the two scissor blades was the key to winning. \"If I just stick a corner of the paper in and uses it as a screwdriver I could separate the blades and make the scissor useless.\" Sunil thought and finally got the motivation to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like he planned he stuck a corner of the paper into the screw of the Scissors and started trying to unscrew it. But by this time Vinnie had managed to get about 90% of the paper cut down into pieces that was tiny enough for Russell, so it was still a tight race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunil started to feel the screw getting loser, but could also see Vinnie being almost done and having Russell controlling his pieces. Was he going to be finish first, or would he lose it to Vinnie?</span></div></div>",

He wanted stop and try again, but he heard Vinnie remind him, \"You only get one shot at this! If you stop now you lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunil understood that he needed to keep going and try to push himself to go louder, even thought nothing seemed to change. While Vinnie's had lasted only about ten seconds Sunil got his going for about a minute before feeling the pressure drop inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce finished he understood that he had still not manage to be anywhere near Vinnie's level of burping. \"I'm impressed man.\" Sunil said, while putting his hand on Sunil's shoulder. \"That was probably the longest burp I've seen anyone do. But we both know that we said that it was the loudest one that would win.\" \"And that means I lost.\" Sunil said depressed. \"Don't take it so hard Sunil. I choose this game because I knew I was good at it, after you have had your meal you will be the one to choose what we will do next.\" Vinnie said. \"Yeah, you're right.\" Sunil said, sounding more positive now. \"So go over to your food bowl, eat up, and then choose something that you know you are good at.\" Vinnie said to encourage Sunil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith much more confidence in himself Sunil walked back to his food bowl to eat an extra portion of his lunch, and then find something to kick Vinnie's butt in. His confidence didn't feel as good once he stood in front of his bowl, and felt how his fullness from drinking the soda was coming back. Still he knew the rules, and if he didn't eat now he wouldn't be able to challenge Vinnie later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave it his first bite and felt that it could still go. He still like the taste of his food, and if he just continue to take these small bite he might get it all down rather painless. He didn't feel the same when he was halfway through. Now he really felt like he was getting as full as can be. All he wanted was to quit right there, but seeing Vinnie watching him (and waiting for him to give up) was good enough reasons to why he had to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing the last part of food inside his mouth Sunil laid back rubbing his painfully round belly. It felt like he was going to explode if he did anything that would involve to much movement. \"Well Sunil, what kind of challenge will you choose?\" Vinnie asked, looking like he could take on anything right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunil know that in his current state he wasn't going to be able to do much physical things. Maybe if he got to rest until a third challenge his stomach might become calm enough. So first thing to do should be something that wouldn't involve much work on his parts, and it being hard for Vinnie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some thinking Sunil decided to choose...</span></div></div>",

Blythe sighs as she tries to push the pets through to the door. \"Sure guys, but it's going take me a while guys\" Blythe responds to Zoe. the pets groan in unison; Blythe starts to push the pets through the doorway, as they get out of the door they roll into the playroom screaming and crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey tumble into the wall and each one fly in every direction, when they halt they were all dizzy, they all stumble around. they bump into each other; they fall over onto the floor,they all are grasping for air to get their breath back.\"Is everybody ok...\" Russell asks the others, the others try to get up as they help each other up, they look at each other they thank the ones that helped them up \"Thank you Pepper\" Zoe said to Pepper, \"No problem Zoe, anytime\" \"Thanks Vinnie\" Penny-Ling says to Vinnie.

His goal was to make the water inside a glass he was holding in front of him with on hand to levitate over his head, and then down into another glass he was holding with his other hand. Standing silently in a corner away from everyone else, Sunil took a deep breath and started focusing. As he focused he could feel the water rise from the glass, and start moving over his head. Just as it was right above him, he heard the voice of someone who had been walking up to him. \u201cHey Sunil, what are you doing?\u201d Taken completely out of his mediation the water above his head fell down on him. \u201cOh my god, I am so sorry! I didn\u2019t mean to disrupt you when you where doing something important!\u201d The voice said with lots of guilt. Rubbing the water out of his eyes Sunil saw that the one speaking was Penny Ling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad it been anyone else Sunil would have told them how angry he was that they interrupted him while he was doing some complicated tricks, but as soon as he saw that it was Penny Ling his whole anger over being disturbed seemed to just disappear. Seeing her beautiful eyes and hearing her cute giggle over seeing him all wet made Sunil laugh a little at it as well. \u201cI only come here to tell you that its time for Mrs. Twombly to feed us. I didn\u2019t know that you where busy practicing your magic.\u201d \u201cOh, that\u2019s nothing to apologize for.\u201d Sunil said blushing slightly. \u201cI-I\u2019m just gonna clean up my act here first, and then I will join you and other pets for feeding.\u201d Sunil said slightly nervous. \u201cO-Okay. See you soon.\u201d Penny Ling said, also sounding slightly nervous and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile cleaning up the water from the floor Sunil thought about why he always acted so strange when Penny Ling was around. When all the other pets where near them to he didn\u2019t feel anything but when it was just he and her, he felt so strange inside. He felt like a fire started had started up inside of him. He got all sweaty and nervous too, and felt like he was about to faint whenever she got really close to him. \u201cI think I remember my mommy telling me about these feelings when I was just a kid,\u201d Sunil thought to himself, \u201cShe told me that she had felt the same way when she meet my father.\u201d \u201cShe told me that this thing is called\u2026\u201d Sunil paused as everything became clear to him. \u201cLove\u201d He said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should he do now?</span></div></div>",

All those times when he and Penny Ling had been close to each other, or he had even just stared his eyes at her he had felt love? Thinking about it more another thought entered his head. \u201cWas Penny Ling also in love with me?\u201d looking back at it there had been times when Penny Ling had just walked up to talk to him without any real reason, and every time she had always looked just as nervous to speak as him. She had also looked a bit sweaty to speak and seemed to have problem keeping her eyes on focus on him, just like he had with her. Putting two and two together, Sunil finally saw the great picture in front of him. He was in love with Penny Ling, and she was in love with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cleaning up Sunil went to join the others to get his food. They all had there own individual bowl where they would get their food in. when Sunil got there he saw that almost all of it was eaten. \u201cWhat? But who would do something like that\u2026\u201d was all Sunil manage to say before getting interrupted by a small burp. Looking behind him he saw Penny Ling sitting there rubbing her slightly outlined belly. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry! I had just eaten my own food but felt I needed some more so I looked at your bowl and thought he wouldn\u2019t notice if I took just a little but when I started eating I lost control over myself and just eat and eat and managed to stop just when there was only very little left and I hoped that you wouldn\u2019t notice.\u201d Penny Ling rambled in panic, tears starting to form in her eyes. \u201cTake it easy Penny Ling. It\u2019s no problem.\u201d Sunil said trying to calm Penny Ling down. \u201cI\u2019ve actually\u2026thought about going on a diet.\u201d \u201cR-Really?\u201d Penny Ling asked sweeping her tears of her eyes. Sunil took and put her hand into his, and as they did this Sunil could feel this warm feeling start rising again. \u201cYep, we are definitely in love.\u201d Sunil thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling all mixed up by the emotions going through him Sunil thought about what would be the next step to do with his and Penny Lings love. \u201cWhat I remembered my mum told me was that the first thing my father did when they had seen each other was to take her to a date. He had taken her to a place to eat, and once their eating was done he told her his true feeling about her. So the logical thing to do is to do the exact same thing, the only questions is where can I find a place to take Penny Ling out for a dinner date?\u201d Sunil though just as the answer came jumping straight into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it that could help him?</span></div></div>",

They both hit the ground and Buttercream was the first one to apologies. \u201cOh, I'm sorry! I thought about all kind of sweet, elite, flavors of candy I could create when I jumped right into yourself Sunil.\" She said in a very fast rapid pace. (Both being a rabbit and having a huge consuming of sugar made her whole persona very hyperactive and fast talking.) \"I'm the one to apologies to you, since I was to busy trying to think out some good place for a dinner date.\" \"A dinner date? Oh! Who are you having feelings for?\" Buttercream asked curiously. \"What? Me? No, no, I-I'm not having a lover. I'm doing this for a friend.\" Sunil tried to lie, but he could see that Buttercream wasn't buying it. \"Oh, why did I have to tell her my secret plans?\" Sunil thought to himself. \"Fine. It's Penny Ling.\" Sunil said, finally giving up trying to hide it. \"The Panda?\" Buttercream said in a some what surprised tone. \"What? Is it something wrong?\" Sunil asked. \"No. No. It's just that I saw you becoming pared together with Pepper instead. You know your looks, your personalities. It just felt more right.\" Buttercream said blushing a bit. \"Pepper? I like her as a friend don't take me wrong, but I don't feel the same for her as I do for Penny Ling.\" Sunil said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right, but do you have a plan for how your lovery-smugery dinner will be?\" Buttercream asked Sunil. \"I haven't got very far since sadly there isn't many places for pets to date.\" Sunil said sadly, feeling like this date would never be able to work. Buttercream too felt sorry for Sunil's sake until she got an idea so bright and good that it made her jump around Sunil like crazy for getting so excited to tell him. \"I guess by your behavior that you have figured out a way for my plan to work?\" Sunil said knowing his friend's behavior well. \"I figured out the bestest most perfect place for two love-bonding mammals like you and Penny Ling to hang out in.\" \"Oh, tell me.

As you two walk in I acts like I have forgot something for your date, and that's when you two get trapped. I tell you through the door that I will go and find a way to fix it, and leave you alone. With Penny Ling knowing that I'm out there trying to find a way to fix you out she will be more clam down about the situation, and you two will both be able to have the most cuddly-duddly date you want without the worries of someone interrupting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like it?\" She finished asking. \"Like it? I think this is a GENIUS PLAN!\" Sunil said so loudly that he almost got the other pets attention. Quickly calming himself down he said to Buttercream in an almost whispering tone. \"In that way Penny Ling and me would be all alone all night if we want to.\" \"And since I will be preparing the whole thing I will be fixing all the settings and the food for also.\" Buttercream added. \"All you need to do is to ask her out to follow you to it. Think you can do that?\" She asked a bit cocky. \"Oh believe me. If you fix up for tonight I will make sure to have Penny Ling with me for the evening.\" Sunil said back in a very similar tone. \"Then make sure to have her by my so called private place at around 19:00, and I will be having almost everything done. \"No problems, Buttercream.\" Sunil said with much confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater when he actually was standing near Penny Ling (Who was having her back turned against him) he didn't feel as much confident anymore. \"Come on Sunil!\" He thought to himself,\" You can do it. Buttercream is taking care of everything else and you only need to ask her to join you.\" With all his inner strength he took and carefully tapped on Penny Ling's shoulder. She turned around and looked at Sunil with her cute eyes. \"Yes? Was it something you wanted?\" She asked and gave Sunil a cute wink. \"I-I...\" Sunil stuttered, unable to say a single word. \"Come on Sunil!\" His inner voice said. \"You can't back away, so just say it!\" \"Would you...\" Sunil said before taking a quick pause. \"Yes?\" Penny ling asked curious. \"Want to..\" He continued before taking another quick pause. \"Yes?\" Penny Ling asked even more interested. \"Followmetothepantry?\" Sunil said quickly. Penny Ling had to think for a moment to separate the words from Sunil's rushed ending before asking. \"Why do you want me to go there?\" \"Well, there's a...\" Sunil said before feeling his nerves grab him again. \"Don't stop now, Sunil! You have already asked the question. Tell her!\" \"A...Surprise.\" Sunil finally said. \"A surprise?\" Penny Ling asked. \"Yes a surprise, and if you follow me you will see it.\" Sunil said and reached out his hand to Penny Ling. Without any second thought Penny Ling took his had and was being lead to the pantry. \"Well, I guess this could work.\" Sunil thought to himself. \"This whole thing was technically meant as a surprise for her, and when I tell her my feeling for her it will become another surprise.\"</span></div></div>",

If you follow me in we can see it together.\" Sunil said and took her hand and lead her inside.

And nobody knows we are in her, AGAIN!\" Penny Ling shouted, almost starting to cry. \"So, so Penny Ling keep it together. This time we aren't forgotten.

Just stay where you are and I'll get help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay where you are?!\" Penny Ling said, sounding a bit more upset now. \"Where else do you think we would be going?\" She asked, but Buttercream had already left so she was left without any answer. \"Great, what are we suppose to do now while we wait?\" Penny Ling asked still a bit upset over the whole thing. \"Oh, I think I know something we can do.\" Sunil said and pointed to where there was a nice small table with two nice small chair and some small plates with some delicate sweets served up. \"And if you still would be feeling a bit hungry I think Buttercream or her owners wouldn't mind if we took some of this.\" He said and pointed at all the stocked up candy that was surrounding them. Before Penny Ling got a chance to answer she heard he stomach make a growling noise. \"I guess we can eat a little while we wait.\" She said as she stared walking to the table. \"I just fed her up a bit, and then when she's feeling a bit more softer inside I'll take and tell her I love her.\" Sunil thought as he started following her to the dinning table.</span></div></div>",

The table was twice as long as they where tall and half as wide, and filled to every corner with little snacks. There was hard candy, soft candy, sour candy, filled candy, and tons of different chocolate dishes. All with a huge barrel like container carrying several gallons of soda to wash it down with. For almost a minute they both just stood there admiring the huge amount of food there was just for them. It wasn't until Sunil looked over at Penny Ling and said \"Well, shall we?\" before they decided to sit down and start eating. Penny Ling was about to grab a piece and eat when Sunil stopped her. She was about to ask why when she saw him carrying something that was hidden behind the table. It was a couple of small (small for a human) plastic cups that he placed down with the backs up next to the table. He then took on of them and pulled it back a bit, and gave Penny Ling a hint of coming over and sit down. Penny Ling understood and walked up to him and as she started sitting down Sunil took and pushed the cup back into the table like he had seen people do to at dates in movies. \"Oh, such a gentleman.\" Penny Ling said, surprised to see Sunil act so super nice to her. \"I couldn't let myself let a lady have to sit on her own.\" Sunil said, trying to put on the charm. \"Oh Sunil, you have been acting so polite lately.\"  Penny Ling said being back at her normal happy self again. \"It's like something wonderful must have come into your life.\" \"You could say that it is something like that.\" Sunil said, and got once again lost in the beauty of the panda girl's eyes.</span></div></div>",

Every time she seemed interested in tasting something that was out of reached for her he wouldn't just get it for her, he would go so far as to hand feed her personally so all she had to do would be to lean back and enjoy the sugary richness of it.

He had been given so many chances to tell Penny Ling about how he feel for her while feeding her, and he had flunked every time. He had even started to hand feed her things that was just right next to her just for another chance to try and speak, and even thought it didn't make any different in Sunil it definitely made a different in Penny Ling. While Sunil had been eating based on how big his own hunger was, Penny Ling had been eating both based on how hungry she had been and by her own polite of not wanting to say no to Sunil's offer to feed her. Even as time went on and Sunil started to feed her things she hadn't even asked for she didn't have it in her heart to tell him no when he was putting down so much effort to please her. She was know for being able to store a lot of food inside of her, but even she felt like she was reaching her limits!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer otherwise slightly potbelly that she had been carrying was now stretched out to half a feet in length, (Which was huge for someone her small size) and it wasn't just expanding straight out but to the sides as well, making it even more clear of her new \"rounder\" body shape. With all this food still being digested inside of her and with Sunil right next to her prepared to feed her another cinnamon bun Penny Ling said something she wouldn't have want to say during this whole day, \"No please, no more. I'm feeling so full.\" She really didn't want to say it since she didn't want to appear as mean to him, but she had to know where her own limitations where. \"Oh okay.\" Sunil said a bit surprised, but looking down at his lover's swollen middle he could clearly see that she should have told him off a long time ago. \"I'm actually starting to feel a bit full right now as well.\" which was true, Sunil was also sporting a slight out rounded belly by now. Looking over at the table he could see that he and Penny Ling had together been eating about a third of the huge buffet that had been given to them, so it would make sense that they both would feel a bit full now, but that came with a huge problem now for Sunil. With no more food to give to Penny Ling he wouldn't have no other choice then to...try and talk to her! </span></div></div>",

Feeling he couldn't hold his breath in any longer Sunil exhaled and said, \"Are you still feeling worried about being locked in?\" Penny Ling looked surprised at him and Sunil felt like he had ruined just about everything. He put his face in his palms and was waiting to hear Penny Ling either cry or getting angry, but to his surprise all he heard was her calmly voice saying \"No, I don't think so.\" Looking up he saw Penny Ling's cute face still being as happy as she always is. \"I'm feeling a bit uncomfortable in my tummy because of all the food I ate, but except for that I feel fine.\" She said and hold her hands on it, trying to make it feel better.</span></div></div>",

He had been closer to her before feeding her, but this felt a bit more private in a way. Nevertheless he looked up and asked Penny Ling if she was ready and she said \"Yes.\" back to him. After a few more seconds of concentration Sunil took and placed the fingertips of his paws on Penny Ling belly. Starting slowly and with almost no force in his pressing Sunil wanted to first feel just how thick the pains where before going further, and when he had a idea of what was the right level to work on he started for real. Once he started to think more about Penny Ling's stomach instead of her Sunil started to work like an almost professional massager. He let his paws move softly all over her wide round middle, poking at any soft spots he could find, and doing some grabs and shakings with it to help work out her digestions of the food. After a while he could her Penny Ling staring to make some moaning sounds, and he could feel her middle parts getting more softer. Once he felt that he was done Sunil let go of Penny Ling's belly and saw how she slipped of her own chair, and laid herself on her back on the floor. Standing up and looking down at her Sunil asked, \"How does it feel now?\" \"It feels wonderful!\" Penny Ling said, as she was massaging her own belly, trying to do exactly as he had done. Looking down at her Sunil saw that her stomach hadn't changed size, but from how it was moving when Penny Ling was pressing her paws at it Sunil came to the conclusion that his massage had made all the food inside of her digest quicker, and was now all a part of this panda girl's frame. \"Sunil.\" He heard Penny Ling say. \"Yes?\" He asked nicely. \"Come down her and feel my belly.\" She said in a tone that sounded a bit seductive. Sunil could feel his whole body temperature rising with several degrees as he started to lower his hand to feel at her belly once again. But when he was just on his way to touch it he heard her say, \"No. Lay down next to me.\"</span></div></div>",

She put it on the highest point of her sphere shaped stomach. \"Do you feel it?\" Penny Ling asked Sunil, who took a few moments to really feel on it until he said \"No, what is it?\" \"You made my tummy happy.\" Penny Ling said sounding very happy herself. Sunil didn't answer, he just felt very happy himself being so close to the one he loves. \"If only I could say it now, everything would be perfect.\" Sunil thought, and he was on his way to try and speak when Penny Ling interrupted. \"Sunil. I want to tell you something, if it's okay with you.\" \"Sure Penny Ling. What was it you wanted to say?\" Sunil said, with a little bit of frustration inside. \"I have been having this strangest feeling for a long time, and I think it has to do with that I like you.\" Penny Ling said. \"Well...I like you too Penny Ling.\" Sunil said, unsure if she had just said what he thought she said. \"No, I mean I like like you.\" She said this time a bit more shy. \"You mean that you...\" \"Love you? Of course I do.\" Penny Ling said and hugged him. \"Well, I have to say that I think I like like you the same way.\" Sunil managed to say, which was being hard, not only because of his shyness but also because he was getting almost no air when he was getting hugged by Penny Ling. \"Oh Sunil, why haven't you said this before?\" Penny Ling asked hugging him even harder. \"It hasn't feel right until now so to say.\" Sunil answered with some force. \"Especially now when you said it first.\" Sunil thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continue to hug each other Sunil and Penny Ling felt that they where on their way to have their first kiss.

But as he grabbed some new candy to use he could see Penny Ling getting back into her angry side, and instead of coming towards him with her full force she seemed to pick up some candy as well. Knowing that she could probably find a way to choke him with that as well Sunil didn't waste any time and started to charge towards her, just as she was doing towards him.

I was sleeping when my owners brought me here. Remember? I slept in until an hour ago.\"<br>\r\n\"Pepper? Russell continued, \"When did you last see Sunil and Penny Ling?\"<br>\r\n\"When we all ate our lunch earlier today. It was when Sunil got all mad at whoever ate his food. I didn't see who ate it though, I was too busy eating mine.\" Pepper said.<br>\r\n\"Hmm, how about you, Buttercream? Where did you last see them?\" Russell asked unaware of her fear of the question.<br>\r\nButtercream had a very hard time keeping the truth inside her. \"Um-uh...\" she stuttered as she began sweating heavily. Her ears were twitching which was a clear giveaway that she was nervous. \"At lunch...yeah! Like what Pepper said! Definitely. Totes my goats! He was for surely absolutely positively definitely for serious at lunch!\" she said hurriedly with a nervous smile.<br>\r\n\"Ooookaaay\" said Russell. He didn't expect anything less from Buttercream. He was used to her scatterbrained thoughts and jabbering.<br>\r\n\"I guess we're going to have to search without a clue on where to start.\"<br>\r\nShe was in the clear...for now.</span></div></div>",

What the... \" She looked surprised at the morbidly obese girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had seen fat kids before but not even near as fat as they were. In a few hours their parents came to pick them up. If the looked like this they need to answer some difficult questions. Questions she did't had a  answer for. She had't an idea what was going on.<br>\r\nSuddenly the girls saw her. Happily they jumped at her and their combined weight pushed her to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlythe oped her eyes and rubbed her head. She moved so hard she rolled out of bed. Sleepy she opened her eyes. What a strange dream. Some people say dreams tell something about the future. She sure hoped that was't the case here. If all kids suddenly became obese. Then they would't fit the clothes anymore Blythe made for them. Yeah she made clothes for them and many people liked it to buy her clothes for their kids.<br>\r\nShe looked at her clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What this late already. I need to hurry or else I'm late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fast got dressed and jumped in the dumb waiter and entered the littlest day care.<br>\r\nYou had Zoe Trent. White girl with purple and pink hair who had a great sense of fashion, and loved trying on clothes and wanted to become a model. Especially a model for the clothes of Blythe.<br>\r\nMinka Mark. A white, happy, active girl that was kind of artistic in her own way, and always wore colorful clothing. She had white hair in two tails.<br>\r\nPepper Mildred Clark. A white girl with her white hair in a pony tail and also a lock of hair partly for her face who always loved telling jokes and do funny things. She wanted to become a comedian.<br>\r\nPenny Ling. The sweetest girl at daycare. White but with black hair that nicely fell around her face. She was very friendly helpful but also a bit sensitive and loved dancing with her ribbons.<br>\r\nRussel Ferguson. Small boy with spiky hair who loved hanging out with Blythe and tried to lead the others as good if he could.<br>\r\nSenil was a tanned boy with green blue hair who loved doing magic tricks, but it was easy to scare him.<br>\r\nAnd of course Vincent (Vinnie) Alfonso Terrio. A white boy with green hair that loved dancing. Not too bright but he was also a part of the group.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Blythe can you help me? My hair is a mess thanks to the wind. It's blowing so hard outside.\" Zoe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlythe smiled and carefully combed Zoe's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There so good as new. Now I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was suddenly cut of by a ripping sound and a loud scream. Blythe moaned she knew exactly what that mend and walked over to a corner of the day care. There was Minka. With a few yard of tape curled around her. This was't very unusual. It happened about once a week. If Minka used taped she ended on the ground, tape around her stuck in the strangest positions. Just like now. Blythe walked over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really Minka? Again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and tape have a hate-love relationship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It loves you so much it does't want to get separated from you.\" Blythe mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a scissor and carefully cut Minka free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful. Don't get that stuff in your hair. Else I need  to cut your hair. I used to cut the hair of my dolls and... I was't so good in it. Those poor dolls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I paint now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not without a apron.\" Blythe said clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinka was good in painting in her own style. But Blythe also knew that while doing it she sometimes go so excited that she ended up with more paint on her clothes then on her paper.<br>\r\nAfter Minka got her apron there was a knock on the door Blythe opened the door and saw Youngmee. She hold a white, chubby girl with blond hair tight by her wrist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Blythe. I'm  just here to drop of Buttercream.\" She said and let go of the girls wrist that laughing ran inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think she eats a bit too much Sugar?\" Blythe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well she's a candy addict, and my aunt owns a candy shop. You do the math. By the way. How is it with us, you-know-what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm working on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed the door and looked around. Minka was painting, Vinnie, Russel and Senil were in the reading corner looking through some books and Pepper was doing some stand up comedy for Zoe, Penny Ling and Buttercream.<br>\r\nShe fast got some paper out of her bag and started on what Youngmee asked. A design for some clothing. There would be a customized party in a few weeks and you needed to make your costume by yourself. The person or persons with the best costume would get a prize. Blythe, Youngmee, Sue and Jasper decided to join together. The also decided that Blythe need to design the clothes for them. Jasper, Youngmee and Sue would get the stuff, and together they would make the costumes. Blythe fast started working. Just when she was done coloring it she heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That looks nice. I would love to wear that.\" Zoe said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This? Sorry Zoe but it;s way too big for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe was bit shocked. After hearing the stuff was too big for her. It made her feel like she was too small and thin for nice clothes. Of course that was't what Blythe mend, but that's how Zoe understand it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what's up Zoe?\" Pepper asked. \"You look like someone died.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw some new designs from Blythe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they that bad?\" Penny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No they look great. But Blythe said they were way too big for me. But it would look so good at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But for who was it then. You and I are about the same size. Minka is even thinner then us. Penny and Buttercream are perhaps a few sizes bigger but not that much. So why would that clothing be so much bigger?\" Pepper asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is't for the boys. It's obvious for a girl. But am I too thin?\" Zoe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust the Blythe stood up and went too the bathroom. The four girls fast looked at her sketches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right they all look great. But Blythe said they were too big for us?\" Penny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked over too Minka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm done with my new painting. Wanna see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Minka. We're not in the mood.\" Zoe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Blythe made some new clothes.\" Penny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Minka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are fantastic... but too big for us. Or we're too little for them.\" Zoe said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's too bad. Hee I have an idea.\" Minka said excited. \"If they are too big for us... we just need to become bigger. Gain some weight!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others looked at each other. None of the others thought about that, but it sounded very logical.     <br>\r\n         <br>\r\n\"Well it's for Blythe and her clothes. For that I will gain a few pounds. Who's with me?\" Zoe said and stuck out her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am.\" Pepper said and put her hand on Zoe's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\" Minka said and put her on Pepper's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like if you have too ask?\" Penny said and put her hand on Minka's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I suppose so.\" Buttercream said and also put her hand on Penny's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're gonna gain weight so we can wear Blythe's new clothes.\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlythe looked at the clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's almost lunchtime. Time to get the food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Trombly wanted the kids to have a good meal once a day. So she always made sure every day there were different kinds of food to choose from. Every kid took a plate and took what they liked from the food. It worked pretty well. Blythe put the food ready and waited for the kids.<br>\r\n All the girls ran over to be the first in line and each piled their plates high with food. When she saw all the girls walked to their table with full with food she wondered what was going on. There was way more food on their plates then usually. At least on the plates of the girls. The boys took the normal amount.<br>\r\nBlythe once heard that children knew exactly when they had enough bus still she thought this was kind of strange. Why did all girls suddenly at the same time eat more?<br>\r\n Penny Ling and Buttercream always used to be a bit chubby. Pepper and Zoe were normal sized and Minka was as thin as a rail. So why were they suddenly eating so much?  <br>\r\nDid they perhaps had a contest who could eat the most? Blythe knew they could be very competitive sometimes. If that was the case she should't worry too much. That would be over the next day.<br>\r\nShe walked over too the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything all right here?\" She asked suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything is fine. Why do you ask?\" Zoe said trying to stay calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then. But just be a bit careful with how much you eat. If you eat more then you tummy can handle it comes back out again.  I rather don't spend the rest of the day cleaning up your barf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think she suspects anything?\" Pepper asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I don't think so.\" Zoe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure hope those new clothes are worth eating all this.\" Minka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you saw those clothes right.\" Zoe said. .   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls are were able (to Blythe's surprise) to eat all the food they piled on their plates. However Blythe saw them after wards all five moaning and rubbing their swollen bellies  in the reading corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I do anything about this?\" She asked herself. \"I know I need to watch those kids but...I mean it's not like they are on a diet or something. If I deny them more food their parents's can complain. Who am I to say how much they should allow their child to eat? Well maybe tomorrow everything is all back to normal.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I tried them on and... well they ripped and I'm really sorry. I did't do it on purpose. It was a accident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zoe. Accidents happen. But why did you try to wear my designs when I told you they were too big for you. I always make clothes for you and the others. Don't take my designs if I don't want you too. Now I need to repair them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry Blythe, but I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zoe I'm really angry at you. You gonna have a time out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe sadly walked too the time out spot. She felt really bad. She admit that she kind of deserved this. At least she did't betrayed the others. But why were't that clothes for her. They looked so good.<br>\r\nIn the meantime Blythe looked at the clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can repair them. It just needs a few stitches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew Zoe would't be in time out to long. She could't stay mad too long at those kids. After all Zoe said she was sorry and seemed to feel really bad. Besides that she wanted to wear her clothes. That was kind of flattering. But still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those clothes are't for them but for me.  I and the others worked so hard. We have a good chance to win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put the clothes in her bag and walked back to the other kids. The boys were still playing catch. But the girls were standing together whispering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the clothes are to big for us. According to what Blyte said.\" Pepper said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I would't  try them on again without Blythe's permission. I never saw her so angry. Not even that time when Vinnie put insects in your drink and you barfed over some schoolbooks.\" Penny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank for reminding me of that. He wanted to show me what's funny, well that was't funny.\" Pepper said angry<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was funny for him.\" Minka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does't matter right now. How are we gonna be able to wear those new clothes from Blythe. We're not big enough for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't wait until we grew enough. We grow very slowly.\" Penny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we can become bigger If we eat more!\" Minka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an idea. That way we  become bigger. Perhaps enough to fit in those clothes.\" Buttercream said.      <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not. I love a good meal.\" Pepper said.    </span></div></div>",
