He sighs, slowly turning over in bed, to smile at the utter love of his life.  Agumon, who is still laying on his side, fast asleep. Bajiir giggles, and looks down at his belly, pleased to see that it's round, and sexilly plump as it always is.  There is absolutely no sign of the bulges made by his dinner last night, a creature that Bajiir thinks is VERY lucky.<br>\r\nBajiir has known Agumon for a while now, but only relatively recently have they become full fledged mates.  They have enjoyed all kinds of things together, though Agumon is almost always the dominant one in the relationship.  Bajiir loves that though, he loves to snuggle, worship, and please his wonderful mate.  He knows that although Agumon is dominating and predatory, he's also loving, and knows how to treat his mate.<br>\r\nBajiir has been eaten by Agumon many times before, and been fully digested alive... An experience he finds to be quite, enjoyable, and arousing, even if it's agonizing and slow.  He has always been reformed, though, Bajiir knows that when his time to go comes, he would MUCH desire it to be in the belly of his beloved Agumon.  Of course, since everytime he is eaten his reformation is decided by Agumon, that day may come sooner or later then Bajiir might think.<br>\r\nBajiir beams and leans close, to give his mate a loving slurp, and reaches down to stroke over his sexy, plump, smooth belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgumon murrrrrs, then suddenly belches in Bajiir's face, making him smell the putrid, fresh scent of digested flesh and the many other scents found in a predator's belly.  He murrrs, and stretches as he himself slowly wakes up. He opens his eyes, and smiles at Bajiir.</span></div></div>",

I wonder what it could be?\"<br>\r\nAgumon simply grins, and murrrs as he slides himself over his mate, until he's sitting on his stomach.

He murrrs some, and strokes it over, as it makes a loud, ravenous, greedy gurgle.  \"Mmmmm, oh I am feeling STARVED! I am so hungry and empty right now... and well, you always look soooo delicious...\" He murrrrs, making a very naughty, dirty smirk as he looks down at Bajiir.  He slurps his chops, and murrrs softly, as he scoots himself closer, then settles back again, rubbing his warm, plump rear against Bajiir's chest, letting him feel the warm, scaled backside; a part of his body that he knows Baj can't ever EVER get enough of... Not to mention many other parts as well.<br>\r\nBajiir moans, and trembles softly, already starting to feel quite aroused indeed, staring up at his mate, loving the position he's been put in, and, the sexy things his lover is starting to say. \"Ohhhh, but, you ate that BIG rabbit last night! That was enough to feed two preds! How can you be hungry already? How can you have digested him away, and made his life, not even worth a whole day's feeding?\"<br>\r\nAgumon makes a dirty smirk, and chuckles, as he strokes over his belly, \"Mmmm, I will admit, that Bunny felt gooooood in me... He struggled, thrashed, kicked, squirmed, and pleaded soooo wonderfully... Mmm, I loved his terror as I sloooowly digested him alive, feeling him slowly melt in me... And don't pretend you didn't too, you LOVED listening to his grisly demise in my belly, and putting yourself in his place...

But, that doesn't mean I wanna get eaten!\" He beams, knowing that Agumon will enjoy teasing and toying with him, and, having some fun before the feast...<br>\r\nAgumon smirks, and chuckles softly, looking down at Bajiir, slurping over his white teeth in a naughty, lewd way.

Afterall, EVERY predator should get to play with his food before he eats it alive!  \"Yeah, well, you know us FT, we're always eager to have our fun... I heard you and Fox having fun as well you know...\"<br>\r\nFT smirks, looking Agu and Bajiir over, knowing that they were preparing for breakfast, and also, that a hungry Agumon is the best Agumon to battle with.  He won't publically admit it, though both Agumon and Bajiir know, he really enjoys loosing to Agumon, and being eaten up by him... Though he certainly wouldn't complain about eating him one day!  \"Well, Fox is the ship's slut... So of course he's full of energy, and needs his big dragon to tap it! So, what were you two up to?\"<br>\r\nBajiir, who has spent this entire time staring at Agumon's belly, a somewhat worshipful, eager look in his eyes, speaks up, \"Oh, just this and that... you know..\" He murrrs, and leans up, giving Agumon's belly a firm, loving kiss, snuggling into it, and moaning soflty, as he hears the ravenous, hungry gurgles from inside... As well as the clunks of a few bones shifting around inside of him.  Either bones lodged in his innards, or the bones of that lucky bunny, Bajiir can't tell which... But he loves the noise either way, it's the sound of a healthy predator's belly!<br>\r\nFT chuckles, \"Well, if you two aren't up to much, maybe I should show Agumon that, in the morning, I am full of enough energy to beat him!\"<br>\r\nAgumon sighs, not so much beause he dislikes defeating and feasting on FT, but more because he was looking forward to actually playing with his food, and playing with his Baj AS food in particular... He looks at FT, then slides off of Bajiir, smiling at his moan of pleasure from feeling his rump slide along his body. He giggles, and rubs over his stomach where Baj kissed it, having much enjoyed that... He always loves how much love his mate shows him, and, how eager he always seems to be to do things with him...  He smirks at FT, \"So, shall we then?\"</span></div></div>",

I know you love scaley food in your scaley gut!\" He grins, as he reaches around the door frame, and produces a large platter; demonstrating that he had been planning this.  He lays it on the ground, then slowly lays himself on it, pulling his legs close, and putting his arms next to it, looking a lot like a tied up meal, without the ropes or apple.  He beams up at Agumon, \"Don't I look simply delicious? Don't you want to cook me up and gobble me down?\" He mmms and chuckles a little, feeling himself become aroused over this, eager to get eaten alive by Agumon, again!<br>\r\nBajiir sighs a little, as he sits up on the bed, putting his chin in his paw, watching this, feeling a little left out.  Lately it's felt like FT gets eaten by his Agumon a whole lot more then he does, and gets to do more with him... He doesn't want to be a controlling mate, but he still can't help feeling a touch jealous.  But for now, he sits there, watching his beloved Agu, knowing he'll enjoy this breakfast a lot.<br>\r\nAgu smirks a little, and slurps over his lips, drool starting to drip from the corners of his mouth. \"Mmmm, you do look delicous... Heh, maybe, I'll take you to the kitchen, and get some breakfast in my belly... Hmmm, I am not too sure what to cook you up for though....\" He smirks, reaching down, plucking the platter up, shoving FT's face into his belly, giggling as he starts walking along, letting the dragon listen to the ravenous gurgles from inside of his body, demanding meat, whoever's it is!<br>\r\nHe arrives in the kitchen, and smirks a little, \"Hmmm, maybe I'll fry you up, make you dragon bacon!\" He murrrrrs hungrilly to himself, more drool starting to slide from his lips, as he pulls out a frying pan, and gets it all ready for his breakfast, putting it on the stove, and turning it on.  He smirks down at FT, and rubs over his belly, \"Mmmm, soon, you'll be in here you know... And I'm gonna digest you away, and use your body to nourish and pleasure myself...\" he winks, \"and maybe someday, it'll be permanent, and you'll get to stay as part of me... Though, for now, I can eat you, then let you go back to your unsuspecting fox lover...\" He smirks, as he picks FT up, and places him in the frying pan, slurping his chops, as he listens to the sounds of his body starting to fry up deliciously, starting to get cooked up and prepared for his meal.

Soon, you'll be safely in me!\" He murrrs, and chuckles some, as he slurps over FT's head, then picks him up, and plops him down on the platter again.  He carries him over to the table, and sets him down, smirking some, as he puts a bib on himself, sporting a picture of his favorite meal, Bajiir, on a plate, looking delicious and sexy.  He murrrs, and reaches down, picking up FT, slurping his chops hungrilly, \"Mmmmm, you ready to go into me?\" he chuckles, and before FT can even respond, he opens up wide, and starts sliding him into his hungry, drooling, warm jaws, murrrring as he rubs his tongue over his body, tasting him, savoring his delicious flavor, and sighing to himself as he enjoys this.

He murrrrs happilly and rubs over his stomach, chuckling a little to himself, as he massages his belly, pushes into it, probing and feeling at his tasty prey within there, eager to feel his struggles, and to slowly digest him alive...

His soon-to-be meal was resting against his side, snoozing softly and unaware of the hungry avian's presence. Falco quietly stooped across the room, avoiding the scattered objects along the flooring before he halted in front of FT's bedside. Eying the green dragon's succulent body, Falco couldn't help himself but lick his beaked mouth, occasionally letting a strand of drool drip down to the bed. FT couldn't have provided an easier and better meal for Falco.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green dragon laid atop the blankets of the his bed with most of his clothing taken off. Boxers were the only thing to conceal any part of his scaled body, that appeared to by lightly hot. Falco guessed the sleeping dragon had been to hot for clothing or bedsheets, however he wouldn't complain. This allowed the salivating bird more room to taste his meal's true flavor and scaled hide. Falco stared deeply at the sleeping dragon, watching him lightly twitch every so often from a plausible dream he was experiencing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled and dared to placed a feathery hand along the dragon's thigh. FT's warm emerald scales roused Falco from the smooth touch, forcing him to rub along the reptile's calf softly. FT smiled in his droozy dream state, clinging to the mattress tightly as he mumbled gibberish words. Falco retreated his hand away, certain to not awaken the sleeping dragon. He had wasted enough admiring his food's tone form. He had a dragon to gobble up! Although, something held Falco back in eating FT right on the spot. Resist as he might, he couldn't stop gazing towards the dragon's chest, lazily rising and deflating from each deep breath, as his rested against his lined belly. Below his abdomen lye his savory rump, rounding out to stretch his sexy little scaled legs and ending with his bare feet. FT's tail slowly scoots along the bed, sweeping happily as the reptile releases slow groans of nourishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalco felt his face grow hot from the sight as a common feeling began to poke between his legs. He could either swallow this delicious looking dragon now, or play around with it for awhile, and in turn, eating it then.

His beak nostrils caught a whiff of FT's scent, which was too far to pass off for a single second. This dragon was going down Falco's throat whether he liked it or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing a knee at the edge of FT's bedside, the avian slid himself onto the mattress at quiet yet brisk pace. He craned his head down to the dragon's scaled feet, slipping out his tongue to give one a quick brush. The sudden flick gave his mouth muscle a delecant flavor that caused Falco to shudder in bliss. His taste was so good, it was impossible not to continue. The feet begin to wiggle slightly as Falco continued his pursuit to lap at them, making sure not go lick too hard or fast to awaken his dinner. FT simply mumbled out moans as he shifted his legs somewhat in response. Falco smiled even more before he purged after FT's body even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scooped the footpaws into his beak, swallowing them down into the slimy tight confines of his esophagus. Six toes squirmed inside the voracious bird's gullet as saliva was quickly slathered over his soles. Falco began to crawl upwards at a tense rate, guiding FT's scaled calves and tail into his drooling maw to guide them down his neck. The dragon continued to weakly smile, chuckling some from whatever dream he was going through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalco relentlessly moaned in pleasure. The scaled meat that was working down his body was utterly irresistable, lightly wincing from each lick or swallowing tug. After FT's deliciously plump thighs squeezed into Falco's bloated beak, the bird had arrived at his thick bum. His boxered groin sank leisurely down in Falco's outstretched maw as the tug did its best to drag the scaled mass inward. The lump of flesh probed around the dragon's waste, rimming around familiar bulges that protruded from the lizard's undergarments as FT recoiled in several shifts from the ticklish feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFT slowly began to stir into awakening, scrunching his eyelids as his hands pinched at the bed covers. Falco tensed as the dragon popped his eyes open, groaning out as he lifted his head. \"...F-Falco?\" FT called out after a long yawn. Falco's eyes widened as he hurried to take in his meal. FT was shocked to have suddenly get shoved back by a small force, causing the reptile to look at his half devoured body. He looked back at Falco in distraught, gritting his teeth together. \"Think you could get the slip on me, eh? We'll just see about that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalco suddenly gagged at the feeling of tremendous struggles deep inside his torso. FT had begun to kick his legs wildly while his tail wiggles and thrashed about in a violent manner. The blue bird had just gulped down FT's clothed rump in, however, if he could just get past FT's abdomen, he was certain to gobble this dragon down into his stomach for sure. That would be problematic due to the fact that FT placed his scaled hands around Falco's beak, forcefully pushing against the tough maw to escape.</span></div></div>",

The dragon began to whimper as his writhing body continued to descend into Falco's slimy mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFT's curved hips sank down into Falco's bulging neck, laddering down the fleshy slick walls to the bird's growling stomach. He could feel his feet press the bottom of the falcon's stomach, forcing his thriving legs to curl up inside. Hot slime surrounded the green hindpaws and legs, tingling at FT's scaled flesh to rouse a soft yelp to escape his mouth. Falco's confidence overtook him from the sound, persuading him to slurp down FT's lined belly and torso in. The reptilian flavor caused Falco's legs to tremble under the erotic satisfaction. He wanted <i>more</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFT twisted and turned during his trip inward, wriggling at the feeling of Falco's tongue venturing around his chest and arms. The dragon whined out in displeasure, hating that he didn't lock the door before dozing off. He was foolish enough to let Falco make an easy snack out of him. He was supposed to be the top predator amongst the fleet; even far superior to Fox. His shoulders squeeze into the wet maw, as Falco lifts his bulging form upright onto his knees. FT's head vanished with the avian's one, sporting out an excellent lumpy form to sink into the hot sac awaiting him. The dragon slid into the stomach completely, compressed together by the stomach walls as they did their work in tightening around the defeated reptile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalco rolled onto his back on FT's bed, cooing in pleasurable happiness as he planted his hands around his newly fat gut. He tugged at the blue feathery sphere, wobbling his stuffed belly to shake his prey about to get his digestive juices to spread over the wriggling reptile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's that for a wake up call? I'm surprised I let you get away with slurping me down so many times. Each time, I was missing out on your meaty scaled body, and I gotta say, it's way better than Fox or Krystal combined.\" Falco gloated out as he gave his belly another jiggle. The muscles were squeezing FT even tighter as his steamy fluids continued fizz at the emerald dragon's scales. FT felt himself fall back asleep just as before. His constant struggling and tiredness had wiped him out, and continuing his fight would be completely in vain. Falco had won this round, and FT was certain to claim vengeance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying atop the comfy bed, Falco relaxed back with his hands rested around his squelching soft gut, feeling his prey give one more soft kick before fainting away.</span></div></div>",

I prefer my meals to be a little warm, instead of wet and cold.\" He smirked a mischievous smile at Krashy and went back to working again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrashy only grumbled and began to devise a plan for his escape. Although the rope was thick for the net, Krashy might be able to bite through, but if that doesn't work maybe he could try to appease FT in another way...maybe he could...No! <i>Never</i>! Krashy tried shaking the thought away of pleasuring the dragon just for his freedom. He blushed quickly and forgot about that dreadful plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime was rushing short for Krashy as the fire flared and FT was almost done setting up.

Titling his head back, the young dragon's legs slid inside slowly, getting a wet happy welcome from Krashy's tongue. FT's tail slowly shifted from side to side in happiness, while his legs were being cleaned and coated in saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shark forced one more head tilt and FT's tail and feet were scooped inside, concealing the green anthro entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrashy rubbed the large round belly he had expanded. FT could feel Krashy moving, laying his back down on the sand and giving his purple gut a couple of slaps and rubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrashy licked every last scent of the taste of the dragon from his lips, and belched out defiantly. FT was losing oxygen was feeling dizzy from the excitement. Krashy playfully picked at his teeth while FT begins to squirm out, placing is hands around the tight dark place that he is confined in, rubbing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No matter how hard you try dragon, I'll always beat you anytime, anywhere.\" Krashy snickered to FT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get you next time though, now that I know most of your tricks.\" FT replied eagerly. Krashy huffed to himself and began to toy with the dragon by massaging and slapping his belly, watching it slosh back forth, causing FT to somehow roll inside the rumbling impossibly tight fleshy cage.</span></div></div>",

They move towards him, their bodies hidden by the darkness, the creatures standing just out of the light.

The dragon nodded and let the wolf come closer. \"Do you have a name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf shook his head. \"I used to...we gave up on names...we can't remember our anthro names.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon nodded and felt the tongue of the Alpha on his scaled body. Curiously, he petted the wolf as it licked him, the tongue seeming to dry him off. FT relaxed and let the wolf lick his entire body and soon, it was dry save for the traces of wolf saliva on his scales. The wolf pulled away and closed his eyes. \"Mmm...it's interesting how we can dry people with our tongues...something that our primative forms did not have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFT nodded again and watched as the wolf licked him again.

It was from the object coming towards him, a sleek white and blue space fighter jet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFT knew what it was as soon as it touched down.

Had it not been raining, I'd have tied you up and roasted you over an open fire on that mountain.\" Fox admitted, licking his lips at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFT giggled, feeling some of the spooge seeping from his tailhole. \"Since I belong to you, we could do that some time.\" FT suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox broke the hug and smiled. \"I'd like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFT smiled back and sat there eagerly, waiting for Fox to devour him.</span></div></div>",

Fox murred and rubbed his midsection as he eye humped FT, feeling very glad he found the dragon. Then he decided it was time to prepare FT for dinner. \"Hey dragon, you don't mind if I cook you, do I?\" Fox asked, not sure if FT wanted to be cooked right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFT blushed and kicked his legs over the edge of the counter. \"No, I don't mind.\" FT replied, looking at the various cooking tools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox grinned and licked his lips ravenously, reaching over and grabbing FT. He slurped FT up and down, moaning as the dragon's flavor got better with each lick. \"You're so delicious, FT. But I have no idea how to cook you. Do I put you in a pot or roasting pan and slide you in my oven, do I roast you over a spit?\" He asked, smelling his dragon pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFT giggled. \"I always had a fantasy of being cooked in a big cauldron.\" FT replied, looking around for one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox licked his lips. \"Sounds nice. I have one, but I haven't used it in a long time, so it's in my basement.\" Fox replied, carrying FT to a preparation counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFT nodded and looked around. How was he going to be cooked?</span></div></div>",

FT giggled from the amount of drool his scent caused Fox to seep from his mouth. \"I think you'd look so delicious on that roasting spit\" Fox said, nodding back towards the rotisserie oven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFT blushed and wagged his tail, purring and nuzzling his vulpine Master. \"The only bad thing is, you'll be sealed up inside the oven. I want to be as close to you as I can be when you're cooking.\" Fox sighed, licking FT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFT smiled and shivered, feeling Fox's tongue on his body. \"Well, there's always that mountain retreat.\" FT said, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox laughed and rubbed FT's head. \"Now my delicious dragon, get on your arms and knees.\" Fox said, licking his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green dragon did as he was told, raising his rump a bit, but lowering it once Fox patted it. FT wached as Fox grabbed a carrot and banana and moved around behind FT. The dragon turned his head to watch Fox line up the objects with his tailhole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFT let out a shudder and a yelp of pain as Fox wedged the banana and carrot into his tailhole, sliding them both in about halfway. \"That'll keep my seed inside you.\" Fox explained before picking up the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little dragon winced and closed his eyes, letting Fox do all the work. The vulpine pilot used his foot to pull the oven door open and leaned inside, quickly placing FT on the round pole inside, holding him with one paw while placing rope on his body. \"Grab onto the spit so you don't fall off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFT nodded and held on to the pole, curling his tail around it while Fox secured him to it with the rope. Once he was tied to the spit, Fox stepped back to admire his work. When FT didn't hear a response for some time, he opened his eye to look at Fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vulpine was standing there, holding onto his cock while slurping his chops, a ravenous look in his eye. \"That good, huh?\" FT said, muffled from the ropes around his muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox nodded and closed up the oven. \"Before I start cooking you, do you want to be spun around or held stationary?\" Fox asked.</span></div></div>",

The dragon inside began to feel warm as the oven sprung to life, his eyes closed as he started to cook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFT opened his eyes for a second, seeing Fox peering into the oven, drooling and licking his lips. \"FT, you are the most delicious thing I've ever seen tied to a spit.\" Fox said, making FT blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuices appeared on FT's body, dripping from his elbows and knees. His scent rose out of the oven, smelling better with each second FT spent in the oven. Outside, he could hear Fox growling in hunger, sniffing the air constantly and licking his lips. \"Oh, FT! You smell SO delicious! You're going to be a great meal!\" Fox exclaimed, rubbing his furry belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFT began to pant as the heat rose, blinking a bit as he heard the oven door open. The dragon watched McCloud lean in with a turkey baster, soaking up the juices collecting on the oven floor. FT closed his eyes as Fox squirted the liquid over FT's body, basting him from muzzle to tail. Before leaving, Fox places his finger on FT's snout, tracing it back from the muzzle, up his face, down his head, across his back, and to his tail tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox pulled out of the oven and licked his finger, his eyes widening in delight as he tasted FT's wonderful flavor on his finger. \"Mmmm, that was the best thing I've ever tasted!\" I can't wait to eat you up, pet!\" Fox said, his stomach confirming his statement with a loud growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox closed up the oven and stared inside, licking his lips as he watched parts of FT's body glow from the heat. And after what seemed like hours, Fox finally removed FT from the oven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox carried the steaming dragon over to his dining table, where a large platter awaited to hold FT. Fox placed FT onto the platter and licked his lips, telling FT to open his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon did as he was told and felt an apple being wedged into his jaws. The hungry vulpine licked his lips as he stared at FT's body, grabbing a salt shaker from the middle of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFT giggled and sneezed as Fox sprinkled the salt over his body, making sure to cover ever part of it. Finally, Fox pulled the platter close, taking a deep sniff of FT's cooked body. FT felt the drool landing on his head and knew Fox was about to eat him.</span></div></div>",
