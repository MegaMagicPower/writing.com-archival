You aren't interested in the museum and you are about to throw the junk mail away but the flier is beautiful. The flier is so well done that it's practically a work of art suitable for framing and putting on your wall. The words are a work of art themselves making the museum sound like a magical place. The museum is called \"L'ame de L'art\". The museum promises to share the secret stories of the souls behind the art.</span></div></div>",

On top of that, you were in a car accident a week after graduation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were on your way home from work when a drunk driver turned the wrong way on a one way street. You did your best to avoid the accident but the other driver was too drunk to notice you. He plowed into you at full speed. Your car took the bulk of the damage and is now at the scrap yard in more than five pieces. You however, did not have any broken bones. The worst injury you have is a torn rotator cuff. You also have a sprained ACL plus a few other minor injuries. You've been released to go home but you can't get a job. You struggle to even dress yourself since your left arm is immobilized, your right arm hurts and your left leg is weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat bothers you most is that your friends don't visit you. It is human nature to be selfish, to expect people to visit you when you are ill but to not visit anyone when they are ill. Some of us learn to be more altruistic when we get older but some of us remain selfish even into old age. You realize that you haven't known a single male who wasn't selfish. Your dad left you when you were seven. You know where he is but he doesn't even try to get visitation. Your mom and three sisters care about you but your older brother is selfish. You haven't had many friends and the few friends you've had were all fair weather friends, only there when you entertained them. You wish you had a real friend, one that would stay with you even if you were unable to entertain him.</span></div></div>",

This ticket  would entitle you to a special tour behind the scenes to really see the souls behind the art.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scratch it out of boredom. It is blank but the silver you scrape off sticks to your finger. Then your finger starts to tingle and turn cold. You look at the finger and the silver starts to glow and turn blue and green and gold. The colors swirl magically. Then it all fades and your finger seems normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get thirsty and head to the fridge for a glass of milk. It is a difficult journey in your condition. When you get back to your bed, you notice a picture on your nightstand. It is a picture of _____.</span></div></div>",

You touch the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe part of the picture where you touched glows silver, blue, green and gold. You back away. Bumps appear on the picture and they grow. Four bumps specifically grow and spread out away from the picture. When the bumps are a foot tall, the silver and blue bumps turn more flesh colored. Soon you have four naked guys standing on your nightstand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognize three of them. William is your best friend. Zack is an athlete. You don't know Tyler well but you've seen him around. You have no idea who the fourth guy is but he must have been at Jack's party like the rest of them were. You look at the picture and there is a blank space where the four guys came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four guys act confused. They look around as if they are trying to figure out where they are. They hyperventilate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Breathe!\" You say. You touch them to see if they are real. You just sit there for several minutes holding them. They are paralyzed from fear. William faints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zack, is that really you?\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack yes, \"What have you done to us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what happened. I just touched a picture and you four appeared.\" You look at the picture and notice that the part of the picture where the four came from is now blank but the rest of the picture is fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unknown guy asks, \"I was just playing basketball. So am I a clone or did I disappear from the basketball court.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack yells, \"This is impossible. People can't exist this small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unknown guy says, \"Technically, we are the height of the smallest person ever. What's impossible is how we instantaneously went from wherever we were to appear here. Unless you have some sort of transporter technology.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say, \"Not that I know of. What is your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unknown guy says, \"I'm Marlin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Jason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach yells, \"But are we weak from being so tiny or did shrinking us make us denser or more pliable or in some other way indestructible. Hey giant. Put me on the floor and step on me. Let's see if we are weaker.\"</span></div></div>",

This interactive isn't limited to television macro. Also, this interactive has a shift of focus: more realistic interactions with humanoid characters that have complex personalities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b><span class=\"clgreen\">I will give GP for chapters that are good enough and fit this interactive enough.</span></b></font> <b><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">I will give at least 300 GP to the first person to write a good chapter in which Zack gets stepped on.</font></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou acquire something. It can be a magical item or a sci-fi device or something in between. It gives you the power to pull people out of images. These images could be photos, videos, television, paintings, any kind of image, even statues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reserve the right to edit or delete but will only do so when necessary such as \"wen people right and english good is.\" I will also ban repeat offenders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlways leave options open for people to write the chapters they want to write.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice or option chapters are fine but don't add endless choice chapters without writing at least one chapter of story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are some themes that I may allow in small doses but I don't want too much of. These include pain, torture, death, destruction, underage, bodily fluids, farts, scat, fat, animal, and gender change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am also setting a limit that only humanoids can be pulled from images, no animals or weird creatures. Superman, Popeye, and Anakin Skywalker are humanoid enough for me. Ghosts, genies, and Darth Vader are not humanoid enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegarding sex, it is allowed but please don't rush into it. I want this to be a story, not porn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo character should ever be bigger than 72 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">Cast of Characters</font></b><br>\r\nThis is mostly to help you keep existing characters straight. Feel free to add your own characters. Periodically, I will update this list to include them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nList of macro roles from smallest to largest: micro (unaware), tiny, doll (objectified), pet (cared for), dwarf, short, average, tall, giant. Mega is not allowed in this interactive because mega is too destructive. This is not meant to limit what role a character plays but to suggest what role a character fits best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason. Age: 18. Macro role: average. Relations: older brother, three sisters, mother. Stats: unknown. Notes: injured in recent car crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack. Age: unknown. Macro role: unknown. Relations: unknown. Stats: unknown. Notes: extremely extroverted and popular. It is through the enigmatic Jack that many other characters know each other. Although he has no magical power, he has the power to fill plot holes. Try to avoid him except when you need him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam. Age: 18. Macro role: pet. Relations: Jason (best friend). Stats: unknown. Notes: none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler. Age: 18. Macro role: doll. Relations: unknown. Stats: unknown. Notes: kinky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack. Age: 18. Macro role: tiny. Relations: unknown. Stats: unknown. Notes: death fantasies (crush or vore).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlin. Age: 18. Macro role: tall. Relations: unknown. Stats: unknown. Notes: none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid. Age: unknown. Macro role: giant. Relations: Michelangelo (creator). Stats: google them. Notes: This is not King David. This is Michelangelo's ideas and feelings as he created the statue, therefore he likes to stay naked and be admired.</td>",
