Though both Plegia and Valm were defeated, Risen still appeared from time to time, and it was up to them to protect the people of Ylisse from the undead warriors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe particular battlefield they were on was different from the usual, mostly because the village had already been ruined before the Risen showed up, so there was nobody there anyway. Usually the Shepherds would proceed to go to each house and check to make sure nobody was harmed in the battle. This time, most of the Shepherds started to head straight back to the camp, except for the most meticulous Shepherds, like Miriel, Cordelia, and, of course, Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he expected, Robin found nothing in the dilapidated, sometimes crumbling houses he checked. When he came down to his last few houses, Cordelia and Miriel finished checking their sections of the village, so they left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last house he visited, despite being surrounded by the woods, was somehow the most intact compared to the rest of the village, and Robin theorized that perhaps a Mage of some sort lived there and put up enchantments to keep it standing. But whatever it was, it was gone now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin opened the door to find the kind of furniture and decorations he'd expect from a Dark Mage, or perhaps one of those Shamans he'd read about in the Elibean histories. There was a cabinet full of strange, sometimes nasty-looking materials (he assumed they used to be used for ingredients), a cauldron, two large bookcases on the left wall of the room, and another cabinet on the right wall, this time with glass doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity reached his feet as they took him around the room, examining all the books and materials left in this mysterious person's house. He made his way over to the cabinet on the right, and found each and every shelf to be filled with different vials, beakers, and containers of varying shapes and sizes. But one in particular stood out to him: a simple vial of middling size compared to the rest, with a pyramidal bottom so that it could stand up without needing some sort of holder. This was also the only one with actual liquid inside, complete with a cork in the top to prevent any from spilling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, he decided to open the cabinet and take said potion, placing it in one of the incredibly secure pockets on his coat. Perhaps he could get Tharja or Miriel to look at it later and see if it did anything unique.</span></div></div>",

Well, come on back quickly! It's almost dinner, and Sully volunteered to cook if you weren't back in time.\" Even despite Olivia's shyness, it seemed even she could have a pushy side when it came to keeping Sully in that kitchen as little as possible.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Olivia grabbed his hand, Robin suddenly felt something rushing past his neck and shoulders, cascading down his back. He didn't have much time to think about what was happening to himself, however, as his attention was instead caught but what was happening to the woman dragging him along. Somehow, Olivia's hair seemed to be receding, vanishing into thin air, as colour drained from it. It didn't completely disappear, however, as it stopped receding after it reached a short, masculine-looking length, and had faded to be completely white. The hairties holding up her ponytail and holding together her braids simply fell out, falling to the ground. Her new hairstyle actually looked rather familiar, though Robin couldn't quite place where he'd seen it before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Olivia, you... your hair,\" Robin pointed out, trying to get her to stop dragging him so he could figure out what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" Olivia hummed as she turned around, only for her eyes to go wide. \"R-Robin, y-your...\" she mumbled, one hand covering her mouth while the other pointed towards Robin's head, finally letting go of his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Robin mumbled as he turned his head, trying to see what Olivia was pointing at. That was when a long, pink lock of hair flapped into his line of sight. Alarmed, Robin quickly grabbed hold of it, only to find there was much more where that came from, and it was all firmly attached to his scalp. Long pink locks cascaded down from his head, reaching all the way to his rear. \"This is...\" he muttered, suddenly recognising the colour, and realising why Olivia's new hairstyle had looked so familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Robin, wh-what's going on?\" Olivia asked. During Robin's examination of himself, she had discovered that she too had been changed, and was now clutching her rather short hair, her face a mixture of panic and embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure,\" Robin answered, doing his best to keep calm. \"But it seems like we've swapped hairstyles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, b-but how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin thought back, trying to figure out what might have caused the swap. As far as he could tell, nothing had been out of the ordinary about Olivia when she approached. It was possible someone had placed a hex on her, but there was no sign of anything of the sort. Was it him, then? Nothing like this had happened to him before, and nothing had happened to anyone else he touched today. And the only thing that had happened since his last contact with other people had been...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The potion!\" Robin suddenly exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found a potion in one of these houses, but I tripped and it got all over me. That must have caused this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-So, we just need to go back to the house and get another one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin shook his head. \"No, it was the only one like it there, and all evidence of it disappeared after I broke it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You mean... w-we're stuck like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin racked his brain, doing his best to think of an alternative solution. Not only did he need to calm Olivia down, but he also wasn't fond of the idea of being stuck with Olivia's hair for the rest of his life. While it could easily be cut shorter, the colour wasn't as easily dealt with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we do have multiple dark mages within the Shepherds, it's possible one of them knows something about this, and how to reverse it. Although, that'd mean heading back to camp looking like this.\" Judging by Olivia's reaction, she didn't seem particularly fond of that idea, and neither was Robin. He'd never live it down if someone saw him looking like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alternatively, the potion might still be on me. We swapped after we touched once I got covered with the potion, so maybe if we touch again, we'll swap back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But wh-what if it doesn't w-work? Or if it swaps s-something else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I suppose there's only one way to find out, isn't there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did the pair decide on?</span></div></div>",

Judging from the condition of the tome, it was clearly an incredibly ancient spell, and from the black colour it was likely some sort of dark magic spell. All Tomes they used contained an immense about of text which created the power with which they cast the spells, this is why despite only being able to cast a single spell they appear to be carrying around an entire book. The Tome itself is what gives the caster the ability to do this. He opened the book to find that, from the ruins transcribed it was unlikely this was like any spell he had ever seen. He decided the quickest way to work out what the spell was, was to cast. Even though he wasn't exactly adept at dark magic, what was the worse thing that could happen? Maybe he would blow up his room, or set it on fire but for some reason, he was feeling uncharacteristically impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the book to the page with it's incantation and began to speak the ancient words. As he began cast it, the book floated above the table, emitting a dark purple glow as a gust of wind began to swirl around him. Taken aback by the rather extreme reaction he stopped speaking the incantation but at this point it was too late as the spell was already in effect. A purple light shot from the book at him and made him keel over in pain, and after the pain nothing. It was as if he was loosing all sense of being. He could no longer feel any sensations coming from his limbs as he started to black out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Am... I dying...?\"</i> he thought as he lost consciousness. It's true, his life felt rather short. He didn't even remember anything of it prior to the shepherds finding him and taking him in. As his life flashed before his eyes he couldn't help but regret that... </span></div></div>",

Or at the very least he would have understood whether or not it was safe. Slowly he began to regain consciousness, and the feelings of his limbs returned to him. Blinking his eyes a little bit and looking around, he found that he was still in his tent. Well, at least at first this is what he thought as when he looked around the tent, he found that it certainly wasn't his. Rather than maps of the battlefield, books of strategy and the set of chess that was on his desk, he saw an alchemic work station on the desk to his left, and to his right what appeared to be an alter where some ritual would likely be held. On the shelves across the room from him, instead of book was bottles and jars filled with all sorts of strange herbs and off cuts of monsters and animals. Then he noticed it, the black hair that pervaded his peripheral vision. He turned to try and brush it away until he realised from the way it moved that it was his hair! But this was impossible, his hair was a white silver, not pitch black, unless that spell did something to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing that issue to the side for now he looked down to quickly realised what happened to him. On his chest were two rather large breasts contained by a black material that provided just about as much coverage as a bra would, leaving a valley of cleavage visible. Additionally, a dark cloth draped over his shoulders almost like a cape, and a sheer, see-through material hugged his skin, the only real other clothing he seemed to be wearing. It didn't take a genius to figure out what had happened to him: He had somehow become Tharja. Or at the very least he now occupied her body he guessed thanks to the tome her had bought. Hesitantly patting his crotch a little bit it was clear that his manhood was no longer there, not that it would have fit given the tight fitting thong like garment he now donned. He was now a woman, from head to toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd not an ordinary one by any definition, but a very attractive one. The outfit Tharja often wore left very little to the imagination, however while she acknowledged how beautiful this body was, she didn't feel attracted to it in the way he normally would have. Rather it was almost a sense of pride of her own good looks. Sure she wasn't the most well endowed girl in camp but that wasn't something a couple hexes change. She stopped for a moment at that odd thought, 'cursing her friends'? That sounded downright horrible and yet, the very thought of doing this excited her. A smirk crawled over her face as she thought of all the fun she could have throwing a few curses around camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Robin caught herself with these strange thoughts. Curses, Hexes, being the most beautiful? These weren't her own thoughts, it was almost as if Tharja's mind was starting to take her over. A feeling of anxiety began to settle as she realised what was happening. This spell from the black tome didn't just make her look like Tharja, it was starting to make her Tharja in ever way possible. She figured the best way to sort this issue was to get a hold on the tome that caused this once again. That combined with her new knowledge of dark magic would be more than enough to reverse this nightmare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs quivered a little, her inner thighs brushing against each other as she tentatively took her first steps as Tharja. Her long pitch black hair grazed her back and neck is a subtle yet utterly foreign way as she moved. With her new assets and wider hips his sense of balance was out of whack, the gold heels on her feet not really helping with this. Each step felt unlike anything she'd experience, her hips swinging voluptuously each time she minced forward. After what felt like a rather long walk, a fact that now highlight how less physically able his current form was, he reached his tent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she carefully peaked through the entryway of her old tent saw her old body standing in the room looking at something on the desk in the corner. As she stood there peaking around the corner she was overcome with an odd feeling, the acute awareness that the man standing just a few meters away from her was incredibly handsome. The very sight of him made her blush a little bit, it was a feeling of affection, the feeling that this man was special. He's the one that she was destined for... Robin quickly snapped himself out of his thoughts, realising that Tharja's personality was once again taking control of him. As he walked into the doorway properly this time, the man in the tent turned to face her. \"You're... well, suppose to be me right now... or something...\" he said, an uncharacteristically puzzled look on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Robin</span> Tharja... I think the spell swapped us around...\" she said in her now womanly voice. While it was clear the spell was now extending to affect his speech, it appeared the real Tharja had understood what was going one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'd odd... I really don't feel like myself... curses, hexes, all the things I've spent my life doing feel so... foreign to me now.\" he muttered, \"So... how did this happen?\" he asked. Robin took time to explain the book and how the spell had happened, though as he explained he realised he didn't know exactly why the spell had swapped him and Tharja around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... between the two of us I think we should be able to figure this tome out!\" Robin said. Opening up the book, the ancient text that was written in it still didn't appear any more coherent, even with Tharja's knowledge of dark magic rattling around in his brain. After what felt like hours the two of them had finally decided to give up deciphering this book, \"It's too hard!\" the tacticians body spoke out, \"I figure the best way around this is to just try it out again!\" he said, clearly a little bit frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so... or we could stay like this...\" Robin offered. \"I won't lie, but I've started to question who it is I am. I don't feel like 'Robin' anymore... all these things... swordplay, strategems... it all seems rather foolish to me.\" the newly minted woman approached her old body, \"I've even fallen head over heels for my old body... nothing about me feels like this tactician. To me, I am Tharja. Nothing else seems right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter much discussion, they finally came to a decision.</span></div></div>",

Yet, no matter where he looked, he only saw swiveling darkness...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his right, he heard a sinister laugh echo throughout the mist. \"Show yourself!\" Robin commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElapsing from within the darkness, a figure emerged.

It counters swords, no matter what your silly textbooks tell you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin raggedly drew in his breath. He had never seen a weapon of that caliber before... It must have come from a time when adventures were less about marriage and redundant character shipping and more about actual strategy and story narrative!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin exclaimed in response, \"Even so, how did you hit me with only 1 point in skill? The odds are against your hitrate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe marauding brigand laughed once more and simply stated, \"The numbers fool you, my dear boy! Even with a 60 hitrate, the odds are in my favor due to my weapon advantage.\" He wiped the slick edge of his axe with the tips of his fingers. \"Now... It is my turn.\" Batta concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo! Robin made the simplest mistake in the book!

He had been the one to find him, given him a place to belong, given him purpose to live for. He had given him so much, if only Robin could have done the same for him. Magical energy swirled around him in a vortex as it felt as though it was ripping the very fibre of his soul away from himself. Then suddenly, he blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen all of a sudden, everything returned to him but slightly different. He found himself in a similar tent to his own though it was clearly different. There was a distinct lack of maps and battle plans that were usually messily spread out over his desk, and where they would normally be was a clean desk with a few common items such as books and brushes. Instead of being stocked with many books about strategy and tactics, the bookshelf on the far side of the tent was now filled with numerous novels. Robin absentmindedly brushed away a lock of dark brown hair that was obstructing his vision, only to notice that his hair which was usually rather short, now grew well beyond was reasonable for a man like himself to have. He looked down and saw that he was now wearing what looked like the uniform of the pegasus knights in his army, complete with a short dress and an armoured breast plate which appeared to be covering a modest pair of breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiecing together everything he observed he recognised the body. There was no doubt it was the body of Sumia, Chrom's wife. Apparently his wish made in panic was granted in the most twisted way possible so no one else would be by Chrom's side for longer than who he now was. He had her narrow waist, wide hips, full butt and, probably everything else as well. Robin put his hand to his crotch and confirmed that he was use to having down there was gone. Curiosity getting the better of him, Robin stripped down naked to get a better view of his new body, rubbing his behind to inspect it's shape and even groping himself and yet, while the sensation itself was arousing, the sight of them did nothing for him. No doubt now, he was a woman through and through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she overheard the sound of people walking past the tent, she was suddenly overcome with a sense of anxiety. Her cheeks flushed red as the fear of someone walking in on her naked came to mind. It was odd though, as she had never in the past been so shy or cared so much about what other people thought. Shaking the thought from her head, she decided that either way it'd be best to get dressed so she could get to the bottom of what was going on. Donning once again the pegasus riding uniform, Robin set out of the tent to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Whether or not the real Sumia was occupying her old body, her best bet to figuring this out was probably to head to Chrom's tent. Eventually Chrom would have come by her old tent and brought her body over to his so they could discuss his plans for the next battle. As she made her way towards Chrom's tent she couldn't help but think about how weird everything felt. The way her long hair brushed her back and teased the nape of her neck with each step, the way the air freely past under her dress dancing around her inner thighs. In a weird way he had never felt so exposed and vulnerable in her life, even more so than on the battlefield. And yet despite how her bottom heavy build affected her stride, causing her hips to sway in an alluring manner, it didn't really feel awkward at all. She'd barely been a woman for five minutes and already it she felt natural like this, as if that's the way she had been her whole life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew it, she finally made it to Chrom's tent. Although this was were the prince use to lay his head, now it was used so that the Tactician could meet with him and discuss strategies uninterrupted. Since Chrom married Sumia, he had since been staying with her at night. Remembering this fact suddenly sent Robin's mind into overdrive. He hadn't just become a woman, he'd become the woman his best friend was married too. Before he could reconsider the choice he had made, the tents entryway opened as the Prince appeared from it, \"Oh, hello honey. I didn't expect to see you here. Me and Robin's meeting ran a little overtime so I probably won't make it back to the tent until a little later.\" he said, his eyes looking at Robin with more affection than she'd seen in his eyes before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was wearing more casual attire as oppose to military clothing he usually wore, and while she had seen him dressed like this in the past, she found herself involuntarily checking out Chrom's body. The way the outfit better showed off his muscles, tight and lean, didn't do a lot to help this either. As her face heated up, he felt a moist, warm feeling in his crotch. Before Robin had time to process these feelings, Chrom leaned in and kissed her. As her body was overwhelmed with unfamiliar feelings, her earlier suspicions were now confirmed. She didn't only become Sumia physically, but mentally as well. She couldn't deny, she was head over heels for her best friend! No, her husband... this mental correction she made almost happened automatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chrom broke the kiss he smiled warmly, \"I just have a few more things to take care of, after that I promise we'll spend more quality time...\" he said, a little mischief in his tone. Robin blushed, \"O-of course... I'll see you later honey...\" she said, her delivery almost identical to how Sumia would have said it. As the prince left her, she only stood there watching his figure grow smaller and smaller in the distance as she clutched her hands over her chest. It appeared as though as time passed, she was becoming more and more like Sumia. As a matter of fact she couldn't even fathom the idea that she was once a tactician. The very thought of being entrusted peoples lives terrified her... no, she was more suited to fighting by Chrom's side. All the knowledge of battle strategies seemed to be gone and in their place, the proper way to groom and look after a pegasus. Robin felt a little panicked, if she didn't act now she'd lose herself in Sumia's personality! On the other hand she could just leave things as they are, after all that young man the shepherds found in the fields hardly felt like who she was now. While she remembered everything that happened, and while she knew that she was in fact that man, it didn't seem right anymore.</span></div></div>",

The shepherds were a very precious part of his new family and though the feelings he had for Lissa weren't romantic by any stretch they were rather close. It was almost like have a annoying little sister, as  she seemed to relish his reaction to her many pranks. He'd miss that, and he thought it sad he had not spent more time with her. As the pain surged through his body as result of the spell, a light flashed from the book as his vision descended into nothingness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then suddenly he opened his eyes, greeted by the sight of the plains outside where they had decided to set up camp. How he had suddenly found himself outside was baffling and yet, if this is all that dreadful spell had done, maybe he should be grateful for it. It had been a terrible idea to even try such a suspicious looking book in the first place. How foolish he had been, it wasn't even the kind of magic he was accustom to in the first place. As he breathed a sigh of relief, it was in that moment a lock of blond, curled hair fell into view. It would appear as though the books magic hadn't had as pointless as an effect as he had first thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down he found his body clad in an embarrassingly pink, frilly outfit which hugged his form rather tightly. Judging from the was the clothes curved inward at the waist, and the new flesh at his bosom it would appear that the spell didn't just alter his attire, but his whole being. As he moved a bit he took notice of the heel on his boot making it slightly difficult to stand or walk, but though all this he had to think, at least he wasn't wearing a dress. From what he could see, it was becoming apparent that he was now Maribelle. In his fear of death moments ago when casting the spell, he had wished to spend more time with Lissa and now, the magic appeared to have granted that by making him her best friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom another point of view this whole dilemma she would have probably be rather amusing, but the idea of suddenly becoming the most lady-like person in the entirety of their army, was anything but ridiculous to her. And yet it, at the same time she didn't exactly feel out of place as she was. It was as if the feminine, grace and poise that Maribelle had held in high-esteem came naturally to her. \"Oh how troubling! It would appear as though that dreadful spell is even making me behave as a proper lady should.\" she muttered, only more disturbed by how refined his sentence had been uttered. Before the spells effects began to run deeper, she decided it would be best to find the tome that had caused this in the first place. She opened the parasol in her hand, as just because she was in a rather confusing situation it didn't mean she should allow the sun to sully her fair skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe minced towards her destination with a rather elegant prance, and though she felt the urgency of the situation, very well couldn't run about like a panicked commoner. Try and she might, she couldn't bring herself to behave in such an improper manner.</span></div></div>",

Sure, it was a necessity but he couldn't help but wonder what it would have been like to live life different. To work towards something that didn't inevitably lead to the death of someone regardless of something, to work towards something that could bring joy or happiness to someone else. As these thoughts flashed across his mind, the book also flashed with a light, both blinding him and engulfing his body in an intense burning heat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his vision returned to him he found himself in strangely outdoors, not too far from the tents where everyone stayed but it was still rather jarring to be indoors one moment and outside the next. A cooling breeze blew past causing the light materials of his clothing to flutter about. The wind brought to his attention how exposed his current attire was, didn't he usually wear a rather heavy and think robe over himself. He looked down at himself to see a rather small and slender form he now possessed. His body wasn't wearing a lot, but he did don a white garment the hugged his new form tightly and left his shoulders, midriff and legs exposed. Around his waist a rather sheer and translucent material draped over his lower half, which now brushed agains his smooth slender legs. A similar material also adorned his thin arms, along with a few ringlets of gold, and on his wrists were now a pair of rather large bracelets attached with a long white cloth. His now pink hair flowed behind him, and it's braids draped in front of him confirming what he feared. He had become Olivia, the shy dancer. Robin tried to figure out how this could have happened and decided that the only explanation was that this was a result of the spell she had tried to cast only moments ago. \"If I'm Olivia... she must be me...\" she muttered, trying to ignore the airy female voice that replaced his voice. She quickly decided to check his living quarters for her old body and the book, and hopeful find some way of reversing this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through camp in this new body was an odd experience. The way Olivia's form moved was completely foreign to him and the way her clothing moved, his hips swayed, the breasts bounced, with every step was beyond distracting. On top of this, her body was now a lot smaller, a fact that she took note of as a lot of the members of the army now towered over her demure form. As she walked through camp many of the soldiers glanced in her direction. She wished they would stop looking at her, it was embarrassing. Robin didn't know if it was because she was in a different body or not, but the idea of these people looking at her was almost unbearable. Her cheeks flushed as she hastened her steps towards her destination.</span></div></div>",

The creams here will make your face absolutely fantastic.\" Anna told him, and before he could react she was applying different creams to his face. Robin wanted to tell her to stop, though he couldn't deny that it felt pretty good. He felt the skin of his face afterwards, and he couldn't deny it was much softer and smoother. \"For half price, I will give some more makeup, that will get rid of all those little blemishes and imperfections.\" As Anna watched Robin start to consider her offer, she gave a greedy smile. Her special makeup was addictive and would have Robin keep coming back for more. she would gain tons of money and each time she could add more and more makeup to ease him into giving her more money. After a bit of internal debate, Robin decided that he had to at least try it, since it kept nagging at him. Right after giving her the money, Anna immediately got to work on Robin. she grabbed a brush with some powder on it and began brushing his face with it. The money was great, but she couldn't deny that getting to apply makeup to Robin's face was incredibly fun. When it was done, Robin was amazed by how much better his face looked afterwards. Anna gave him some of the cream so that he could use it later. Robin told himself it was  one time thing, but Anna knew he would be back the next day for more.</span></div></div>",

Their footsteps gradually becoming uneven as their visions started to blur and their heads started to throb. Then they both felled onto the floor, slipping into unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin wasn't sure how much time past but suddenly he regained consciousness, finding himself kneeling on the floor. Blinking his eyes a few times to clear his vision he saw that he was still in the same room, however the sensations his body was sending him were telling him something was off. Turning his head to the side to look around he was caught off guard by the strange feeling of a few weights hanging from his head. He quickly darted his hand up to his head and pulled forward two very long locks of blonde hair tied into ringlets. His investigation only brought attention to his hands which were not only covered in what appeared to be pink gloves but were also rather small and dainty, those of a young lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly turned to the full-length mirror in his room only to see Maribelle standing right back at him. Shocked, he gasped only to see Maribelle follow his exact movements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin?\" The strategist turned to the sound of the voice only to see his own body staring right back at him. Once he saw this, everything finally fell into place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maribelle? Is that you?\" Robin asked. His body nodded yes. \"What happened?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I wanted you to be more dignified and noble like myself. So I cast a spell on you to do just that. But...\" Maribelle could feel herself growing angry at the current situation. \"This can't be happening to me! I am a lady, I should not be trapped in this body!\" She then took a few deep breaths to try to calm herself down. \"Okay, I still have the spellbook, let me try to reverse this,\" she continued, pulling out the book in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin honestly wanted to trust Maribelle, but considering that she tried to change him without his permission the first time and that she screwed up, it was clear that's such a good idea. It would probably be a better idea to try to fix the problem himself. He is more experienced when it comes to spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some thought Robin decided to...</span></div></div>",

She was disappointed she couldn't see anything, although changes were happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spell started to affect Robin's clothes. His clothes were turning lighter while his shoes started becoming a brown color. His coat is slowly disappearing. Now with more visible changes, Maribelle could see something went wrong. She decided to continue to watch so she would know what happened. Little did she know that her own clothes are changing slowly as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin's clothes continue to change as they're now fully pink and turning into Maribelle's normal ensemble. His hair is wrapping into Maribelle's usual style. His hair also has the two white bows that Maribelle usually wears on her hair. As the changes continued Maribelle realized something. \"Are those my clothes?\" Maribelle looked down at herself and she sees that her clothes are turning into Robin's own ensemble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No?\" Maribelle shouted with shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Robin turned to Maribelle as the changes were unfolding on them both. He sees her clothes changing and he decided to look down on his own body. He sees that his clothes are changing too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening to us?\" Robin shouted as the changes were slowly wrapping up. After the spell finished its work Robin and Maribelle both looked at themselves in the nearest mirror they could find. Robin couldn't help but feel ridiculous in Maribelle's clothes. His top was replaced with Maribelle's, his pants with her's and his boots and gloves were also replaced with her own. He even notice light make-up on his face. His hair was done in Maribelle's style, and it feels tight as it's trying to work with his much shorter hair. He could even feel what he assumed to be a bra and panties underneath her clothes. He also noticed that the clothes seemed tailored to fit him as nothing felt too small on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Maribelle, she doesn't feel that much better. Robin's clothes feel slightly more heavy than her own. His coat definitely being the heaviest of his entire ensemble. Her hair was no longer up in its usual style but falling loose past her shoulders. She felt completely un-ladylike in Robin's clothes especially in his underwear. She also noticed that his clothes seemed tailored to fit her as nothing felt too big on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that Maribelle might have something to do with his current situation Robin decided to question Maribelle. \"Maribelle do you know why this happened?\" Robin questioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you see I just wanted to make you more dignified and noble like myself. So I cast a spell on you to do just that. But something definitely gone wrong considering our current situation. \" Maribelle confessed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you cast a spell on me without my permission.\" Robin angrily said to Maribelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my lord. \" Maribelle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe will be talking about this later. I need to change back into my own clothes. You too, Maribelle. \" Robin said as he left the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Maribelle said as she left the room<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was disappointed she could not see anything, although changes were happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the spell continue it's work Robin's clothes started to change. His outfit was turning lighter and lighter while his shoes started becoming a brown color. His coat was slowly disappearing. Now with more visible changes, Maribelle could see something went wrong. She decided to continue to watch so she would know what happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin's shoes had morphed fully into a pair of brown boots that reached up into his knees. The heels on the boots also slowly started to grow. The color of his clothes now shifted fully to a mostly light pink and white ensemble with a bit of a darker pink in places. His coat has completely disappeared. As the changes continued Maribelle realized something. \"Are those my clothes?\" she said as she looked at Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin felt a sharp pain in his ears as a pair of spherical red earrings formed in them. \"Ahh... What's going on with my ears?\" Robin said. He realized that something feels weird on his body so he looked down at himself only to see his clothes changing. \"No!\" Robin shrieked as he ran over to the nearest body mirror. He could feel that his underwear has gotten much softer as they turned into a pair of panties. He could also feel a newly formed bra under his shirt. Next white bows were beginning to appear in his hair as it reached his shoulders and was now a bit thicker. The hair on the rest of his body had also disappeared. His nails have also lengthen a bit and are now more shapely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening to me?!\" Robin shouted. He could now feel that his skin is now much more smooth and soft. It was free of blemishes and show off the dedication that Maribelle (and soon Robin) put into skincare. The next change was that Robin found his hair lengthening down to his lower back. The hair was collected into multiple ringlets that gave him a ladylike appearance. With that the bows in his hair finished up, and now Robin completely had Maribelle's hairstyle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Robin's clothes have fully formed. His coat completely disappeared as his clothes to gain new frills and heart designs. His boots gained slight heels and Robin found his hands engulfed in a pair of fancy pink gloves. Robin was now fully wearing Maribelle's outerwear. But now his sword had changed into a white parasol to protect Robin's fair skin from the sun. The only good side to this is that his body hadn't taken on any permanent feminine changes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle looked on in shock at the new Robin. At the very least she had accomplished her goal as she knew Robin looked more proper. Maribelle thought that it went pretty well as being like her was an honor and that Robin should be happy with his new self. Robin turned around to see Maribelle. Thinking she might have something to do with his current situation he decided to question her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maribelle, do you know why I'm currently dressed like this?\" Robin asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes, I do. I wanted to make you more proper like me so I cast a spell on you. It didn't go the way I thought. But I'm satisfied with the results.\" Maribelle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you cast a spell on me without my permission?\" Robin angrily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I'm sorry.\" Maribelle said with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will talk about this later. For now, I need to get back into my regular clothes.\" Robin said as he left the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Robin walk back to his room he couldn't help but notice that his clothes (or rather, Maribelle's clothes) actually feel pretty good to wear.

Maybe he could have a tailor make a version of these clothes that better fit his personality (and favorite color as well). Though he can do without the earrings and hair style (He'll need to get a haircut once he gets back into his normal clothes.) His skin also feels smooth and soft. Robin thought he might ask Maribelle how she takes care of her skin later because he could get used to this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he needed to get back to his room so no one can see him with his new clothes.

No matter how hard he tried or pleaded, Robin was unable to stop Lissa from dragging him to the market of a nearby town. \"You have to get me out of here.\" Robin said feeling incredibly embarrassed now that he was surrounded by hundreds of people while he was dressed as a feminine lady. Even worse he had no way to escape from Lissa, and it was too far out for him to walk in these heels without tripping or stumbling. He wished he knew a spell that could help him change or escape, but honestly he was more worried about Lissa casting a spell on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Robin, you look very beautiful. You should be very proud of the great work that Maribelle did, would you really let her down? Besides if you don't want to draw attention, you just need to appear to be the confident proper lady you are dressed like.\" Lissa continued to tease Robin, excited to see how it would all turn out. Robin kept looking around to see if anyone had noticed he was a boy. Luckily since he was so girlishly dressed, he seemed t be fine for now, but if anyone knew him or he was forced to talk or get close than he would have some problems. He knew that Lissa was right, and that if he continued to act like he didn't belong then it draw attention, but it was incredibly difficult to keep his composure. \"What do you think we should do first Robin? Do you want to go get some new clothes from Maribelle's favorite store? Or maybe you want to get some makeup Robin? It would make you look even more pretty,and hide who you are I guess if you cared about that.\" Lissa talked quite loudly making no effort to try and hide Robin's name or identity. This was a one in a lifetime chance and Lissa was prepared to have as much fun as she could with the feminized strategist. </span></div></div>",

He wanted to believe his sister and she did sound very sincere. Chrom didn't know if Robin would really do something like that,  but regardless he knew that Robin was in the middle of the market dressed like Maribelle. \"Robin is normally so calm,  wouldn't he tell me if there was a logical, normal reason?\" Chrom thought before making his decision.</span></div></div>",

Next Lissa pulled over to the clothes section. She had a glint in her eyes as she showed it tons of girly ballgowns. Lissa was practically tossing clothes into Robin's arms. Heels, panties, bras, and of course lots of elegant and beautiful dresses. She happily took Robin to the front where they payed for all the items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin asked if they were done, but Lissa shaked her head.\"Oh Robin, we haven't even got you in one of your new outfits yet.\" Her smile grew wider as she took Robin over to the changing room. Robin begged her not to do it, but Lissa ignored him and pulled out the cosmetics. She started by spraying him with some perfume to give him a wonderful girly scent befitting a lady. Lissa curled his eyelashes with some mascara and then applied some eyeshadow. She blended some foundation in and then lightly dusted his cheeks with blush. Finally she applied a pink lipstick to his lips. \"Time to see how beautiful you look right now.\" Lissa said as she took Robin over to a mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin gasped when he saw his reflection, gone was Robin and instead there was a pretty, refined lady staring back at him. His lips were plump and kissable, the eye makeup really made his eyes pop. The blush had given him nice rosy cheeks, and there was not a blemish or imperfection to be seen. He could smell the flowery perfume that added to his girly presence. Robin couldn't believe how he looked. He stood in shock trying to process his feelings, he felt strange as he looked at his reflection replaced by a beautiful lady. \"Do you see now, how silly you have been Robin? Who would want to hide such a beautiful look from the world?\" Lissa had a sweet smile on her face as she handed Robin an elegant pink ballgown, and some heels and continued to soothingly speak to him \"Put these on Robin, then we can show off the beautiful lady you are to everyone.\" Robin could feel the soft fabric of the dress even through his gloves. Staring at his feminized reflection, Robin thought about what he should do.</span></div></div>",

Robin quickly stepped in and Lissa zipped the dress up, adjusting it until it fitted Robin properly. Lastly, Lissa slid two elbow-length pink gloves on his hands completing the ensemble. With Robin finally all dressed up, Lissa dragged Robin over to the mirror allowing him to get a good look at himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin couldn't help but stare at his reflection.

Lissa meanwhile while giggling in enjoyment as she saw the endless joy that was plain on Robin's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin felt the soft fabric of the dress in his hands as he admired it. From the way the dress gently brushed up against his skin to the gloves that made everything he touched feel soft, it was all so heavenly to Robin. Robin thought of how the female members of the camp would dress up like this for special occasions, he only now truly understood how they must have felt being dressed like this. Robin couldn't believe that this wonder was around him all this time and yet he had ignored it, never wearing a dress til now.  The ballgown felt like being hugged by a soft cloud to him. Sure it was restricting but Robin thought that he didn't have any need to rush and he should take his time. He vowed that he would never forget the pleasure that he had discovered today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa looked to Robin with a great big grin on her face. \"You really do look wonderful Robin.

I can't wait for everyone to see me as I truly am.\" Robin gleefully imagined how wonderful it would be to show off his new look to the others. He wasn't sure how they would respond, but with how lovely he looked and his love for how he looked, he was sure it would turn out well. \"Trust me Robin. The others will just adore you! Maybe one of them will even ask you to be their girlfriend.\" Lissa said with a snicker as she tried to picture how things would turn out.</span></div></div>",

She reprimanded Robin each time his back was less than perfectly straight, or if he had his hands on the table. The hardest part for Robin was getting used to having to cross his legs and rest his hands delicately on his lap. It went on until Maribelle was sure that he had gotten it all down. \"Good progress Robin, but that was the easy part.\" Maribelle gestured for Robin to get up as she began lecturing him. Maribelle told Robin every little rule on proper posture for a lady. Like before, she reprimanded him every time his posture wasn't perfect but she also would then start the lecture all over. It was shocking to Robin how much he had to pay attention to. Sometimes it was his elbows were bent at the right angle, or his legs were too far apart, his shoulders slouched, his hands weren't resting in a feminine position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle was determined to make sure that Robin's posture was nothing less than perfectly feminine. Eventually she moved on to walking as she gave Robin the lecture. Robin had a book placed on his head and was made to walk carefully. With the heels that he was wearing, and the fact that he had to walk like a lady, it was especially difficult for him. He kept having to do it over again, taking a while to even get past just not causing the book to fall. He eventually got it as he expertly placed one foot in front of the other in dainty steps. This had the effect though of giving his walk a feminine sway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful, Robin, but now we will try it in a more restricting outfit.\" Maribelle lead Robin to her closet as she got in dressed in a fancy ballgown and some more fancy and higher heels. Robin was made to go through the whole process again in his new outfit. Lots of it was easy due to how ingrained his new posture was, but he underestimated how much harder it was with this wide dress and taller heels. Robin had to gently lift up his skirt when he walked and it was difficult walking and standing straight in these new heels. After a while, Maribelle said that he was done with the first lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin breathed a sigh of relief, but he had to admit he was a bit nervous. Robin noticed that he now walked, stood, and sat just like a high class lady would. He didn't even have to try, it was all natural to him now. Robin couldn't even force himself to change his posture, it just went back to how it was supposed to be. Robin was scared, he didn't expect Maribelle's lessons to be so effective, at this rate if this continued, he would probably be unable to act in any way except like a lady. Maribelle smiled as she looked over Robin. He was dressed so femininely with his posture prim and proper. \"Perfect, you look exactly how a lady should. Next we shall move on to lesson 2...\"</span></div></div>",

Blemishes, rough skin, and imperfections are simply not allowed.\" Maribelle lead Robin over to the vanity who instinctively smoothed his skirt before sitting down. Maribelle showed him each type of cosmetic he could possibly use before lecturing him on when to use it and how to apply it.  Robin had to go through an intensive quiz by Maribelle making sure that he memorized it all. Next they moved on to actually applying the makeup. Maribelle watched over Robin like a hawk to make sure there wasn't even the smallest mistake. It took quite a lot of tries before Robin was able to get it completely right. Robin blushed as he looked at his reflection. Thanks to the makeup, he looked even more beautiful than ever before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle complimented Robin on how he looked and then moved on to hair care. Like with the cosmetics, she taught and quizzed him on every hair product that she knew of. Maribelle undid Robin's hairstyle and she forced him to restyle it himself. It was a laborious process as Robin struggled immensely with the complicated hairstyle that Maribelle had. With Maribelle's tips and guidance, Robin eventually managed to style his hair like Maribelle's. When that was finished Maribelle spoke up again. \"A lady follows a strict schedule. Doing your hair and makeup and touching it up throughout the day must be an instinctual routine. Thus, it is required that you can perfectly yet swiftly go through the routine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle removed Robin's makeup and undid his hair, making him do it all over but with a strict time limit. Robin thought the task to be impossible as he went through it over a dozen tries. It was either that he took too long or that he made a mistake in his haste. All the while, Maribelle talked with Robin as she worked out a schedule for him on when he would work on his hair and makeup. Through constant attempts, Robin eventually succeeded in doing it, even doing it again a second time. At this point, Robin didn't even need to think about it. His hands naturally moved from memory to do what he needed, flawlessly and with incredible efficiency. The ease that he now did it, was what scared Robin the most. He could tell that he was slowly but surely becoming a lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo finish up the lesson, Maribelle removed the gloves that Robin was wearing. She taught him how to file his nails, clean them properly, and push back the cuticles. Robin was reminded that a lady did not do manual labor and that his hands and skin could clearly represent that. Similarly he was told that he always needed to wear a pair of gloves to keep his hands clean, and keep a parasol with him at all times to protect his increasingly delicate skin from the sun. Now that Maribelle was satisfied with how he did with lesson 2, she moved onto to lesson 3.</span></div></div>",

Robin was instructed on how to raise and inflect his voice. Robin found it to be the hardest lesson so far. Every time he talked he was either met with criticisms of his voice being too low pitched or too high pitched. Robin also had to make sure that his voice was soft, but not too quiet. It was a grueling task with Robin having to try every way he could until he found the right voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Robin had gotten his voice to sound convincingly feminine, Maribelle moved to training Robin to speak like a lady. Robin had to start with tongue twisters and other exercises to make sure that his enunciation was perfect. As usual he was strictly reprimanded if he misspoke at all. Robin was shocked by how difficult they could be. Getting his voice to sound elegant and high class was its own struggle. Robin had to pay close attention to how Maribelle spoke so that he could finally get it down/<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next part was the one that Robin dreaded the most, he had to practice speaking with Maribelle. Every sentence he spoke was criticized in every way imaginable.  Maribelle would find some grammar flaw and then Robin had to go through a detailed grammar lesson until he got it right. When it wasn't grammar, Maribelle would pick out the words he used. She made sure there was absolutely no slang or other incorrect words to be found in his speech. Robin also was given many synonyms for his words that Maribelle said were better suited for a lady like him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin went on to the next exercise that was Maribelle and Lissa giving him a prompt for him to speak about. He blushed when he heard what the first one was and prepared himself. \"Thank you Maribelle for your gracious aid and your impeccable lessons. Before I was a ruffian devoid of grace or class, but now I have improved immensely as I became a lady. I vastly prefer the elaborate and exquisite dresses I wear now as opposed to my old ratty, drab robes.\" Robin said while Maribelle and Lissa giggled, with Robin embarrassed at what he had to say. Lissa was glad to see how things were progressing, the feminine and refined voice that came out of Robin's mouth now perfectly matched his new appearance. Robin had to go through more prompts that were all about reaffirming himself as a feminine lady and a high class noble. Robin was horrified that he even thought now in a proper and refined speech and had to try hard to remember that he wasn't a lady or a noble. Maribelle gave another smile as she complimented him once more before going on to the next lesson.</span></div></div>",

For this reason, your next lesson will be on how to properly conserve with your fellow nobles.\" Robin wasn't looking forward to the lesson, he never cared about all that formal talk with nobles. Maribelle grabbed his attention before speaking up once more. \"A true noble is always proud and confident. So first, you must acknowledge and accept you are a noble and then be proud of it.\" Robin gulped as he saw the large stack of books that Maribelle brought out for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin had to sit and listen while Maribelle read from the books to him. They were all about what it meant to be a noble, their responsibilities and what was expected of them, and their importance. Maribelle would chime in from time to time with her own opinions. When she was done, Robin had to give his own thoughts on the subject. He did what she said, but Maribelle told him to be more detailed and complex while also talking about how it related to him personally and why he was proud to be a noble. Robin had to think long and hard about it for a good while. He had to give a very long and thoughtful response but eventually he came up with a satisfying answer to her. After all of that, it was incredibly difficult for Robin to not think of himself as a noble. In fact as much as he hated to admit it, a part of him was proud of it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin an important part of interacting with other nobles is to know their social standing. Even among nobles there is people of high and low standing and you must take that into account when conversing with them. However never forget that a noble of any standing is still a noble, so you must treat them with that due respect.\" Robin first had to learn how to quickly distinguish the social class of anyone he met so he would be able to tell even when dealing with foreigners. He was confused at first by all the subtle details that he had to look for so that he could figure it out, but he was slowly learning it. Robin learned and had to recite every noble family in Ylisse, their history, and all of their members. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that everything was prepared, they moved onto to the details of conversation. Maribelle told Robin every little detail on what was appropriate to talk about with other nobles. She discussed in great detail what high class ladies spoke about and their interests. Maribelle repeatedly stressed the importance of not offending another noble whether by accident or on purpose. Robin found it a prickly subject but Maribelle helped him get it. Robin also practiced addressing nobles of higher standing by using Chrom as an example. Maribelle worked hard to stress that he needed to address Chrom as Lord Chrom and to see him as such. It was very difficult for Robin since Chrom was his best friend but Maribelle was very persistent. Eventually Robin caved in and accepted the idea and saw Chrom in a new light. After that, Robin practiced with Maribelle and Lissa on how to speak with fellow ladies. Maribelle sighed as she felt that she ended up having to teach Lissa about it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin thought they were done with the topic until Maribelle said they was one thing left about it. \"One of the most important parts for a lady when conversing with other nobles is how to converse with potential husbands.\" Robin blushed with embarrassment as he heard that she would teach him about getting a husband. Maribelle bombarded him with all sorts of tips and tricks on how to attract a man. Robin had to listen as Maribelle went on at length about what a lady looks for in a man. Likewise Robin had to learn what a noble gentleman looked for in a wife. It was all so embarrassing to him but nonetheless he had to know what to do on dates or how to talk with a boyfriend, and even how to kiss them. When it was over, Robin was blushing furiously having realized that if this continued then there was a real chance he would have to get a boyfriend. Robin knew if that happened then his fate as a lady for life was sealed. Maribelle and Lissa smiled and giggled at each other before they moved on to Robin's fifth lesson</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maribelle explained the Robin's fifth lesson was on high-class fashion as she began getting everything ready. She brought tons of dresses and other clothes before shoving a stack of books into Robin's hands. He looked on with horror at the mountain of fashion tomes that he was holding right now. Maribelle started off with the basics as she told Robin about fabrics and which ones were best. Next she talked about the types of clothes that ladies wore and began breaking down their component. Robin had to learn about and be able to identify all the different types and variants of dresses, heels, skirts and so on. Maribelle then brought up how he needed to change what he wore depending on the season and informed him on what clothes were appropriate for each season. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he knew about clothing, Robin moved on to the next step. Maribelle got excited as she started shoving dress after dress into Robin's hands. Robin had to try on each of the dresses. While he did that, she lectured him on how to identify a great outfit by how it felt and fit. Maribelle was training him to be able to tell everything about an outfit just by wearing it. Robin was told repeatedly that a lady needed to have the ability to identify quality at first sight. Maribelle said it was important to know if an outfit was worth trying on. She brought out more clothes and put Robin to the test of seeing which ones were low quality.  When he was done with that part, he then had to identify fakes. Maribelle informed him that a lady only wears authentic clothing. It was a very hard task as Robin had to pay attention to every little detail. If there was even the smallest thing he didn't know about the dress then he wasn't able to do it. Robin was relieved when he had finally made it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle then began to discuss the qualities that made up a great outfit. She went at length especially on how a lady should judge their clothing. She wanted to make sure that Robin understood his new feminine clothes were lovely and wonderful while his old robes were ugly. Robin had to sit through a very long lecture until he had grasped it well enough. Then came the incredibly difficult exercise. Robin had to give 50 reasons why his old clothes were hideous and ill-suited to him now and then give 50 reasons why the dress he was wearing was so wonderful. He couldn't believe that it was even possible for him to do it.  Robin gave it a couple of tries to little success. He decided that the only way to do it was too place himself in the mindset of a high class fashionista. When he did that, Robing was finally able to do it and with ease even. It came at the price of leaving Robin a bit stuck in the mindset though. Now whenever he thought about his old clothes he couldn't help but feel some disgust while likewise feeling some joy at the feminine attire in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last part of the lesson was Maribelle teaching Robin how hair and makeup fit into fashion. He learned how to style his hair and do his makeup to best fit with what he was wearing. Maribelle also discussed current fashion trends and ways to predict and keep up with the latest trends. Maribelle smile as she looked over Robin. \"Robin you are doing absolutely wonderful. I can tell that you were just meant to be a lady. You have just one lesson left for me to teach you.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maribelle told Robin that his final lesson was on proper behavior. He wondered what exactly she meant by that while she was getting everything ready. Maribelle started off with greetings and how to properly curtsy. Robin learned very quickly that she was incredibly strict about getting his curtsy to be absolutely perfect. He had to do it about 200 times before she finally accepted it. She lectured him about how to politely end a conversation before moving on to manners. Robin was first taught how to gently stifle a giggle with his hand, and to always wipe his mouth when he ate. Maribelle stressed the importance of always being courteous and respectful especially to other nobles. Robin was trained to always be calm, composed, and graceful. Maribelle said that most of all as a noble he was expected to be a pillar of virtue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final step was on proper interests for a lady. Robin was first greeted with a long lecture on everything a lady should not do or be associated with. Some of the interests he was expected to have were shopping, trying on dresses, and teatime. Maribelle went on a lot how important it was for a lady to drink tea. Robin was told that it was more than just drinking something but also a social event and the chance to speak with others. She was very intent on making sure that Robin knew everything there was about tea. Robin had to hold and drink his tea in a certain way. He also was expected to be very particular about his tea and only drink the finest tea that there was,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle decided the that lessons were finished and went about testing Robin. She checked his mannerisms, posture, speech, and knowledge. Robin answered every question with ease showing off his new vast knowledge. He was shocked at how much information he was able to cram in but he felt that he forgot about a lot of other stuff in the process. Maribelle was very impressed with his posture and mannerisms as well. Every movement and way he held himself exuded pure femininity and grace. Between his elegance, sweet smile, beautiful dress, perfectly done hair and makeup, almost anyone besides Robin himself would just see a lovely lady. Maribelle told Robin how proud she was of how he did with Lissa agreeing. Robin responded by giving them a curtsy and thanking them for everything they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin realized a bit too late that he had made a grave mistake. With Lissa guarding the door, he decided to wait it out until the lessons were over before figuring out what to do. He now knew that he greatly underestimated how powerful Maribelle's lessons were and how dedicated she was into making sure he learned them by heart. He had to admit though that Maribelle was very skillful at molding someone into a proper lady. Robin had so many new ladylike habits that were so deeply ingrained that his body just followed them by instinct. Even his mind was flooded with all sorts of new beliefs, knowledge and interest. Large parts of his mind were trying to push him to fully accept being a lady. Robin wondered if it was even possible to fully go back to how he was before. Even most of the parts of his mind that resisted were affected heavily by Maribelle's lessons. They were much more noble minded and quite proud of the fact as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle pondered what she should do next alongside Lissa. Robin was close but they wanted Robin to not just fully accept being a lady but also to embrace it. They figured that they should do something big to test his newfound skills in a real life setting. They were sure that it would also give him the final push that he needed.</span></div></div>",

Of course considering their friendship he shouldn't be that surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Robin,\" Chrom said. He turned to Lissa and Maribelle. \"Lissa, Maribelle, may I ask the two of you to leave? I need to talk with Robin in private.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course my lord. Come Lissa, we shall give the two some alone time.\" The two ladies quickly left the room leaving Robin alone with his fiancee. The tension felt awkward. Robin didn't know why Chrom wanted to marry him. After all, he knew that Robin's a man. Does this have something to do with Chrom's reaction to Robin's makeover earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin, I need to tell you something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that Chrom?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have been friends for a while, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a short time. But we have formed quite the friendship within such a brief time frame. Why did you ask?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, lately I been having some weird feelings for you and I didn't know exactly what they are.\" Robin gulped. He didn't have a good feeling about what Chrom's feelings are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But when you showed up earlier this morning all dressed up it hit me. I love you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-what?\" Robin stammered in pure shock. Of course it did had something to do with Chrom seeing Robin's new look after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I now know what I want. I want to keep you safe. I want you to be loved and respected by all of Ylisse. But most of all, I just want to be by your side till the very end.\" Chrom said. It must've took a lot out of him to unload these feelings on his best friend like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin, I know Maribelle already told you we're engaged. But I want your official approval on this.\" Chrom took out a brown case and opened it up as he lowered his knee, revealing a ring. Robin could tell that it was quite a beautiful ring. It was a golden ring with a big shiny diamond on it. He knew that Chrom wouldn't give something like that to just any girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin,\" Chrom looked up at the young tactician's face. \"Will you marry me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin didn't know what to do. On the one hand, being Chrom's wife would give him a life of comfort with plenty of security, and he wasn't sure why, but he couldn't help but find Chrom attractive. <i>Wait, what? I don't think Chrom's cute. I'm not gay. Grrrr, what's going on with me?</i> On the other hand, he's a man and he knew that Lissa and Maribelle would use the opportunity to try to push him further into femininity.</span></div></div>",

He turned to see Lissa who was giving him a sly smile. Suddenly Robin raised his right hand against his will which made Lissa giggle. Next Robin found that he was giving Lissa a curtsy \"Thank you for all of your generous aid you have given me. Now, I may become the proper lady that I was always meant to be.\" Robin said in a soft and girlish of a voice that he could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa was sent onto the floor in a laughing fit while Robin was left there wondering why he did that. He wanted to run away as she was distracted but instead he stood there patiently until Lissa was back up. Robin could only assume that this was because of Lissa's spell. Robin was forced to adjust his posture into a proper and feminine form. One of his hands gently rested against his hip while the other opened up his white parasol to protect his fair skin from the sun.\"Are you ready this time, Robin?\" Lissa asked while trying to stop herself from laughing again. \"Of course, I apologize for my earlier actions. I have no idea what came over me.\" Robin politely said while screaming inside his own head, now that he had lost control.</span></div></div>",

You wanted me to help you become a proper lady and I couldn't say no.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lissa told Robin their plans on what they're doing today, She noticed that Robin's now standing up straight with his chest out and his shoulders back.

Lissa figured that Ricken would be the best choice for him. Robin was a beautiful, feminine, and elegant lady now and Lissa wanted him to be more comfortable in his new role as that. Lissa wanted Robin to be with a noble to get him used to being a high class lady. Granted Ricken wasn't exactly high-class compared to the other nobles because of his broken and dishonored house, but Lissa bet that he'll treat Robin right. Ricken will make Robin feel like a lady and the relationship will help Ricken feel like more of a man. Everyone will be happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa turned to Robin with a big smile. \"Alright Robin, I know who will be the best boyfriend for you. It'll be Ricken!\" Lissa excitedly said as Robin blushed in embarrassment. He wanted to scream and stop her before it was too late, but being in the barracks dressed like this, was making him too embarrassed to act. Lissa gave another reassuring smile as she told him that he would enjoy it. \"You will love being with Ricken. He's a nice, young man. You will be treated like a princess and have everything you could ever want. Wearing a beautiful dress as he holds you in his arms, giving you a kiss. Oh how wonderful.\" Lissa felt more than ever that she made the right decision and was filled with determination to make sure it worked as she dragged Robin over to Ricken's room.</span></div></div>",

She touched up his makeup and checked that his hair was perfect. \"There, now you look absolutely lovely for your boyfriend.\" Lissa smiled as she knocked on Ricken's door. Shortly afterwards, Ricken opened the door and invited the pair. At first he thought that it was Lissa and Maribelle but then began to think. When he looked carefully at the young lady alongside Lissa he noticed that it probably wasn't Maribelle. She dressed just like her and had the same hairstyle but different eye color and hair color . Lissa had a big grin on her face as she explained that it was Robin. Ricken stood there shocked at Lissa did her best to keep a straight face as she weaved her tale. She told Ricken how Robin wanted to be a proper lady and that she was helping him. Robin for his part stood there mostly silent with the occasional nod. He was too embarrassed to think straight, especially since he could clearly tell that Ricken found him pretty like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicken could still hardly believe that the beautiful, young lady in front of him was Robin. It was difficult for him to imagine that Robin could be made to look so feminine and lovely. Ricken blushed a little as he studied how Robin looked. He was overwhelmed by how pretty Robin was with his fair, blemish free skin to his long luscious locks. He was entranced by Robin's soft kissable lips and found himself lost in Robin's eyes. Lissa couldn't be happier to see that Ricken was finding himself attracted to the new Robin. She just had to get him to take Robin as his girlfriend and she was sure that everything would work out after that. \"Robin is sadly  a bit uncomfortable in his new role as a lady. I was hoping that finding him a boyfriend would help Robin get used to it. Ricken, would you like the honor of taking Robin as your girlfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He could tell that Robin was a bit uncomfortable with the prospect. Ricken decided that it wasn't a problem, stuff like arrange marriages were very common among nobles. He would just have to be slow and careful with Robin. Besides considering how disgraced his family was, he couldn't refuse an offer from a member of the royal family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicken agreed to the offer which made Lissa squeal with delight and shocked Robin. Lissa said that she was going to go and inform a couple of people about it which Robin realized was trapping him like this. Robin wondered what to do for a second when he suddenly felt something. He looked to see that Ricken had gently taken hold of his hand. Ricken was clearly flustered as he tried to think of what to say first. \"I promise to be a wonderful boyfriend and treat you just like the lady you are.\" It only now sunk in for the tactician that he now had a boyfriend. It was especially embarrassing for Robin that his new boyfriend was someone young like Ricken. Robin and Ricken both blushed as Ricken led Robin over to a table and pulled out the chair before sitting Robin down. Robin became even more flustered at being treated like a lady already. Ricken sat down and wondered what he should do next. He now had a pretty girlfriend but he didn't know what to do. Ricken kept taking quick glances at Robin which kept making him blush as he was still awed at how lovely Robin was now. Ricken knew that he had to do something and decided what a good first step was.</span></div></div>",

By the time Robin reached his room, Robin's posture, as he walked was, nothing less than perfectly ladylike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Robin entered his room, he sat down at a table wanting to rest his arms and head on the table. This, however, introduced Robin to an increasingly intense headache. Robin jolted up, lifting his arms and head off the table causing the headache to lessen. While trying to gather his thoughts again, his mind unconciously tries to repress the headache. This causes his body to unconciously cross his legs and rest his hands delicately on his lap, making him feel much more comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Robin gives a small sigh, while trying to figure out what to do next, he notices the small teaset resting on his desk, which he got from Maribelle for his birthday recently. As he looks at it he can't help to feel the urge to pour himself a cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do?</span></div></div>",

Memories where he fails at preparing tea and Maribelle reprimanding him, get overwritten by the scene of a proper teaparty with Lissa, Maribelle and himself attending. As the memories finish being overwritten, Robin quickly adjusts his ladylike posture. \"Of course I know how. It's only befitting for someone like myself.\" correcting himself in his high-pitched voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he picks up the white porcelain tea set in a refined manner, he starts preparing the tea expertly while keeping a dignified posture. It's as though he has done it for years making it naturel. As he fills in a cup, Robin sits down, crossing his legs, resting one hand on his lap and lifting the cup, with his pinky outstrechted, slowly to his mouth. Anyone looking at this could only look in envy to this elegant and dignified ladylike posture he was in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he enjoyed his tea, Robin found himself in need of a good book to read during his teatime. As he puts down his cup of tea, Robin leaves his elegant posture and walks daintly over to the bookcase. As he searches his bookcase he notices something.</span></div></div>",

They all felt so good on his body, he wondered why he never actually wore dresses before. <i>I feel so good in these dresses, I should wear them more often.</i> The latest one was an elegant pink and white ballgown. It had large poofy sleeves, and had tons of petticoats that made him felt so girlish. The dress had lots of heart designs embroidered into it, and tons of frills and laces. Long silky pink gloves covered his hands and a pair of fancy pink heels covered his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin smoothed the dress and walked over with a girlish sway over to the vanity. He then began to try on the makeup he found on the vanity. He thought he'll have trouble with it, but on instinct the makeup was applied swiftly and elegantly. It was like he done this several times over, except he never wore makeup until today. The lipstick made his lips look kissable, the eyeshadow and mascara made his eyes look especially feminine, and the perfume made him smell like a lady.

Robin tried to stop himself, but for some reason he had no control over his body. He wanted to scream as his body began undressing. He folded the clothing and gently place it somewhere to be washed later. His body turned its attention to the closet and with a smile began grabbing off clothing. He shuddered looking at the wide variety of colorful dresses and heels. Robin grew more and more embarrassed with each dress and heels his body tried on. Even worse was that his body kept stopping and posing in the mirror admiring the image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours had passed with dozens of fancy dresses finding there way on his body. To Robin it felt like days had passed while trying to find the perfect dress. His body finally found what it wanted as it tried on an elegant pink and white ballgown. It had large poofy sleeves, and had tons of petticoats that were very hard to move around in. The dress had lots of heart designs embroidered into it, and tons of frills and laces. Long silky pink gloves covered his hands making him unable to touch anything without thinking of his incredibly girly predicament. To finish off a pair of fancy pink heels were slid onto his feet. Robin didn't just feel like a prisoner in his body, but also in the fancy ballgown that restricted his every movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body smoothed the dress and walked over with a girlish sway over to the vanity. The fashion show was embarrassing enough, but putting on makeup was even worse for him. He had to constantly look at his reflection and watch as it became even more girly looking with each stroke of the makeup brush. A touch of lovely smelling perfume was added and all Robin saw was a beautiful elegant lady. It was only know that Robin grasped that this was his room now. These fancy girly ballgowns belonged to him. Robin wondered what was going to happen next. On cue, his body began acting again.</span></div></div>",

Maribelle poured the tea for both of them and Robin took a sip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Robin was acting like his usual self. But as time went on Maribelle began to notice that Robin's posture is changing. His posture was now more feminine and proper. His back was straight, his legs were crossed and he was sipping tea with his pinky up. Rules on how to behave like a proper lady (such as how to walk gracefully in a ball gown, how to find the best dress for certain occasions and how to get a husband for example) slowly started to slip into his brain. Maribelle was happy that her spell still did something she wanted as Robin carried himself much better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she spent the afternoon with Robin chatting over their mutual interests, Maribelle deemed the spell to be a great success now that Robin was much more proper even though it didn't work exactly like she intended. After they finished tea Robin said \"Thank you for having tea with me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a problem Robin. It's not everyday I get to spend time with someone who's prim and proper like you.\" Maribelle said.

Set on his goal, he headed off to Maribelle's room. Knocking on the door, he was soon greeted by Maribelle. Maribelle was a bit shocked to see him, but she was happy he was here. She welcomed him in while she prepared them some more tea. Maribelle listened with a smile as Robin asked if he could have some of her clothes. Maribelle immediately accepted since this was the perfect chance to give Robin a more refined look. Before she gave him some clothes, she offered to do his makeup and fix up his hair a bit. Robin agreed it was a good idea. Maribelle sat Robin down and got to work on him,  using different creams and lotions to soften his skin and remove any blemishes. She added a bit of makeup to his face too enhance it a bit like some lipgloss. Next she washed his hair and used lots of different hair products to leave it free of tangles and silky soft. The hair products left a sweet smelling scent in his hair which she started styling.  It was too short to do much, but Maribelle cleaned it up as much as she could and teased it into a feminine style. She finished off by placing two white bows in his hair and a bit of sweet smelling perfume. When he saw how he looked, Robin was overjoyed. He looked, felt, and smelled much more like a lady should. Maribelle wanted to change his clothes before they left to his room. She debated whether she should dress him in her normal outfit, or something else maybe one of her fancy dresses.</span></div></div>",

It also might help in case they went out afterwards. She handed Robin the outfit, and he found a private place to get dressed.. He stripped off all of his clothes, and began with the undergarments. He put on a pair of pink panties and clasped on a matching pink bra. Next was a pink corset that tightened his waist giving him a feminine figure. It was quite painful, but Robin thought it was a necessary sacrifice for beauty. Robin put on a pair of dark pink pants and then knee length brown boots with a moderate      heel. A light pink top with dark pink accents and heart designs along with white sleeves followed. Next he slipped on a pair of fancy elbow length pink gloves. To finish off the outfit, he put on a very short pink and white coat that barely went down to his chest. Robin looked over his new outfit, and was very content. It was much better than that old ugly outfit a proper lady should never get caught dead wearing. Robin went back to join Maribelle and show her how he looked. Just like Robin, Maribelle was very pleased, but thought he needed one final touch. She pierced his ears and placed red spherical earrings in them and then handed Robin a white parasol to protect his delicate skin from the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them began gathering clothes, makeup, hair and skincare products to take back to Robin's room. When they got there, the both immediately agreed that all of Robin's old clothes had to go. Tunics and robes were removed, thrown away, and replaced with colorful dresses, heels, and fancy parasols. Robin was happy that the clothing issue was solved, but he could tell that his room needed work. It didn't even have any tea sets or fine china. Maribelle watched Robin with a big smile as she thought about the spell. It worked far beyond what she expected, and now she had a best friend with similar interests and personality. Maribelle wanted to go out with her new best friend to celebrate the spell's success and show off the new and improved Robin. One of her ideas was to go out shopping where they could buy him more clothing and items to remodel and redesign his room. She talked to Robin about her ideas and they decided on...</span></div></div>",

She decided to talk to him directly thinking that it would be easier to spot a change. Robin heard someone call his name and turned around to see Maribelle approaching him. She offered for him to sit down and have some tea with her. At first he was going to refuse since he was busy until suddenly he felt like he should accept. Maribelle brought out fine decorated pink saucers and teacups to drink from. The entire time, Robin couldn't stop himself from staring at Maribelle intently studying her for some reason. He didn't know why he was doing it, but it was so hard for him to stop.  He noticed her posture, the way she moved, how she held and drank her tea. Eventually he saw that he changed his posture. He straightened his back, while crossing his legs. When his hands weren't being used, they were delicately rested on his lap. He even copied the way she drank her tea. Robin felt embarrassed and confused, he didn't even remember doing any of it. His body just seemed to acted on its  own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for Maribelle to notice that Robin was acting a bit strangely. He held himself like a noble lady rather than how he normally did. She began wondering why, while Robin had more problems to deal with. He continued watching Maribelle this time focusing on her clothing. Robin didn't understand what was going on, but was interrupted by a strange thought. <i>Maribelle has such a lovely outfit, It probably feels divine as well. </i> Robin was shocked that he thought something like that.<i> Her outfit is simply perfect in every way. I would much rather wear that then this ugly, ratty, robe.</i> Robin couldn't get the image of Maribelle's outfit out of his mind. <i>That hairstyle looks so great on her, maybe I should do my hair like that.</i> The strange thoughts continued to assault his mind as the image in his head changed to him wearing Maribelle's outfit and with his hair styled like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Robin was failing to get the images and thoughts out of his head, Maribelle could definitely tell that something was up. 'Is something wrong?\" she asked him partly out of concern and partly to figure out if her spell did anything. Robin's face flushed with embarrassment as he vehemently denied that anything wrong. Just then another thought came into Robin's mind. <i>Maribelle acts just as a proper lady should. I should strive to be more proper and dignified just like her. </i> With that thought, Robin mustered up all his control to get up and tell Maribelle he really needed to be somewhere. His body and subconscious was acting against him trying  to get him to sit back down. He was too embarrassed to suspect that Maribelle had anything to do with it, as he ran away. It all happened so suddenly that Maribelle didn't have any time to react and push the matter. She knew for sure that her spell did something to him. Even though she didn't know what it did, she felt that she should be very happy with the effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later, Robin was hanging around camp trying to get his thoughts in order. No matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't get rid of the urge to want to dress like Maribelle, to act like she did. The urge to wear her clothing was starting to consume him and he knew he had to do something.</span></div></div>",

He knew Maribelle was right. If he wanted to be a lady like her, he can't wear these ugly, ratty robes. He has to fix that little problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle first took Robin over to the cosmetic section where she quickly picked up tons of makeup. Lipstick, lip gloss, eyeshadow, mascara, nail polish, every kind of makeup there is, Maribelle picked it. \"Now Robin, these are cosmetics. They're here to make ladies like us look beautiful. I'll show you how they work later.\" Robin grew very interested. He wondered what he'll look like with makeup on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Maribelle took Robin over to the clothes section where she quickly showed the tactician all kinds of outfits. \"Now, a lady must always be dressed for the occasion. That means you must have a wide variety of clothes.\" It didn't take long before Robin noticed that most of the clothes that they picked up are dresses. Granted, they did get some riding pants which Maribelle explained are for riding horses. But they mostly got dresses. Not that he was complaining of course, they did look beautiful. They also got heels, bras, panties and various undergarments that ladies wore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin couldn't help but stare at one dress that's currently on a mannequin. It was an elegant pink and white ballgown. It had large poofy sleeves, and had tons of petticoats underneath the dress. It also had lots of heart designs embroidered into it, and tons of frills and laces. It was so beautiful, Robin imagined himself wearing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Robin? I could buy you that dress if you like?\" Robin turned to see Maribelle with a smile on her face. She could clearly tell what Robin was thinking right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, in fact I could help you try it on if you want?\" Maribelle said. Robin was ecstatic, the thought of wearing such a lovely dress made his heart flutter. But on the other hand, he felt embarrassed. Part of him didn't want to wear the dress in a place where everyone could see him. It was too embarrassing for him. But he really wanted to wear that dress. Robin was confused on what to do.</span></div></div>",

She reprimanded Robin each time his back was less than perfectly straight, or if he had his hands on the table. The hardest part for Robin was getting used to having to cross his legs and rest his hands delicately on his lap. It went on until Maribelle was sure that he had gotten it all down. \"Good progress Robin, but that was the easy part.\" Maribelle gestured for Robin to get up as she began lecturing him. Maribelle told Robin every little rule on proper posture for a lady. Like before, she reprimanded him every time his posture wasn't perfect but she also would then start the lecture all over. It was shocking to Robin how much he had to pay attention to. Sometimes it was his elbows were bent at the right angle, or his legs were too far apart, his shoulders slouched, his hands weren't resting in a feminine position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle was determined to make sure that Robin's posture was nothing less than perfectly feminine. Eventually she moved on to walking as she gave Robin the lecture along with a pair of heels. Robin quickly put them on. He noticed that the heels were a perfect fit on his feet if very tight and snug. He tried to wiggle his toes and he found that he was unable to. Maribelle then placed a book on his head and told him how to walk properly. With the heels that he was wearing, and the fact that he had to walk like a lady, it was especially difficult for him. He kept having to do it over again, taking a while to even get past just not causing the book to fall. He eventually got it as he expertly placed one foot in front of the other in dainty steps. This had the effect though of giving his walk a feminine sway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful, Robin, but now we will try it in a more restricting outfit.\" Maribelle lead Robin to her closet as he got in dressed in a fancy ballgown and a pair of fancier and higher heels. Robin was made to go through the whole process again in his new outfit. Lots of it was easy due to how ingrained his new posture was, but he underestimated how much harder it was with this wide dress and taller heels. Robin had to gently lift up his skirt when he walked and it was difficult walking and standing straight in these new heels. After a while, Maribelle said that he was done with the first lesson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin breathed a sigh of relief, but he had to admit he was a bit nervous. Robin noticed that he now walked, stood, and sat just like a high class lady would. He didn't even have to try, it was all natural to him now. Robin couldn't even force himself to change his posture, it just went back to how it was supposed to be. Robin was surprised, he didn't expect Maribelle's lessons to be so effective, at this rate if this continued, he would probably be unable to act in any way except like a lady. Exactly the way he wanted. Maribelle smiled as she looked over Robin. He was dressed so femininely with his current attire and posture prim and proper. \"Perfect, you look exactly how a lady should. Next we shall move on to lesson two...\"</span></div></div>",

Eventually he gave in to his urges and thought of how he should do it. He didn't want to talk to Maribelle or take anything from her, so she wouldn't get suspicious and he surely doesn't want to be seen shopping. <i>If only there was a spell that'll get me what I want.</i> Robin got struck by an idea. <i>A spell... That's it!</i> Robin immediately ran over to his spellbook as he recalled a spell once that could make someone's wardrobe exactly like another person's wardrobe. After some time the strategist managed to find the spell that he wanted. He quickly cast it on himself only to be briefly blinded by a bright light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the spell began its work, Robin's clothes started to change. His outfit was turning lighter and lighter while his shoes started becoming a brown color. His coat was slowly disappearing. Robin's shoes had morphed fully into a pair of brown boots that reached up into his knees. The heels on the boots also slowly started to grow. The color of his clothes now shifted fully to a mostly light pink and white ensemble with a bit of a darker pink in places. His coat has completely disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin felt a sharp pain in his ears as a pair of spherical red earrings formed in them. He could feel that his underwear has gotten much softer as they turned into a pair of panties. He could also feel a newly formed bra under his shirt. Next white bows were beginning to appear in his hair as it reached his shoulders and was now a bit thicker. The hair on the rest of his body had also disappeared. His nails have also lengthen a bit and are now more shapely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin put a hand on his face. He could now feel that his skin is now much more smooth and soft. It was free of blemishes and show off the dedication that Maribelle (and soon Robin) put into skincare. The next change was that Robin found his hair lengthening down to his lower back. The hair was collected into multiple ringlets that gave him a ladylike appearance. With that the bows in his hair finished up, and now Robin completely had Maribelle's hairstyle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Robin's clothes have fully formed. His coat completely disappeared as his clothes to gain new frills and heart designs. His boots gained slight heels and Robin found his hands engulfed in a pair of fancy pink gloves. Robin was now fully wearing Maribelle's outerwear. But what was once in his hand a sword had changed into a white parasol to protect Robin's now fair skin from the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the changes were finally done, Robin took a good long look at himself in the mirror. <i>I look... beautiful.</i> The strategist couldn't help but form a smug smile on his face. <i>Yes, this outfit is so much better than that ugly, ratty robe.</i> He quickly turned around to see that it wasn't just his clothes that the spell changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis room was given a complete makeover and was just like Maribelle's. The room had pink walls and everything in the room was either white or pink. It was much fancier than before with lots of expensive decorations. His simple bed was replaced with a massive bed with silk sheets. The room was very well kept and Robin could see that all of his stuff had been replaced. His weapons were changed to parasols and his tomes to fashion books. Robin could also see a vanity table with dozens of make-up products with his closet right next to it. He quickly opened the closet door only to see that all of his clothes were replaced with Maribelle's clothes. What once were tunics and robes were replaced with fancy dresses and riding clothes and his boots were replaced with fancy heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin thought about what to do next. <i>Should I really change into something more formal? I don't have to, but it wouldn't hurt to wear something that'll make a wonderful first impression to the others about my new self.</i> After some thought Robin decides to...</span></div></div>",

Maribelle couldn't help but notice that Robin seemed a bit shocked and confused like he didn't want to do it. They sat down conversing for a bit while Maribelle wondered about something. She started to think that maybe her spell did do something and tried to check something out. \"Robin, sit up straighter.\" Both Robin and Maribelle were a bit shocked to see him actually follow her suggestion. Maribelle followed with some more to continue to find out what was going on. Robin couldn't help but wonder why he was being so agreeable and obedient right now. Maribelle smiled seeing the fruits of her labor. She had gotten Robin to adjust his posture so he was sitting just like her and drank tea the same way. She started to think that she had a good idea on what was going on. If it was what she thought, then her plan to make him classy could continue.

At first Robin was just there to hold her shopping bags, but the trip was accelerating the potions effect. Robin could feel himself becoming more and more interested in all of the dresses, shoes, and makeup Severa was buying. When Severa noticed it she shoved each purchase in his face to speed up the process. Eventually she was able to convince Robin to try on her purchases. After a bit he went from begrudgingly trying on clothes to happily shopping for his own new clothes with Severa.  Robin left with Severa now wearing a dress, heels, and makeup and now completely had Severa's love of fashion.

She decided to nurture his competive nature with a competion. Robin and Severa got into a bunch of competitions for things that Severa liked. She and Robin modeled clothes and makeup to see who looked better. Than they competed over who could buy the better outfit. At first Robin didn't care too much, but he quickly got into it. By now he was just as competive as Severa and wanted to show off how great he was.  Next Severa made sure that Robin looked like a girl and they started flirting with cute boys. Robin just did it because Severa wanted him to at first, although he began to really like it. He lost his attraction to girls and replaced it with an obsession with cute boys. He also found himself becoming short tempered and very hot blooded. Severa giggled as she had accomplished her goal. Now Robin acted just like her and would understand how she felt. She wondered what she should do with Robin now.</span></div></div>",

It would solidify and serve as a permanent reminder to Robin of his new girly life. Severa and Robin bought everything they needed and headed to his room. They got to work painting the room a lovely pink color and painting the furniture pink or white, and if not that it was replacing it with cuter furniture. Old dusty tomes about tactics and strategies were thrown away to make room for fashion books and books about flirting. They placed a vanity in the room and lined it up with an overflowing amount of makeup. The bed was given a pink sheet with hearts on it along with heart shaped pillows. Severa and Robin saved the best part for last as they began replacing clothes. Robin's briefs were gone and in their place was at least five times as many panties in many colors and just as many matching bras. the two giggled as they grabbed each robe and tunic one by one and cut them up and replaced it with a cute dress. Boring boots were now lovely heels and any influence of Robin in the room was gone, leaving a girly room for a now very girly person. Severa had Robin get changed into a dress in the room and then had him sit at the vanity and fix up his makeup. As Robin applied wonderful lipstick to his lips in his Severa styled room, any last remnants of Robin's old personality were gone and replaced with amazing Severa thoughts. The two giggled as they worked on their makeup thinking of what to do next.</span></div></div>",

So she... *ahem* \"borrowed\" a tome from Henry's collection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, which page was that on?\" she muttered, flipping through the book rather than waste time looking through the table of contents. \"Ah, whatever. It's not like there's more than one swapping spell in this tome. Ah, here we go.\" She stopped at a page that read \"Swapping Perspectives\" and began to read the instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drew the circle in the ground required by hexes, curses and the like (battle spells summoned the circles in the air, but hexes were mostly used in at-home rituals), put a lock of her hair on the left, then put a lock of Robin's hair on the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, if she had actually <i>read</i> the section of \"Swapping Perspectives\" instead of going with the first one available, Severa would've known that for a proper Body Swap, you place the caster's hair in the four cardinal directions and the target's hair in the exact center. But, well, there was a reason she decided to be a Mercenary instead of a Dark Mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe charged up her magic, chanted the words of the spell, and then filled the circle with her magic, making it glow in the process. Finally, the circle shone with a bright light...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, I wanted to be blinded today,\" Severa gritted out sarcastically, only removing her hand from her eyes when the light disappeared. She looked over herself: purple coat, brown boots, abs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the spell didn't even work properly!\" She groaned, irritated at her perceived failure. \"Gawds! Why do I even bother!\" She threw the tome on the floor and stormed out of the room, grumbling all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin stopped in the middle of looking over a few maps, suddenly feeling something was off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I forget to do something today?\" He quickly looked over his planner for the day, and found everything crossed off for the day. \"Okay, so it's not that... Did I mess up while getting ready?\" He tugged on his long red twintails and adjusted the bindings on his chest, but didn't feel anything out of the ordinary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe yawned, arching his back more so than usual, yet didn't seem to notice. \"I'm probably just tired, then.\" He made the last of his notes on the terrain, then went off to bed.</span></div></div>",

She undressed him marveling at how deep in sleep he seemed to be. This gave her the perfect idea for what to put on him. Maribelle had given her a very girly outfit recently that she wasn't sure about. Forst she pulled out the matching bra and panty set. They were white with pink frills and bows on them. She put them on and then moved on to his legs. She pulled up some white stockings that were very tight on him. Next was the pink and white heels, they were about 3 inches and had lots of straps around the ankles. It took her forever to get them tied right, but thar just meant Robin would find it very difficult to take them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa had some white gloves that she wanted to put on him, though she decided to wait in case she paints his nails. She pulled out the main piece, a very elaborate and girly dress. It had all kinda of pink embellishments such as ribbons, frills, and bows. It had a massive bow on the back of the waist and a seemingly infinite petticoat. It was very difficult to put on him, and would be nearly impossible for him to take off, it was quite small on him, which made it even more perfect in her eyes. Lissa pulled out the last two pieces. First was a matching bonnet that she tied tightly around his head. Lastly was a matching parasol that she placed in Robin's hand. She loved the new look she was giving Robin. He looked like a dainty doll. Lissa wondered where to continue from now. </span></div></div>",

Lissa started by shaping his nails so they were much cleaner and feminine. She pushed back his cuticles and brought out the nail polish. First was a coat of light pink nail polish. When that was done, she used a darker pink to create some heart designs on Robin's nails. She was proud of her work and looked over it with a smile. Lissa grabbed the elbow length silk gloves, but there was something to do first. She pulled out a very sticky substance that she applied to the inside of the gloves. Lissa than pulled the gloves up Robin's arms where they were stuck. Next she used the same substance to glue the parasol to his right hand.

Some light pink eyeshadow and then it was time for the final piece on his face. Lissa gleefully applied some bright pink lipstick onto his lips to make them look nice, plump, and kissable.

She hoped to win over Chrom's heart, but she was unable to build up the courage to tell him how she felt. She wondered and wondered what she could do to win over his heart. While she was absent-mindedly walking about, she accidentally bumped into Anna. Cordelia apolgozied and was about to leave, when Anna moved in front of her asking if she wanted to buy something from her. Cordelia denied and was about to leave when Anna said she had stuff that could make someone's wish come true. Hearing that perked Cordelia's attention and she excitedly asked if Anna had anything to help someone fall in love. Anna smiled and brought out a cursed book that she said was rumored to contain the secrets to love. Cordelia thought for a second about it, it could help her or there could be unexpected effects. When she thought of having a chance to marry Chrom though, she caved in and bought it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia clutched the book tight and left while Anna waved and told her to come again. Cordelia found a quiet place that she didn't think anyone would go. She looked at the book, it reminded of the very steamy romance books that she liked to read, though she could feel something about it. She opened it up and started reading through it. It really was just like the erotic, smutty romance books that she loved, and her face was as red as a tomato as she read through it. Anything else she read couldn't even compare, as she was lost in it. Cordelia wondered how the effects would work and what would happen before hearing a noise. She knew that someone was approaching, and in her hurry to get out before someone saw her with the book, she accidentally left it behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin walked over to where Cordelia was a second ago wondering what had happened. He was sure that he had heard someone over here, and turned to see the book. He could tell that a strange aura was radiating from the book. Robin pondered who it belonged too before going to check it out. He began reading from the beginning and it didn't take him long to be shocked. \"Wh-What is this!?\" Robin said out of both shock and embarrassment. He had never read a book like this and couldn't believe what he was reading. No matter how much his face went red or how fast his heart began beating, Robin found himself unable to stop. He wanted to close the book and leave, but was completely unable to avert his eyes. As Robin was lost in the book, it was beginning to activate it's spell on him.</span></div></div>",

First his boxers were morphing and changing colors as they became a pair of red panties. Fabric appeared as it wrapped around his chest, to form a matching red bra. Robin's pants were melting away to nothing, as his boots were growing taller. They lengthened all the way up to his things as the color changed to a red color.On the boots right above the knees, a pink strap appeared while the top of the boots folded to expose the inner white fabric. Next a pink garter belt was attached to pink stockings under the boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin's robe began to shorten as it became the length of a mini dress. Silver armor was forming on parts of Robin's robe such as the side of his arms that were facing outward. More silver armor was covering his chest, as it began to shape itself. The new chestplate was molded so there was two metal cups that made it look like Robin had breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin could see the new metal covering his arms out of the corner of his eyes while reading. He wondered what was happening to him, but he couldn't pry himself from the book so he could see. Suddenly he felt a little different, he could feel the wind brushing up against his skin more. Robin's skin had become softer, smoother, and blemish free just like Cordelia's and the effort she put into skincare. There was a strange tickling feeling against his back and thighs as Robin's hair grew down to his knees while two long strands went over his ear and rested against his chest. More wild strands in his hair appeared as a silver feather shaped accessory formed in his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fabric of the robe became softer and thinner with the shoulders disappearing to leave the sleeves detached. They turned into red gloves that went up to the upper arms and had multiple pink straps on them. The middle of the mini dress became white while the sides were now red. Finally a pink belt that crossed into a x shape with heart shaped ends finished off the outfit. The items that Robin had on him changed as well, his tomes becoming books on Pegasus riding, and care and his sword now a long silver spear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was finally freed from reading the book just in time to look over his new outfit. He blushed in embarrassment to see that he was now dressed up like Cordelia.He wondered if there way any way he could reverse it here, or if he would have to sneak back to his room to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then as Robin was considering his options.</span></div></div>",

Robin returned to his room late at night, ready to retire to bed. To his shock, there was a package left up on the bed. Robin was suspicious, but suddenly his body acted against his will. Robin tried to move to no avail. He had no control over his body. Robin didn't notice that he had a seductive sway as he strutted over to the package. He was shocked, at the contents of the package. Inside was tons of makeup and what appeared to be clothes among other things. He didn't get much of a look inside and he pulled out the makeup and a small mirror that he placed in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was horrified as he sat down in front of the mirror and started applying makeup to his face. Against his will he kept brushing makeup across his face. He notice that it made it look like he had dark tanned skin. As Robin was forced to watch his reflection being madeover, the second part of the hex activated. As long as he watched his reflection, the more his mind began to warp and change. Robin wanted to get away from the mirror, but had no choice but to watch his own makeover. Dark thoughts started sneaking their way into his mind. As he looked over his face now fully painted to give a dark skin color,  he could feel a strange longing within. For some reason he thought of suffering and a smile started to creep its way across his face. He imagined his friends being forcibly made up with thick dark makeup and dressed in sexy seductive outfits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to deny that he was enjoying it while putting facial markings on with purple makeup. He saw the smile on his face though, and as he face looked more and more like someone else's, his resistance began to ebb. As the facial markings were finished, Robin realized that he was making himself over as Aversa. He started panicking, wondering what would happen. A growing vain part of him loved his new look and couldn't wait for it to finish. The wicked thoughts in Robin's mind started to overtake him as he was sucummbing to darkness and evil, and was starting to love it.</span></div></div>",

His mind was slowly being completely warped and corrupted by Aversa's dark magic.  The smile of his face was growing wider with each dark fantasy that ran through his mind. He grabbed some products and applied thick dark makeup to his eyes. Dark eyeshadow and black coated eyelashes that were curled and lengthened. Next he grabbed a brush and began brushing and styled his hair. When it was done, Robin recognized the haircut as the one Aversa wears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of Robin was horrified to see his face almost completely replaced by Aversa's, but just as big of a part of him was absolutely in love with it. Robin was confused as he held out one of his hands spreading out he figured. He learned very quickly why as he took out what seemed to black fake nails. He put them on one by one giving him dark claws. As Robin did this, the dark fantasies continued to flood his mind. Seducing men and manipulating them, turning his allies into evil as vain dark sorceresses. Causing lots of mayhem with dark magic. Robin watched as he pulled out the piece de resistance, a tube of white lipstick. Robin puckered his lips while applying a thick coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Robin looked in the mirror he didn't see his own reflection. He saw the face of Aversa with the same hair, skin tone, and makeup. There was even her vain, sadistic smile painted on his face. Robin realized that Aversa had beat him and there was no chance of resisting. With this, his mind was completely overwhelmed and warped to be just like Aversa. The tactician  hero was now a sadistic sorceress and he couldn't be happier. Robin wanted so much to give his allies a wonderful makeover, though he had something to do first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin strutted over and grabbed the clothes out of the box, nd undressed himself. He put on a black skimpy dress with a black feathery collar. He pulled up dark pantyhose with black designs on them. To finish off, he slid on a pair of very tall black heels. Robin admired himself extensively in the mirror, and then pulled out a dark magic tome out of the package. Robin thought about what to do first.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After some thought, he had a couple of certain people in mind. First there was Chrom, his former best friend would make a good target plus it would get rid of a big threat to his plans. Of course there was also Lucina, she had come back in time to stop his Master Grima from succeeding. Robin instead wanted her to be one of Grima's most loyal and devoted servants. There was also Tiki, taking out her would weaken the influence of Grima's greatest enemy Naga. \"So many targets, so little time.\" Robin giggled as he finally decided who he was going to target first.</span></div></div>",

After noticing that he'd stopped really improving after a while as a Grandmaster, Robin realized that not only he, but every member of his army that had reached level 20 had stopped improving as well. All except for one person; Kellam, whom he had used a Second Seal on to teach him the skills of the Thief class, which would, of course, be incredibly useful for someone as unnoticeable as him. By observing Kellam's improvements after reclassing, Robin realized that in order for the Shepherds to improve, they would need to take some time to learns the weapons and fighting styles of other classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is why he had ordered huge loads of Second Seals and Master Seals to be used for training purposes, and why he had just finished learning the skills of the Trickster class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter returning back to their camp, Robin headed straight to the barracks to pick up a new Second Seal, planning on going through the Cavalier class next in order to get Discipline and Aegis, two Skills he very much wanted to have under his belt. He picked up the Second Seal, flipped through the list of Classes available...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...then stopped, as he realized that there were classes there he had never seen before, not even when he had used a Second Seal beforehand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dancer, Falcon Knight, Saint...\" Robin muttered. \"Valkyrie? Dark Flier? Witch? I thought those could only be used by women!\" Robin was greatly tempted by that offer, especially when it came to the Dark Flier and their ridiculous Galeforce skill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder... which one of these should I pick?\"</span></div></div>",

Robin  and the majority of the army had left for a supposed Brigand invasion at the border. \"Nothing serious.\" He had said. \"So I'll need you to stay here, keep watch of thie border. We wouldn't want it spilling into Ylisstol.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll only be a few days.\" Chrom ruminated over his words. Robin, while a brilliant tactician, certainly wasn't the best at assigning him with any interesting tasks. The camp was practically empty. Vaike, Lissa, Tiki; all gone. He had even taken Lucina. Aimlessly marching through the camp, Chrom was stuck for things to do. He could go see Marribelle, though he wasn't sure he wanted to put up with her ceaseless complaints. He could check in Thatja, but... Actually maybe he shouldn't. As he almost reached the edge of the site, he was hocked by the sudden loud *crash* from behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rushed to the origin of the sound, Nowi's tent, only to see the manakete wrapped tightly in blankets and rope, struggling against her bonds. \"Nowi? Who did this to you?\" Chrom asked, quickly scanning the rest of the tent. He drew his sword, carefully cutting the rope restricting the girl's movements. She still struggled frantically, even after the bonds had been broken. \"It's okay now, Nowi. Whoever did this to you doesn't seem to be around any-\" A sharp pain ran through his hand, causing him to grunt in pain. He looked down, only to see the green-haired girl biting onto him. \"N-Nowi! What are you doing?\" He shouted, as the girls eyes slowly went from glazed to focused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, I feel so much better now.\" She smiled, having changed back to her normal cherry demeanour. Before he could so much as respond to the girl, her daughter barges inside, carrying an apothecary's worth of potions and herbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom-Chrom!?\" Nah was just as stunned as he was, almost dropping everything. \"Did you untie her?\" She spoke with urgency, the girl quickly placing her potions on a nearby desk, clutching her dragon stone tightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Nah, I'm fine.\" Nowi answered. Nah merely glared at her, a cheeky smile forming on her mother's face. Nah sighed. \"... She was tied up for a reason, you know. Mom was sick... I didn't want her hurting anybody.\" Nah placed the stone back in her pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you tied her up? Without telling anyone?\" Chrom responded, a little annoyed that a member of the shepherds would be so secretive. \"I didn't want to worry you all.\"  She said, running her eyes up and down Chrom's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously honey, I'm feeling so much better now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not you I'm worried about. Chrom, did she bite you?\" Nah asked, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, she barely even broke skin.\" Chrom extended an arm, showing off the small , barely bleeding bite mark. Nah sighed, glancing away. \"No... It's not fine... You've been infected by her.\"  Chrom' suddenly felt a slightly dizzying sensation, unsure if it was solely because of the news, or whatever disease he had contracted. \"So? Is it bad?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't die from it, but...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't know what it'll do to a human let alone a man.\" The dizzying sensation started to quicken, as Chrom found it harder and harder to stand or stay focused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know!\" Nowi smiled, albeit guiltily. \"You told me you didn't.\" Nah growed, before turning back to the unsteady prince. \"It'll...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It felt like his body was being crushed inwards.He dropped to his hands and knees, doing his best to fight the apparent disease that was coursing through his body. Of course, there wasn't much he could really do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, what do I do?\" Nah said, beginning to panic, she rushed back to the desk she'd placed the potions on top of and flipping through the pages of a book that lay there. Chrom couldn't see it, but it detailed what was known about Nowi's former affliction that she'd passed onto Chrom. Naturally, it said nothing of what would happen if a human male were to be infected, despite Nowi's apparent knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her daughter rushed around, trying to find a cure before Chrom's transformation was complete, Nowi simply watched Chrom as his body grew smaller. The pain he was in prevented him from fully realising what was happening, but his body seemed to have regressed in age, and his muscles had grown much weaker. His clothes were much more loose, threatening to fall off if he moved the wrong way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the pain seemed to ease off. The dizziness and nausea remained, alerting him that this was not over yet, but it seemed the first phase had completed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, you look so small,\" Nowi said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! Please!\" Nah scolded, clearly not pleased with how casually Nowi was treating this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNowi was right though. As Chrom slowly pushed himself up into a kneeling position, he found that, were he standing, he'd probably only be able as tall as Nowi and Nah were. He didn't have a mirror to observe himself in, but he guessed he'd look just as young as well. Some of his garments had fallen off, but he still had enough on to be decent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Gods. I am so sorry, Chrom,\" Nah apologised, as she saw what Chrom had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not your fault,\" Chrom managed to get out as he battled the nausea. Just as he would have guessed from his appearance, Chrom's voice sounded younger and higher pitched, but for the time being as still male, a fact he could confirm by the feeling in his pants.He reached a hand up to his ears, finding them to still be rounded, rather than the pointed tips Manaketes had. For the moment, he was still a human boy, even if he was a child instead of an adult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would not last for long, however, as the pain beset him again, forcing him to lurch forward back onto his hands and knees. Nah rushed to his side, as the next set of changes washed over him.</span></div></div>",

He couldn't believe what was happening to him... he was supposedly turning into a Manakete, and now he was just struggling to keep himself on his hands and feet. He felt a strange burning across his body, his already thin arms and legs seemingly thinning even further. He felt slight, painful cracks in his bones as his figure changed, while his face burned as it shifted and softened, eventually becoming girlish and cute. As he groaned on the floor, his voice changing even more than it already had, blue hair fell into his view. It seemed to be growing on his head, distressing him even further, but he was quixkly distracted... Chrom felt an uncomfortable shifting in his groin, as his 'outie' became an 'innie'... After a few more moments of pained groaning and shaking, it all became too much for him. His arms gave out, collapsing on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNah had a brief freakout about his sudden collapse. She was worried that the disease had killed him... meaning that her mother was guilty of murdering the Exalt, but was calmed by his... her soft breathing. Chrom seemed to have just fallen asleep, probably exhausted by the sudden changes brought on by a disease neither of them had known about before today. She lowered a hand to her head, her skin rapidly cooling as her heartbeat slowed. She was definitely getting better... though she doubted Chrom would view it the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNowi crouched down next to her, gently brushing the new girl's hair. It was hard to tell how she was feeling at the best of times... though she was a little worried that her mom was happy about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNah... didn't know what to do. Chrom looked like she'd be sleeping for a bit, but she knew the girl wouldn't react well to what happened... Who would? Her mother was maybe more happy to have another 'friend' like her than horrified by what she had done to the Exalt. All she knew was... she didn't know how to help Chrom.

While she normally didn't like interrupting the woman when she was in a deep sleep, this situation... needed to be solved. \"Umm... Tiki?\" Nah said, giving her a light shake. Her eyes slowly opened, looking curiously up at the younger half-manakete. \"Nah?... What's the matter?\" The great, seemingly always sleepy voice of Naga yawned, sitting up slightly in her bed. \"Um... there's an emergency... I think it'd be better if you just come and see.\" Nah said, having no idea how to tell someone that the Exalt had just been... turned into a Manakete. Thankfully, Tiki seemed to take her worry seriously, hopping off of her bed and briefly stretching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... I'll come see what the problem is...\" She sighed, following the Manakete back towards her tent. Stepping inside, she immediately spotted the blue haired manakete lying on thebfloor next to Nowi. She seemed content for now, but... something seemed off about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another Manakete? Where did you...\" Her voice trailed off, a rare look of concern falling on the manakete's face. Upon closer inspection, Tiki was... confused by what she was seeing. The brand on her arm... as well as the strange resemblance she had to Lucina could only really mean one thing... \"Oh... oh dear, that's...\" She sighed, staring at Marth's descendant, reduced to a young Manakete. \"Chrom, yeah...\" Nowi and Nah said in unison, though Nowi didn't sound nearly as worried as Nah did... despite looking slightly guilty. \"Anyway, you've been around since... forever, right? We can fix this... right?\" Nah quickly asked, hoping for a nice and ea1ay solution to that problem... even if it seemed unlikely. Tiki responses with:</span></div></div>",

Lissa wondered if that meant the spell had worked but while thinking about that wasn't carefully enough to not make the door creak a bit as it moved. Chrom's vision turned to see her peering from behind the door and he smiled. \"Hey there sis, come on in!\" Chrom said with glee. Lissa was smiling too, this was such a shift and he hadn't freaked out over his clothes which mean that the spell make his mind totally girly! \"Coming!\" the younger sister said as she walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're looking cute today Chrom.\" Lissa said as she got a closer look at him, up close one could tell he was a boy but it could be difficult even without his hair and makeup being done. Which gave Lissa an idea. \"Thanks! I love this dress so much, it feels delightful to wear.\" the cross dressing boy told Lissa, who was absolutely loving how much more like her Chrom was now. \"It's really pretty. But don't you think it's a waste to have such a pretty dress on if you don't have your hair or face done?\" Lissa asked playfully,causing Chrom to put his hand over his mouth. \"Oh dear, you are quite right!\"</span></div></div>",

I hope I can attract a whole bunch of cute boys with it!\" Chrom said sweetly, even his orientation taking a shift from the spell despite his body remaining mostly the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Lissa had Chrom sitting down in front of her makeup cabinet, the younger sister grinning widely as she pulled out cosmetics and went to work with great vigor. Chrom's face was totally coated in white foundation to mask the very few flaws his more feminine face had, followed by some blush being put on his cheeks and mascara on his eyelashes. A tube of lipstick was pulled out and Chrom's lips were painted a lovely vivid blue, with similarly colored eye shadow to match. Then came a bit of eye liner around his eyes and a beauty mark drawn on near the lower left corner of his lips. Next came the hair, which was a simple task as it was so easy to work with now it only took a few moments to do it up in some adorable pigtails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tada! And done!\" Lissa said with a cute bow as Chrom looked in the mirror. \"Wow, I'm soooo cute! Thank you so much little sis, I love you!\" he said, giving her a hug. Lissa was enjoying this even more than she had expected. Part of her just wanted to play around more with her new sister-like brother, but another part of her also wanted to see what would happen if she let this Chrom roam free.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chrom entered his tent, maps strewn across the table he'd set up inside. A large group of Risen had been spotted nearby, and he saw it as his duty to take them out, to keep his people safe. Of course, raw strength alone would no win the day, which is why he'd called his tactician, Robin, over to to try and come up with a plan of attack. Robin had been in the middle of something when he'd asked her for help, but she said she would come momentarily. Chrom moved towards to table, intending to tidy up the maps and put away any irrelevant to the discussion, when suddenly he was overcome with a wave of dizziness. Struggling to hold it together, Chrom drew his sword, his other hand clasped to his head, as he looked around for a potential attacker that could be causing this, but saw none. And then all of a sudden, all sensation disappeared, as if he'd passed out, and yet, he was still conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a few moments in the black void he'd found himself in felt like hours to Chrom, but before long, sensation returned, although something didn't seem quite right. He had assumed he'd wake up to find himself lying on the ground after passing out, or at least be left in the same standing position he'd been in before the void had engulfed him. However, he now found himself in a crouching position, surrounded by bushes, and he was now outside instead of his tent. His sword has also vanished from his hand. He was definitely still at the Shepherds' camp, as he could see his tent not too far away, but he'd been moved outside of it. Why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom looked around for anyone that might have moved him out here after he passed out for some reason, when suddenly, he noticed some long, dark hair, flowing into the edge of his vision. His hair was nowhere near that long, nor was it black. He reached up to grab it, and see if it was truly attached to his head, but instead his attention now moved to the hand that had risen up into his line of sight. He was certainly controlling it, but it was not his hand. It was slim and feminine, with long, purple nails. The black hair he'd seen was now the least of his worries. Chrom looked down at himself, only to discover a mountain of cleavage hanging from his chest, held in a tight, black top. Below it, a dark brown body stocking covered up the rest of the clearly feminine curves that sat beneath the breasts. He had seen this body and outfit before; it belonged to Tharja, a Plegian dark mage he'd managed to recruit during the war against Plegia. But if he was viewing her body from this angle, then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's go-\" Chrom cut himself off as he reached his hand up to his throat. That was almost certainly Tharja's voice that had escaped his mouth. That the view of his body didn't convince him, then that certainly did; he had somehow found himself in Tharja's body. He wasn't entirely sure how it happened, but he had no doubt one of Tharja's hexes was involved. He'd heard tell of Tharja's hexing around the camp, but he'd yet to become the victim of one himself, until now. Regardless, Robin would be over any moment now for their strategy meeting, so he needed to get this sorted out now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly stood up, wobbling a bit due to his new center of gravity and the heels Tharja wore, and walked over to his tent. Now that he was walking, he couldn't understand why it had taken him as long as it did to notice that he wasn't in his own body. Everything felt vastly different, from the slight bounce of his chest, to the void between his legs as his thighs rubbed together. It was an altogether odd experience, one Chrom had no intention of experiencing for any extended period of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully for Chrom, inside his tent, he saw his own body, seemingly examining itself. \"Tharja,\" Chrom called out, trying to sound commanding, although to tone didn't quite come across right with Tharja's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body turned around, looking at him with a dark glare. \"Hm, so you are in my body after all, then,\" his body stated with a rather brooding tone, confirming that Tharja was in fact the one in his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on here? Why have we switched bodies?\" Chrom asked, attempting to keep his cool, despite the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had intended to cast a hex on your to make you lose interest in Robin so I could have her all to myself. Clearly I made a mistake somewhere along the line, and it did this instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, switch us back, then. I need to meet with Robin about our strategy for the upcoming battle, and I can't very well do that while I'm in your body.\" Chrom crossed his arms, before immediately uncrossing as he realised that made them push against his breasts.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Very well,\" Tharja said. Chrom gave a small sigh of relief. He was a little worried that, given her original plan, Tharja might decide to keep his body to try and win over Robin, but it seemed she valued her own form more than she did Robin. Before Chrom could get too comfortable, though, Tharja spoke up once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will attempt to undo the hex,\" she said, deliberately emphasising the word \"attempt\". \"However, considering this wasn't what the spell was supposed to in the first place, there's no guarantee things will turn out right, especially considering your body isn't used to casting magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well, is there an alternative?\" As much as Chrom didn't want to be stuck in Tharja's body any longer than necessary, he'd prefer to do things right. While he wasn't too familiar with magic himself, living with Lissa for so long was enough for him to know that when things went wrong with magic, they could go VERY wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not unless you're willing to spend the time to learn the spell yourself, and make the exact same mistake I did. My body is experienced in hexes, so the outcome would be the same. Of course, it could take months, even years, for someone like you to start casting hexes properly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing things right was one thing, but that was far too long to wait. Unless he wanted to live out Tharja's life for that long, or embarrassing let everyone know it was him in this womanly form, this was his only option. \"Alright, let's go with the first plan, and just hope it turns out okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm,\" Tharja hummed, seeming altogether unimpressed with the situation she'd accidentally placed herself in. Chrom could do nothing but cross his finger and hope as Tharja began to mumble something under her breath and perform some sort of gesture with her hands. Was this how hexes were cast?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom held his breath as Tharja's incantation drew to a close, pray that the dizziness would return, and he'd wake up in his own body once more.</span></div></div>",

He refused to accept it, especially considering accepting it meant he would be trapped in her body until the circumstances changed. \"Tharja, my body comes with more than just time with Robin. It comes with my duties as a prince, as a leader on the battlefield. Do you really think you can so easily slip into my life like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Tharja replied matter-of-factly. \"I have my ways. While I prefer the dark arts, I'm sure I can find a way to teach myself the skills needed for your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that's enough. You've had your fun, now swap us back. That's an order.\" Chrom was getting agitated now, and was through trying to reason with Tharja. He needed his body back, and he needed it back now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and since when does a soldier give orders to their leader?\" Tharja replied, a smirk on her face. \"Now if you'll excuse me, I have to meet with Robin about the upcoming battle, and I'd rather you not be here while that's happening.\" With that, Tharja turned Chrom around, and pushed him out of the tent. Now that she had Chrom's body, and he had her's, he was helpless to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDejected, Chrom looked down at the body he'd found himself stuck in. He had no intention of being stuck as a woman for the rest of his life, but there seemed to be no reasoning with Tharja; she was intent on keeping his body for good. If he was going to get his body back, he'd need to do it himself. He assumed Tharja would have kept her notes on hexes and the like in her tent. While he'd never cast magic before, he hoped it wouldn't be too difficult, especially with a body that had plenty of experience. All he needed to do was find the hex Tharja had used, or at least one with a similar effect, and cast it to swap back with her. Of course, magic wasn't exactly his expertise. Perhaps it would be better to get the help of someone more experienced in the field, if they'd believe who he really was, that is.</span></div></div>",

They'd just think he was crazy, or that this was some sort of scheme to win Robin's affection. However Tharja had done this, he'd need to figure it out himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he wouldn't figure out anything just standing here. Walking as quickly as he was able to on Tharja's heels, Chrom headed over to Tharja's tent, hoping to find some information about the hex she'd used. He hated the way her body moved, reminding him of every little difference in his body. It made him incredibly uncomfortable, but he did his best to use that to spur on his quest to get his body back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, he managed to make it to Tharja's tent without incident. He couldn't even imagine having to try and pretend to be Tharja in front of someone else. He let out a sigh of relief once he slipped away inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, where are her notes?\" he said to himself, looking around the inside of Tharja's tent. Along the edge of the tent, there was a small desk, pilled high with books and documents. It was more than a little intimidating. \"Well... I guess I'd better start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, finding the spell Tharja had used wasn't quite is difficult as it first appeared. On the middle of the desk, a book as open to the specific spell, and though it was written in some sort of ancient language that Chrom didn't understand, Tharja's translations were on a separate sheet next to the book. Next to those were a small sigil drawn on another separate sheet, a small pile of ash in its centre. For the time being Chrom opted to ignore the sigil and the original book, and read through Tharja's translations, hoping it wouldn't be too difficult for him to understand.</span></div></div>",

Of course, Tharja's translation couldn't be one hundred percent accurate, as the spell was just supposed to make him lose interest in Robin, but if Chrom followed these instructions, he should at least be able to replicate the effects Tharja had caused. Supposedly, he needed to place some ingredients on the sigil, say a few magic words over them, which Tharja had thankfully written out the pronunciation for, and then go find the target of the spell before completing the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while for Chrom to go through all the various ingredients Tharja had collected, but he ultimately managed to find the correct ingredients in the correct amount. Now came the difficult part. Chrom had never used magic, so all he could really do was read out the words and hope that was enough. If he needed to activate the magic himself somehow, he hoped Tharja's body would do that itself. He took a deep breath, before speaking the words Tharja had written down. He held his breath, waiting for something to happen. After a few excruciating moments, the sigil began to glow slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom put his hands on his hips, proud of his efforts so far. For a more experienced mage, such as Tharja, this would probably be nothing, but it him, getting this far was an achievement in itself. He read over Tharja's translations again, memorising the words he needed to say in order to complete the spell, before leaving the tent, heading back towards his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith any luck, Tharja wouldn't have gone anywhere, and she'd still be in the tent for him to cast the spell on. He did his best to ignore the way Tharja's body was moving, and put all his focus on getting there as quickly as possible. His eyes darted around as he walked, making such no one was watching him. He was still a little worried about people spotting him, he especially couldn't let anyone interrupt him now that he was halfway through the spell that would put him back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, he was able to make it to his tent without incident, and he stealthily peaked through the flap. Inside, Tharja, in his body, was talking to Robin. They seemed to be discussing their strategy for the upcoming battle. Tharja was really doing a good job of imitating him, surprisingly. Of course, that just spurred Chrom on to get his body back even more. He couldn't let Tharja just take over his life! Quietly, so as not to alert the pair of his presence, he spoke the words from Tharja's translation, waiting for the spell to take effect. Just as with the first time the spell had been activated, Chrom began to feel dizzy, and before long, he passed out. But instead of being consumed by fear, a smile was on his face as his consciousness faded, waiting to feel the familiar sensations of his own body.</span></div></div>",

A small smile washed over his face as he realised he was no longer in Tharja's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis positivity was dashed as a looming figure suddenly entered his field of view. It was his own body. \"Well, you're a crafty one, I'll give you that,\" it said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom's mind was racing now. The spell had definitely worked, he'd fainted and everything. But if he wasn't back in his own body, then who's body was he in!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly sat up, feeling the familiar sensations of long hair swishing around and breasts jiggling slightly on his chest, although they seemed lesser than they'd been in Tharja's body. Looking down at himself, he saw the familiar black robe that Robin wore wherever she went. His eyes widened when he realised what had happened. With both Robin and Tharja being in the tent at the same time, he must have cast the spell on the wrong person, and wound up in Robin's body instead of his own!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm in Robin's body?\" Chrom said allowed, trying to get a grip on the situation. Somehow, hearing Robin's voice coming out of his mouth wasn't nearly as unnerving as hearing Tharja's, but it still bothered him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised you managed to figure out the spell so quickly,\" Tharja said, walking around to stand in front of him. \"If you'd waited until Robin was gone, you'd probably have gotten your body back.\" Tharja didn't seem particularly pleased by this turn of events. She'd taken Chrom's body to get to Robin, but now Chrom had accidentally taken Robin's body, complicating things. She'd need a new plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Gods, what have I done,\" Chrom mumbled, realising the mess he'd caused. Any moment now, Robin would be waking up in Tharja's body, probably just as freaked out as he was when he'd first swapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE!?\" And there it was. Both Chrom and Tharja turned to look at entrance to the tent, hearing Tharja's voice shouting from outside. Without hesitation, Chrom quickly pushed himself up off the ground and rushed outside, where he found a very shocked and confused Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin?\" He didn't really need to ask to confirm it was actually her, since the real Tharja was inside the tent in his body, but he asked regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-? You're... Tharja?\" Robin asked, trying to figure out who it was in front of her that looked exactly like she was supposed to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom shook his head, feeling Robin's pigtails whipping around. \"I'm actually Chrom. Tharja took my body, and then when I tried to cast the spell to swap us back, I... I accidentally swapped with you instead.\" The regret over his mistake clearly seeped into his voice, but Robin didn't seem to buy it entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that doesn't make any sense. I've been talking to Chrom all afternoon and nothing seemed any different about him. How do I know this isn't just another one of your schemes to try and get me to like you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was Tharja pretending to be me. Please, you have to trust me. Tharja has the instructions for the spell in her tent, we can use that to give you your body back, and then I can swap back into my own body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin? Is something wrong? Why'd you suddenly run outside?\" Chrom heard Tharja say as she stepped out of the flap. It seemed she was intent of carrying on the charade of pretending she was really Chrom. Only now, instead of simply making Robin believe that nothing was wrong, it gave the impression that Tharja had taken her body and lied about being Chrom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was glaring daggers at both of them, unsure of who she should trust in this situation.</span></div></div>",

Although he wasn't exactly fond of the idea of letting someone else know he was stuck in Tharja's body, he knew better than to try and sort this out himself. He knew next to nothing of how magic worked, and trying to cast a spell like this without any experience sounded like a recipe for disaster. He wanted his body back, but not so desperately that he'd try to rush things and potentially mess things up even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who could he get help from? While there were multiple users of both tomes and staves amongst the  Shepherds, Tharja was currently the only one that utilised dark magic. Most of the anima magic he'd seen only had combat purposes, so he didn't know if any of the mages in the Shepherds would be able to undo this. If anyone would be able to do it, it would likely be Miriel. She seemed to constantly be researching all sorts of things, magical or otherwise, so it was entirely possible she'd have an answer to how Tharja did this and how to reverse it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin could also be a good choice for him to go see. While Robin's amnesia did seem to prevent her from remembering where she'd learnt magic in the first place, she was still a capable mage on the battlefield. She might not know as much about magic as Miriel, but she was also Tharja's main motivator for keeping Chrom's body. If Robin knew the truth, it would throw a wrench in Tharja's plans, and since she'd no longer be able to use his body to get close to Robin, she'd have no choice to give it back. Or at least, that's what he hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked away from what was once his tent, still not comfortable with the way his hips were swaying back and forth, Chrom ultimately decided that he should go and find...</span></div></div>",

While Miriel might be able to formulate a solution, Chrom figured that without Tharja's knowledge of dark magic, it would be quicker to get Tharja to swap them back herself than it would be to come up with an alternate solution, and for that, he needed Robin's help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly made his way over to Robin's tent, doing his best to ignore all the alien feelings Tharja's body was assaulting him with as he went. He couldn't imagine ever getting used to this, but with any luck, he wouldn't have to deal with it for too long. Just as he neared his destination, Chrom spotted Robin exiting her tent, thankfully having found her before she when and met with Tharja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin!\" he called out as he quickened his pace, struggling not to trip over his high heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Tharja...\" Robin answered, sounding rather unenthusiastic. She had long since grown tired of Tharja's antics, it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom slowed down as he neared Robin, somehow already feeling a little out of breath despite the small jog. \"Listen, I know this is going to sound crazy, but I need you to believe me. I might look like Tharja, but I'm not her. She cast a spell that swapped our bodies, and now she refuses to swap us back.\" Chrom knew how crazy he sounded, but it was the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was understandably concerned by \"Tharja's\" odd behaviour. Tharja was by no means normal, but this was strange even by her standards. Was there really something to her story? \"So, who are you really, then?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm Chrom.\" Chrom was hesitant that it was really him trapped inside Tharja's body, but it was necessary if he wanted his own body back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin raised an eyebrow at Chrom's confession. It was hard to see the woman in front of her as anyone other than Tharja, let alone Chrom. \"Is this some sort of a joke? Did Lissa put you up to this?\" She had to go meet with Chrom, and this distraction was keeping her from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I swear I'm telling the truth. Tharja stole my body so she could be with you.\" Chrom was desperate for Robin to believe him, he couldn't just be stuck as a woman for the rest of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin frowned. Even Tharja wasn't normally this desperate. Was she telling the truth, or had she just gotten a lot better at acting? Was this really Chrom trapped in Tharja's body, or was this Tharja pretending to be Chrom so she'd spend more time with her? Even if went and asked Chrom, she'd probably get the same answer either way; whoever was in Chrom's body would deny Tharja's story.</span></div></div>",

It sounded odd being said with Tharja's voice, but the memory was still special to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin's eyes opened wide and her jaw went slack as she realised the truth. \"...Chrom?\" Chrom nodded, awkwardly scratching the back of his neck.

Chrom naturally followed, a little proud that Robin had liked his plan. Robin wasn't walking particularly fast, but she still found herself having to slow down at times to let Chrom catch up, as he still seemed to be struggling with Tharja's body. That was understandable, of course; Chrom hadn't told Robin how long he'd been stuck as Tharja, but she couldn't image it would be easy to adjust to a new body, especially when Chrom and Tharja's bodies were so different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were thankfully able to get over to Chrom's tent without incident, although Robin doubted they'd arouse suspicion eve if anyone had spotted them. It wouldn't be the first time Tharja had followed her around, after all. Without making her presence known, Robin stepped right inside Chrom's tent, followed quickly by Chrom himself. Inside, they found Chrom's body, which presumably contained Tharja, looking over a map of the area for the upcoming battle. Chrom couldn't tell if she was just keeping up appearances, or whether she'd actually learned military tactics that quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up as she saw the pair enter. \"Ah, there you are, Robin. I was wondering what was taking you so long,\" she said, before scowling at Chrom. \"Although it seems you've been followed here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can drop the act, Tharja. I know it's you,\" Robin said, not fooled by her act for even a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What are you talking about?\" It seemed she was rather committed to keeping up the charade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chrom told me everything. You stole his body and refused to give it back.\" Chrom mostly let Robin do the talking. While it was mainly because they only needed Tharja to know that Robin wasn't falling for her act, and he didn't need to be speaking to convince her of that, but it was also partially because he was a bit intimidated by Tharja. Her body was much weaker than his, so now that they had switched, Tharja held the strength advantage against both him and Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you trust Tharja's word over mine?\" Tharja asked, acting rather hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you remember what you said to me the first time we met?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to catch Tharja off guard. \"I... uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I thought.\" Robin crossed her arms across her chest. \"Tharja, I know where the real Chrom is now, so you can't just pretend to be him to get me to like you. Now give Chrom his body back, this isn't going to get you what you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja looked down in silence, realising that she'd been caught. The one person she needed to not know about the swap now knew. Chrom shuffled around awkwardly while Tharja thought about her next move. He hoped this would be over soon and he'd get his own body back, but he worried that Tharja might have another trick up her sleeve.</span></div></div>",

He did his best to hold Robin up as the pieces began to fall into place in his mind. He wasn't experiencing the dizziness, but Robin was. There could only be one explanation. \"Tharja!\" he shouted at the culprit behind this. He caught a smirk on what was formerly his face right before Tharja passed out, flopping onto the ground. At about the same time, Robin collapsed in his arms, and he slowly laid her down on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom's heart was racing, but for an entirely different reason this time. Tharja had cast her hex, but he was still stuck in her body, and Tharja had swapped herself with Robin instead. Instead of sorting this out before it became too big of a problem, it had simply turned into an even bigger mess. Would he ever get his body back? He was beginning to think that may he should have just learned the hex himself instead of relying on Tharja to bend to their will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short while, the two unconscious bodies began to stir. Resisting the urge to help Robin's body, which he was sure no longer contained Robin, he rushed over to his old body, gently lifting its head off the ground. \"Robin, are you alright?\" he asked. Obviously she wouldn't be completely alright, but he wanted to make sure she wasn't hurt after Tharja had collapsed in his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Huh?\" Robin was incredibly surprised by the sound of her new voice. She sat up almost immediately, and started down at the body she now possessed, her face flushing a bright red. \"I... I have your body,\" she mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, now this is much better,\" Robin's voice sounded from near the entrance of the tent. Tharja was awake, and appeared to be hugging herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tharja... why?\" Robin asked, not completely understanding Tharja's actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No matter what I did, you refused to accept my advances. I couldn't even win you over by becoming the object of your affection. So if I can't have you, then I'll take the next best thing.\" She had a gleeful smile on her face the entire time she was speaking, the kind of smile neither Chrom nor Robin had seen on Tharja's actual face before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tharja-\" Chrom started, only to be cut off immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't bother trying to talk me out of this. This is my body now, and I'm not giving it up for anything.\" This all seemed a bit unhinged, even by Tharja's standards. However, considering she was the one with mastery over dark magic here, there wasn't much Chrom could do if she refused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least swap Chrom and myself, then,\" Robin suggested. \"Chrom doesn't deserve to be stuck in your body just because you want to keep mine.\" While she would have preferred to have her own body back and have everything be normal again, Robin was prepared to accept being stuck in Tharja's body if it meant Chrom was able to have his own body back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't he? He's the one who stole you away from me in the first place, I think he's getting exactly what he deserves.\" She stood up from the ground and dusted off her coat. \"Now if you'll excuse me, I'm afraid my tactics have gotten a little rusty, so I don't have a plan for the upcoming battle,\" she said, clearly trying to play the part of Robin. \"I'm sure you two can come up with something without me, though. I'll be in my tent if you need me.\" With that, she simply walked out of the tent, Chrom and Robin helpless to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom let out a disappointed sigh, his head dropping down. \"I'm sorry about getting you involved in this,\" Chrom said, still hating that it was Tharja's voice coming out of his mouth. \"This would never have happened if I'd just tried to sort this out on my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be,\" Robin replied, coming down from the shock of being in Chrom's body to find herself somewhat uncomfortable. \"Neither of us could have predicted how far Tharja would take this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sat in silence for a moment, before Chrom asked, \"So, what do we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Robin started as she stood up, adjusting to her new centre of gravity, \"you asked me here to talk strategy for the upcoming battle, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Chrom stood up as well, not wobbling as much as he had the first time. While he wouldn't call himself \"comfortable\" in Tharja's body, he had certainly gotten a bit more used to it now that he'd had to walk around in it for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, that's probably what we should do. This isn't ideal, but for the time being, I suppose it'll be my job to lead the Shepherds, and we can't lead them into battle without a plan. I will still need your help, though. I may be a good tactician, but I'm not much of a leader.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Chrom said, nodding. He wasn't exactly pleased that he and Robin had been forced into bodies other than their own, but he was at least glad that someone he trusted was in charged, and was willing to do whatever he could to help out.</span></div></div>",

Had their plan failed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a prince now, and commander of this army. Why would I go back to being an outsider that everyone looks down upon and thinks is creepy or something of the like? You refused to accept me in my own body, despite my attempts, should I immediately give up this one when it might still bear fruit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Yes you should give it up! It's not your body!\" Robin practically shouted at Tharja. \"You can't just steal someone's life like that!\" Chrom simply stood shocked in silence. Tharja was completely dead set on keeping his body, and for more reasons than just Robin, it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can. And I have,\" Tharja stated rather confidently. \"Now, are we going to have our strategy meeting, or am I going to need to start searching for a new tactician?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of silence, and a heavy sigh, Robin approached Chrom again, talking to him quietly. \"Head back to Tharja's tent for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Chrom exclaimed, a little louder than he probably should have. Were they just giving up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just listen. Go to Tharja's tent and see if you can find anything on the hex she used. Bring anything you can find back to my tent. I'll meet you there after the strategy meeting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod and a reassuring smile, Chrom turned back towards Tharja. \"Alright, \"Chrom\", let's have this meeting then,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough they could have started immediately, Tharja seemed to wait until Chrom had left. Regardless, what was going on in there was none of Chrom's concern now. Robin could fill him in on the strategy later if he was back to being himself by then. Moving with purpose, he swiftly marched his way over to Tharja's tent, doing everything in his power to ignore the feminine way her body moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside was a bit of a mess, leaving Chrom at a loss for where to begin. A large collection of tomes lay scattered around the tent, and there was quite the assortment of ingredients that he assumed Tharja used for her hexes. He knew there had to be some sort of information about the hex here, he just needed to find it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It took Chrom a while to properly sort through the variety of tomes that Tharja kept in her tent, but he eventually managed to locate the hex that he assumed Tharja had used. Unfortunately, it wasn't as much help as he would have hoped. As Tharja had described, the hex was supposed to make the target lose interest in the object of their desires. Somehow, Tharja had messed up the spell, resulting in the body swap. Even if he could figure out how to cast the hex himself, it would be of little use unless he could mess it up the same way Tharja did. He'd still be trapped in Tharja's body, the only difference would be that his life would be her primary reason for keeping his body instead of the amount of time she could spend with Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe was also the matter of casting the hex itself. While he could certainly recognise the language used in the tome, the amount of jargon left him awfully confused as to what it is he'd actually need to do. Hopefully Robin could decipher it, being somewhat well versed in magic, even if she couldn't remember where she'd studied it. He had to hold onto what little hope he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, that tome proved to be the only useful information he could find on the hex. There were a variety of ingredients that she had stored away, but not knowing what any of them actually were, Chrom couldn't tell which, if any, were needed for the hex. So, deciding he'd found all he could, Chrom heading back over to Robin's tent, clutching the tome to his chest. He hoped Robin wouldn't be too long, he didn't know how he'd explain what appeared to be Tharja snooping around Robin's tent if someone happened to find him there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom was able to make it to the tent without incident, finding a clear spot on Robin's desk to lay the tome on, before taking a seat in the chair in front of it. His feet were starting to ache from walking around in Tharja's heels all day. How did she manage it? Not to mention, Tharja was far from athletically fit, leaving him out of breath from all his running around, annoyed by the way his breasts rose and fell as he panted. Much as he hated it, he had to admit that the longer he spent in Tharja's body, the more he was growing accustomed to it. He'd even just thought of the breasts hanging from his chest as \"his\". Would he perhaps one day grow so used to this body that he'd treat it as his own? He doubted it, but even if he did, he would still want to swap back; regardless of who's body he was comfortable with, he still wanted his life back.</span></div></div>",

Nah, who now had Chrom as her father, had inherited his royal blue hair colour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what should we do now, sister?\" On one hand, it still felt kind of odd for Lucina to hear Nah calling her \"sister\", but at the same time, it felt strangely natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... I'm not sure. I hadn't expected something like this to happen. Perhaps we should we should try to fix this.\" She sheathed the Falchion once more, noticing how it felt a little heavier in her smaller arms. She felt a little uneasy about using a sword effective at slaying dragons now that she was half dragon herself, but she supposed that couldn't be helped for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay.\" Lucina couldn't help but notice that Nah seemed a little sad at the mention of fixing the timeline so that Chrom found his intended bride. She could somewhat understand why; while she had grown up alongside a sibling, Nah had been an only child, and hadn't exactly had the most pleasant childhood. Perhaps that was why she'd taken so quickly to referring to Lucina as \"sister\". It made Lucina feel a little bad about trying to right the changes. Would it truly be so bad to leave things like this? The whole reason she had traveled back in time was to change the future, after all. Perhaps being Nah's sister, and a Manakete, was a change that didn't need to be reversed.</span></div></div>",

She looked around quickly, and spotted a Plegian archer drawing his bow and taking aim at Chrom\u2019s back. Panne grabbed her Beaststone, and felt the stone\u2019s power flowing through her as she shifted into her beast form. Once her transformation was complete, she leaped into the air and spun around, then kicked at the archer with her hind legs, knocking the archer back. While the archer was stunned, Panne followed up by charging at the archer and slashing with her claws. Her sharp claws tore through steel and flesh, killing the archer. Chrom turned around, having heard the commotion behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are safe,\u201d said Panne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Chrom. \u201cI appreciate the save.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome distance away, Lucina sighed in relief.

When you\u2019re close, I feel safer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...

I know it doesn\u2019t compare to what you went through...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt does not,\u201d said Panne. \u201cBut that does not diminish the pain you are feeling. And, despite my opinions regarding humanity... I am sorry for your loss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Chrom. \u201cThat means a great deal to me... maybe, together, we can heal each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Panne asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere,\u201d said Chrom, reaching into a pocket and pulling something out. \u201cI want you to have this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is... a ring,\u201d said Panne as she accepted the ring. \u201cAnd it bears the crest of Ylisse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Chrom. \u201cMy parents had it made to celebrate my birth. They wanted me to give it to the woman I would want to spend the rest of my life with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you asking me to be your mate?\u201d Panne asked, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... I guess I am,\u201d said Chrom as he knelt down and took one of Panne\u2019s hands. \u201cPanne, will you marry me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Yes,\u201d said Panne, with a soft smile. \u201cYes, I believe I will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina, watching from her hiding place, gasped in surprise.

But if Panne was now going to marry Chrom, then that meant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina clutched at her head as she felt a horrible pain welling up inside her, as if her entire body was being violently reshaped. The pain grew to be too much for her, and she passed out. She woke up a few minutes later, and when she came to her senses, she had a feeling that Panne becoming Chrom\u2019s wife had caused her to change as well. Lucina drew her Falchion, and held it up so that the blade caught her reflection.</span></div></div>",

While the shape of her face was still the same, her skin was slightly darker, and markings were visible on her cheeks and forehead. Her hair was still blue, but Lucina\u2019s ears were obviously different. A pair of large, rabbit-like ears hung from the sides of her head, and were draped over her shoulders. Unlike her mother, who braided her hair around her ears, Lucina allowed her ears to hang freely, much like her brother Yarne did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina\u2019s breath halted in her throat as she realised her very thoughts were starting to change. She already considered Panne and Yarne to be her family, even though that wasn\u2019t how history was supposed to unfold. How long would it be before she forgot who her true mother was supposed to be? Would she come to believe that Panne was always destined to be her mother?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina sighed and shook her head, causing her ears to sway from side to side. She had to undo this, but how? Chrom wasn\u2019t supposed to marry Panne, but it seemed that he had genuinely fallen in love with her. While Lucina wanted to restore the timeline, she also didn\u2019t want to make her father unhappy. Could she find a way to restore the timeline, and by extension, herself, without breaking her father\u2019s heart?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina tried to push her thoughts out of her mind as she sheathed her Falchion. However, as she returned the sword to her scabbard, she felt an unfamiliar weight in one of her pockets. Lucina pulled the item out and gasped. A large, smooth red rock was resting in her hand, and Lucina could feel the power pulsing through her Beaststone. It called out to her, begging her to use it and unleash her bestial form, and complete her transformation into a Taguel. However, Lucina instinctively knew that if she used her Beaststone now, there was no going back. She\u2019d become a Taguel permanently, and her memories of her true mother would be lost forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stared at her Beaststone, the question kept echoing in Lucina\u2019s mind. Would she accept her new Taguel nature and complete her transformation? Or would she try to find a way to restore the timeline, and bring her old family back?</span></div></div>",

Her Beaststone grew warm in her hands, and she felt a burst of strength flow through her. Her ears perked up as her blue fur grew longer. Her face pushed out into a muzzle, and her teeth sharpened into fangs while her nails became claws. Her feet grew longer as her legs changed shape, and her body stretched out as her muscles grew stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds, Lucina\u2019s transformation into her bestial form was complete. Once she had finished changing, she sat up and looked around, her ears twitching left and right. Despite the fact that this was the first time she\u2019d transformed like this, her beast form felt completely natural to her. It almost felt as if she\u2019d been born like this... and for all intents and purposes, she had. History had already changed when Panne had married Chrom and become her mother. Even now, Lucina could feel her original mother fading from her memory, as images of Panne began to replace her. Lucina could now also see her younger brother, Yarne, in her memories, even though, until a few hours ago, the two of them hadn\u2019t been related.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Lucina let the power fade from her, and shifted back into her human form. Her body shrank back down to her human proportions, and her ears flopped down onto her shoulders. Lucina had accepted her new Taguel nature and family, and to her surprise, she didn\u2019t regret a thing. While she felt a small pang of regret for the loss of the mother she\u2019d never know, Lucina had come back in time to change history so that her parents could live. Maybe marrying another woman would help Chrom survive in the inevitable battle with Grima...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina shook her head, and put her Beaststone back into her pocket. She had completed her transformation into a Taguel, and that was all well and good. However, what would she do now? Her plan had been to protect her parents for as long as possible, until Grima began to arise again. While she could continue to do that, maybe she could search for her new brother. Yarne, along with her other friends, had joined her in travelling through time to stop the fall of Ylisse. Maybe she could find him, and see how he reacted to the knowledge that he now had a sister. Or, perhaps she could try and find other tribes of shapeshifters. While the Taguel were gone, Lucina had heard rumours of people who could transform into foxes, or birds, or cats. Or, maybe she could do something else entirely...</span></div></div>",

Everything in his mind told him that he needed to be prim, proper, feminine, and elegant. Gaius's tastes and interests were becoming refined and fit for a lady as he gained a noticeably more haughty attitude. Maribelle looked on with interest as she noticed that Gaius was taking on a more feminine posture. He sat so that his back was perfectly straight while delicately resting his hands on his lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaius could feel his old skills of thieving beginning to slip away as he gained new skills that his new self would consider much more important. They were skills of horse riding, casting magic especially healing magic,  an encyclopedic knowledge about high class fashion, and how to converse with other nobles. Gaius could now recite any law in Ylisse by memory with ease. Maribelle decided to sit down and chat with Gaius for a little. She was amazed at how much more well behaved he was now. Maribelle happily chatted about her favorite interests and was pleased to see that Gaius had the same passion for them. They seemed to how the exact same taste in everything from what they thought were the loveliest dresses, to their favorite authors, and even what they wanted in a husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't what she intended but Maribelle couldn't be more satisfied with the results. She had turned a rapscallion like Gaius into a refined lady \"This batch of tea may be gone, but no matter. I can always make more and I know for certain that it will work.\" Maribelle thought to herself as she enjoyed her unexpected victory. \"Thank you for the wonderful tea, Maribelle. Speaking with you was quite the delight.\" Gaius told her politely as he gave her a curtsy. \"I always relish the chance to speak with a refined and elegant lady like yourself. Perhaps we can meet again later today.\" Maribelle responded with a smile. \"I would love that.\" Gaius said as he gave another curtsy and excused himself. Gaius knew that he had to get out of these clothes as soon as possible. They were ratty, garish, and sticky as they were filled and lined with all sorts of candy.</span></div></div>",

Try as he might he was losing to his desire to emulate Maribelle. He started negatively comparing himself to Maribelle. Ricken now saw his robe as being ugly and his hair a ratty mop, while Maribelle had a lovely feminine outfit and perfectly style luscious locks. He couldn't deny or resist it any longer. Ricken wanted to walk, talk, act, look, and think just like Maribelle. She was his hero, his role model now and he idolized her more than anyone else.

Maribelle was less than pleased at these turn of events. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ricken!\" Maribelle shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Ricken blushed at the thought of seeing his idol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you drank the tea?

He noticed her posture, the way she moved, how she held and drank her tea and changed his ways to match hers.  He straightened his back, while crossing his legs. When his hands weren't being used, they were delicately rested on his lap. He even copied the way she drank her tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for Maribelle to notice that Ricken was acting a bit strangely. He held himself like a noble lady, like her, rather than how he normally did. She began wondering why, maybe it had something to do with the tea Ricken drank earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ricken, is something wrong?\" she asked him partly out of concern and partly to figure out if her spell-laced tea did anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicken flushed in embarrassment. He really wanted to emulate Maribelle and maybe telling her the truth directly would help. But he was nervous, what if she didn't want to help him? What if this gets out? He'll be the laughingstock of the Shepherds. Ricken knew he had to do something, but what?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It didn't take long for Tharja to find a hex that amused her, and should suit her purpose fairly well. The hex should combine Sumia with her mount, creating a strange combination of man and beast that Robin should hopefully never fall for. A devilish grin spread across Tharja's face as she cast the hex, watching from the shadows as the scenario unfolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia, unaware that anything was wrong, simply continued to groom her pegasus. \"Good girl,\" she said to her pegasus, making sure to keep her calm, \"It won't be long now. This war will be over any day now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Sumia found herself lifted up into the air, prompting her to let out a yelp and drop the brush she was using, before being put down on on her pegasus' back. \"What's going on!?\" she shouted, looking around the stable for someone who might be doing this. However, she was unable to spot anyone as Tharja had hidden herself well enough to avoid detection. She tried to get off her pegasus, but found herself unable to move her legs, or even lift herself of its back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why... why can't I...\" She heard her pegasus let out a panicked neigh, redirecting her attention to the beast she was riding. To her surprise, her pegasus' head and neck seemed to be shrinking. \"What!? What's happening to you?\" It wasn't just the pegasus, though. Sumia noticed she seemed to be shifting forward along the pegasus' back to fill the space. She tried in vain to push herself off the pegasus' back, or at least back away from its shrinking head, but to no avail. Worse still, her legs seemed to be sinking inside the pegasus' body. She was loosing feeling in her lower half, but gaining an entirely new set of feelings to replace them. She cover her eyes with her hands, not daring to look again until it was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, her pegasus stopped neighing, and the shifting feelings stopped. Sumia slowly lowered her hands. Her pegasus' head had completely vanished, and sitting in its place was her body, from the waist up. She no longer had her own human legs, but she had a slew of new feelings coming from her lower half. She could feel the thin layer of hair coating her equine lower half, the hooves she had for feet, the tail coming out of her rear. She had four legs instead of two, and a pair of wings as well. She slowly tried to lift her leg, watching as her front left leg lifted up off the ground. It felt different from moving her old legs. She put it back down, not trusting herself to move around on four legs yet, especially with how clumsy she usually was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire time, Tharja had been watching from the shadows. This hadn't exactly been what she had in mind when she thought about combining Sumia with her pegasus, but it should work just as well. Sumia was no longer completely human, and that should hopefully be enough to stop Robin from falling for her.</span></div></div>",

That is, until she heard a very familiar voice from outside the stable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sumia, are you in here?\" It was the voice of the Shepherds' tactician, Robin, the man for who's sake Tharja had cast this hex for. Not only would he notice her leaving, but this would also be the perfect opportunity to see how he'd react, so Tharja instead opted to stay hidden in the shadows, and watch the events unfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia shrieked when she her Robin calling for her. What if he saw her? He'd think she was a freak or something! She frantically looked around for someone to hide, but she only succeeded in stumbling around and almost tripping, due to not being used to walking on four legs, along with her usual clumsiness. She managed to steady herself against a wall, but it was now too late to hide, as Robin entered the stable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sumia? Are you-\" Robin gasped as he saw Sumia, her torso perched upon the body of a pegasus. \"Oh Gods, what happened here!?\" He quickly rushed over to help keep her. With Robin beside her, Sumia noticed how much taller having her pegasus' body instead of her legs made her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't know. I was just grooming my pegasus, and then we sort of merged together.\" Her tail twitched nervously as she told Robin what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin didn't seem to be giving the reaction that Tharja wanted. He seemed more concerned than anything. Tharja still had hope that Sumia's equine lower half would prevent the two from becoming romantically involved though. \"This sort of thing doesn't just happen for no reason,\" Robin said thoughtfully, \"Someone must have done this to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did nothing to ease Sumia's fear. If anything, it made her more afraid, that there might be someone out there that hated her enough to do this to her. \"So, what now? Am I just going to be stuck to my pegasus forever?\" Sumia wasn't just worried for herself, but also for her pegasus. While she had had her legs replaced with the body of a pegasus, her pegasus had practically been killed by this, its mind wiped from existence as its body was merged with hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja readied herself to leave once more, deciding that seeing Robin's reaction was no longer worth possibly getting found out and blamed for all of this. Meanwhile, Robin looked at Sumia, trying to decide on a course of action. It was strange, to say the least, and he'd certainly never had to deal with a situation like this before. He knew a bit of magic for use in combat, but he didn't have enough experience to deal with something like this. Eventually, Robin spoke up.</span></div></div>",

Her legs moved in a completely different way from what she was used to, and she had four legs now, rather than just two. Sumia put her leg back down, and felt the strange sensation of a hoof touching the ground, rather than her foot. Sumia sighed deeply as her tail swished back and forth idly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja had watched Robin and Sumia\u2019s conversation from the shadows, and fortunately for her, neither of them had spotted her. Unfortunately for her, Robin hadn\u2019t reacted the way she had hoped he would. Tharja had hoped that this strange combination of woman and beast would repulse Robin enough that he wouldn\u2019t fall for Sumia. However, it seemed that this experience was only serving to bring Robin and Sumia closer together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja groaned quietly in annoyance. It was clear that this plan wasn\u2019t working as well as she\u2019d hoped. From her hiding place in the stables, she considered her options. Maybe she could cast a second hex on Sumia, in order to make sure Robin didn\u2019t fall for her. Or maybe she could just undo the hex and restore Sumia and her pegasus. Or she could just leave Sumia alone for now, and see how events unfolded.</span></div></div>",

Is everything alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Cordelia!\" Sumia yelped, her new wings flaring out in surprise as she looked over her shoulder at her fellow Pegasus Knight. \"I-I... uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia's voice trailed off as she stared at Cordelia as the red-haired woman entered the stable. When Tharja saw Cordelia, her jaw dropped in complete surprise. Somehow, Cordelia had also become a pegasus centaur!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look rather pale,\" said Cordelia as she trotted up to Sumia. \"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, um, I-I th-think I need to lie down,\" said Sumia. Sumia tried to take a step towards Cordelia, but her rear left leg tripped over something and she ended up staggering. Cordelia dashed forward and grabbed Sumia's human torso, and used one of her wings to steady Sumia's pegasus body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must've worked yourself to exhaustion,\" said Cordelia as she put Sumia's arm around her shoulders. \"Come on, I'll walk you back to your tent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" said Sumia weakly, and the two pegasus centaurs trotted out of the stables, leaving Tharja with her jaw still hanging open. The Dark Mage closed her mouth and shook her head. This should've been impossible! She'd only targeted Sumia, so why was Cordelia also a pegasus centaur? Not only that, but Cordelia hadn't realized that, only a few minutes ago, both she and Sumia had been normal humans! It seemed as if reality itself had been altered, but that was impossible... wasn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja bit her thumb and lowered her head, her face falling into the shadow of her bangs.

Once the two pegasus centaurs were out of sight, Tharja stepped out of the stables and had a quick look around. She saw Robin speaking with Chrom, presumably about strategies for tomorrow's skirmish against the Risen horde that had appeared near the Breakneck Pass. Neither of the two men noticed her as she walked away from the stables towards where the tents for the Shepherds had been set up. A few guards were on patrol as she made her way over to her tent. They were used to seeing her coming and going at odd hours, usually leaving to search for ingredients for her hexes, or returning from said searches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja pulled back the flap of her tent and looked around quickly, and was thankful that no-one had entered the tent while she was away, though she did notice that the ingredients for the hex she used on Sumia had turned to ash, as she'd expected. Tharja entered her tent and closed the flap behind her, and let out a sigh of relief. Thankfully, none of the Shepherds had seen her entering or exiting the stables, meaning that none of them knew what she had done to Sumia... and to Cordelia as well, apparently. Tharja moved the jars containing the various preserved animal parts she used in her hexes to reveal a book, an old leather-bound grimoire written in an ancient tongue that had contained the hex she had cast. Tharja flipped through the yellowed pages until she reached the page she was looking for, then pulled out a notebook that contained her efforts at translating the grimoire's text. She quickly scanned her translation, then retrieved a Plegian textbook that contained translations of the ancient tongue, and started re-translating the grimoire's text on a new page in her notebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving become somewhat fluent in the ancient tongue thanks to her hours of study with her initial translations, her second translation only took her about an hour, compared to the three hours it had taken her to translate the page the first time. When she was done, she compared her first translation with her newest translation. The first part of the text detailed the effects of the hex, which was designed to combine a human and a beast into a single creature. The second part of the text listed the ingredients needed to cast the hex, and that was where Tharja noticed a discrepancy between her initial translation and her second translation. Tharja checked the original lines in the grimoire and compared them to the translation textbook and grimaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she had correctly translated each of the ingredients, she had made an error in translating the amount of each ingredient required in her initial translation. In her first translation, she had mistranslated the number one for a number ten, and such had collected ten of each ingredient, rather than a single specimen of each ingredient. Suddenly, the warning listed under the instructions for casting the hex made a lot more sense. Tharja felt her stomach tie itself in knots as she read the translations of the final part of the page. It was a warning that explained that increasing the ingredients would cause the power of the hex exponentially. Tharja flipped over a page in her notebook and started jotting down numbers as she figured out just how powerful the hex had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see,\" she muttered to herself. \"If one set of ingredients is the baseline, then two sets would double it, three sets would be four times more powerful than one set...\" Tharja trailed off as she continued through to ten sets of ingredients. Her eyes went wide as she calculated how powerful tens sets of ingredients would be, then went back through the set of numbers again to check her math. Tharja felt her throat go dry as she wrote down the final calculations. By using ten of each ingredient instead of one, she had caused the hex to be over five hundred times more powerful, and Tharja dreaded that she had altered the very fabric of reality itself by casting such a powerful hex. She picked up the grimoire and looked at the page opposite the hex she used. Tharja returned to her notebook and quickly translated the first few lines of the next page of the grimoire, and sighed in relief as she realised the next hex in the grimoire was one that would reverse the effects of the one she had just cast. However, Tharja was worried that she might not be able to translate the text and gather the ingredients in time. She was loathe to admit it, but if she wanted to try and reverse the hex she had cast, she would probably need help. Tharja briefly considered going to Robin, but quickly dismissed the idea. Robin would no doubt be upset that she had cast the hex in the first place, and probably wasn't fluent in the ancient tongue, so she couldn't rely on his help for translating the grimoire. That meant that the next best candidate would probably be Miriel. The scholarly mage would probably have some familiarity with the ancient tongue, which would allow them to work together to translate the grimoire, and Tharja figured she could probably convince Miriel to keep quiet and help by convincing her it was for the purposes of discovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja yawned, and glanced outside her tent. The sun was starting to set, and Tharja suddenly became acutely aware of just how tired she was. Casting such a powerful hex had been surprisingly draining, and her concentration and focus on her translations probably hadn't helped. Tharja yawned again and considered her options. She could go and see Miriel now and try and enlist her help, or she could turn in for the night and go to sleep. Of course, the longer she waited, it would become more difficult to reverse the hex she had cast. What should she do?</span></div></div>",

Trying to sort this out while she was still tired would make her more likely to make mistakes. It would be a better idea to get some rest now, and focus her efforts on reversing this hex in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she laid down to rest, Tharja couldn't help but think about the effects of the hex she'd cast. She had not only combined Sumia with her pegasus, like she'd intended to do, but she had also done the same to Cordelia, and oddly enough, Cordelia didn't seem to notice anything amiss, and considering she didn't hear any screams or shouts when Cordelia and Sumia left the stable, she assumed the rest of the camp found it normal. With the reality altering effects in play, Tharja couldn't help but wonder why Sumia had still freaked out when the spell was cast. Perhaps being at the epicenter of the hex caused her to be immune to the reality warping effects, making her just as clueless as Tharja was about the new reality that had been created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven still, something didn't seem right. What she'd done was certainly more powerful than the hex's intended result, but it didn't seem over 500 times more powerful. Was there something she was missing, or had she simply not had a chance to see everything it had done yet. She knew it hadn't effected everyone, as she was still normal, as were Chrom, Robin, and the guards she saw on the way over here. Perhaps her spell only effected Pegasus Knights? Had she created a world where pegasi no longer existed, while the Pegasus Knight class was filled by half-human, half-pegasus people? That would explain why she hadn't seen any other changes, as Chrom's army only contained two Pegasus Knights that she knew of; Sumia and Cordelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, there was nothing she could do at the moment. In the morning, she would focus her efforts on reversing this hex, and perhaps trying one that wouldn't result in the fabric of reality being warped. Little by little, her fatigue from the day's events overcame her, and she drifted off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Tharja awoke, the first thought to hit her mind was that something felt wrong. Her barely awake mind couldn't tell what it was, but there was something not right. Her eyes slowly opened, staring at the pillow her face had been pressed onto. She didn't remember going to sleep on her stomach, and she wasn't normally the type to roll around in her sleep, so this struck her as odd. She rolled over onto her back, and that's when she realised what exactly it was that her mind felt was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs were gone, and in their place, a long snake-like tail, extending past the length of her original legs, off the edge of the bed, and then for a few metres further on the ground. She reached out and touched it, to confirm what she was seeing, feeling not only the scales beneath hear fingers, but also her hand running along where her hips should be. This was definitely real; her legs had been replaced with the body of a snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, several emotions ran rampant through Tharja's mind; confusion, panic, anger, fear. However, it soon dawned on her that this was not a curse placed upon her by someone else, nor something she could easily reverse. \"The hex wasn't done,\" she mumbled, noticing her tongue felt different, but lacking the mirror to investigate. She realised that the observed effects of her hex were not enough to quantify the hex being over five hundred times more powerful than it should be, but she hadn't expected that it not yet complete, nor that she herself would fall victim to it. Now the extent of her hex worried her even further. Clearly it was not limited to pegasus knights, nor simply to riders and their mounts. Would it simply turn anyone into a human-animal hybrid? How far would it reach? To those here in the Shepherds' camp? To all of Ylisse? To the whole world? Then there was the question of where her snake body came from. When Sumia had become a pegasus-centaur, she'd simply fused together with her pegasus, but with Frederick guarding the camp, Tharja doubted a snake would ever get close enough to her tent for her to fuse with. Not to mention, she'd never encountered a snake as large as her current body outside of myths and fairy tales. Had the hex simply transformed her outright, turning her into a combination of man and beast rather than literally combining her with an existing beast?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the very least, if yesterday's encounter was anything to go by, Tharja should have to worry about causing a panic, as the spell was so powerful that it altered reality to ensure that these new human-animal hybrids would be treated as if they were normal. Tharja was thankful that despite the hex morphing her own body, she was not also victim to its reality warping effects, likely due to being the one who cast the hex in the first place. Unless circumstances had changed overnight, Sumia was likely also aware due to being at the epicenter of the hex, and was probably still somewhat panicked about why she and others were suddenly becoming hybrids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of the warping reality, Tharja had no intention on being half snake for the rest of her life, so she needed to reverse this hex as soon as possible. She quickly sat up, swinging her tail around to the side of the bed, when suddenly she felt somewhat dizzy. A loud gurgling sound from her stomach alerted her to the cause. She felt incredibly famished, and despite having just woken up, she still felt tired, if not more so than when she'd gone to bed. She supposed this was only natural, as the hex had continued to work its magic throughout the night, draining on her energy. Getting any work done in this state would be a tough order, but if she put it off to try and replenish her enter, the hex could just continue to push onwards, assuming it wasn't complete yet. Either way, she knew she should probably seek help with translating the reversal hex, to prevent making a mistake as she had yesterday. Provided she could actually convince someone that reality had changed, that is.</span></div></div>",

She slithered her way through the camp, and Tharja felt uneasy at just how quickly she had adapted to her new body. She was able to slither around without even thinking about it, and had reared up on her snake body so that her head was at the same height it had been when she had legs. Not only that, but the feeling of sliding over dirt on her scales felt incredibly natural, as if she\u2019d never had legs in the first place. That scared Tharja more than anything.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tharja winced as another pang of hunger shot through her body. She had no idea why she was so hungry, but she wasn\u2019t going to wait around for the rest of the camp to wake up and prepare breakfast. She needed to eat, and that meant she needed to go hunting. She removed her dark mage cape and tossed it aside, not wanting it to get in the way during her hunt. With that done, she slithered out of her tent, and slipped out of the Shepherd\u2019s camp and into the wilderness surrounding the clearing. The Shepherds had set up camp just to the north of a small forest east of Breakneck Pass, and Tharja entered the forest, keeping her human body low to the ground as she weaved her snake body between the trees. Tharja\u2019s forked tongue poked out of a small divot in her lips, tasting the air before slipping back into her mouth. Tharja could taste the scents of smaller animals, like foxes and rabbits, as well as the scents of larger animals like deer, and possibly even a bear. She headed deeper into the forest, her tongue constantly darting out of her mouth and back in, slowly getting a better idea of what was in the forest, and how close her potential prey might be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about fifteen minutes, Tharja stopped. She was well inside the forest now, and she sat still for a minute, her tongue poking out and back in as she tasted the air, getting a sense for what was around her. The taste of fox fur and rabbit blood was in the air, suggesting that a fox had recently caught a rabbit for breakfast. However, rabbit didn\u2019t interest her; they were far too small, and she doubted that she could find enough to sate her hunger. She could also taste bear, though it was faint, at least a few days old. Her tongue continued sampling the air, and she could taste deer somewhere to the southwest, somewhere close. Tharja lowered her body and slithered to the southwest, keeping her arms close to her sides as she slithered around the trees. Her tongue was darting in and out of her mouth faster now, giving her a better sense of the deer\u2019s trail. Her eyes scanned the trees ahead of her, looking for any signs of the deer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja stopped as movement to her right caught her eye. She turned her head slowly, and saw a deer walking through the forest, stopping to sniff the air. Tharja lowered herself to the ground and began inching towards the deer ever so slowly. The deer had its back to her as she got closer and closer, her large snake body making no sound as it slithered forward. Tharja opened her mouth and smiled, exposing her two long fangs, dripping with venom. As she got within striking distance, a soft chuckle escaped her throat. The deer turned to face the sound and spotted her, but it was too late. Tharja lunged forward, opening her mouth wide as she struck. Her aim was true, and her teeth sank into the deer\u2019s neck. Tharja savoured the warm tang of the deer\u2019s blood as venom shot out of her fangs into the deer. The deer struggled, trying to tear itself from her mouth\u2019s grip, but Tharja wrapped her arms around the deer\u2019s body, holding it still as she emptied her venom sacs. Once she was sure the deer had enough venom in its blood, she opened her mouth again, pulling her fangs out of the deer\u2019s neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja let the deer go, and licked the blood from her lips as the deer staggered off into the forest. Tharja followed the wounded deer at a leisurely pace for a few minutes, tracking it by the scent of the blood dripping from its neck. After a few minutes, the venom in the deer\u2019s bloodstream finished its work, and the deer collapsed, dead. With her prey dead, Tharja slithered up to it. She grabbed the deer\u2019s legs and tucked them up close to the body, then slithered around to the deer\u2019s rear. Tharja picked the deer up by its rear and lifted it up to her mouth. She unhinged her lower jaw, allowing her mouth to open much wider and lower than normal, and began stuffing the deer into her mouth. It took Tharja the better part of five minutes to get the deer down her throat, but she finally managed to get the head into her mouth. Once the deer\u2019s head was past her lips, she closed her mouth and swallowed, her neck and human upper body bulging as muscles began pushing the deer down past her human body and into the digestive system located in her snake body. After about two minutes of swallowing, Tharja had managed to get the deer into her snake body\u2019s stomach, bringing her human upper body back to normal proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja sighed in contentment, basking herself in the light of the rising sun, satisfied by her successful hunt. However, as pleasant as sunning herself was, she needed to get back to the Shepherd\u2019s camp.</span></div></div>",

She was slithering at a slower pace than she had been on the way in, as her stomach was bulging out due to the deer she had eaten. Still, she made it back to camp without incident. As Tharja made her way back into the camp, she could see that a few of the other Shepherds had risen, and it sounded like breakfast was being served in the mess tent. Having already eaten, Tharja simply slithered past the mess tent and made her way back to her own tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja entered her tent, and looked herself over. Her clothing was covered in dirt and twigs from where she had slithered through the forest, so she quickly removed her dirty clothes and retrieved a clean set of clothes. She frowned as she held up the full body stocking that she wore as part of her Dark Mage uniform. For some reason, this one had a pair of legs, which was odd, since Tharja obviously didn\u2019t have legs. However, the hex Tharja had cast yesterday soon kicked in again, and Tharja felt an odd headache, causing her vision to blur. She blinked her eyes and shook her head, and when her vision cleared, the full body stocking she was holding now ended at the waist, and there were no longer any legs. Of course, Tharja no longer remembered that the body stocking had once had legs. She frowned, trying to remember what had caused her to falter, then shrugged and slipped the body stocking on. Tharja quickly donned the rest of her Dark Mage uniform, then slithered out of her tent once she was fully dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, Tharja,\u201d called out a voice, which Tharja immediately recognised as belonging to Robin. \u201cI wanted to speak to you regarding today\u2019s skirmish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja turned her human body around, and spotted Robin a few feet away.</span></div></div>",

Extra joints formed in her shrunken legs, and her abdomen began to extend, and the new growth was also covered with a black exoskeleton. Eight points began to form on Tharja\u2019s second thorax, four on either side, and these points stretched out, forming multiple joints as her new legs grew in.

Still, what he'd said the last time she spoke to him nagged at the back of her mind, telling her something was wrong here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last time she saw Henry, he'd asked if she wanted to try her hand at dark magic, and after she accepted, told her to give him time to get things ready. It all seemed innocent enough, well, as innocent as you could get when it came to dark magic. However, before he left, he said one last thing that made Sumia worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've always wanted to ride a pegasus, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did he mean by that? He wanted to ride a pegasus? What did that have to do with teaching Sumia dark magic? Sure, she was a Pegasus Knight, but how was that relevant? Did Henry want her to teach him how to ride a pegasus, in exchange for him teaching her how to use dark magic? As far as she was aware, pegasi only accepted pure-hearted women as their riders, so how could she possibly get one to allow Henry to ride it? None of it made sense, no matter how long she spent thinking about it. As such, she did her best not to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat all changed, however, when she suddenly received a note in her tent. She didn't know when it had gotten there, but it was apparently from Henry, asking her to see him in his tent. She had no doubt this had something to do with the magical lesson he'd promised her. On one hand, she was excited. She'd always been somewhat curious about what using magic was like. but on the other hand, Henry's odd remark made her feel uneasy. Regardless, she still made her way over to his tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly pushing aside the flap that served as a makeshift door, she peered inside. She saw Henry standing in front of his desk, flipping through the pages of multiple different books, and scrawling things down on a piece of paper. He was so focused on what he was doing that he didn't even notice Sumia slowly entering the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Henry?\" Sumia said, trying to get his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Henry suddenly dropped his quill and turned around. \"Sumia! You came!\" Despite his words, he didn't seem surprised at all, as if he knew she was there the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you did leave that note in my tent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Henry said, rubbing his hands together eagerly, \"Ready to start casting some spells?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nya ha! You'll see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry seemed to be preparing to cast a hex, but to do what, Sumia had no idea. Little did Sumia know, Henry's idea of teaching her to use magic was very different than what she had in mind. He had deemed that Sumia's body didn't have enough magic to cast spells, or at least, the spells he was willing to teach. The \"obvious\" solution was to put Sumia in a more magical body. Specifically, his body. Like he'd told Sumia, he'd always wanted to ride a pegasus, and by switching bodies with her, he'd be able to kill two birds with one stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt should've been a fairly standard hex, although he'd never actually tried it before, let alone on himself. As Sumia watched nervously, Henry cast the hex, expecting to find himself in Sumia's body, and she in his.</span></div></div>",

Was she supposed to be learning from this? Was this preparing her to use magic? Nothing seemed to be happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Henry started to finish up his incantation, Sumia began to feel something. Was this magic? It felt almost like something tugging on her entire being. The feeling got stronger and stronger, becoming harder to not worry about. \"Uh, Henry?\" Sumia asked, not sure if this was supposed to be happening. The only response she was got was Henry's trademark laughter, as he waited for the spell's full effects to take place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a swift tug, Sumia almost felt like she was pulled off her feet. However, her body din't move any inch. That didn't mean nothing had happened, though, as Sumia was now staring at the back of her own head. Looking down, she found herself to be in some sort of ethereal form, sticking out of her body's back. Henry's spell was literally pulling her spirit out of her body! She wanted to scream or shout or something, but no sound came out. Before she could do anything else, another tug pulled her spirit completely out of her body, and sent it flying off in some random direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Sumia, the exact same thing was happening to Henry, but since he knew the effects of the hex, he wasn't too worried. Well, until the final step, that is. If he had performed to hex correctly, his spirit should have flown into Sumia's body, and hers into his. Instead, he found his spirit flung in a random direction, apparently having a different target in mind. He wasn't too worried, as the hex could be reversed fairly easily, even if he accidentally got more people involved in the swap. He just hoped it wouldn't be too difficult to find Sumia in whatever body she ended up in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia wanted to scream as the world whizzed past, unable to slow down her ethereal form. She really wasn't sure what Henry had planned, or why he would do this. What was going to happen to her spirit now? Would it simply fly around aimlessly without a body? Would it return to her own body eventually? Would it seek out another body to take over? She soon got her answer, as her spirit headed strait for someone else in the area. Who was her spirit heading towards?</span></div></div>",

His limbs slimmed down, his skin became smoother, his hands and feet shrunk a little. His rear expanded, two lumps grew on his chest, and his penis shot back up into his body. His features softened, and his hair grew longer. Along with his body changing, his clothes changed to suit his new class as well. His shirt and pants merged together, morphing into an elaborate white dress, a white sash formed around his neck, and a pair of flowery ornaments appeared in his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis all happened in just a matter of moments, giving Donnel no time to react until the light from the seal had faded and he could see again. When it did, he was buffeted with a barrage of new feelings. \"What in tarnation!?\" he yelled, before quickly covering his mouth at the sound of his new, higher-pitched voice. He had wanted to get stronger, not become a girl! Not to say the women in Chrom's army weren't plenty strong, but crossing the gender fence was definitely not something Donnel had intended to do. Not to mention the outfit he was wearing. How was he supposed to fight in a dress like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe frantically looked around the barracks, the changes to his body becoming all the more apparent with every movement, but to his dismay, the seal that had changed him was gone, and he was unable to find any other seals. He let out a sigh of frustration, leaning against a wall. \"How am I supposed to tell Chrom about this?\" he said to himself, still bothered by how his voice sounded. He'd have to explain this to Chrom and the rest of the Shepherds somehow, but would they believe that the girl talking to them was really him? \"First things first, I gotta get out of this dress.\" As much as he didn't like it, Donnel figured he could get used to being a girl, but the fancy dress was a bit much for him. Not only did he think it's be hard to fight in, he'd probably have trouble just walking around in it without tripping over the hem. After looking around to make sure the coast was clear, Donnel left the barracks and headed towards his tent, hoping his old clothes would still fit his new body.</span></div></div>",

He nodded triumphantly and said, \"Good has triumphed this day! Never again shall you trouble innocent villagers with your acts of villainy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwain had travelled back in time to assist with preventing his ruined future from coming to pass, but he had yet to locate Chrom and the Shephards. To make matters worse, he had also been separated from the other warriors of his future, making him a little unsure of what to do. For the time being, at least, he had busied himself with ridding the lands of bands of rogues who would hope to profit from attacking unprotected towns and defenseless villagers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to leave, when he noticed something leaning against a nearby tree. It was a sword, but it seemed to sparkle with some kind of otherworldly light. \"What's this?\" Owain wondered aloud as he normally did, \"Have I discovered some kind of legendary weapon?\" Not hesitating a bit, Owain quickly walked over to the sword, stepping around the bodies of the fallen ruffians, and picked it up, bewildered by the glow it gave off. \"O sword, reveal unto me your secrets! How do you shine so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Owain know, the sword was no ordinary weapon, and was actually magic. By picking it up as he had, he had inadvertently doomed himself to its curse.

Unhand me this instANT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Owain's surprise, his voice cracked at the end of his proclamation, raising a few octaves. He coughed a bit in an attempt to clear his throat, but no matter what he did, the raised pitch seemed to stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of foul trick is this?\" Owain couldn't deny how feminine his voice sounded now. If he didn't know any better, he'd think this sword was turning him into a...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Owain could think it through any further, the pain suddenly intensified, all over his body. It was as if it were trying to overwhelming, but against all odds, Owain remained not only conscious, but standing. It did halt his dramatic monologue, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the pain, Owain was able to observe strange changes happening to his body, new changes popping up everywhere the pain touched. His limbs seemed to be shrinking, thinning out. They still seemed to be just as strong, but their muscles were far less pronounced. However, despite the thinning, his thighs seemed to accumulated a small layer of fat, enough to make them appear shapely, though hidden beneath his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is- GAHCK!\" Owain cried out as a loud snap reverberated through the clearing. His shoulders and waist had pushed inwards, compressing his frame, and his hips had done the opposite, growing outwards. Though still physically male, his physique was looking decidedly female now, and it seemed Owain was soon about to match where it mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't help but notice the pain seemed to intensify in one area in particular. \"No, please...\" he grunted through the pain, sounding far less dramatic than he usually did. Alas, he was powerless to stop it, as that which lay hidden inside his pants shot back up into him, inverting into its feminine equivalent. Between the pain, and the myriad of odd feelings now coming from his groin, Owain was unsure of how he was still standing, but he had little time to think this fact over, as the pain redirected itself somewhere else. Before he knew it, his chest practically exploded outwards, a large pair of breasts pushing out from underneath his top, threatening to rip it if any more pressure was applied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm...\" Owain was at a loss for words for what was going on. There was absolutely no denying it; the sword was turning him into a woman. He only got a small glimpse of his new lithe, feminine form before the pain concentrated in his face, forcing his eyes shut. He held a hand to his head, while the other still gripped the blade, feeling his hair growing longer, falling over his hand and shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the pain could cease, Owain heard a ripping sound, followed by a fluttering of fabric around his body. If he had to guess, his outfit had ripped apart, and was reforming into something else. Under normal circumstances, it would sound like an insane suggestion, but considering he had just been transformed into a woman by a strange glowing sword, it seemed about on par with what else he'd experienced today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, the cloth settled down, and the pain ceased. And then, at long last, the blade dropped from Owain's hand. Slowly but surely, Owain opened his eyes. The first thing he noticed was the green bangs, falling into the edge of his vision. Swishing behind him was a long green ponytail, falling down to his knees. His pants seemed to have disappeared completely, while his shirt had stretched out into a blue dress, with slits that reached a little too far up the sides, exposing practically all of his shapely legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough his mind should have been reeling from his sudden transformation into a woman, there was something else that caught his attention. \"This outfit...\" Something seemed oddly familiar about the outfit he was wearing. He'd never seen it in person, but he was sure he'd seen it before. Eyeing the blade again, he peered over at it, teetering slightly from his new centre of balance, and caught a glimpse of his reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lyndis!\" Owain shouted, his dramatic tone sounding odd in his new voice. \"Lady Lyndis of Caelin!\" Owain had heard many tales of heroes from other worlds, stories drifting through the Outrealm Gate. Lyndis, more commonly known as Lyn, was one of the heroes he'd heard of from the land of Elibe. Somehow, this blade had transformed him into an exact replica of Lyn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been gifted the form of a legendary hero!? Perhaps... perhaps this was fate?\" Owain stated, still trying to keep his dramatic flair despite everything. He wasn't really sure how to feel right now; whether he should be upset about being turned into a woman, or whether he should be pleased that he had been reshaped into such a famed hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one thing that was for certain though; this blade was his. He hadn't immediately recognised it, but now that he'd become Lyn, he realised the sword did in fact resemble the blade she was often depicted wielding. Whether it was the genuine article, or simply a replica, it belonged with him now. And so, he reached down to pick it up, wondering what he should do next.</span></div></div>",

She decided to continue to watch so she could see if everything is working as intended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaius' changes continue to get more physical as all the hair on his body disappeared. He could feel that his skin was now much softer and smoother. It was free of blemishes and showed off the dedication that Maribelle (and soon Gaius) put into skincare. The next change was that Gaius found his hair lengthening down to his lower back. The hair was collected into multiple ringlets that gave him a regal appearance. With that the bows in his hair finished up, and now Gaius completly had Maribelle's hairstyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaius' clothes also continue to change with his body, starting with his shoes. They morphed fully into a pair of brown boots that reached up into his knees. The heels on the boot also slowly started to grow. The color of his clothes now shifted fully to a mostly light pink and white ensemble with a bit of a darker pink in places. His coat was much smaller and Gaius felt a sharp pain in his ears as a pair of spherical red earrings formed in them. He could feel that his underwear was much softer as they became a pair of panties. Next the beginning of white bows were starting to form in his hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving on from his hair his new clothes started to fully form. His coat completely disappeared as his clothes to gain new frills and heart designs. His boots gained slight heels and Gaius found his hands engulfed in a pair of fancy pink gloves. Gaius was now fully wearing Maribelle's outerwear, but his equipment still had to change. His spellbooks become books on high fashion and other books meant for a noble lady. The sword that he had changed into a white parasol to protect Gaius' fair skin from the weather. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final changes started upon Gaius. His waist shrunk inward as in turn his hips widened. His face became soft and feminine as it got coated with makeup. He could feel his chest grow immensely as they were cupped by a newly formed bra. The very last change occurred as Gaius' penis slowly turned into a vagina, making him an official girl in body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow did Gaius kept his mind post transformation, or did his mind begin to change to suit his new body?</span></div></div>",

The only difference between his new body and Maribelle's is that Gaius' new body has red hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he stopped tasting anything sweet out of his lollipop, he quickly took it out of his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, no more..\" Gaius held up his hand in shock, <i>What happened to my voice? It wasn't that high a minute ago.</i> Gaius quickly realized that the glove on his hand. <i>Why is my hand wearing that glove. It looks like one of Twinkles' gloves. I need to find a mirror.</i> Gaius quickly ran off in search of a mirror with Maribelle stealthily following him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after some searching, Gaius found a mirror at a nearby stall. A quick glance allowed him to see his new body. <i>My body. What happened to it?</i> Gaius genuinely didn't know what to think of this. He didn't know whether to scream in fear of his body changing like that, or happy that his body was so curvy and sexy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Maribelle was still watching Gaius secretly. Considering the circumstances, she wasn't sure whether to approach him and help him get comfortable to his new body and maybe make him more proper in the process, or just leave him on his own. After all, the candy was supposed to make him more well-behaving, so maybe he'll eventually become more proper on his own. </span></div></div>",

I'll explain what just happened to you in my room.\" Gaius quickly took her hand and Maribelle led him out of the camp and to the Barracks. Once they got to her room, she had Gaius sit on her bed with her sitting right next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Gaius,\" Maribelle as she prepared to give Gaius her proposal. \"The reason why you're a little girl is because I cast a spell on the lollipop you just ate.\" Gaius' eyes widen in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you do that to me?\" Gaius shrieked in horror. Maribelle sighed in response, this could be more difficult than she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because I think you deserve a chance at a better life, and turning you into an adorable little girl can help you with that,\" Maribelle said. Gaius raised an eyebrow at what she just said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meaning?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to be my daughter.\" At that, Gaius couldn't help but be shocked at what she just asked of him. He couldn't even form a response. This allowed Maribelle to elaborate on what she was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must be hard for you to be a thief. Always sneaking around, always worrying about being stabbed in the back by some common thug. It can't be something that's worth living for.\" Gaius knew that she had a point, life as a thief is stressful, but the whole thing felt skeptical to the thief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seriously want me to be your daughter Twinkles?\" Gaius asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I do,\" Maribelle pulled Gaius into a hug. \"If you keep up this life of thievery you could be either be in jail or in an early grave. I want to raise you right and avoid this life of thuggery. Of course if you do this you have to be a proper lady like me. No daughter of mine would be caught dead doing the things you do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaius went into thought over the subject. On the one hand, it would be nice to have a proper mother to take care of him, raise him and maybe give him some nice candy every now and then. It would also be good to not have to worry about being in jail or stabbed by another crook. On the other hand; he isn't a girl and having to be a proper lady like Maribelle would be restrictive in more ways than one. Always having to worry about how you look, making sure that you walk the right way of all times, having to marry some nobleman and have children of his own and he heard that corsets can hurt like hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking about for a bit Gaius decided to...</span></div></div>",

I don't know why but ever since I touched this strange necklace, I can't stop thinking about your clothes. They are just so soft, lovely, and beautiful.\" Gaius blushed he still couldn't believe he was thinking this and then telling someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa didn't know what to say of this, it was surreal to hear this from Gaius of all people. He seemed sincere though so she could only believe he was being truthful. <i>I can't blame him though. My clothes are really cute.</i> Lissa thought. Maybe she could help Gaius and get some fun out of it in the process while she's at it. </span></div></div>",

Miriel shook Anna\u2019s hand, and Anna led Miriel around to the back, where the potions and tomes were being kept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, here\u2019s my stock of those tomes and potions I mentioned,\u201d said Anna. \u201cHow do you want to start?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe it would be best to start by testing the effects of one of these items,\u201d said Miriel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna paused. \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s a good idea?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wish to understand the effects of these items, correct?\u201d Miriel asked.

Her vision grew blurry as the pain grew even stronger. Somehow, Miriel was able to stay standing, even though she felt like her head, neck and shoulders were on fire. After about a minute, the pain began to subside, and started to regain sensation in her head and shoulders as her vision began to clear. As her vision came into focus, Miriel realised that she couldn\u2019t feel her glasses on her face\u2026 except she could also feel her glasses resting on her nose. She also felt as if her right ear was brushing up against something, even though it wasn\u2019t, and she had a similar feeling with her left ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiriel?\u201d Anna asked quietly. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Miriel. \u201cI believe so.\u201d Miriel\u2019s voice sounded strange in her ears. It sounded as if her voice had an instant echo. Miriel cleared her throat and looked at Anna. \u201cWhy are you staring at me like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, you\u2019d better see for yourself,\u201d said Anna, taking Miriel\u2019s hand and leading her over to a mirror. Miriel gasped when she saw herself in the mirror. Miriel reached up with her hands, and placed her hands on her outer left and outer right cheeks. Unless she was hallucinating, which was unlikely, Miriel now had two heads. Her left head was wearing her glasses and hat, while her right head was bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy goodness,\u201d said Miriel, both of her mouths speaking in unison as she blinked with four eyes. \u201cWell, it would seem that particular potion causes the growth of a second head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo... um, is that, you know, second head, are you, well, are you, er, two people or one?\u201d said Anna, stammering nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe I am a single person, rather than a pair of conjoined twins,\u201d said Miriel. She held her right hand up to her right jaw and held her right mouth shut as she opened her left mouth a few times, trying to get better control over her new head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess they weren\u2019t kidding about doubling your brains,\u201d said Anna. \u201cYou literally have two brains now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA most unusual development. However, it is not unpleasant,\u201d Miriel said, saying the first sentence with her left mouth and the second sentence with her right mouth. Miriel turned to look at Anna. \u201cDo you have my glasses in stock?\u201d Miriel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah, I think I\u2019ve got a few pairs,\u201d said Anna. \u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy glasses were not duplicated when my second head was formed,\u201d said Miriel with her left head. \u201cThus, I require a second pair of glasses for my new eyes,\u201d she said with her right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, okay,\u201d said Anna. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll go grab a pair. Be right back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Anna walked over to another corner of the storeroom to pick out a pair of glasses, Miriel stayed in front of the mirror. She brought her hands up to her necks, and began running her hands against the inner right and left sides of her necks, enjoying the strange new sensations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go,\u201d said Anna, walking up to her. \u201cOne pair of glasses, free of charge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy thanks,\u201d said Miriel, unfolding the glasses and slipping them onto her right head. With her second pair of glasses on, her vision cleared up completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how does it feel?\u201d Anna asked. \u201cHaving two heads, I mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I said, it is not unpleasant, though the initial transformation was quite excruciating,\u201d Miriel said with her left mouth. \u201cHowever, I may need some time to fully adjust to my new body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you need to take a break, that\u2019s fine,\u201d said Anna. \u201cI\u2019m sure all these tomes and potions can wait until tomorrow. If you\u2019re still interested in testing them, that is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I am still interested,\u201d said Miriel. \u201cI must learn how this magic works, and how to replicate it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit!\u201d said Anna. \u201cSo, do you want to keep testing now, or wait until tomorrow?\u201d</span></div></div>",

However, Miriel found it difficult to split her focus in such a way, so she decided to simply read the notebook with both heads. As Anna had said, each of the notes was written in a way that was clearly designed to hide their true purpose and allow the reader to make potentially incorrect assumptions. However, one note towards the back of the book caught her attention.

She opened her mouth to speak when a familiar pain shot through her head, neck and shoulders. However, the pain seemed to be lesser than it had been the first time she had taken the potion, and the growth of her second head happened much faster this time, taking approximately thirty seconds, as opposed to the minute of her initial transformation. Once her second head had grown back, Miriel reached into her bag and picked up the pair of glasses Anna had given her earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, that is much better. Now, how much do I owe you for the glasses?\u201d Miriel asked with her left head as she placed the glasses on her right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you the glasses were free earlier, didn\u2019t I?\u201d said Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour generosity is greatly appreciated,\u201d said Miriel with her right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you are most welcome,\u201d said Anna. \u201cNow, do you want to keep testing, or do you want to take a break?\u201d</span></div></div>",

With her staff broken, she needed to get a new one if she wanted to help out on the battlefield. The only problem was, they\u2019d run out of Physic staves, and Lissa wasn\u2019t particularly interested in using a Mend or a Heal staff. She\u2019d heard that Anna had recently received some new items, and she hoped that included some new Physic staffs, or possibly even a Recover staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa pushed open the door of Anna\u2019s store, causing the bell above the door to ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Anna,\u201d Lissa said as she walked in. \u201cDo you have any-- gyaaah!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa screamed and stumbled backwards, tripping over her feet and landing on her butt. The two-headed monster turned around and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, Lissa,\u201d she said, using her left head. \u201cMy apologies. I did not mean to startle you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-Miriel? Is that you?\u201d Lissa stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it is,\u201d said Miriel with her right head as she held a hand out to Lissa. \u201cI am surprised that you did not recognise me, as we have known each other for some time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d said Lissa as she took Miriel\u2019s hand and allowed the two-headed woman to pull her back to her feet. \u201cIt\u2019s just that... well... you have two heads!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I am aware,\u201d said Miriel with her left head. \u201cIt is the effect of a potion I recently purchased and imbibed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou... you drank a potion,\u201d said Lissa slowly. \u201cAnd it gave you a second head?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is correct, yes,\u201d said Miriel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d said Lissa. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, the magic behind the transformation is most intriguing,\u201d said Miriel with her right head. \u201cI am planning to assist Anna in testing the other potions and tomes she received recently.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, you mean there are more things like that?\u201d Lissa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d said Miriel with her left head, retrieving a notebook from her bag and holding it out for Lissa. \u201cAnna made a list of the potions and tomes she acquired in this notebook. However, the descriptions are rather vague, and I was planning to decipher them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like it would just be easier to pick something and try it out,\u201d Lissa said as she took the notebook from and started flipping through the pages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWere you planning on volunteering as a test subject?\u201d Miriel asked with both heads in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa blinked in surprise, both at how loud both of Miriel\u2019s voices were, and at hearing it twice. \u201cWhoa, that was weird,\u201d Lissa said. \u201cBut yeah, I\u2019m going to volunteer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Miriel with her left head. The two-headed woman turned to Anna, who was counting gold at the counter. \u201cAnna?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard everything,\u201d said Anna, setting a small stack of coins aside. \u201cThat\u2019s your change, Miriel. Now, if you two will follow me, we\u2019ll head to the storeroom and find something to test on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa nodded, and followed Miriel and Anna into the storeroom. Once Lissa arrived, she saw Miriel holding a red glass bottle containing a purple liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the potion that gave me two heads,\u201d said Miriel, returning the bottle to a crate full of similar bottles. \u201cI do not see much reason for you to consume one of these.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa nodded. \u201cI was gonna try something else, anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll the tomes and potions in this part of the storeroom were part of the same shipment,\u201d said Anna. \u201cThey\u2019ll all probably have some sort of effect on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it permanent?\u201d Lissa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, there\u2019s a staff that I can use to turn you back to normal,\u201d said Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa sighed in relief. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s good to know.

I am training myself to use my heads independently.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but you only had to get used to two heads. I have to get used to having two <i>bodies</i>,\u201d the two Lissas said in unison. As the two Lissas spoke, the head on her original body turned to face Miriel, causing the head on her new body to turn in the opposite direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I believe I have an idea that could help you adjust,\u201d said Miriel with her left head. She turned her right head to Anna and said, \u201cAnna? Could you please find Lissa some clothes and a blindfold?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess,\u201d said Anna, walking around the corner and out of sight. \u201cNot sure what you want the blindfold for, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy plan is to blindfold Lissa\u2019s original body, then have her dress her new body,\u201d said Miriel with both heads, looking at Lissa with her left head and at the corner Anna had gone around with her right head. \u201cMy hypothesis is that Lissa will adapt faster if she cannot see out of one of her bodies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh,\u201d said the two Lissas. \u201cWell, I\u2019m willing to give it a shot, at least.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna soon came back with a bundle of clothes. \u201cI don\u2019t know how well these will fit,\u201d said Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d said the two Lissas, having returned to looking at herselves. She was also running her hands up and down her bodies, moving in perfect unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiriel took the blindfold from the pile of clothes and walked up to Lissa\u2019s original body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnce I have blindfolded your original pair of eyes, I am also going to hold your original arms still,\u201d said Miriel with her right head. \u201cIs that acceptable?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep,\u201d said the two Lissas, nodding. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Miriel with her left head. She wrapped the blindfold around the eyes of Lissa\u2019s head and tied it, then reached down and grabbed Lissa\u2019s wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnna, if you would, please give Lissa\u2019s new body her clothes,\u201d said Miriel, speaking with her right head, which she turned towards Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna nodded, and walked up to Lissa\u2019s naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go,\u201d said Anna, holding the clothes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said both Lissas in unison. Both Lissas tried to reach out for the clothes, but Miriel kept her grip on Lissa\u2019s original arms. The arms on Lissa\u2019s new body also jerked to a stop, but soon continued and picked up the smallclothes that were at the top of the pile. As Lissa\u2019s naked body began dressing herself, Lissa\u2019s original arms and legs twitched as she tried to perform the same actions with both bodies. However, by the time Lissa\u2019s new body had finished dressing itself, these twitches had almost completely stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that was weird,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s second body, now dressed in poorly fitting clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I take this blindfold off now?\u201d Lissa asked with her original body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, of course,\u201d said Miriel with her left head, releasing her hold on Lissa\u2019s arms. The arms on Lissa\u2019s original body reached up and fumbled with the knot on the blindfold for a few seconds. She soon untied it, and handed the blindfold to Miriel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how do you feel now?\u201d Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt still feels really weird, but I\u2019m getting used to it,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s second body, turning to face Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat blindfold trick helped a lot,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s original body, facing Miriel. \u201cThanks, Miriel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy pleasure,\u201d said Miriel with her right head. \u201cNow, how do you wish to proceed?\u201d</span></div></div>",

I mean, look at how tight your shirt is around your necks. That can\u2019t be comfortable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiriel hadn\u2019t noticed it during all the excitement earlier, but she found that Lissa was correct. Her shirt was indeed quite tight around her necks, and she also found it was rather tight around her shoulders as well. Presumably, her shoulders had widened to give both heads adequate space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may be correct,\u201d said Miriel as she pulled out Anna\u2019s notebook and began reading through the pages again. \u201cI believe we may both benefit from such a spell.\"</span></div></div>",

Would something that changes your stance change your legs?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is a possibility,\u201d said Miriel slowly from her right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, but this potion turning me into a centaur is also a possibility,\u201d said Anna. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, that might fit,\u201d said Lissa from her new body, standing beside Miriel. \u201cWar horses are pretty sturdy, and I\u2019ve never seen one trip over before. Have you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConsidering what we have seen this form of magic do, that is as plausible a hypothesis as any,\u201d said Miriel from her left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the only way to find out is to try it,\u201d said Anna. She raised the bottle to her lips and started drinking. She quickly swallowed all the liquid within the potion bottle, and gave the empty bottle to Lissa\u2019s original body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe warned, the transformation could be quite painful,\u201d said Miriel quickly from both of her heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m starting to realise that,\u201d said Anna, wincing as pain started shooting through her legs.</span></div></div>",

She winced in pain, squeezing her eyes shut as it felt like her legs were on fire. She was dimly aware of a ripping noise behind her, but couldn\u2019t tell what had been torn by her transformation, or even what her transformation was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a minute, the pain began to subside, and Anna was able to open her eyes as she rested on her hands and knees, trying to get her breath back. She was aware of a strange sensation in her butt, as if it was were at a strange angle, but also as if it wasn\u2019t. She looked up at Miriel, and saw that both of Miriel\u2019s mouth\u2019s were hanging open. Lissa\u2019s new body was standing next to Miriel, and she looked just as shocked as Miriel did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d Lissa said, from both her new body and her original body, which was standing beside Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat... what happened?\u201d Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa\u2019s new body stepped forward, and knelt down by Anna\u2019s side. She reached out and grabbed Anna\u2019s ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou feel that?\u201d Lissa\u2019s new body asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...\u201d Anna said slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa\u2019s original body walked around behind Anna, and also knelt down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you also feel this?\u201d Lissa\u2019s original body asked, as Anna felt a hand grabbing each of her rear ankles... Her rear ankles?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked, Anna tilted her head down so that her chin was resting on her chest, so she could see her legs. She could see her legs, with her knees pressed into the floor... and behind them, she could see a pair of naked legs resting on their knees, and could feel the hands on Lissa\u2019s original body wrapped around the ankles of those legs... her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the gods...\u201d Anna whispered. \u201cHow...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa\u2019s original body let go of Anna\u2019s rear ankles and stood up. Anna shivered as she felt Lissa\u2019s hands running along a new part of her body, almost like a second torso that connected her front and rear legs. She could feel torn fabric around where her butt had originally been, which was now rubbing against the sides of her new extended body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not quite a centaur,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s original body. \u201cMore like a human centaur. A humantaur?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be grammatically incorrect,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head. \u201cWhile a centaur is a distinct mythological beast, using taur as a suffix in this case would be akin to calling Anna a human bull, which Anna is clearly not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you have a better idea for a name?\u201d Lissa\u2019s new body asked, standing up and facing Miriel with her arms folded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell... no,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t think so,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s original body, also standing up and walking in front of Anna. \u201cI think I\u2019ll stick with humantaur. What do you think, Anna?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna nodded. \u201cHumantaur is as good a name as any,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, can you give me a hand standing up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s original body. Lissa\u2019s original body knelt down in front of Anna and took her hands, while her new body walked around beside Anna and wrapped her arms around the new part of Anna\u2019s body. It wasn\u2019t exactly like a torso, and since it connected Anna\u2019s front and rear legs, she was starting to consider it like a bridge, her bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, put your left feet on the ground,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s original body, lifting Anna\u2019s torso into an upright position as she started lifting Anna\u2019s bridge with her new body. Anna put her front left foot on the ground, and also felt the bare sole of her rear left foot touching the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Lissa\u2019s original body said. \u201cNow the right feet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna did the same with her front right foot, and also felt her rear right foot mimicking her front right foot\u2019s actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, now up we go!\u201d Lissa said using both of her bodies. Lissa\u2019s original body pulled Anna up by her hands, while her new body lifted up Anna\u2019s bridge, bringing Anna up to all four feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere we go,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s original body, letting go of Anna\u2019s hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t so bad, was it?\u201d Lissa\u2019s new body said as she let go of Anna\u2019s bridge and stepped in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy for you to say,\u201d Anna said. \u201cYou\u2019re not the one who has to get used to having four legs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, about that,\u201d said Miriel from her right head. \u201cLissa, could you please step aside? Anna, I would like you to try walking towards me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa\u2019s original and new bodies stepped back, with Lissa\u2019s original body on Anna\u2019s right and Lissa\u2019s new body on Anna\u2019s left, clearing a path between Anna and Miriel. Anna concentrated, and tried to take a step forward with her front left foot, but her rear left foot also stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d Anna cried out as she flailed her arms around, trying and failing to keep her balance. Thankfully, Lissa\u2019s new body caught her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Lissa,\u201d Anna said as she steadied herself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s new body with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnna, are you familiar with the Centipede\u2019s Dilemma?\u201d Miriel asked with her left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna frowned in confusion. \u201cThe what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is a psychological effect named after a rhyme, and is more properly known as hyper-reflection,\u201d Miriel explained with her right head. \u201cBy thinking too much about how to achieve a task, such as tying a knot, may impede the person trying to accomplish said task.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re saying I\u2019m thinking too hard about trying to walk with four legs?\u201d Anna said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what\u2019s making it so hard for me to walk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrecisely,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head. \u201cDo not focus on how to walk. Simply do what comes naturally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll try,\u201d said Anna with a nod. She stepped forward, and found herself walking without any trouble towards Miriel. After a few seconds, she had reached the two-headed woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh,\u201d said Anna. \u201cLooks like you were right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I had suspected that Lissa had the same problem when she was adapting to having two bodies,\u201d Miriel\u2019s right head said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you tell me how you were walking just now?\u201d Miriel\u2019s left head asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Anna. \u201cI stepped forward with my back right foot, then my front left foot, then my back left foot, then my front right foot. I\u2019m surprised how easy it was when I wasn\u2019t thinking about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Anna!\u201d Lissa called out, and Anna turned to see Lissa\u2019s original body standing next to the boxes of tomes, and holding the grey tome she and Miriel had used to alter their clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCatch!\u201d Lissa\u2019s original body threw the tome at Anna, and she stepped forward a few steps to catch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou might want to use that,\u201d said Lissa. \u201cYour back legs are kind of naked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for reminding me,\u201d Anna said as she blushed in embarrassment. Anna quickly opened the tome and cast the spell. The fabric that had been torn by the growth of her bridge stretched to cover the new body parts, and began wrapping around her butt, then travelled down her rear legs, even forming a new pair of boots on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow fascinating,\u201d said Miriel with her right head as she studied the newly formed fabric. \u201cThe spell takes into account new body types created by these potions. Does it alter all of the user\u2019s clothes, or just the clothes they are currently wearing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no idea,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s original body, as both of her bodies walked up to Anna and Miriel. \u201cBut I do have a question. What are we going to do now?\u201d</span></div></div>",

The clothes on Lissa\u2019s original body had changed. The crinoline that had been under Lissa\u2019s skirt when she was a cleric was now over her skirt, and was connected to a leather corset that she was now wearing around her stomach. Her sleeves were now tucked into the fingerless leather gloves she was wearing, and a pair of metal vambraces were now over her gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna and Miriel, who had been watching Lissa\u2019s promotion, turned their heads to look at Lissa\u2019s new body. Lissa\u2019s new body was still wearing the same clothes she had been wearing before she had promoted her original body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how do you feel?\u201d Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel a little stronger in this body,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s original body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel any different in this body, though,\u201d Lissa\u2019s new body said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps the best way to determine if both of Lissa\u2019s bodies have promoted would be to give her a weapon,\u201d Miriel said with her left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf memory serves, War Clerics use axes in combat, so I suggest giving both of Lissa\u2019s bodies a Bronze Axe and seeing if they can both use them,\u201d Miriel\u2019s right head continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll go get a couple of axes,\u201d said Anna, turning and walking to another area of the storeroom. \u201cBe right back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiriel found her gazes attracted to Anna\u2019s new body as she walked. Anna\u2019s two pairs of hips swayed in different directions as she walked, as she stepped forward with one of her rear feet first, then stepped forward with the opposite forward foot, and the effect was almost hypnotic. Anna\u2019s rear hips would sway to the left a fraction of a second before her front hips swayed to the right, and vice versa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiriel? You\u2019re staring at Anna\u2019s butt,\u201d Lissa said from her new body, startling Miriel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just observing Anna\u2019s new gait,\u201d said Miriel from her left head, which she turned to face Lissa\u2019s two bodies, while she continued to watch Anna with her right head. She felt heat rising in both of her faces as she blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s bodies in unison, drawing the word out while Lissa looked at Miriel with identical knowing smiles on both her faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiriel felt her faces grow even warmer as her blushing intensified, while she continued to look at Anna with her right head while her left head looked at Lissa\u2019s two bodies. Was Lissa implying that her interest in Anna\u2019s new body was not purely scientific in nature? Or was Miriel interested in Anna\u2019s new body for more... carnal reasons?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiriel watched Anna with her right head as Anna came to a stop and knelt to pick up a pair of Bronze Axes. Anna only knelt with her front legs, and her rear legs stayed upright, tilting Anna\u2019s upper body forward as she reached down to grab the axes. Once Anna had the two axes in her hands, she straightened her front legs and turned back to face Miriel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what you see?\u201d Anna said teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiriel\u2019s whole face felt incredibly warm from her embarrassed blushing, and she turned her right head away from Anna and back to Lissa\u2019s two bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t really mind the attention,\u201d said Anna as she walked up to the two women, causing Miriel to look back at Anna with her right head again. As Anna walked up to them, Miriel noticed that Anna was actually exaggerating the swaying of her hips slightly, causing Miriel to feel even more flustered. Perhaps her interest in Anna\u2019s new legs was not entirely scientific after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, here are the Bronze Axes you wanted,\u201d Anna said, holding the two axes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Lissa from both bodies as her original and new bodies both took an axe. Once both of Lissa\u2019s bodies had an axe, they took a few steps back and tried to lift the axe. Lissa\u2019s new body was barely able to lift the axe off the ground, while Lissa\u2019s original body was able to lift the axe up and performed a few practice swings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like only this body was promoted,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s original body as she swung the axe around more skilfully with each passing second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can barely lift this axe with this body,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s new body, clearly struggling with the weight of the axe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna stepped forward and took the axe from Lissa\u2019s new body. \u201cSo, now we know that Seals only affect the body you use them with,\u201d Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head, her face finally starting to return to its normal colour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd while that is only true for Seals, it raises the possibility that Lissa could use different potions or tomes on her two bodies, and end up with two radically different bodies,\u201d Miriel\u2019s right head said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that means you\u2019ll want to try something new with your two bodies, then,\u201d said Anna, resting the Bronze Axe against a nearby wall, where it would be out of the way.</span></div></div>",

The previously loose fitting shirt and pants Anna had given her were gone, and in its place she wore a white sleeveless dress, with a golden belt tied just below her breasts, holding the dress closed. She was wearing green high-heeled shoes with an open top that were connected to knee-length stockings of the same colour.

Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body also walked over, and she used her two bodies to pick up the crates containing the two-headed potion and move it to the side, then she did the same with the humantaur potion. With the two crates of known potions moved aside, Anna walked over to the humantaur potion crate and knelt down on all four of her knees, and began labelling the crate appropriately. Lissa then looked over at the remaining potion crates, and counted eight crates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre there only ten types of potions?\u201d Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep,\u201d said Anna. \u201cAnd there are only ten types of tomes as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, since we\u2019ve tested two of each, there are eight types of potions and eight types of tomes left,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body, which walked over to one of the potion crates and reached inside. She pulled out a bottle that looked very similar in colour to the humantaur potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Lissa\u2019s Sage body asked. \u201cBecause this looks like the humantaur potion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is the reason I asked you to clarify both the colour of the potion and the colour of the bottle,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head, which was looking at the bottle Lissa\u2019s Sage body was carrying, while her right head was reading through the notebook in her hands. \u201cI remembered seeing notes about a light green potion in a light blue bottle, as well as notes regarding a dark green potion in a dark blue bottle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI get it,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body. \u201cSimilar looking potions and bottles must have similar effects.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is most likely an accurate hypothesis,\u201d Miriel\u2019s right head said, still reading through the notebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf the light green potion turned me into a humantaur, then this dark green potion must do something to the drinker\u2019s legs,\u201d said Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is correct,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head. \u201cThe description for this potion is, I quote, \u2018Get a leg up.\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it\u2019s definitely got something to do with my legs,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body, holding the potion up to the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019ll make my legs longer,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr maybe I\u2019ll grow a third leg,\u201d Lissa\u2019s Sage body continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr maybe--\u201d both her bodies began to say, before being cut off by Miriel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeculation is rather pointless, I think,\u201d Miriel\u2019s right head said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe fastest way to determine the effects of the potion would be to drink it,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll drink it with my new body,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body, uncorking the bottle in her hands. \u201cHopefully, that means my original body will be unaffected.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, let\u2019s hope so,\u201d said Anna as Lissa\u2019s Sage body began drinking the potion.

In what way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna received a multitude of strange potions and tomes from one of her suppliers,\" Miriel informed, still alternating which head was speaking between sentences. \"However, the descriptions of r their purposes were increasingly vague. As such, we have been experimenting with them to discover their effects. However, if we were to test them on a body that is currently altered, it may skew the results by mixing the two effects together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was enough for Maribelle to put the pieces together. \"Lissa! You brought me here so you could turn me into some sort of... freak!?\" She hesitated before the final word, struggling to think of anything other than the insult that escaped her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all reversible,\" Anna stated. \"My supplier also gave me some staves that can restore your body back to normal. I wouldn't have agreed to test one of these on myself if I didn't have it.\" She turned side on, giving Maribelle a better view of her rear legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you know these staves work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Anna and I tested it earlier,\" Miriel's right head answered, looking over at Maribelle. \"However, the notebook only mentions one such staff,\" Miriel's left head stated, looking down at Anna's notebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I only got one in this shipment, but they must have sent me some earlier that forgot about, because I found a few more while stocktaking. They were mixed in with my spare Restore staves,\" Anna answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, even still...\" Maribelle mumbled, still rather unsettled by the entire situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleeeease, Maribelle?\" both Lissa's pleaded at once, before her Sage body followed up with, \"It'd mean so much to me.\" Her War Cleric body wrapped Maribelle in a hug, albeit a less aggressive one than what she'd used on Anna.</span></div></div>",

She looked past Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body at Lissa\u2019s Sage body, which was performing the incantation from the grey tome. Orange words spiralled around Lissa\u2019s Sage body, and the dress she was wearing was shortened and reshaped to fit her normal hips. The third shoe, which was still on the floor, also vanished without a trace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder what kind of tail you\u2019ll get,\u201d Anna said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019ll be like a horse\u2019s tail.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is possible,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever, the tail could be similar to that of a cat, or of a monkey,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one way we\u2019re going to find out, though,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body as she walked back to the others, carrying the grey tome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust, don\u2019t panic, okay?\u201d Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body said. \u201cThe transformations from the potions are pretty painful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose it\u2019s too late for me to back out?\u201d Maribelle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d said Anna. \u201cIf you really don\u2019t feel comfortable doing it, you can walk away.

She removed the stopper from the bottle, and briefly sniffed at the potion inside. She may have been imagining it, but Maribelle would have sworn she caught a brief scent of elderberry tea. Steeling herself, Maribelle put the bottle to her lips and drank the potion quickly. Once she finished, she passed the empty bottle to Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long does it take for...?\u201d Maribelle started to say, before she felt a sharp pain in her backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot long,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body, putting the empty bottle down and taking Maribelle\u2019s hands. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you can get through this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle couldn\u2019t reply, as the pain in her rear was growing stronger, causing her to grip Lissa\u2019s hands even tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat sort of tail does Maribelle grow?</span></div></div>",

Maribelle felt a hand what felt almost like her spine, even though it was definitely far lower down than her spine should have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you feel that?\u201d Lissa\u2019s Sage body asked, as Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body ran her hand up from the tip of Maribelle\u2019s tail slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Maribelle, her eyes wide. \u201cYes, I can feel your hand on the... on my tail.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body. \u201cI\u2019m going to start lifting your tail up now. You ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle nodded, and she felt Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body place a hand near the base of her tail, while she kept her other hand near the tip. Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body began lifting the tail up, and Maribelle felt the new muscles in her tail moving. Maribelle felt Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body curling her tail, so that it curved up from the base, then curved down again about half-way down the length of her tail, then curled in at the tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think you can hold your tail in this pose?\u201d Lissa\u2019s Sage body asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... I think so, yes,\u201d Maribelle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to let go of your tail now, okay?\u201d Lissa\u2019s Sage body said, and Maribelle could no longer feel hands on her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, look at that, you\u2019re doing it!\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle looked over her shoulder again, and got a better look at her tail. Like Lissa had said, it was hairless, and was the same colour as the rest of her skin, but she still wasn\u2019t sure how she felt about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there a mirror here?\u201d Maribelle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, just follow me,\u201d said Anna, walking over to another part of the storeroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle let go of Lissa\u2019s Sage body\u2019s hands, and followed Anna over to the mirror. Walking felt rather strange, as she could feel her tail bobbing in time with her walk, as well as swishing from side to side slightly as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go,\u201d said Anna, stopping in front of a full-body mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Maribelle, stepping in front of the mirror and turning to the side. She could see her tail poking out of her pants in her reflection, and turned different ways so that she could study it from different angles. She even found that she was starting to be able to move it to a certain degree, though she was nowhere near as skilled as Anna was with her four legs, or Miriel with her two heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting a good look at her tail, and thinking long and hard, Maribelle finally made a decision as to what to do with her new tail.</span></div></div>",

Let me just get my purse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Lissa,\" Maribelle interjected. \"I'll pay for it. I was the one who wanted to see the restoration staff working, it's my fault you had to give up your second body.\" Maribelle still wasn't entirely comfortable with the strange alterations going on, but she could tell that the loss of her second body had upset Lissa, and she wanted to rectify that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa gasped. \"Really?\" she practically shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Maribelle answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh! Thank you thank you thank you!\" Lissa squealed as she pulled Maribelle into a tight hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small smile appeared on Maribelle's face, as she lightly hugged Lissa back. \"You're welcome, darling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lissa finally let go of Maribelle, she turned to Anna, taking her purse out, and give her to required amount. \"I take it this should be enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed it is,\" Anna replied, taking the money and handing over a duplication tome, which she had fetched while Lissa was busy hugging Maribelle. \"A pleasure doing business with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you are, darling,\" Maribelle said, passing the tome on to Lissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa bounced excitedly on the balls of her feet has she hurriedly opened up the tome and read out the spell. As with the first time she read the spell, glowing orange words circled her, and her body glowed a bright white. When the light faded, the second Lissa was back, just as naked as she was when she first appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay, I'm back to having two bodies!\" Lissa's original body cheered, as her new body quickly went over and started getting dressed in the Sage clothes that had been left behind after the use of the staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, if you want your third leg back, I can sell you a potion for that as well,\" Anna suggested, hoping to make another sale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks,\" Lissa's War Cleric body responded. \"I think just having my second body back is good enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, that's weird,\" Lissa's Sage body said, now mostly dressed. \"My clothes fit properly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How exactly is that out of the ordinary compared to everything else?\" Maribelle asked, not understanding what Lissa was finding strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my clothes had adapted to fit my three legged body, but now they fit my two legged body just fine, and my third shoe is gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Presumably, the restoration staff undid the effects of the clothing alteration, as the effect did come from one of Anna's tomes,\" Miriel's right head suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that that is over, I presume you are satisfied with the demonstration of the restoration staff, Maribelle?\" Miriel asked with her left head, her right head now peering down at the notebook, looking through the other vague descriptions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes I am. I suppose that means it's my turn now, doesn't it?\" Maribelle said, still somewhat dreading having to undergo such a transformation herself, even if she knew it was reversible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, you'll be fine,\" Lissa's War Cleric body reassured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle slowly walked over to the crates containing the tomes and potions to be tested. \"Why are only some of the crates labelled?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are the ones we've already tested,\" Anna answered. \"The unlabelled crates just have a vague description in the notebook.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lovely,\" Maribelle muttered under her breath. She didn't exactly like the prospect of going in blind, but she assumed Miriel would at the very least tell her the description of whatever item she chose before she had to use it.</span></div></div>",

Humantaur, see?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I see now,\u201d said Maribelle. \u201cHowever, I can\u2019t help but feel like that may not be the proper term for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did say something to that effect,\u201d Miriel\u2019s right head said, still reading through Anna\u2019s notebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever, as I was unable to come up with a better name, Lissa\u2019s designation has stuck,\u201d Miriel\u2019s left head said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle nodded, and glanced over to where Lissa\u2019s Sage body had walked over to the other side of the room. Lissa\u2019s Sage body then picked up a Bronze Axe that was resting on the wall, and gave the axe a few practice swings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLissa, what are you doing?\u201d Maribelle asked, causing Anna and Miriel\u2019s right head to turn and face Lissa\u2019s Sage body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTesting a theory,\u201d Lissa\u2019s Sage body said, swinging the Bronze Axe with ease. \u201cWhen I first duplicated my body, I was still a Cleric, then I used a Master Seal on my original body to promote to a War Cleric.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I used another Master Seal with my second body, and promoted my second body to a Sage,\u201d Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever, since my original body was a War Cleric when I duplicated it again, my second body is now also a War Cleric,\u201d Lissa\u2019s second body concluded as she finished swinging the Bronze Axe around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is quite interesting,\u201d Miriel\u2019s right head said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will make a note of that,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head, which turned to look down at the notebook as Miriel began writing in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou still haven\u2019t picked a tome, Maribelle,\u201d said Anna. \u201cAre you stalling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA lady never stalls!\u201d said Maribelle, doing her best to sound indignant, even though she absolutely was stalling.

Was it a dud?\" Lissa's War Cleric asked, as her Sage body took a closer look at Maribelle to see if anything changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maribelle, do you feel any different?\" Miriel asked with her left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I suppose I feel a little strange, but I don't seem to be any different,\" Maribelle answered half relieved that the tome didn't do anything, and half worried that the tome had done something she couldn't see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How peculiar,\" Miriel's right head mused, going through the notebook again to make sure she had the right tome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe something happened outside the storeroom. It did say something about spreading her presence, didn't it?\" Anna suggested, hoping her supplier didn't send her something with effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if it did something to your body, I don't see it,\" Lissa's Sage body said, stepping around from behind her. As she did though, she accidentally bumped into Maribelle's back, and then, the unexpected happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Maribelle lurched forward from the impact, her head suddenly slid right off her shoulders. With a rather unladylike shout, Maribelle quickly reached out on instinct, managing to catch her head in her hands. Everyone else simply watching in stunned silence. \"Did... Did that really just happen?\" Maribelle asked in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe the fact that you are holding your head in your hands is proof of that fact that it did in fact just detach from your neck,\" Miriel said with her left head, managing to regain her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly and carefully, Maribelle turned her head around in her hands to look at her body. It was almost like looking in a mirror, aside from the fact that her neck lacked anything atop it. \"This is unbelievable,\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa's Sage body looked over at Maribelle's now empty neck. \"Woah, there's just smooth skin covering your neck,\" she said, having half expected to see the inside of Maribelle's neck. She ran her hand over Maribelle's neck, finding it to be just like the rest of her skin, only that it was covering a surface that normally wasn't exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle, on the other hand, was discovering that her newly exposed neck skin was rather sensitive. She started giggling uncontrollably as Lissa ran her hands over her neck. \"N-No, Lissa! S-Stop,\" she managed to get out between giggles. Of course, once Lissa realised what was happening, it only prompted her to tickle Maribelle's neck even more. \"Lissa! Please, sto- Ah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a fit of giggles, Maribelle lost her grip on her head. This time, Lissa's War Cleric body was the one to catch it, but in trying to reach out and catch her head, Maribelle's body ended up tripping over, her arms and legs falling off as it hit the ground. With a grunt of pain, Maribelle attempted to pick herself up off the ground, only to find that her limbs could only helplessly flop around on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened this time?\" she asked, unable to see what had happened to her body because of the way Lissa was holding her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your arms and legs fell off,\" Anna said, staring at Maribelle's scattered parts on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, \"spreading your presence\" refers to being able to detach your body parts while still retaining your control over them,\" Miriel's right head said, as she made a note in Anna's notebook. \"I suppose having your body parts in separate locations could be considering spreading your presence,\" her left head finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what am I supposed to do now?\" Maribelle asked, trying to look over at Miriel, which only resulted in her neck, still on her torso, turning uselessly. \"I can't exactly do much in this state.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I can put your body back together,\" Lissa's Sage body said, carefully picking up one of Maribelle's arm and pressing it against her torso. Lissa's deduction proved to be correct, and Maribelle's arm reattached to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked!\" Lissa's Sage said, turning Maribelle's head to show her what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, that's a relief. Would you mind putting the rest of me back together, Lissa, dear?\" Maribelle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it!\" both of Lissa's bodies said, as they sat Maribelle's body up, and started putting it back together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow in one piece again, Maribelle stood up and dusted herself off. \"I must say, that is without a doubt the strangest thing I have ever experienced,\" Maribelle, looking at herself to make sure her body wasn't simply going to collapse again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look pretty normal now,\" Anna observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well, I still feel somewhat odd. The same way I did when I first cast the spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assume that indicates that you still have the ability to take off your body parts, and your body collapsing wasn't a singular occurrence from the spell,\" Miriel's left head stated. \"You body likely collapsed at first due to not being used to your new ability,\" her right head concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then, I can still...\" Maribelle trailed off as she held one hand in the other. With the smallest amount of force, her right hand separated from her wrist, being held in her left. \"Bizarre,\" she mumbled, wiggling the fingers of her detached hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you still have full control and feeling in the detached part?\" Miriel's left head asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.

What did you wish to test?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst, I would like to test which parts of your body can be removed, and how many pieces you can be separated into,\u201d Miriel\u2019s right head said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose that is acceptable,\u201d said Maribelle. \u201cWhere should we start?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body said, walking up behind Maribelle. \u201cWe start from the top.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa\u2019s War Cleric body placed her hands on the sides of Maribelle\u2019s head and lifted. With a barely audible pop, Maribelle\u2019s head came off her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLissa!\u201d Maribelle said, turning around to face Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body. Or rather, her body turned around to face Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body, as her head was unattached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body, turning Maribelle\u2019s head around to face her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so fast!\u201d Maribelle said hurriedly as Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body spun her head around. \u201cNot so fast, please,\u201d Maribelle said again when Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body had finished turning her head around. \u201cI get rather dizzy when you do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd please, ask for permission before you start removing body parts,\u201d Maribelle said, crossing her arms in a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Maribelle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you didn\u2019t mean to offend me, darling,\u201d said Maribelle. \u201cI am still adjusting to all of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body. \u201cAnyway, can I start pulling parts of your face off?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy face?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you know, like your eyes and your ears, stuff like that,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose so,\u201d said Maribelle slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body. Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body sat down and crossed her legs, and put Maribelle\u2019s head in her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is a rather strange perspective,\u201d said Maribelle as she tried to shift her head into a more comfortable position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well, it\u2019s about to get weirder,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and can you put your hands on your hips?\u201d Lissa\u2019s Sage body said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle scrunched her face in concentration as she did so, unable to see her body from where she was. \u201cLike this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s it,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body. \u201cNow, push your torso up off your hips.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean, like this?\u201d Maribelle said, straightening her arms, and feeling a slight bit of resistance as her torso went higher than it normally did. Her surprise at this caused her to lose her grip on her hips, and her torso started to fall, but Lissa\u2019s Sage body caught her body before it fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you got it,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body as Maribelle wrapped her arms around Lissa\u2019s Sage body to keep a better grip on her. \u201cDo you mind if I take your arms off your torso and start pulling them apart?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s acceptable,\u201d said Maribelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body. \u201cAnna, can you get Maribelle\u2019s legs and hips, and take those apart?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing,\u201d said Anna, walking over to Maribelle\u2019s detached legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Maribelle, can you turn your legs around to your left a bit?\u201d Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s good,\u201d said Anna. \u201cNow, take about three steps forward.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle tried to nod as she complied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, stop there,\u201d said Anna. \u201cNow I\u2019ve got some room to work here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiriel, are you taking notes?\u201d Lissa\u2019s Sage body asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I am,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head, which was watching the proceedings while she looked at the notebook in her hands with her right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body said. \u201cThen let\u2019s get to work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Lissa and Anna got to work taking Maribelle apart into as many pieces as possible. Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body worked on Maribelle\u2019s head, while her Sage body took apart Maribelle\u2019s arms and torso, and Anna disassembled Maribelle\u2019s hips and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must say, this is rather strange,\u201d Maribelle said as Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body peeled her lips off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you can still talk with your mouth removed,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it seems,\u201d said Maribelle\u2019s disembodied mouth. \u201cI do wonder how I am breathing when my head isn\u2019t attached to my lungs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe spell must have made your body parts self-sufficient when they were detached,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head. \u201cI do wonder how eating would work with your mouth and head separated, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat isn\u2019t something I\u2019m particularly keen on testing, myself,\u201d said Maribelle as Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body removed Maribelle\u2019s nose from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy apologies,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head. \u201cI was merely thinking aloud.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle tried to nod, having forgotten that her head wasn\u2019t attached to her neck anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence in the storeroom for a few minutes as Lissa and Anna took Maribelle apart into as many pieces as they could think of. Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body had removed Maribelle\u2019s mouth, her nose, both her ears and eyes, and even her hair from her head. With her eyes detached and placed on the floor, Maribelle found she could only see the ceiling. Lissa\u2019s Sage body had taken the arms off of Maribelle\u2019s torso, and had found that Maribelle\u2019s arms could detach at the elbows. Lissa\u2019s Sage body then removed Maribelle\u2019s hands, then detached all ten of Maribelle\u2019s fingers. However, Lissa\u2019s Sage body was unable to separate Maribelle\u2019s fingers at their joints, so Maribelle amused herself by wriggling her fingers around and trying to move them independently. Her torso shivered when Lissa\u2019s Sage body had reached into her shirt and removed her breasts from her torso, then peeled her nipples off her breasts. Meanwhile, Anna had detached Maribelle\u2019s legs from her hips, then split her legs apart at the knees. Anna then pulled Maribelle\u2019s feet from her legs, then took her feet out of her boots and detached the toes. Once she had finished removing the toes, Anna reached into Maribelle\u2019s pants and removed her genitals, much to Maribelle\u2019s embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that really necessary?!\u201d Maribelle\u2019s disembodied mouth yelled as her detached eyes looked around wildly and her head flushed with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you wanted to know how many parts you could be broken into,\u201d Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I think we\u2019ve found the limit,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body. \u201cI haven\u2019t found any more points that Maribelle could separate at.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I think I\u2019m done too,\u201d said Anna as she placed Maribelle\u2019s genitals on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Maribelle has been broken into a total of forty-seven pieces, assuming my count is accurate and that we haven\u2019t missed any potential separation points,\u201d Miriel\u2019s left head said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must say, that is a much larger number than I ever imagined,\u201d Miriel\u2019s right head said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForty-seven!\u201d Maribelle said in shock. That was an absurd number of pieces to be in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is correct,\u201d Miriel\u2019s left head said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Miriel\u2019s right head asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhysically, I feel fine,\u201d said Maribelle. \u201cAnd I can feel all of my separated parts, though I couldn\u2019t tell you how many parts I\u2019m in right now.\u201d Maribelle took a shaky breath. \u201cAnd I would very much appreciate it if I could be put back together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body cheerfully, and she scooped up Maribelle\u2019s fingers and started attaching them to her hands. Likewise, Anna began reassembling Maribelle\u2019s legs and hips while Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body put her head back together. After a few minutes, Maribelle felt that she was completely back in one piece, and began examining herself.</span></div></div>",

She tried to wiggle the toes on her right foot, watching as the \"fingers\" on her foot-hand performed the movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here I thought this couldn't get any stranger,\" Maribelle said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you can not only separate your body parts, but you can also reassemble them in unconventional ways,\" Miriel's right head mused aloud, making a note in Anna's notebook. \"How are you feeling, Maribelle?\" her left head asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... a little disorientating.

At the very least, she change wasn't exactly obvious unless she took a body part off in front of someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Lissa,\" Anna asked, \"What exactly was your idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, I though that since Maribelle's parts can attach to places their not supposed to, maybe they can attach to things other than other body parts,\" Lissa's War Cleric body explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you wanted to take my arm of and try sticking it to something?\" Maribelle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.

She reattached her hand to her wrist, pleased to have it back where it was supposed to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, while your body parts can reattach in unorthodox ways, it would seem they can only attach to each other,\" Miriel's right head mused, while her left head looked down at her notebook, writing down the observations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if I used the same tome Maribelle did,\" Lissa's War Cleric body suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If both our bodies could come apart, maybe they'd be able to connect to each other,\" her Sage body continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lissa, I understand your enthusiasm, but we have not yet tested the effects of using multiple tomes on the same individual, save the clothing alternation tome,\" Miriel's left head explained, looking up from the notebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would perhaps be safer if we postponed testing multiple effects on the safe individual until we know what all of the products do,\" she said with her right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, fine,\" Lissa replied with her War Cleric body, while her Sage body pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiriel nodded with her right head to acknowledge Lissa's statement, while her left head addressed Maribelle. \"Thank you for your assistance, Maribelle. Would you like to be restored now?\"</span></div></div>",

I've managed to adjust to this ability rather quickly. It's still incredibly strange, but now that I've gotten used to it and I'm not going to fall apart involuntarily, it doesn't impact me negatively. I suppose I'm not sure if I'm ready to give it up or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine,\" Lissa's War Cleric body said, wrapping an arm around Maribelle's shoulder. \"The rest of us got used to our changes pretty quick too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's perfectly understandable,\" Miriel's right head stated. \"You're welcome to keep the changes if you so wish,\" her left head followed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for understanding,\" Maribelle said, giving a small curtsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although, that does mean we're out of people to test these on again,\" Anna pointed out. Testing all of her new products was going to take quite a while if everyone they tested on wanted to keep their changes. Even still, she had to admit that she understood what Maribelle was feeling.

The restore staff would remove your second body instead of removing the alteration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess,\" she answered with her War Cleric body. \"But that's just a risk I'll have to take.

that Recover staff I bought earlier back to my quarters, along with one of those Bronze Axes we used to check if I promoted,\u201d Lissa\u2019s Sage body said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I want to use one of the Second Seals we have stored at the Shepherd\u2019s Barracks with my second body,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want this body to actually be a Sage, instead of just dressed like one,\u201d Lissa\u2019s Sage body said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd, this way I can test if there\u2019s a limit to how far apart my bodies can be, since the Barracks and the

course of action?\u201d Miriel\u2019s left head asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo long as Lissa buys the Bronze Axe before she leaves, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a plan,\u201d said Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body, picking up one of the Bronze Axes and the Recover Staff she had purchased earlier, as well as the duplication tome Maribelle had purchased for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll just grab my purse, and meet you outside,\u201d Lissa\u2019s Sage body said to Anna, then she turned to Miriel. \u201cOh, and you said you had a spare Fire tome I could use?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it is in my bag,\u201d Miriel\u2019s right head replied. \u201cI no longer need it, so you are free to use it as you see fit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Miriel,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body, which turned and walked out of the storeroom, followed by Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what are we planning on doing while we wait?\u201d Maribelle asked once Lissa and Anna had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was planning on making a tally on what potions and tomes we have used thus far,\u201d Miriel\u2019s left head said, looking at Maribelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile I know that the potions must be drank in their entirety for the transformation to take effect, I do not know how many uses the tomes or restoration staff have before the magic in them is exhausted,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head, looking down at the notebook as she made her tally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle nodded. \u201cAnd what have you used so far?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThus far, we have used two head duplication potions, one humantaur potion, and one centre leg potion,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have also used a body duplication tome twice, a clothing alteration tome three four times, and a detachment tome once,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe restoration staff has also been used three times,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Maribelle. \u201cAnd you haven\u2019t tested the effects of multiple tomes or potions on one person yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, hindsight would suggest that we have,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLissa did use a tome to duplicate her body, then used a potion on her duplicate body, seemingly with no ill effect,\u201d Miriel\u2019s right head said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was the potion that gave Lissa her third leg, correct?\u201d Maribelle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is correct,\u201d Miriel\u2019s left head said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you suggesting that the results of the potion Lissa drank may have been skewed by the duplication tome?\u201d Miriel\u2019s right head asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is exactly what I am suggesting,\u201d said Maribelle. \u201cAnd you claim to have used the clothing alteration tome multiple times?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but I was less worried about contaminating the results of future tests with the clothing alteration tome,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter all, that particular tome affects our clothing, rather than our bodies,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle and Miriel heard the door to the storeroom opening, and they both turned to see Anna walking towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Lissa\u2019s on her way to the Barracks and the Palace,\u201d said Anna. \u201cWhat did I miss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaribelle has raised the possibility that the results of the potion that gave Lissa\u2019s second body a centre leg may have been inaccurate,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause it was used on the duplicate body, not the original,\u201d said Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrecisely,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe effects of that potion may be different on an unaltered body,\u201d Miriel\u2019s left head said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr it\u2019s a sign that the potions and tomes can be used together without any problems,\u201d said Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiriel nodded her heads in unison. \u201cThat is also a valid hypothesis with the evidence at hand,\u201d her right head said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you haven\u2019t tested the effects of multiple potions on one person?\u201d Maribelle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna shook her head. \u201cNo, we haven\u2019t,\u201d said Anna. \u201cBut I have a theory of my own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am listening,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we know that potions with similar colours in similar bottles affect the same body parts,\u201d said Anna, cocking her front hips to the left and her rear hips to the right as she crossed her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, both the humantaur potion and the centre leg potions were different shades of green, and both came in bottles that were different shades of blue,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Anna. \u201cI was thinking that, if two different potions altered two different body parts, then there wouldn\u2019t be any conflict between the two potions, but if the two potions altered the same body parts...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat might cause problematic interactions between the two potions,\u201d Miriel\u2019s left head concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Anna. \u201cYou might be able to use the two-headed potion and the three-legged potion at the same time, but not the three-legged potion and the humantaur potion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoth you and Maribelle have raised interesting hypotheses,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould we test these hypotheses while we wait for Lissa to return, or wait until she returns with Chrom and Robin?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Anna knelt down with her front legs, leaving her rear legs standing as she reached into the crate and pulled out a potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to find out whether or not this potion really gives someone three legs,\u201d said Anna, holding up the potion in question as she walked up to Miriel and Maribelle. \u201cIf Maribelle tests the potion and it gives her a third leg, we\u2019ll know it\u2019s safe to use potions and tomes together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if it doesn\u2019t give me a third leg?\u201d Maribelle asked, shifting her feet uncomfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ll know that using potions and tomes together can cause the potions or the tomes to act differently,\u201d said Anna. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to use it, that\u2019s fine. Miriel or I could also use the potion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what will that prove?\u201d Miriel asked with her left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you drink it and grow a third leg, we\u2019ll know it\u2019s safe to use two different potions at once,\u201d said Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat would happen if you drank the potion, though?\u201d Maribelle asked. \u201cAssuming it works the way you think it does, will you develop a centre leg at your front pair of hips, your rear pair of hips, or at both pairs of hips?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d said Anna. \u201cWho knows? Maybe using two potions that affect my legs in different ways will cause my legs to do something totally different.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is a possibility,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head. \u201cHowever, despite the initial pain from the transformations, none of the items we\u2019ve tested have had negative effects. I think it is likely that this will be safe to test.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna nodded. \u201cI was thinking along the same lines. So, who wants to try this potion?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Anna could feel something forming between both pairs of legs, and when her newly-formed centre feet touched the ground, a shiver ran up Anna\u2019s spine, starting at her rear pair of hips and travelling up her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna gasped as the pain faded, and she felt around her front pair of hips with her hands. When she looked down, she saw that she had grown a centre leg at her front pair of hips, similar to the one Lissa\u2019s Sage body had grown when she had used the potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy goodness,\u201d said Maribelle softly, her face pale. She hadn\u2019t seen how the potions affected someone before, and the sight had made her feel rather queasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say this potion works the way we thought it did,\u201d said Anna as she looked over her shoulder at her rear pair of hips. \u201cDid my rear hips get a third leg? I think they did, but I can\u2019t quite tell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is correct,\u201d Miriel said with her left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have developed a centre leg at both your front hips and your rear hips,\u201d she continued with her right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs a result, you now have two left legs, two centre legs, and two right legs, giving you six legs in total,\u201d Miriel concluded with her left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d said Anna, slowly lifting both left legs and both right legs off the ground, leaving her balancing on her two centre legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem to be adjusting much faster this time,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I recall, you were rather uncomfortable with your humantaur form at first,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well, the longer I\u2019ve been like this, the more I\u2019ve gotten used to it,\u201d said Anna as she lowered the four legs she\u2019d raised. \u201cEven these new centre legs feel completely natural to me now. Honestly, it\u2019s a little hard to imagine going back to just two legs now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must admit, I understand how you feel,\u201d said Miriel with her right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, having two heads has felt much more natural to me than having one ever did,\u201d Miriel\u2019s left head continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder if there is a way to make these alterations permanent...\u201d Miriel said softly with her right head, a distant expression on her faces as she pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe drinking another two-headed potion will make your changes permanent,\u201d said Anna as she walked over to the tomes. The six-legged humantaur stepped forward with her rear centre leg and her front outer legs, then stepped forward with her rear outer legs and front centre leg. Once Anna reached the tomes, she picked up the grey clothing alteration tome and cast the spell, causing the tears in her pants to repair themselves as fabric formed over her new centre legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr it may simply give me a third head,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould three heads be so bad for you?\u201d Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I suppose not,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head as she walked over to the crate that contained the potions that had given her a second head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do wonder if I should drink a single potion with one head, or drink one potion with each head,\u201d said Miriel with her left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you only drink one potion, you should probably drink it with your original head,\u201d said Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that is a good idea,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr, incidentally, which head is my original?\u201d Miriel\u2019s left head asked as her faces went pink in embarrassment. \u201cI am afraid I have forgotten.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour left head is the original,\u201d said Anna. \u201cIt\u2019s the only head with a hat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, yes, of course,\u201d said Miriel with both heads as she reached up and felt the hat on her left head. \u201cThank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiriel then turned her attention back to the crate containing the potions that had given her a second head.

She also made sure to check how many potions and tomes were left. She\u2019d received ten types of potions and ten types of tomes, with three boxes of each type of potion and tome, with twenty-four potions or tomes in a single box. Since Miriel had drank two of the two-headed potions, she only had seventy of those potions left, whereas she still had seventy-one of the humantaur and three-legged potions. Likewise, she\u2019d sold the duplication tome to Lissa, which had been used twice, while they had the clothing alteration and detachment tomes resting on top of the boxes they had come from, so she still had seventy-one unused tomes in each of those three boxes. Anna had also found five more restoration staves in her stocks earlier, bringing the total number of restoration staves to six.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Anna was checking her stocks and Miriel was copying the information from Anna\u2019s notebook into her own book, Maribelle decided to simply stand and watch the other two women. While she had initially considered Miriel, Anna and Lissa\u2019s transformations to be freakish, she had found that, after spending some time with them, she found their new forms to be rather interesting. She was fascinated by how Miriel was able to split her focus between the two notebooks, reading from Anna\u2019s notebook with her left head while she used her right head to focus on her writing in her own notebook. She also found it strange how Anna\u2019s rear feet were the ones she started walking with, rather than her front feet. Maribelle had also noticed that Anna had checked one the higher shelves by stepping up onto one of the lower shelves with her front feet while leaving her rear feet on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of waiting, the three women heard the door to the shop open, and heard voices filtering in from outside the storeroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLissa, I fail to see what\u2019s so important that you had to drag both of us out here,\u201d said a woman\u2019s voice that they recognised as belonging to Robin, the tactician of the Shepherds and Chrom\u2019s wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s because what I want to show you is inside the storeroom,\u201d said Lissa. \u201cDuh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see Anna around,\u201d said Chrom, Exalt of Ylisse. \u201cAre you sure we\u2019re allowed in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019re allowed in,\u201d said Lissa. \u201cIn fact, Miriel, Anna and Maribelle are all waiting for us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting bunch you\u2019ve gathered,\u201d said Robin as the door to the storeroom opened. \u201cWonder what they\u2019re... doing... here...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin\u2019s voice trailed off as she saw Miriel and Anna\u2019s altered forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRobin?\u201d Chrom asked as he tried to get through the door past her. \u201cIs something... what in the...?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurprise!\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body as she pushed passed her brother and sister-in-law and walked up to Miriel and Anna. \u201cAnna got a whole bunch of new potions and tomes, and we\u2019ve been testing them. Turns out, they do some pretty crazy things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a bit of an understatement,\u201d said Robin, her gaze darting between Miriel\u2019s two heads and Anna\u2019s four legs, before settling on the seemingly normal Maribelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd are you altered in some way?\u201d Robin asked Maribelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot anymore, thank goodness,\u201d said Maribelle, shaking her head. \u201cWe used a staff that came with these potions and tomes to return me to normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Robin. \u201cSo you\u2019ve been testing them to make sure they work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore like, to see how they work,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s voice from behind Robin and Chrom. The two turned around to see Lissa\u2019s Sage body walking in behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, all of these things came with really vague descriptions,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body as she walked past Chrom and Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor example, I used a tome that said it would allow me to be in two places at once,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I\u2019m one person who has two completely identical bodies, both under my control,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s... that actually sounds interesting,\u201d said Chrom, recovering from his shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m guessing you brought us here because you wanted us to help you test this stuff out,\u201d Robin said to Lissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep!\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body, as both of her bodies smiled at Robin and Chrom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe also figured it\u2019d be a good idea for you two to know about this stuff,\u201d said Anna. \u201cI was planning on selling it here in Ylisstol once we\u2019d figured out what it all does.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Chrom. He looked at Robin briefly, and she smiled and nodded at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, our schedules are pretty clear for the rest of the day,\u201d Chrom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019d be happy to help you out,\u201d Robin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d said both of Lissa\u2019s bodies, and she hugged herselves in excitement. She then walked her War Cleric body over towards the potions, and her Sage body over to the tomes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, who wants to go first?\u201d Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what do you want to try out?\u201d Lissa\u2019s Sage body asked.</span></div></div>",

There was a ripping sound as the lumps tore through his shirt, forming into tubes that soon grew to be the same length as his arms. The tubes of flesh soon gained shape, forming visible muscles and joints as the ends of the tubes formed into hands. After about a minute, Chrom\u2019s second pair of arms had finished growing in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d said Robin, who had watched with fascination. Maribelle, on the other hand, who hadn\u2019t seen how a potion transformed someone before, simply stayed silent and shifted her feet uncomfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you weren\u2019t wrong about the pain,\u201d said Chrom, groaning. \u201cWhat happened to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold your hands out in front of you,\u201d Lissa\u2019s Sage body suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom did so, and his eyes went wide as he saw four hands, rather than two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGods...\u201d Chrom whispered, clenching his four hands into fists, then opening them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at Chrom\u2019s new hands,\u201d said Robin as she walked up to him. \u201cCheck out the way his fingers are arranged.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, the fingers on his new hands appear to be in reverse order,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head, while her right head looked down at the notebook while she wrote in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiriel was right.

Nothing happened,\" Chrom said, confused as to what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not all alterations are immediately obvious,\" Miriel's left head explained. \"Maribelle's alteration, for example, did not reveal itself until she used the ability she'd gained,\" her right head finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was your, uh, \"alternation\" anyway, Maribelle?\" Robin asked, setting the tome down on the edge of the box she'd retrieved it from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gained the ability to remove my body parts, while still retaining control of them,\" Maribelle said, scratching the back of her neck, still a little uncomfortable with the transformation she'd experienced herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, interesting,\" Robin mused, already trying to come up with potential strategies that utilised such an ability. At that moment, however, the tome that had been placed precariously on the edge of the box lost its balance, ready to tumble to the floor. Robin reached out to grab it, but her reflexes proved to not be quick enough, and the tome tumbled out of Robin's normal reach. Instead of hitting the floor, however, the tome still landed safely in Robin's hand, only her arm seemed to have stretched an extra foot, poking out of the end of her now too short sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone stared silently at Robin's extended arm, as it slowly retracted back to it's normal size. \"Well, I think I found out what the tome does,\" Robin said, putting the tome down more carefully this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" Miriel's right head muttered, as she began making notes. \"Does your skin feel any different? More elastic, perhaps?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feels about the same to me, aside from what I can do with it,\" Robin replied, already testing out the extent of her new ability. She'd found she could pinch and pull her skin out further than it should reasonably go, in addition to the previously discovered stretching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is so cool!\" Lissa's War Cleric body said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want a closer look?\" Robin asked with a grin, as she stretched her arm over to Lissa's War Cleric body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've gotten the hang of that pretty quickly, huh?\" Chrom noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that difficult,\" Robin replied. \"It's just like controlling my arm normally, only it goes past where it normally does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it just me, or is your arm, um, curving in ways its not supposed to?\" Anna asked, noticing how Robin's arm looked while she had it stretched out. Rather than simply growing in length, and still bending at the elbow, her arm had curved along its entire length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, I guess it is,\" Robin said, not having noticed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that would explain the description in Anna's notebook,\" Miriel's left head stated. \"If you are no longer forced to bend solely at your joints, that would certainly improve your flexibility,\" her right head concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, is it just your arms that can stretch?\" Lissa's Sage body asked, as her War Cleric body continued to toy with the skin on Robin's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt it, considering the illustration on the tome, but I suppose there's only one way to find out.\" Robin quickly pulled her arm back to its usual length, before making a face of concentration. Without warning, Robin's legs suddenly grew rather quickly, her pants untucking from her boots as they refused to stretch with her body. She put her hands up to stop herself, her legs stopping their growth as she pressed against the ceiling. \"Well, I think it's safe to say it's not just my arms,\" she said from her place at the ceiling, looking down at the others in the room who watched in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Lissa's War Cleric body shouted, unable to hear what Robin had said so high up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said,\" Robin shouted back, before her head started to descend towards the group, her neck stretching to accommodate, a smirk on her face. \"I think it's safe to say to say it's not just my arms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that really necessary?\" Maribelle asked, a bit unsettled by Robin's contorted body. She'd already started to get used to Miriel and Anna's extra body parts, but Robin's newfound ability still freaked her out a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no,\" Robin said as her legs and neck started to retract, \"But while I've got this ability, I might as well use it.\" As she finished retracting back to her usual size, she noticed her pants were no longer tucked into her boots. \"Although it's a bit inconvenient that my clothes don't stretch with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Maybe we can use the clothing tome for that,\" Lissa's War Cleric body said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it makes your clothes adjust to your body, then they might become as stretchy as you,\" her Sage body finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or, it could end up being a wasted use of the tome, with her clothing not needing to adapt to any immediate changes,\" Anna interjected, not sure it was worth using up a use of the tome just to test that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you think, Miriel?\" \"Is it worth testing?\" Lissa's bodies asked.</span></div></div>",

She thought, after seeing Chrom\u2019s reaction, she could prepare herself for the pain. She hadn\u2019t expected anything like this, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a minute, the pain subsided. Robin shook her head, then opened her eyes. She almost immediately felt dizzy, as she could see in all directions; in front of her, to her sides, behind her, even above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d said Robin, closing her eyes again. \u201cThat was... weird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Chrom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I think so,\u201d said Robin. \u201cSeeing in nearly every direction at once was disorientating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can imagine,\u201d said Anna. \u201cHow many new eyes have you got, anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d said Robin. She raised her hands to her face, and felt where her original eyes were. She rested her fingers on her eyelids, and pulled them open, using the feeling of her fingertips on her eyelids to differentiate between her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so that\u2019s my original pair,\u201d said Robin as she opened her original eyes. She then felt around on her forehead, and felt a single eye located in the centre of her forehead, and gently pulled her forehead eye open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got one eye on my forehead,\u201d said Robin, turning her head to face Miriel. The two-headed woman was watching with her right head, and looking down at her notebook with her left head. Miriel\u2019s right head nodded, and Robin continued feeling her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands ran down her cheeks, and she felt a single eye on each of her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s an eye on each of my cheeks,\u201d Robin said as she opened her cheek eyes, then ran her tongue against the inside of her cheeks. \u201cThe inside of my mouth doesn\u2019t feel any different, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow strange,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head as she dutifully noted Robin\u2019s words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin then raised her hands to her temples, and found her next pair of eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve also got eyes on my temples,\u201d Robin said, opening her temple eyes. She\u2019d found that opening her eyes at this slower pace was allowing her to acclimate to her wider field of vision much easier. She continued feeling the sides of her head, but felt no more eyes, so she reached around with her left hand, and felt a single eye in the back of her head. She then brought her right hand to the top of her head, and felt a single eye there as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got two more eyes,\u201d Robin said as she opened her rear eye. \u201cOne on the back of my head, and one on the top of my head,\u201d Robin said, as she opened her top eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre there any other eyes you have not yet found?\u201d Miriel\u2019s left head asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin closed all her eyes, then opened them again. \u201cNo, that\u2019s all of them,\u201d Robin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen you have developed five new eyes,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head. \u201cPresumably, you can now see in almost any direction.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right,\u201d said Robin. Her original eyes were looking at Miriel\u2019s right head while her forehead eye was looking at Miriel\u2019s left head. Her right cheek and temple eyes were looking at Anna, Maribelle and Lissa\u2019s Sage body, while her left cheek and temple eyes were watching Chrom and Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body. Her rear eye was looking down at the potions and tomes at her feet, while her top eye was simply staring at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you can see all of us?\u201d Lissa\u2019s Sage body asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, although my hair is getting in the way of my new eyes,\u201d Robin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you are clearly seeing things differently,\u201d said Maribelle, looking slightly queasy at the sight of Robin\u2019s eye-covered head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s an understatement,\u201d Robin said, looking at Maribelle with her right cheek eye, while she turned her right temple eye to look at Anna, who was picking up the restoration staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, do you want to be restored?\u201d Anna asked.</span></div></div>",

In the end, it didn\u2019t matter too much, as after about a minute, the pain subsided, signalling that the transformation was over. Robin looked down at her hands and gasped. While she still had a total of five fingers and thumbs on each of her hands, she now had only three fingers on each of her hands. The little finger on both of her hands had turned into a thumb, and it seemed like her index and ring fingers were now exactly the same length as each other, making her hands symmetrical. Robin closed her hands into fists, and saw her upper and lower thumbs above her three fingers on both her fists. Robin opened her hands again, and held her hands up for the others to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like Lissa was right,\u201d Robin said as she showed the others her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head as she looked down at the notebook with her right head so she could see what she was writing. \u201cIt seems the potions can alter existing body parts, even when new body parts are not being added.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Robin as she opened and closed her hands a few times, watching how her new thumbs moved. She then walked over to Maribelle and picked up the restoration staff with her right hand, to see how her new hands worked at holding things. Her three fingers wrapped around the staff, as did her upper and lower thumbs, with her uppper thumb resting on her index and middle fingers, while her lower thumb rested on her middle and ring fingers. The tips of her two thumbs rubbed against each other when she picked up the staff, which was a strange feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019d say you\u2019ve got a pretty good grip on that,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body as she walked up Robin, and tried to tug the staff out of Robin\u2019s hand. However, the staff wouldn\u2019t budge until Robin loosened her grip and let go of the staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Robin as she let go of the staff, letting Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body take it. \u201cMy hands don\u2019t feel any stronger, but with two thumbs like that, I can get a pretty good grip on things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll say,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, do you want to be restored so you can try the next potion?\u201d Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I do,\u201d said Robin, nodding.

After a minute, Robin felt the pain subside, and she looked at her hands. At first, they didn\u2019t seem any different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing\u2019s changed,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body as she crossed her arms on both bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas the potion a dud?\u201d Lissa\u2019s Sage body asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin shook her head. \u201cThere was definitely a transformation. I could feel the pain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere was the pain from the transformation located?\u201d Miriel\u2019s left head asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy hands and feet,\u201d said Robin, looking at her hands again, while Miriel looked at Robin\u2019s hands with both her heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe I have determined what the potion has changed,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTry counting your fingers,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Robin slowly. She folded her thumb in on her left hand, then closed each of her fingers one by one. One, two, three, four, five, six... six?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin\u2019s eyebrows shot up in surprise as she realised what the potion had done. Looking carefully at her left hand, she checked her fingers. Her new sixth finger was located in the centre of her hand, and looked to be an identical copy of her middle finger. Robin checked her right hand, and noticed that she also had a second middle finger on her right hand as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI grew an extra finger on each hand,\u201d said Robin. \u201cAnd if the pain in my feet is anything to go by, I think I grew an extra toe on both of my feet, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin sat down and pulled the boot off her right foot, then took off her left boot. With her feet bare, Robin counted her toes, and found that, like she had suspected, she had grown a new toe on both of her feet. Like her new fingers, her new toes were identical copies of her middle toes, rather than new toes added on the end of her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve got new toes, too,\u201d said Robin as Miriel began writing notes down. \u201cIt looks like my new fingers and toes are copies of my middle fingers, rather than completely new fingers and toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat seems rather small,\u201d said Anna, slowly tapping her rear left foot on the ground. \u201cAt least in comparison to the other changes the potions have made.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, particularly since polydactyly is a rare but known phenomenon,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoly-what?\u201d Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDactyly,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head. \u201cIt is the scientific term used to refer to people who are born with additional fingers or toes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, okay,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body, nodding. \u201cSo, it\u2019s a real thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, though it is very rare,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head. \u201cIt is interesting that a potion was developed that mimics a real medical phenomenon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin picked up her boots, and put them back on her feet. Once her boots were back on, she stood up and looked over at Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI gotta say, extra fingers and toes aren\u2019t really all that exciting,\u201d said Robin. \u201cAt least, not in comparison to what else these potions can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you want to be restored?\u201d Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Robin said with a nod. Lissa raised the staff in her War Cleric body\u2019s hands, making pink light wash over Robin. The extra toes and fingers Robin had grown vanished as she walked back over to the three remaining potions. On the left was a purple potion in a clear bottle, in the centre was a green potion in a red bottle, and a black potion in a clear bottle was on the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMight as well test the next potion,\u201d said Robin, picking up one of the potion bottles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich potion did Robin choose?</span></div></div>",

The pain in her mouth was intense, and stopped her from being able to move her mouth at all.

A minute later, the transformation was complete, and Robin looked down at her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was balancing on her toes, which were covered by a white hoof, which had been formed by Robin\u2019s toenails. Her foot felt like it was longer, but her lower legs felt shorter than they had before. She looked behind her, and saw what looked like a backwards facing knee, but Robin suspected that it was actually her ankles. Despite the changes to her lower legs and feet, she didn\u2019t feel as if she was any taller than she had before the transformation had taken effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell... this is... unexpected...\u201d Robin said slowly as the others stared in shock. \u201cGlad I took my boots off before I drank that potion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly, Robin lifted her left foot up, then put it back down again, hearing her new hoof tapping against the floor.

She put them on as best she could, then Lissa gave Robin the clothing alteration tome and Robin cast the spell. Robin\u2019s pants started shifting as the magic took hold, changing the pants to fit the shape of her legs better. Her boots began reforming into a pair of leather spats that covered the tops of her feet closest to her hooves, and her pants were tucked into the spats, to prevent her pants from hanging loosely. Finally, the soles of her boots hardened into metal and lined the bottom of her hoof, and Robin felt a slight pushing sensation as nails formed in the horseshoe, locking it into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what do you know?\u201d Robin said, lifting one of her feet up to get a better look at the bottom of her hoof. \u201cIt did give me horseshoes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery interesting,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head as she dutifully made a note of the changes made to Robin\u2019s clothing by the tome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, do you want to be restored?\u201d Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body asked, holding a new restoration staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, go for it,\u201d said Robin.

Robin was engulfed by the pink light, which quickly faded as Robin\u2019s lower legs and feet were returned to normal. With her feet back to normal, Robin noticed that her clothes had also been transformed back to normal by the staff, as the leather spats and metal horseshoes had been combined into her regular boots, and her pants had been reshaped to fit her normal legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that was fun,\u201d said Robin, shifting her feet as she got used to having normal legs and feet again. \u201cNot something I\u2019d want on a permanent basis, but it was still pretty cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019m kind of interested in trying the hoof potion and the humantaur potion together,\u201d said Chrom. \u201cMight be interesting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I could offer you those potions for a fee of one thousand, seven hundred and fifty gold,\u201d said Anna, sensing an opportunity to make a sale. \u201cYou\u2019ll save two hundred and fifty gold, and I\u2019ll even throw in a free clothing alteration tome.\u201d</span></div></div>",

She felt something brush against the backs of her legs as her tail swished from side to side, and she felt her hand get tangled in what felt like long hair. She gently pulled the hair on her tail around in front of her to get a better look at it. Long white hair was hanging from her fingers, and she dropped the hair as her tail twitched again, sending her tail hair swinging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I can\u2019t get a proper look at it like this, but I think I have a horse\u2019s tail,\u201d said Robin, looking over her shoulder at the tail emerging from her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it would seem,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you please turn around so we may see your tail?\u201d Miriel\u2019s left head asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d Robin said, turning around so her back was to Miriel, allowing Miriel to get a better look at Robin\u2019s tail and make more accurate notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan... can I touch tour tail?\u201d Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, go for it,\u201d said Robin, twitching her tail as she learned how to control it.

The rest of it is just hair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long\u2019s the hair?\u201d Robin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt reaches down to the ground,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body. \u201cMight need to trim it if you want to have one all the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t, but that is good to know,\u201d said Robin. \u201cIs that enough information for you?\u201d she asked, looking over her shoulder at Miriel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiriel nodded her heads. \u201cYes, thank you,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head as she looked down with her left head and wrote in the notebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Lissa, go ahead and restore me,\u201d said Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got it,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body as her Sage body stood up and took a few steps back, so she wouldn\u2019t lose her Sage body when she restored Robin. Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body held the restoration staff and activated it, causing the pink gem to flash. When the pink light faded, Robin\u2019s tail was gone, though the hole in her pants where her tail had been was still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Robin, walking over to Chrom. Chrom held out Robin\u2019s tactician\u2019s robe, and Robin took the robe and put it back on. Once she had her robe on, she picked up the elasticity tome and the breast mouth potion she\u2019d purchased earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to use those now?\u201d Chrom asked.</span></div></div>",

Nothing?\" he thought aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It appears to be another tome whose effects are not immediately obvious,\" Miriel noted with her left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I don't see anything either,\" Lissa said with her War Cleric body. As she spoke, her Sage body approached, remembering how Maribelle's separation ability hadn't become clear until she bumped into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lissa began to prod at Chrom's body, he suddenly felt a surge of energy from within him. It wasn't painful or anything, like the potion he'd tried had been, but it still caught him off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Lissa shouted with her War Cleric body, while her Sage body jumped backwards, as Chrom felt the energy subsiding. It wasn't just Lissa, however. All eyes in the room were on Chrom, various levels of surprise displayed on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom, however, was none the wiser as to what happened, only knowing that he felt a bit off. \"What happened?\" he asked, before immediately clamping his hand over his mouth. It wasn't his own voice that had come out, but rather it was Lissa's. Looking down at himself, it wasn't difficult to see why. He seemed to be an exact copy of Lissa, even wearing the same outfit her Sage body was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That certainly does appear to be a rather convincing disguise,\" Miriel said with her right head. \"You seem more or less indistinguishable from the real Lissa,\" she continued with her left head, making a note of the tome's effects in the notebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you turn back, or do we need to use the restore staff for that,\" Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'll see,\" Chrom replied, finding it a bit unnerving to hear a voice other than his own when he spoke. He concentrated on turning back into himself, and after a brief moment, he felt the same surge of energy he'd felt when Lissa touched him. \"Well, looks I can turn back into myself,\" he said, looking down to find his body was his own once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you mind trying it again, only without Lissa touching you this time?\" Miriel asked with her left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.\" He tried to concentrate again, but this time nothing seemed to happen. The energy refused to spring forth. He shook his head. \"Nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, so you probably have to be touching whoever's appearance you're taking,\" Robin noted. It meant that if it were to be put to tactical use, one of the enemy would need to be captured first, but it still seemed to have its uses. For one, you'd still be able to carry a weapon without being detected, unlike the invisibility tome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would seem that way, yes,\" Miriel replied, continuing to alternate between her heads whenever she spoke. \"I believe Chrom's transformation at Lissa's touch occurred due to his being unfamiliar with his new abilities. With enough time to adapt, I hypothesise that one would be able to utilise the ability without transforming at every touch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd hope so,\" Chrom said. \"It'd get pretty confusing if you changed you appearance every time someone touched you.\" Halfway through his sentence, he felt the energy surge up again, and heard his voice changing, as Lissa poked his arm again. \"Lissa...\" he berated using her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" her Sage body replied, not an ounce of regret on her face, as her War Cleric body continued to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must inquire, though,\" Miriel interjected, \"Have you physically become a copy of Lissa, or is the tome simply allowing you project an illusion that makes you look like her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the difference?\" Chrom asked, not bothering to turn back into himself yet, seeing as Lissa would probably just poke him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if it is simply an illusion, you may look like a replica of Lissa, but I assume you would feel the same underneath that guise. On the other hand, if you have actually become her double, you would be physically female right now, and I'm sure you would be able to tell the difference between that and your normal body.\"</span></div></div>",

Despite being biologically female, he still felt normal, which he guessed was a side effect of the tome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he finished transforming, everyone looked down at Chrom\u2019s legs, to see if he had successfully duplicated Robin\u2019s centre leg as well, or if he was still normal.</span></div></div>",

Another line formed, and Chrom opened his mouth with a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this is weird,\u201d he said, his words sounding slightly slurred, due to the fact that his lips kept sticking together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Robin asked as she stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot sure,\u201d said Chrom as his nose began to form. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt but... it\u2019s really hard to describe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can imagine,\u201d said Robin. \u201cLooks like you\u2019re starting to get the hang of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, maybe,\u201d said Chrom as part of the blob began to rise up, forming a roughly spherical shape. Chrom slid his eyes, nose and mouth along his body and up the side of his newly-formed head, then moved his face around so it was on the front of his face. Liquid began pooling over his head, forming a rough blob that mostly resembled the shape of his hair, though Chrom was unable to actually form hair yet. Chrom\u2019s head began to rise as his neck began to take shape, followed by his torso. Long tendrils of flesh-coloured liquid began to stretch out from his shoulders, forming rough, almost boneless versions of his arms, though he didn\u2019t manage to get fingers yet. Chrom was still for a few seconds, with liquid slowly running down and dripping off the parts of his body he had managed to form so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I think that\u2019s as good as I can do,\u201d said Chrom, shrugging his shoulders, sending a ripple through his body. \u201cAt least for now. I think I\u2019m going to need more practice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s better than you were a few minutes ago,\u201d said Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Chrom, nodding his head distractedly as his upper body seemed to float in the puddle that consisted of his lower body and legs. Chrom began to move his puddle half around as his upper body started to become a little more solid, though he was still obviously liquid, and was still unable to properly form his hands or his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour new method of locomotion is interesting,\u201d said Miriel with her left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am somewhat interested in testing it firsthand,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you want to give the melting tome a go, I can sell it to you for five hundred gold,\u201d said Anna, resting her finger on her chin as she smiled at Miriel.</span></div></div>",

Orange words spiralled around her as her body briefly flashed white. Once the white light faded, Miriel carefully set the tome down as she felt a strange wetness on her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe that answers your question,\u201d said Miriel with her left head. She could feel herself starting to drip on the floor as her body finished becoming liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really didn\u2019t waste any time, huh?\u201d asked Chrom, who was still only semi-solid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiriel didn\u2019t answer Chrom\u2019s question, as she was too busy adjusting to the new sensations of her fluid body. She closed her eyes, and relaxed, feeling her body start to flow out of her clothes. The dripping fluid from her arms became a downpour as she flowed downwards, spreading herself over the ground. Miriel could feel her liquid being absorbed into her clothes, but with a bit of concentration, she was able to pull herself out of her clothes, leaving her clothes dry as she formed a puddle. Miriel flowed out of her boots, unable to tell exactly where she was. She could no longer feel her clothes, and could instead feel only the wooden floor below her. Again, she could feel herself seeping into the wood, but with a bit of concentration, Miriel was able to keep herself out of the wood. With a little more focus, Miriel was able to reform all four of her eyes, and oriented them around her puddle so she could see in all directions. Once her vision was formed, she began moving around the floor, flowing around as she experimented with her new form. She pulled herself into as small a puddle as she could, then stretched herself out as far as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting the hang of this a lot faster than my brother,\u201d Lissa said with her Sage body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiriel imagined her body growing a mouth, and she could feel both pairs of lips forming on the top of her puddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps it is my experience with two heads that has allowed me to adapt so fast,\u201d Miriel said with one mouth as she slid one of her eyes around to look at Lissa\u2019s bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr, I simply have a natural affinity for this form,\u201d Miriel finished with her other mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll be able to reform yourself?\u201d Chrom asked. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll have better luck than me.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Miriel contracted herself into as small a puddle as she could, then slid her eyes and mouths around in order to form her two faces. Once her eyes and mouths were in the correct places, Miriel focused on forming her noses. Two small bumps rose out of the puddle, and the two bumps took the shapes of her noses. Once her noses were formed, Miriel moved on to forming her heads. Two blobs began rising from the puddle, and Miriel moved her faces onto the fronts of the blobs. The two blobs continued to rise up from the puddle, and took a more solid shape. Ears began to form on the sides of the blobs as they became more defined, looking more and more like heads with each passing second. Soon, Miriel had completely reformed her heads, but both her heads were hairless, with not even eyelashes or eyebrows. Miriel closed all four of her eyes, and focused on forming her eyelashes. She felt a prickling sensation on her eyelids, then opened her eyes. Miriel raised a tentacle of fluid out of her puddle and felt along her eyes, and felt eyelashes under her tentacle. Miriel relaxed the tentacle, causing it to liquefy and slide back into her puddle. Now that she had confirmed that it was possible to reform hair, Miriel focused on forming her eyebrows. She felt the same prickling sensation on both her foreheads as short red hairs began poking out, quickly forming into her eyebrows. The prickling sensation ran across the tops of her heads as she began forming her hair, and Miriel could feel her hair brushing against her puddle as it formed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d said Lissa quietly, speaking with both bodies as she watched in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re already doing better than me,\u201d said Chrom, who had moved away from Miriel, so that his puddle body wouldn\u2019t mix with Miriel\u2019s. \u201cI still haven\u2019t been able to form hair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must admit, it is somewhat surprising that I have been able to adapt to this form so quickly,\u201d said Miriel with her left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe my hypothesis about having a natural affinity for this form is valid,\u201d she concluded with her right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think you can reform the rest of your body as well?\u201d Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will do my best,\u201d said Miriel, speaking with her left head as she nodded with her right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiriel\u2019s head began rising out of the puddle as her neck\u2019s form, and more of the puddle rose as her shoulders formed as well. However, rather than form arms, Miriel focused on creating her body. The puddle continued to rise until the rough shape of Miriel\u2019s hips had emerged, then the blob started to take a more solid shape. The shoulders became wider and more defined, and the sides of the blob tucked in, following the curve of Miriel\u2019s waist. Miriel\u2019s breasts formed on the front of her chest, followed by her belly button. Once Miriel was satisfied with her body, she began pulling her fluids up the sides of her body and pushing it out from her shoulders. The fluid flowed down from her shoulders, slowly forming her upper arms. Once Miriel\u2019s upper arms had finished forming, she pulled more fluid up her body and pushed it down her upper arms, forming her lower arms, then her hands. Miriel focused on forming her hands, and slowly, four fingers and a thumb emerged from the blobs at the ends of her arms. The blobs themselves soon formed into the palms of her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to say, this is pretty interesting to watch,\u201d said Robin as Miriel formed her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I have found that reforming myself like this is quite enjoyable,\u201d said Miriel with her right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve still got to do your legs,\u201d said Lissa with her War Cleric body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChrom still hasn\u2019t managed to do that,\u201d she finished with her Sage body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiriel nodded her heads, then turned her attention back to reforming herself. Her body was currently resting in the puddle that was formed from her legs, and it rose up slightly as she finished reforming her hips. She began pushing herself up slightly as she began to form her thighs, then pulled her puddle apart into two distinct pools of liquid, one for her left leg and one for her right. Once she had done so, she pushed herself up and continued forming her thighs. With the experience she had from forming the rest of her body, her legs formed much faster than the rest of her had, and she shot up to what was almost her original height as her legs formed. However, she still had a puddle at the end of each leg that would form her feet. Miriel\u2019s toes formed at the end of the puddles, and the puddles stretched out in the shape of her feet. The puddles rose slightly and stiffened as Miriel finished forming her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere,\u201d said Miriel with her left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have restored myself to a solid form,\u201d she continued with her right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would appear that going slowly and correctly forming each body part is the key to successfully solidifying,\u201d she finished with her left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Chrom, who was slowly starting to sink back into a puddle again. \u201cWell, considering the trouble the other tomes have given me, I doubt I\u2019m going to make myself solid any time soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of which, are you truly solid, or have you just formed yourself into your old shape?\u201d asked Maribelle as she walked up to Miriel. Maribelle poked Miriel\u2019s naked shoulder, but Maribelle\u2019s finger didn\u2019t sink in like Robin\u2019s had when she poked Chrom. Instead, Maribelle could feel solid bone in Miriel\u2019s shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt appears I have become truly solid,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can feel that my skeleton has formed inside my body,\u201d her left head continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh,\u201d said Chrom. \u201cI still haven\u2019t been able to form bones yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere,\u201d said Anna, walking up to Miriel. Anna was carrying a bundle of clothes in her arms, and she held the clothes out to Miriel. \u201cYou should probably get dressed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d said Miriel from both heads as she began blushing profusely. \u201cOf course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiriel took her clothes from Anna, and began dressing herself. Miriel was able to put on most of her clothes with ease, though she had a bit of difficulty with her shirt, as she had not had to put a shirt on with two heads before. However, she quickly managed to get the correct heads through the correct holes, and soon finished dressing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a truly fascinating experience,\u201d Miriel said with her left head as she put her glasses on. \u201cI must write down my observations immediately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Miriel had her glasses on, she picked up the notebook she had been carrying, and began writing down the effects of the melting tome down, describing her experiences as a puddle and her experience with reforming herself into a solid form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, while she\u2019s doing that, do you want to be restored?\u201d Lissa asked with her Sage body as she walked towards Chrom with her War Cleric body, her War Cleric body holding the restoration staff in her hands.</span></div></div>",

Once the glow had faded, there were no obvious changes to Chrom\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t see any changes,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body as she used both of her bodies to check Chrom for any changes brought about by the tome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like another tome where the effect isn\u2019t immediately obvious,\u201d said Anna. \u201cThough, given Chrom\u2019s track record, he\u2019ll probably lose control of his new power any second now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d argue with you, except that you\u2019re absolutely right,\u201d said Chrom. \u201cAnd I certainly don\u2019t feel any different, either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, is it just me, or does Chrom seem to be a little shorter than he was before he used the tome?\u201d Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I think you\u2019re right,\u201d said Robin as she looked at Chrom. \u201cHe is shorter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Robin spoke, Chrom\u2019s clothes were becoming rather loose as he dropped in height. Normally, he was about a head taller than Lissa, but now he was the same height as her, and was getting smaller, though his shrinking stopped when he was about one head shorter than Lissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, this tome allows the user to change their height,\u201d said Miriel with her left head as she made a note in the book she was carrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder if it allows the user to increase their height, as well as decrease it?\u201d Miriel asked with her right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Chrom with a shrug, causing the fabric of his now very loose shirt to billow. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll find out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom closed his eyes, and focused on growing. He soon started to increase in height, rapidly shooting up to his normal height, then he started growing taller, causing his clothes to grow tight on his body. Once the tightness became painful, he opened his eyes and stopped growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it looks like I can grow, too,\u201d said Chrom, looking down at the others. He then closed his eyes and concentrated again, and soon returned to his normal height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFascinating,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder what the maximum and minimum heights for the tome\u2019s size changing abilities are?\u201d she continued with her right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I want to find out,\u201d said Chrom. \u201cWhat if become too small to see? Or if I grow so large I break through the roof? Besides, we still need to test the last tome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is true,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose further experimentation can be conducted at a later date,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head, as a bead of what looked like sweat rolled down the side of her right head\u2019s left temple. Miriel frowned slightly with her right head, and the bead of sweat rolled back up the side of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Lissa\u2019s Sage body asked, facing Miriel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am having a little difficulty in remaining solid,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut it is nothing to concern yourself with,\u201d Miriel\u2019s right head continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith practice, I am sure it will not be a problem,\u201d she concluded with her left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, if you say so,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body. She raised the staff in her hands, and the pink gem flashed, bathing Chrom in light. Once the pink light had faded, Chrom walked over to the last of the tomes, and picked it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what does this last tome do?\u201d Chrom asked, as he held the red tome up and showed it to everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiriel flipped through the notebook until she found the page for the red tome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was the description for the red tome?</span></div></div>",

While her War Cleric body was speaking, her Sage body sighed and walked over to Chrom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll become obvious soon enough,\u201d said Chrom as Lissa\u2019s Sage body walked up behind him and started poking him. After a few pokes, he felt a strange surge of energy, similar to what the mimicry tome felt like when he had copied someone\u2019s appearance. This time, though, it was accompanied by a strange tingling sensation in his scalp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa\u2019s Sage body shuddered as she felt a tingling on the top of her head. \u201cThat was weird... whoa!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? What is it?\u201d asked Chrom, turning to face Lissa\u2019s Sage body. When he saw Lissa\u2019s Sage body, his eyes went wide. Lissa\u2019s hair was now bright blue, the same shade of blue that Chrom\u2019s hair was. He looked over at Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body, and he noticed that Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body also had blue hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat...? How...?\u201d Chrom asked, dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt appears that you have inadvertently swapped the colour of your hair with Lissa,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLissa now has blue hair, while your hair is now the same colour as Lissa\u2019s,\u201d finished Miriel\u2019s right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I can swap things with people?\u201d Chrom asked as he reached out and touched Lissa. He felt the surge of energy and the tingling in his scalp again, and Chrom\u2019s hair returned to blue, while the hair on both of Lissa\u2019s bodies returned to blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI looked so weird with blue hair,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body. \u201cAnd you looked pretty funny with blonde hair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is a rather unusual development,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile the other tomes only altered the body of the one who cast the spell, this tome also allows the user to modify the bodies of others, as well,\u201d Miriel\u2019s right head continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps it would be best to experiment with this ability, and determine precisely what can be swapped between to people, and what limitations this ability has,\u201d she concluded with her left head.</span></div></div>",

However, he was unable to summon the swapping power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like I can only swap with one person at a time,\u201d Chrom said as he lifted his hand from Lissa\u2019s shoulder. He moved back over to Robin, and took her hand again, and tried to swap something else with her. \u201cAnd it looks like I can only swap one thing at any time. I can\u2019t make multiple swaps with the same person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh,\u201d said Robin, still playing with her shorter hair with her free hand. \u201cWell, I guess it means you won\u2019t get things too jumbled up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Chrom as he undid the swap with Robin. His hair shortened back to its original length, while Robin\u2019s hair grew out into her pigtails again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what were you trying to swap while you had my hairstyle?\u201d Robin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom, still holding Robin\u2019s hand, answered her question by performing the swap he had in mind. Robin felt a tingling sensation all over her body as she felt her muscles shifting. She felt a pulling sensation on her chest as her breasts shrank, and felt pressure in her crotches as a bulge formed between her left and centre legs and her centre and right legs. Meanwhile, Chrom\u2019s waist sucked in as a pair of breasts formed on his chest, and the bulge in his pants flattened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d said Robin, then giggled at the sound of her deeper voice. \u201cIs this what it feels like to be a man?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Chrom, his voice now a little higher. \u201cI already have a bit of experience being a woman, so I decided to let you experience being a man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s not the weirdest thing that\u2019s happened to me today,\u201d said Robin. \u201cAfter all, I still have three legs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d said Chrom as he reversed the swap. The breasts on Chrom\u2019s chest flattened as they grew back on Robin\u2019s chest, and Robin felt a pulling sensation in her crotches as a bulge formed in Chrom\u2019s pants again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you can swap hair colour, hair style, and gender,\u201d said Robin, counting off the swaps Chrom had done so far. \u201cWhat else can you do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s find out,\u201d said Chrom. He felt the surge of energy again, and felt a pulling sensation in his crotch. He looked down and saw bulges forming in Robin\u2019s pants, between her left and centre legs and between her centre and right legs. He then reversed that swap, then made another one, causing his shirt to push out as he swapped Robin\u2019s breasts onto his body, causing her shirt to deflate. Chrom reversed the swap again, then focused on his next swap. He wanted to try something different, so he tried swapping his two legs with Robin\u2019s three legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin felt a pulling sensation on her centre leg, and looked down to see her centre leg pulling back up into her body, causing the centre leg of her pants to hang loosely. However, the centre leg of her pants soon vanished, along with her centre boot. She looked over at Chrom, and saw a centre leg forming between his left and right legs, and his pants stretched and changed shape to accommodate his new body part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d said Miriel with her right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt appears that it is possible to swap the effects of a potion,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t able to copy my third leg when you used the mimicry tome,\u201d said Robin as Chrom reversed the swap, causing her hips to widen and a centre leg to grow between her left and right legs. Surprisingly, having the third leg swapped back onto her wasn\u2019t painful, like growing it had been when she had first used the potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t actually swap our legs,\u201d said Chrom. \u201cI swapped the effects of the potion that gave you three legs onto me, and swapped the lack of a potion onto you. At least, I think that\u2019s how it worked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh,\u201d said Robin. \u201cThat\u2019s weird. Anyway, Miriel, do you think that\u2019s enough information for now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, thank you,\u201d said Miriel with her right head. \u201cI appreciate your assistance in testing the potions and tomes for us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChrom, Robin, do either of you wish to be restored now?\u201d Miriel asked with her left head.</span></div></div>",

Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body was holding a white bottle that contained a pale pink potion, while Lissa\u2019s Sage body had taken a clear bottle that held a black potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you want the potion that turns your little fingers into thumbs, and the potion that gives you a tail,\u201d said Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body. \u201cI think this body will look good with a tail.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd having an extra pair of thumbs on these hands will make holding onto an axe much easier,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna nodded. \u201cThat\u2019ll be one thousand, seven hundred and fifty gold,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body. Lissa passed the potion her War Cleric body was holding to her Sage body, and her War Cleric body took out her purse and started counting out gold. As Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body counted out gold, Anna walked over to the boxes that held the tomes. She reached into one, and pulled out a tome with a grey cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, that should be enough gold,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body, walking up to Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that looks about right,\u201d said Anna, taking the gold from Lissa and giving her the clothing alteration tome. \u201cYou\u2019ll probably want this as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, yeah, that\u2019s a good point,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body as she took the clothing alteration tome with her War Cleric body. \u201cHow much for it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, I\u2019m planning on giving those away for free to anyone who purchases a potion,\u201d said Anna. \u201cAfter all, you\u2019ll still have plenty of clothes that won\u2019t fit your new body after you use the potion, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re probably right,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body. \u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d said Anna. She reached into the box and pulled out three more grey tomes. Once she had her three tomes, she walked over to Miriel and gave one to her, and passed the second one to Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Robin, taking the grey tome and putting it with the pink tome and the purple potion in a clear bottle she\u2019d purchased earlier<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy thanks,\u201d said Miriel with her left head as she received the grey tome from Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI assume that the third clothing alteration tome will be for yourself?\u201d Miriel asked with her right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Anna. \u201cI\u2019ve actually gotten really used to having four legs, even though I wasn\u2019t really comfortable with it at first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand,\u201d said Miriel with her left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, does anyone else want to buy anything?\u201d Anna asked, resting her finger on her chin.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Miriel walked through the streets of Ylisstol, reading the observations she had recorded in her notebook with her left head as she used her right head to watch where she was going. There were quite a few people travelling through Ylisstol, and Miriel noticed that a number of passersby were staring at her two heads in surprise. Thankfully, the Shepherd\u2019s Barracks weren\u2019t too far from Anna\u2019s store, and a few minutes later, Miriel had arrived at the Barracks. Once she arrived at the Barracks, Miriel made her way through the building towards her quarters. Judging by the fact that she could hear practice swords striking each other, it seemed that most of the other Shepherds were busy practising with their weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching her quarters, Miriel opened the door and hurried inside, closing the door behind her. She walked over to her desk, which contained her various notebooks and experiments. Miriel put the notebook she was carrying on her desk, along with her two pairs of glasses, then walked over to her closet and began stripping off her clothes. Once she was completely naked, Miriel relaxed, and felt herself slipping down into a puddle as she sighed in relief. Maintaining her solid form had required a surprising amount of concentration, meaning that it was likely that her liquid state was her natural form now. Within seconds, Miriel had spread out into a large puddle on the floor of her room. With a bit of focus, she was able to form one of her eyes, and slid it around her puddle body, examining her room from her low perspective. Remaining as a flat puddle, Miriel flowed across the floor towards her door, and used her single eye to examine the crack at the bottom of the door. Curiously, Miriel began extending part of her puddle towards the door, and started pushing herself through the crack. Miriel\u2019s fluid passed under the door easily, and Miriel pulled her entire puddle out through the crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was through the door, another idea formed in her minds. Miriel moved her puddle so that she was in front of her door, then raised part of her puddle up. She could feel the rough surface of the door under her puddle, and began pushing more of her liquid up against the door. As she piled more of her fluid against the door, Miriel began pulling herself up the door. She pulled herself up the door, using her puddle body to cling to the wood. Miriel managed to pull herself all the way up to the top of the door, then pushed herself through the crack at the top of the door. She passed through the door and began dripping down into her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she finished sliding down the inside of the door, Miriel flowed back over to her desk, and began to reform herself into her solid form. Miriel was able to return to her solid form much more quickly this time, likely due to her experience doing so. Once she was solid, Miriel put her glasses back on her heads, and opened her notebook. She then sat down in her chair and picked up a quill so she could write down her observations. As she wrote, Miriel felt her concentration slipping slightly, and could feel herself starting to liquefy. Her buttocks were starting to soak into the chair\u2019s cushion, and her fingers were dripping onto the paper. However, with a bit of focus, Miriel was able to pull the liquid out of the cushion and the paper and back into herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Miriel had finished writing her notes, she got out of her chair and liquefied her legs, leaving her upper body solid. Miriel formed her liquefied legs into a puddle, surrounding her body, and used that to flow over to where she had placed her clothes when she had undressed herself. Miriel pushed her upper body back up and solidified her legs again, then dressed herself again. Once she had finished putting her clothes back on, Miriel left her room to join the other Shepherds for the evening meal.</span></div></div>",

Her War Cleric body was to Maribelle\u2019s left, while her Sage body was to Maribelle\u2019s right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m a little surprised you haven\u2019t used those potions by now,\u201d said Maribelle. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who was most enthusiastic about trying them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess I was,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body, looking down at the potion and the tome she was carrying. Lissa was carrying the grey clothing alteration tome and the potion that would give her a tail with her Sage body, while she used her War Cleric body to carry the green duplication tome and the potion that would turn her little fingers into thumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just think this stuff is really interesting,\u201d Lissa continued with her War Cleric body. \u201cBut I figure I should at least wait until we\u2019re back at the Barracks to use these potions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose that makes sense,\u201d said Maribelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I was really surprised when you wanted to buy that detachment tome,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body, pointing at the tome Maribelle was carrying. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want to try any more of those.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m still not interested in using any of the potions that Anna has,\u201d said Maribelle. \u201cBut, I have to admit, I found that being able to detach my body parts was actually quite enjoyable, in its own way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know what you mean,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body. \u201cWhen I first used the duplication tome, it was really hard to get my head around having two bodies. But after a few minutes, it became completely natural.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it was surprising how fast we could adapt to such strange forms,\u201d said Maribelle. \u201cAlthough your brother seemed to have some difficulties with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that was weird,\u201d said Lissa with her Sage body. \u201cMiriel might\u2019ve been onto something when she said that some people could adapt to their new bodies faster than others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExperience might also have something to do with it,\u201d said Maribelle. \u201cAfter all, the longer you have a new form or ability, the more practice you will have with using it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess that makes sense,\u201d Lissa said, answering Maribelle with her War Cleric body. \u201cBut, anyway, we\u2019re here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women had arrived at the Shepherd\u2019s Barracks, and Lissa used her Sage body to open the door. Maribelle and Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body walked into the Barracks, and Lissa left her Sage body behind to close the door, then quickly caught up with Maribelle and her War Cleric body. Maribelle led the way through the Barracks to her quarters, and Lissa followed her inside with both her bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s get started,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body as her Sage body shut the door to Maribelle\u2019s room. Lissa put the tomes she was carrying down, then unplugged the potion bottles she was carrying. She put the bottles to her lips, and quickly downed the contents of the two bottles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you\u2019re not wasting any time,\u201d said Maribelle as Lissa drank the potions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa giggled, both of her bodies laughing identically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I really wanted to use these,\u201d Lissa\u2019s Sage body said once she finished drinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, here it comes,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body, wincing in pain and holding her hands out in front of her, while at the same time, her Sage body was clutching at her rear. Maribelle watched in fascination as Lissa\u2019s little fingers twisted and changed size, tearing through the gloves Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body was wearing as they were reshaped into thumbs at the bottom of her hands. Meanwhile, there was a ripping sound as the tail on Lissa\u2019s Sage body grew, and long blonde hair began to grow from the tail, trailing down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body, opening and closing her hands, watching as her new thumbs moved on her altered hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill not used to feeling pain in one body and not the other,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body, experimentally swishing her tail back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEspecially since I had pain in this body\u2019s hands, while at the same time, there was pain in my other body\u2019s butt,\u201d Lissa continued with her War Cleric body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat said, my new thumbs and tail really make it easier to tell which body is which,\u201d Lissa finished with her Sage body. \u201cI was having a bit of trouble telling my bodies apart when they were both the same.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d said Maribelle. \u201cYou seemed to have adjusted quite well, all things considered.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I have,\u201d said Lissa with her War Cleric body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just didn\u2019t want to get so used to having two bodies that I forgot which body was which,\u201d she said with her Sage body. \u201cThis way, I\u2019ll always be able to tell that this body is the duplicate, and my other body is the original.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat makes sense,\u201d said Maribelle. \u201cDid you want to use the clothing alteration tome now?\u201d</span></div></div>",

After a few seconds, the gloves on Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body now had three fingers, and a thumb on either side of her hands. Lissa then passed the clothing alteration tome from her War Cleric body to her Sage body, and cast the spell with her Sage body. Lissa\u2019s panties were reshaped slightly, tucking under the base of her tail and repairing the hole that her tail had made when it formed. A slit also appeared at the back of her dress, allowing her tail to poke through the slit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m done,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body, passing the clothing alteration tome back to her War Cleric body. \u201cYour turn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I suppose it is,\u201d said Maribelle as Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body put the tome back down. Maribelle opened the tome in her hands and cast the spell, causing her body to glow blinding white. The white glow soon faded, and Maribelle carefully put the tome down. While she was distracted, Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body snuck up behind Maribelle and grabbed the sides of her head and pulled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d Maribelle cried out as Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body pulled on Maribelle\u2019s head. However, much to Lissa\u2019s surprise, Maribelle\u2019s head remained attached to her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought I told you to ask before you started pulling body parts off,\u201d said Maribelle, looking at Lissa\u2019s Sage body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d said Lissa with her Sage body, looking down shamefully. \u201cSorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut why didn\u2019t your head come off?\u201d Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite simple, darling,\u201d said Maribelle, reaching up and placing her hands on the sides of her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t want my head to come off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle lifted her hands, and her head detached from her neck with a very faint popping noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you can control whether or not your body parts can detach,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body. \u201cThat\u2019s so cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and I\u2019m glad that I won\u2019t suddenly fall apart,\u201d said Maribelle, holding her head in her hands. She slowly turned her head around to look at her neck stump, and saw featureless skin on the top of her neck. Turning her head again, Maribelle walked over to her dresser, and gently lowered her head onto the dresser. She set her head down on the dresser, then turned her head around to face her body. Once her head was on the dresser, Maribelle took a few hesitant steps backwards. She found it incredibly strange, watching herself walking backwards, even though she could still feel her body moving. She could also feel the polished wood that her head was resting on. Maribelle began walking her body around her room, slowly at first, then with more confidence, watching her body walk around with her head resting on her dresser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you\u2019re getting the hang of it,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body. \u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, this is starting to feel much more natural now,\u201d said Maribelle, walking back over to her dresser and picking up her head. She reattached her head to her neck, and rolled her head around a few times to make sure her head had reconnected properly. Maribelle then sat down on her bed, then placed her hands on her hips. She pushed, and her upper body detached from her hips. Maribelle gently lowered her top half onto her bed, then stood her legs up and took a few steps forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is a lot easier than I thought it would be,\u201d said Maribelle. \u201cI guess being taken apart into so many pieces earlier has really helped me to adjust to this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re enjoying yourself now,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body as she walked over to where Maribelle\u2019s upper body was sitting on her bed. Lissa\u2019s Sage body flicked her tail up so she wouldn\u2019t sit on it, then sat down next to Maribelle\u2019s upper body, while Maribelle continued to walk her legs around her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I was wondering,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body. \u201cWhat would happen if I used the detachment tome?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoud it even work?\u201d said Maribelle. \u201cWe know you can use potions and tomes at the same time, but we haven\u2019t tested if you can use more than one tome on yourself at a time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, and I\u2019m already using the duplication tome,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body. \u201cMaybe the detachment tome won\u2019t work properly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr, maybe it will,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body. \u201cAfter all, I am technically using two potions right now, even if I did use them on different bodies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill, this does technically belong to you,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body, picking up the white tome that had given Maribelle her detachment ability. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to try using the detachment tome, just say so.\u201d</span></div></div>",

She placed her hands on her cheeks, then pushed up. Lissa felt a slight bit of resistance, then her Sage body\u2019s head detached from her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt worked!\u201d Lissa\u2019s Sage body said. Lissa walked her War Cleric body over to her Sage body, and used her Sage body to hold her detached head out. Lissa used her War Cleric body to take her Sage body\u2019s detached head, resting her lower thumbs under her Sage body\u2019s chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so weird,\u201d said Lissa with her War Cleric body, holding up her Sage body\u2019s detached head as she looked herselves in the eyes. Meanwhile, Lissa\u2019s headless Sage body reached up, and began running her fingers over the smooth surface of her neck. As she did so, a shiver ran down the spines of both her bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, that felt so good,\u201d Lissa said with her detached Sage head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I wonder if both my bodies can detach parts now,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body. She passed her Sage body\u2019s head from her War Cleric body to her Sage body, and her Sage body took her head. Once her Sage body had her head back, Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body reached up and tugged at her head, gently at first, then with more force. However, the head of her War Cleric body remained firmly attached to her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like the tome only worked on this body,\u201d said Lissa with her Sage body, holding her head in her hands as she stood up, causing her tail to swish from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle had watched silently as Lissa adjusted to her Sage body\u2019s detachable state. She thought back to Lissa\u2019s attempts to mess with her when she had first used the detachment tome, and Maribelle decided it was time for a little payback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lissa\u2019s Sage body stood up, Maribelle walked her legs between Lissa\u2019s bodies, forcing her Sage body to stand still for a few seconds. That allowed Maribelle to reach out and grab the tail on Lissa\u2019s Sage body. As Maribelle felt her hand wrap around the base of Lissa\u2019s tail, she pulled, and with a faint pop, the tail detached from Lissa\u2019s Sage body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Lissa said, speaking in unison with herselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive that back!\u201d Lissa\u2019s Sage body said, holding her head up above her shoulders so that she could see Maribelle, who was now holding the tail from Lissa\u2019s Sage body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, darling,\u201d said Maribelle, running her fingers through the blonde hair of Lissa\u2019s tail. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t resist. But now you know how I felt when you just started pulling body parts off me without asking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess you\u2019re right,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body, looking sheepish. \u201cSorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I have my tail back, please?\u201d Lissa\u2019s Sage body asked, still holding her head up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, dear,\u201d said Maribelle, holding Lissa\u2019s tail out and reattaching it to Lissa\u2019s Sage body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body, lowering her head down and attaching it to her neck. Once her head was attached to her neck, she looked down at her tail. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know that I can detach any extra body parts, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, Lissa, are you aware that your head is on backwards?\u201d Maribelle asked as she walked her legs back to the bed and sat down in front of her upper body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body. \u201cI want to try being like this for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Maribelle as she folded her arms and rested them on the flat surface at the top her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I just had an idea,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body. \u201cWhat would happen if I detached my upper body, then connected my upper body to your hips?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... don\u2019t know,\u201d said Maribelle slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWant to try it?\u201d Lissa asked with her Sage body, looking up at Maribelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose so,\u201d said Maribelle, removing her arms from her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body. She took a few steps, keeping her head on backwards, until she was standing in front of Maribelle. Lissa\u2019s Sage body rested her hands on her hips and pushed, causing her upper body to come off. She then slowly lowered her body down onto Maribelle\u2019s hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere goes,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body as her upper body came into contact with Maribelle\u2019s hips.</span></div></div>",

Lissa then put her Sage body\u2019s hands on Maribelle\u2019s hips and pushed, popping her upper body off Maribelle\u2019s hips.

Once her legs were seated, Maribelle raised herself up and reattached her upper body to her hips, making herself whole once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe know that it\u2019s possible to use multiple tomes safely, and that the tomes will only affect one of your bodies,\u201d Maribelle continued once she was whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot only that, but I can detach my tail,\u201d Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body said, reaching behind her Sage body and detaching her Sage body\u2019s tail. \u201cAnd if I can do this, it probably means that any extra body parts can be detached as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd, given what you\u2019ve learned earlier, that means it\u2019s probably safe to use multiple potions,\u201d said Maribelle. \u201cNot that I have any intention of using the potions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Lissa, speaking with her Sage body as her War Cleric body reattached her Sage body\u2019s tail.

Maribelle felt the tingling sensation of her body parts reconnecting, then turned around and picked up Lissa\u2019s Sage torso. Maribelle placed Lissa\u2019s Sage torso onto her hips, then picked Lissa\u2019s Sage arms and reattached them. Once her arms were in place, Lissa\u2019s Sage body turned around and picked her head up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage head, as her Sage body turned it around to face Maribelle. \u201cBut I\u2019d like to keep my head detached for a little while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said Maribelle as she sat back down on the bed. \u201cPersonally, I\u2019ve found having my upper body disconnected from my hips to be surprisingly enjoyable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body as Maribelle placed her hands on her hips and pushed, causing her upper body to pop off from her hips. \u201cAlthough, I do wonder why I couldn\u2019t connect with your hips.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s some sort of protective measure, to prevent people from getting jumbled up,\u201d said Maribelle as she lowered her upper body onto the bed, then folded her arms and rested them on the smooth surface of her hips. \u201cAfter all, we established earlier that body parts can only be reconnected to where they were originally detached from.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, and when Chrom used the mimicry tome, he had to return to normal before he could mimic someone else,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe also couldn\u2019t mimic the three-legged potion Robin was using when he turned into her,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe also needed to be touching someone in order to mimic them,\u201d said Maribelle. \u201cHe also needed to be touching someone in order to trigger the swapping tome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, and he could only swap one thing, and with only one person at a time,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess whoever designed these potions and tomes really wanted them to be safe,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body as she ran her altered hands through her Sage body\u2019s tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd since it was safe for me to use a second tome, that means it\u2019s probably safe for someone to use two potions on one body,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of which,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body as she let go of her Sage body\u2019s tail. \u201cThat gives me an idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Maribelle asked as she watched Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body picked up the duplication tome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe know that changes made to one body don\u2019t affect the other body,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage head. \u201cBut what if we used the duplication tome after we\u2019d used a potion or another tome?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is a good question,\u201d said Maribelle. \u201cWould the duplicate have the same alterations as the original body, or would the duplicate be normal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we could find out,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body. \u201cAnd by we, I mean you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want me to use the duplication tome?\u201d Maribelle asked. \u201cI...

Or it might just give the detachment ability to my War Cleric body instead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lissa\u2019s Sage head was speaking, she was interrupted by identical growls from her two stomachs, causing her to giggle sheepishly from both her bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr, maybe we could join the other Shepherds for dinner,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</span></div></div>",

The two-headed woman was the centre of attention, and was answering the questions from her fellow Shepherds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how much did growing a second head hurt?\u201d Nowi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, it was very painful,\u201d said Miriel with her left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConversely, the restoration process was painless, though it was somewhat disorienting,\u201d Miriel continued with her right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I consumed a second potion to regrow my right head, the transformation was faster, and the pain was much less intense,\u201d Miriel\u2019s left head concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh,\u201d said Nowi. \u201cThat\u2019s interesting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, your left head is the original head? How can you tell the difference?\u201d asked Stahl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo be honest, I cannot feel any differences between my heads,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI only remember that this head was the original thanks to the notes I recorded earlier,\u201d Miriel\u2019s left head continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy this point, having two heads feels natural to me,\u201d Miriel\u2019s right head concluded. \u201cIn fact, I would go so far as to say that having two heads feels more natural than having one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that why you alternate which head is speaking?\u201d Panne asked. \u201cBecause it feels natural?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrecisely,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head. \u201cWhile I can choose which head to speak from...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd even speak with both heads at once,\u201d said Miriel, her heads speaking in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI find that I tend to alternate between my voices without realising,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head. \u201cAs you said, it is what feels natural.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you say different things with your mouths at the same time?\u201d Vaike asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d \u201cNaturally,\u201d Miriel said, with her left and right heads, respectively. \u201cIt is no challenge.\u201d \u201cIt is not difficult.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d said Vaike. \u201cThat was weird. Cool, but weird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you... I think,\u201d said Miriel with her left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I was not the only one who used the tomes and potions Anna recently acquired,\u201d she continued with her right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaribelle and Lissa have also used them, as you can see,\u201d Miriel\u2019s left head concluded, as she pointed in Maribelle and Lissa\u2019s direction. The other Shepherds turned to look at the two women as they walked up to the table and sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys!\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body as she sat down. \u201cCheck this out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa\u2019s War Cleric body held up her hands, showing the others that she had three fingers, and a thumb on either side of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd take a look at this!\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body, turning around to show the other Shepherds her blonde-haired tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d said Sully, looking between Lissa\u2019s two bodies in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd before you guys ask, no, I\u2019m not two people now,\u201d Lissa said with her War Cleric body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s still just me,\u201d Lissa continued with her Sage body as she sat her Sage body down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI used one of the tomes, and it created a second body for me,\u201d Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo now I\u2019m one person with two bodies,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s really cool,\u201d Lissa said in unison with herselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what about you, Maribelle?\u201d Kellam asked. \u201cYou look normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, please,\u201d said Maribelle. \u201cA lady of my calibre is hardly normal. And as for my alteration, observe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle reached up and placed her hands on her cheeks and pushed. With a barely audible pop, Maribelle\u2019s head detached from her neck, and Maribelle placed her detached head on the table, facing the other Shepherds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow!\u201d said Nowi. \u201cThat\u2019s so cool! Can I pick your head up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but please be gentle,\u201d said Maribelle. \u201cAnd don\u2019t turn me upside down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Nowi, reaching across the table and picking up Maribelle\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaribelle\u2019s not the only one who can do that,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body, as her War Cleric body reached over and pulled off Lissa\u2019s right arm. \u201cTa-da!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you used the detachment tome,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat must mean that it is safe to use multiple tomes, as you are already under the effect of the duplication tome,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, and only my Sage body was affected,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body as she reattached her Sage body\u2019s arm to her Sage body\u2019s shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd Maribelle and I learned that I can\u2019t attach my body parts to Maribelle\u2019s, even though we\u2019re both using the detachment tome,\u201d Lissa\u2019s Sage body said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFascinating,\u201d said Miriel with her right head, which was looking at Lissa and Maribelle, while her left head was looking at the dining hall entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt appears we have another visitor,\u201d Miriel said with her left head, which caused the other Shepherds to turn towards the dining hall and see who had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho entered the dining hall?</span></div></div>",

She also spotted Nowi, Panne, Sully, Stahl, Vaike and Kellam sitting with Miriel, Lissa and Maribelle. All eyes were on Anna as she walked up to the table, having decided to keep her humantaur form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly crow,\u201d said Sully. \u201cYou look like a human centaur.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Lissa\u2019s taken to calling me a humantaur,\u201d said Anna as she walked up to the group. \u201cI wasn\u2019t too keen on it at first, but I guess I\u2019ve gotten used to it. It does make it a bit easier to carry things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was at the table, Anna reached into the saddlebags that were hanging from her taurso, and she started pulling out tomes and potion bottles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre those the strange potions and tomes that caused all this?\u201d Panne asked, looking at the items Anna was placing on the table warily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep,\u201d said Anna as she continued taking potions and tomes out of her saddlebags. \u201cI thought some of you might want to try them, so I brought free samples.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s surprisingly generous of you,\u201d said Stahl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019d only recommend trying something if you intend to keep it,\u201d said Anna, resting a finger on her chin. \u201cIt\u2019ll cost you two hundred gold if you want to go back to normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re saying this stuff ain\u2019t permanent?\u201d Vaike asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Anna. \u201cThere are staves that can remove the effects of the potions and tomes. Problem is, the staves only have ten uses each, and I\u2019ve only got fives staves left.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and that fifth staff has been used five times,\u201d said Maribelle, her head still being held by Nowi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Anna. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to be charging for each use of the staves, at least until I can get some more from my suppliers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill you be getting more potions and tomes from your suppliers?\u201d Nowi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but not for a while,\u201d said Anna. \u201cI just finished taking stock, and it turns out I\u2019ve got seventy two of each kind of potion and tome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMinus the ones that have already been used, of course,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d said Anna. \u201cThe point is, I\u2019ve still got plenty, so I don\u2019t mind giving a few away for free. Besides, if you use them and go around Ylisstol with your new forms, it basically gives me free advertising.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess that makes sense,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d said Anna, clapping her hands together. \u201cWho wants to try something?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Sully leaned her head back and tilted the bottle up, pouring the potion into her mouth. Sully quickly drank it all, then took a few steps back from the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long does it take before... agh!\u201d Sully began, then cried out in pain as the potion kicked in. Pain flared up in Sully\u2019s feet, and quickly moved up her legs. Sully started standing on her toes as her foot started to grow longer, splitting her metal boots open. Sully\u2019s upper legs shortened slightly, and her lower legs became a lot shorter as her ankle was raised up by her elongating foot. Sully\u2019s toes were hidden behind her toenails, which grew and fused together, forming hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSully gasped as the pain in her legs began to subside, and she looked down at her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d said Sully as she leaned over and began running a hand up and down her leg. She slowly lifted her left foot up, then lowered it back to the ground again, hearing her new hoof tapping on the floor. She did the same with her right foot, then took a few slow steps with her new hooves as a grin started to form on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHot damn!\u201d said Sully as she began to walk around with more confidence. \u201cThis is incredible!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what do you know?\u201d said Anna as she started smiling too. \u201cAnother happy customer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what does having hooves feel like?\u201d Stahl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s a bit weird, but I think I\u2019m getting the hang of it,\u201d said Sully as she jumped up and down a few times. \u201cI just gotta remember to walk on my toes, not my whole foot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s something not everyone realises,\u201d said Sully as she knelt down to get a better look at her hooves. \u201cSee, the hooves are actually toes, and this part here is actually my foot,\u201d Sully said as she ran her hand over the body parts in question. \u201cThis bit here, that looks like a backwards knee, is actually my ankle, and this part here is my lower legs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, okay,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body. \u201cThat\u2019s actually pretty cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sully admired her new hooves, Anna picked up the grey tome on the table, and held it out to Sully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere,\u201d said Anna. \u201cYou can use this to turn what\u2019s left of your boots into horseshoes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh,\u201d said Sully, looking at the remains of her boots, which had been ruined when her feet had transformed into hooves. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty neat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSully took the tome from Anna and opened it up. \u201cI\u2019m not really any good at magic, so I don\u2019t know how well this will work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, if Chrom can use the tomes, you shouldn\u2019t have a problem,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFair enough,\u201d Sully said with a laugh, then walked over to her ruined boots. Sully made sure she was standing inside her split boots, then read out the incantation inside the tome. Orange words, written in an ancient language, spiralled around her in circles as the spell was triggered. As the magic took hold, Sully\u2019s pants and armour began to shift. Her shinguards split into two, forming a much shorter shinguard, as well as a footguard for her exposed feet. Ankleguards appeared on the backs of her feet, and Sully\u2019s boots began shrinking under her feet, lining the bottoms of her hooves. Nails formed in the horseshoes, locking them into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d said Sully as she lifted up one of her legs to get a better look at her new horseshoe. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty darn impressive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do you think?\u201d Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to say, I really like these new hooves,\u201d said Sully, lowering her hoof back down to the ground. \u201cI think I\u2019ll stay like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d said Anna. \u201cI\u2019m glad you like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s really surprising how natural this feels,\u201d said Sully as she walked back over to the table and sat down again. \u201cIt feels like I\u2019ve had hooves for my whole life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve found that some people can adapt to their new forms faster than others,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou appear to be one of those who adapts faster,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh,\u201d said Sully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d said Anna. \u201cDoes anyone else want to try something?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Lumps of flesh formed under Vaike\u2019s arms, then pushed out, slowly gaining form as muscles and bones took shape. As Vaike\u2019s new pair of arms reached their full length, hands began to form, with the little fingers at the tops of Vaike\u2019s new hands, and the thumbs at the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw,\u201d Vaike groaned. \u201cYou guys really weren\u2019t kidding about the pain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s not fun,\u201d said Lissa with her War Cleric body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the pain feels the same, no matter which potion you try,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body, her tail swishing back and forth idly. \u201cThe only difference is where you feel the pain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, it looks like you grabbed the right potion after all,\u201d Stahl said, looking over at Vaike. \u201cYou\u2019ve got four arms just like you wanted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeck yeah!\u201d said Vaike, holding his four arms out in front of him. He raised his left arms, then lowered them and raised his right arms. He frowned slightly as he raised all four of his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are my new arms doing the same things as the old ones?\u201d Vaike asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not used to having four arms yet,\u201d said Anna. \u201cKeep moving them around, and you should figure it out in a few minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, okay,\u201d said Vaike as he continued moving his four arms up and down. \u201cYeah, that makes sense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaike continued to wave his arms around, and after a few minutes, he was able to raise his upper arms and keep his lower arms by his sides. Vaike then held his upper right and lower left arms out, and clapped his upper left and lower right hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like your getting it,\u201d said Sully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, can I see your new hands?\u201d Nowi asked as she put Maribelle\u2019s head on the table. \u201cThey look like they\u2019re upside down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing,\u201d said Vaike, folding his upper arms across his chest and holding out his lower arms for Nowi. Maribelle reached over the table and reclaimed her head while Nowi got a good look at Vaike\u2019s new hands. In a sense, Nowi was right about Vaike\u2019s new hands being upside down, as his fingers were arranged in the opposite way to the fingers on his old hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you\u2019ve got your pinkies where your thumbs should be,\u201d said Nowi as she poked Vaike\u2019s new hands. \u201cThen you\u2019ve got your ring fingers, your middle fingers, your pointer fingers and your thumbs. That\u2019s so cool!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, right?\u201d said Vaike, opening and closing his new hands a few times, then he unfolded his upper arms and held them over his lower arms. Vaike brought his upper left and lower left hands together, then brought his upper right and lower right hands together as well. First, he lined the fingers and thumbs of his upper and lower hands up, then he clasped his upper and lower hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so weird, but like, in a good way,\u201d said Vaike. \u201cIt feels like I\u2019m holding someone\u2019s hands, but I\u2019m actually holding my own hands. Whaddya think, Panne?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile I don\u2019t feel entirely comfortable using these myself, I suppose I am glad you\u2019re enjoying this, my mate,\u201d said Panne, smiling slightly in her husband\u2019s direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, thanks,\u201d said Vaike as he sat down next to her, then took his wife\u2019s right hand with both of his left hands. \u201cY\u2019know, if you don\u2019t like it, I can get Anna to restore me tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never said I disliked it,\u201d said Panne. \u201cIt\u2019s simply one of those strange things you man-spawn do that I don\u2019t understand.\u201d She smiled. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m sure I can find advantages to having a four-armed mate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d said Vaike as he blushed. \u201cEr, I mean, yeah, there are totally advantages to the Vaike\u2019s new arms!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Sully\u2019s got hooves, and Vaike has four arms,\u201d said Anna as she picked up the list and ticked off the two potions that had been used thus far. \u201cAnyone else want to try something? Maybe one of the tomes?\u201d</span></div></div>",

He placed his hand flat on the chair, with his palm facing up, and Nowi stepped up onto his hand and sat down in the middle of his palm. Once Nowi was seated in his hand, Stahl slowly lifted his hand up from the chair and placed it on the table. Nowi then stood up and jumped off Stahl\u2019s hand and onto the table, where the others could see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, you\u2019re so cute!\u201d Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Nowi, smiling as she walked across the table to Miriel, who had set her notebook down on the table.

Once she was lying down, Miriel moved the ruler so that one end was at Nowi\u2019s feet, and the other end reached past her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt appears that you are now six inches tall,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head as she picked up the ruler and returned it to her bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d said Nowi as she sat up. \u201cI really am small.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head. Once Miriel had returned the ruler to her bag, she picked up her quill and made another note in her notebook. As Miriel was writing, Nowi stood up and walked to the centre of the table. Once she was in the middle of the table, she sat down again and started growing. In only a few seconds, Nowi shot back up to her normal height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodness,\u201d said Maribelle. \u201cThat was very fast, Nowi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve got the hang of this now,\u201d said Nowi, now at her regular height, sitting cross-legged in the centre of the table. Once she finished growing, Nowi climbed off the table, still completely naked. \u201cI really enjoyed being tiny, but I suppose I\u2019d better see how big I can get.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNowi took a few steps away from the table, then took a few deep breaths and closed her eyes.

Nowi then jumped up and sat on the table, then shrank herself back down to six inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought you\u2019d enjoy being so small,\u201d said Maribelle. \u201cThen again, I never thought I\u2019d enjoy being able to detach my body parts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what you mean,\u201d said Sully. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect having hooves instead of feet to feel so... natural, I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that might have something to do with fact that all of this should be impossible,\u201d said Anna. \u201cWe never knew how much we might enjoy doing this sort of thing, because before now, we\u2019d have never been able to do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat idea may have some merit,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that I have two heads, I have found myself wondering how I ever used to manage with just one,\u201d Miriel continued with her right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever, I do not believe that holds true for every transformation,\u201d said Miriel with her left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor example, despite my natural affinity for the melting tome, and my enjoyment of the ability,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head, melting and reforming one of her hands to prove her point, \u201cIt does not feel as vital to my life as having two heads.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I felt kinda the same about having two bodies,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I had the restoration staff used on me and lost this body, I felt absolutely awful,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven though I\u2019d only had my second body for less than an hour, it felt so much more natural than having just one body,\u201d Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body said. \u201cI mean, yeah, it was a little disorienting at first, but it never felt wrong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt... it almost felt like I was meant to have two bodies,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body. \u201cGoing back to a single body...\u201d Lissa\u2019s voice trailed off as a shiver ran down her spines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust the thought of that makes me feel ill,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLissa, I had no idea you felt that way,\u201d said Maribelle. She reached her hands out, and held onto the right hand of Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body with her left hand, and took the left hand of Lissa\u2019s Sage body in her right hand. \u201cIf I\u2019d known it would make you feel so terrible, I never would have used the restoration staff on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Maribelle,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know, and I don\u2019t think I really knew either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa leaned her bodies in towards Maribelle, and kissed Maribelle on both cheeks simultaneously, causing Maribelle to blush profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, anyway,\u201d said Nowi, speaking up into the slightly awkward silence that followed. \u201cI\u2019m still naked, but I don\u2019t want to grow back to my original size. Do you think that tome that changed Sully\u2019s boots into horseshoes can shrink my clothes too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d said Anna as she picked up the tome in question. \u201cWe\u2019ve only used this on people that have used a potion, not people who\u2019ve used a tome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, let\u2019s find out!\u201d said Nowi, standing up and walking into the centre of the table. \u201cCan you get my clothes for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing,\u201d said Anna, picking up Nowi\u2019s clothes and placing them on the table. Once she\u2019d set down Nowi\u2019s clothes, Anna placed the clothing alteration tome on top the pile and opened it. Nowi climbed over her clothes until she reached the open tome, and made sure she was standing on the pile of clothing while she read out the spell.</span></div></div>",

While she was still wearing her tactician\u2019s robe, she wasn\u2019t wearing the shirt she normally wore under her robe. This left her breasts exposed, but the reason Robin was shirtless soon became apparent. Robin\u2019s exposed breasts no longer had nipples, and she now had mouths were her nipples used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Chrom,\u201d \u201cHey, Robin,\u201d Lissa said, speaking with her War Cleric and Sage bodies simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnna brought free samples for everyone to try out,\u201d Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s been pretty cool, seeing what everyone wants to try,\u201d concluded Lissa\u2019s Sage body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can imagine,\u201d Robin said, speaking with the mouth on her right breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you used the potion you purchased earlier,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, and I\u2019ve also used the elasticity tome,\u201d Robin said with the mouth on her left breast.

How about lipples?\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body. \u201cWay easier to say than lip nipples or breast mouths or whatever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I like lipples,\u201d said Robin, using her original mouth. \u201cI think it fits pretty well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLissa, are you sure you\u2019re still only one person?\u201d asked Chrom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty sure, yeah.\u201d \u201cWhy are you asking?\u201d Lissa said, speaking with her War Cleric and Sage bodies simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you were coming up with names for Robin\u2019s new mouths, it sounded like you were having a conversation between two different people,\u201d said Chrom. \u201cIt also seemed that way a few times when you were talking while we were at Anna\u2019s shop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body, then Lissa turned her heads so she was looking at herselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess I can see why you might think that,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt definitely sounds like it, sometimes,\u201d her Sage body continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do still control both of my bodies, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not two different people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s still just me,\u201d Lissa concluded with her War Cleric body as she turned her heads back to Chrom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that helped your case, darling,\u201d said Maribelle from her seat between Lissa\u2019s two bodies. \u201cThat sounded even more like a conversation than the last time you spoke between yourselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I\u2019m just alternating what I say between my bodies,\u201d Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike Miriel does with her two heads, or Robin does with her lipples,\u201d Lissa\u2019s Sage body concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s got a point, Chrom,\u201d Robin said with her left lipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLissa, Miriel and I have all been changing which mouth we speak with,\u201d Robin said with her right lipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSometimes we say several sentences with the same mouth, and sometimes we switch mouths every sentence,\u201d Robin\u2019s left lipple said. \u201cGuess it just depends on what feels most natural for what we\u2019re trying to say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe that Robin\u2019s words have merit,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head. \u201cFrom personal experience, I know I prefer to alternate which head I speak with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd Robin is correct about the number of sentences we say with each mouth,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head. \u201cI believe that we fully articulate our current idea with one mouth, then switch to the other. This occurs regardless of how many sentences it takes to fully articulate that idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Robin\u2019s left lipple. \u201cIf I can say something in a single sentence with one mouth, I will. But if I can\u2019t...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t switch mouths until I finish expressing my idea,\u201d said Robin\u2019s right lipple. \u201cUnless I consciously choose to change which mouth I\u2019m speaking with, like I did just now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can also say a sentence with both lipples simultaneously,\u201d Robin said with both of her lipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSometimes I\u2019ll say two different sentences, but they\u2019ll both have the same meaning,\u201d Robin said with her original mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnow what I mean?\u201d \u201cDoes that make sense?\u201d Robin said with her left and right lipples, respectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm... I guess?\u201d said Chrom, looking a bit lost from the constant bouncing back and forth between different mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt makes sense to me,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s something you can only understand if you have two bodies,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body. \u201cOr two heads, or three mouths.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, it is pretty obvious that Robin\u2019s one person with three mouths,\u201d said Stahl. \u201cBut it\u2019s not as obvious that Lissa\u2019s a single person with two bodies, or that Miriel\u2019s one person with two heads.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe that\u2019s just a point of view thing, y\u2019know?\u201d said Vaike, shrugging his lower shoulders. \u201cI mean, I look at Lissa and I think I\u2019m looking at a pair of twins, not a single person. Anyone else feel like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that my mate speaks wisdom,\u201d said Panne. \u201cFor once.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Vaike. \u201cHey, whadaya mean, for once? Teach has spoken plenty of wisdom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanne chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m sure you have,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, hey, that reminds me,\u201d said Nowi, who was still six inches tall and sitting on the cover of the clothing alteration tome. \u201cChrom, what sort of changes did you make to yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I did decide to keep the effects of the swapping tome I used when we were testing everything,\u201d said Chrom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA swapping tome?\u201d said Nowi. \u201cLet\u2019s see how it works!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s not get too hasty,\u201d said Anna. \u201cI\u2019ve still got some free samples left, if anyone wants to try one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr maybe we could come up with a way to prove that I\u2019m one person with two bodies,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body.</span></div></div>",

Chrom closed his eyes and concentrated, and Nowi felt a tingling sensation in her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Nowi asked, then gasped at the sound of Chrom\u2019s voice coming out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI swapped our voices,\u201d said Chrom, speaking with Nowi\u2019s higher voice. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNowi started giggling, and it was rather strange, hearing Chrom\u2019s voice giggling like Nowi. \u201cI think it\u2019s amazing! Let\u2019s swap something else!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, but I have to undo the voice swap first,\u201d said Chrom with Nowi\u2019s voice. \u201cI can only swap one thing at a time, and I can only swap with one person at a time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww,\u201d said Nowi. \u201cOkay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNowi reached up and grabbed Chrom\u2019s finger again, and she felt a tingling in her throat as Chrom swapped their voices back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that was fun,\u201d said Nowi, her voice back to normal. \u201cGot any other ideas for some swaps?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s one,\u201d said Chrom, and Nowi felt her whole body tingling. She felt her body growing slightly larger as her breasts sucked into her chest, and a bulge formed in her shorts. Her ears became short and round, and her hair grew shorter and turned blue. Meanwhile, Chrom grew a little shorter as a pair of breasts popped out onto his chest. His hair grew longer and changed to green, and his ears grew into long points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think about this one?\u201d said Chrom, who now had Nowi\u2019s body, while Nowi had Chrom\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou swapped our whole bodies?\u201d Nowi asked as she began running her hands over Chrom\u2019s body. \u201cThat\u2019s incredible!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Chrom. \u201cYou now have my body, and I have yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so weird,\u201d said Nowi. \u201cAnd my clothes still fit perfectly, even though I\u2019m a little taller... and a lot more male.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve noticed that too,\u201d said Chrom. \u201cI did a little testing with Robin earlier, and I can\u2019t actually swap clothing. However, when I did swap something, our clothes would automatically adjust to our new body parts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d said Nowi. \u201cThis swapping tome is really powerful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is, and I think that might be why all these limitations are in place,\u201d said Chrom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, some of the limitations on the tome\u2019s powers seem to exist to ensure the user\u2019s safety,\u201d said Miriel with her left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cObviously, whoever made these things wanted us to be safe when we were using them,\u201d said Lissa with her Sage body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess that makes sense,\u201d said Nowi. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m ready to swap back now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom held out his finger for Nowi, and she grabbed it. Chrom then reversed the swap, giving Nowi her body back while he got his own body back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it was fun having your body, but it\u2019s nice to be myself again,\u201d said Nowi as she sat back down on the clothing alteration tome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what you mean,\u201d said Chrom. \u201cEspecially since I had some difficulty controlling the abilities I got from the tomes when we were testing them earlier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did fine, love,\u201d Robin said with her right lipple as she stretched her neck and kissed Chrom on the cheek with her original mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Chrom with a smile as he took his wife\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, does anyone else want a free sample?\u201d Anna asked. \u201cPanne? Stahl? Do either of you want to try something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna was interrupted by the sound of a throat being cleared, causing her to jump in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you forget I was here again?\u201d Kellam asked as everyone looked at him in surprise. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Kellam! N-no, of course I didn\u2019t forget about you,\u201d said Anna. \u201cAnyway, did you want to try something?\u201d</span></div></div>",

On the cover of the black tome was a stick figure that was surrounded by a dotted outline. \u201cThis is the one that allows you to turn into other people, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019ll give you the perfect disguise,\u201d Anna said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see how it works, then,\u201d said Gaius as he opened up the tome. He read out the incantation, his body glowed brightly as orange words spiralled around him. The glow soon faded, and Gaius put the tome down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, now I just have to touch somebody, right?\u201d Gaius asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Chrom. \u201cYou need to be touching someone in order to mimic them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Gaius. He reached out, and poked Miriel, who happened to be the closest person to him. Gaius felt a surge of energy as he touched Miriel, and he felt his body shifting as he transformed. He could feel his chest and hips pushing out as he felt a pulling sensation at his waist and in his groin. His clothes changed as well, turning into a copy of Miriel\u2019s outfit as a hat and a pair of glasses appeared on his head. However, Gaius only had one head, as opposed to Miriel\u2019s two heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs we discovered earlier, the mimicry tome does not allow the user to imitate the effects of another potion or tome,\u201d Miriel said with her with her left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow curious,\u201d said Gaius. \u201cYou can hardly call this a perfect disguise if it cannot mimic those effects.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head. \u201cIt appears that users of the mimicry tome can only copy someone\u2019s base form. It may be a method of protecting the user, similar to the restrictions that apply to using the swapping tome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is a reasonable hypothesis,\u201d said Gaius, reaching up and adjusting his new glasses, moving in much the same way that Miriel normally did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou also appear to be emulating my behaviour as well,\u201d said Miriel with her left head, as she adjusted the glasses on her right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I noticed that as well,\u201d said Gaius. \u201cIt appears that part of this perfect disguise involves adopting the mannerisms of the person being mimicked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it would seem,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head. \u201cI shall make a note of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Gaius. His body and clothes shifted again, and he was himself once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, that was weird,\u201d Gaius said as he shook his head. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting to start acting like you, Specs. Sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt does not bother me,\u201d said Miriel with her left head. \u201cIt is an interesting aspect of the mimicry tome, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess,\u201d said Gaius. \u201cI wonder...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaius then reached out and placed his hand on Tharja\u2019s shoulder, who was also nearby. Gaius\u2019 body and clothing changed again, this time taking Tharja\u2019s appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you wanted to look like me, you could\u2019ve asked,\u201d Tharja said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow where\u2019s the fun in that?\u201d Gaius asked as his shoulders hunched over, and he hugged the mimicry tome close to his now very large breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja chuckled darkly, and Gaius also began chuckling, and the two sounded identical to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, that\u2019s creepy,\u201d said Nowi, who was still six inches tall and seated on the tabletop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Lissa muttered with both of her bodies as she briefly looked between herselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I think I\u2019ll stay like this,\u201d said Gaius as he sat down. \u201cAt least for now. If you don\u2019t mind, that is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose... if you\u2019re willing to do a favour for me,\u201d said Tharja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaius chuckled again. \u201cThat depends on the favour, Sunshine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need you to acquire some ingredients for my hexes,\u201d said Tharja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll need payment up front,\u201d said Gaius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja sighed, and pulled out a bag of candies, which she placed in front of Gaius. \u201cI trust this will suffice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will indeed,\u201d said Gaius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFascinating,\u201d said Miriel with her right head. \u201cYou are emulating Tharja\u2019s mannerisms and speech patterns, yet you are still acting in a way that is distinctly yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI may be acting differently, but I still feel like myself,\u201d said Gaius, shrugging slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d Miriel said with her left head as she made jotted down another note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, anyway,\u201d said Anna, getting everyone else\u2019s attention. \u201cI\u2019ve still got eight tomes and eight potions to give away as samples, if anyone\u2019s interested.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ve also got a clothing alteration tome, but that\u2019s really only necessary if you use the potions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Tharja as she looked over the tomes. \u201cIn that case, I think I\u2019ll pick this one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja picked up a tome with a dark blue cover that depicted the empty outline of a stick figure. She immediately opened the tome and cast the spell, causing her body to glow brightly.

Tharja then made her feet visible, while leaving the rest of her legs invisible. She then finished by making her body visible. With her neck, arms and legs still invisible, Tharja\u2019s head, hands and feet looked like they were completely detached from her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow!\u201d said the six inch tall Nowi. \u201cThat\u2019s actually a pretty cool look, Tharja.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt certainly makes it easier to tell us apart,\u201d said Gaius, who was still mimicking Tharja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm,\u201d said Tharja, who was examining her invisible left arm. \u201cThat\u2019s unexpected.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Miriel\u2019s left head asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy arms and legs are invisible, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Tharja asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is correct,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see no trace of your arms, your legs, or your neck,\u201d Miriel\u2019s left head continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d said Tharja. \u201cBecause I can still see my arms and legs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d asked Miriel with her left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Tharja. \u201cI can almost see what looks like an outline of my arm whenever I move it. It\u2019s faint, but it is there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head. \u201cI can see no such outline, with either of my heads.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, and I didn\u2019t notice anything like that when I was invisible,\u201d said Chrom. \u201cMind you, I was more worried about becoming visible again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou also weren\u2019t invisible for very long,\u201d said Robin with her original mouth. \u201cThat might\u2019ve had something to do with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could be right,\u201d said Chrom. \u201cSo, Tharja, how do you feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I might enjoy being invisible,\u201d said Tharja as her head, body, hands and feet faded from view, leaving Tharja completely invisible. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad the tome didn\u2019t make my clothing invisible, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the clothing alteration tome might do the trick,\u201d said Anna. \u201cNowi was able to use that tome and shrink her clothes to fit her current height.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but they only fit my current height,\u201d said Nowi. \u201cIf I try to grow again, my clothes stay the same size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNowi then demonstrated what she meant by growing an inch in height, causing her clothing to painfully dig into her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee what I mean?\u201d Nowi said as she shrunk back down to six inches. \u201cIf you use that tome while you\u2019re invisible, you\u2019re clothes will become invisible. But if you then go visible, your clothes will still be invisible. You\u2019d look like you were naked, even though you\u2019re fully dressed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm,\u201d said Tharja as she thought, the sleeves of her body stocking moving as she crossed her arms.</span></div></div>",

After a few seconds, Tharja put Nowi down on the desk, then picked  up the tome in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could\u2019ve just asked me to move,\u201d said Nowi. \u201cI would\u2019ve gotten of the tome for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis was faster,\u201d Tharja said as she opened the clothing alteration tome and cast the incantation. Once the spell was cast, Tharja\u2019s clothing soon faded from view, leaving her completely invisible. The only sign that Tharja was still present was the clothing alteration tome, which was still visible. The grey tome appeared to be floating in the air as Tharja closed the tome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, it did make my clothes invisible,\u201d said Tharja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is correct,\u201d said Miriel with her left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoth your body and your clothing can no longer be seen,\u201d Miriel continued with her right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIncidentally, are you still able to see your clothing?\u201d Miriel\u2019s left head asked. \u201cYou did mention that you could see yourself while you were invisible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, I can see myself,\u201d said Tharja. \u201cAnd I can also see my clothing.

Tharja\u2019s body then faded into view as she made herself visible. However, since her clothing was invisible, she appeared to be naked. Tharja\u2019s breasts were obviously being held up by her invisible brassiere, and she appeared to be standing on her tiptoes, thanks to her heeled shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm,\u201d said Tharja as she looked over her apparently naked body. \u201cEven though I\u2019m visible, I can still see that faint outline around my clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, none of us can see that outline,\u201d said Chrom, carefully keeping his gaze away from Tharja\u2019s naked breasts. \u201cTo us, you just appear to be naked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is true,\u201d said Tharja. \u201cBut that can be fixed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja made her nipples invisible, causing her breasts to appear like featureless mounds.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After reading through the list for a few minutes, Sumia gave the piece of paper back to Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Sumia said. \u201cI want to try out one of the potions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing,\u201d said Anna as she took the piece of paper from Sumia, then walked over to the potions and tomes. \u201cWhich one did you want to try?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want the one that can give me extra eyes,\u201d said Sumia. \u201cMaybe if I can see what\u2019s around me, I\u2019ll be less likely to trip on something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd, you know that the transformations caused by the potions are pretty painful, right?\u201d Anna said as she picked up a pink bottle that contained a light purple potion. \u201cAre you sure you want to try this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia hesitated for a second, then nodded. \u201cYes, I\u2019m sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then,\u201d said Anna as she walked back over to Sumia and held out the potion. \u201cHere you go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Sumia. She pulled the stopper out, then held the bottle up to her lips. She carefully drank the entire potion, then placed the empty bottle back on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long does it take before... augh!\u201d Sumia cried out, clutching the sides of her head as she squeezed her eyes shut from the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d said Anna, resting a hand on Sumia\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019ll only be for about a minute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia tried to nod, but it was too painful for her to move her head. But, just like Anna said, after about a minute, the pain began to subside. Once the pain in her head was gone, Sumia lifted her head up, then opened her eyes, all nine of them. The expanded field of view immediately made Sumia feel dizzy, and she grabbed at the table to steady herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d said Sumia, as all of her eyes started looking around wildly, which wasn\u2019t helping her dizziness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust stay calm,\u201d Robin said, and Sumia could see Robin behind her and to the right, sitting at another table. \u201cSince you\u2019re not used to having so many eyes, just try looking straight ahead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-okay,\u201d said Sumia, as she tried to focus on just looking straight with each of her eyes. Her vision soon stabilised, allowing Sumia to better understand just how much she could see. Sumia could see in a full circle around her head, and could even see straight up. Her left and right fields of view seemed normal, but everything behind and above her seemed a bit flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Sumia said again, with a bit more confidence. Sumia blinked all of her eyes a few times, then slowly raised her hands and began feeling her head to find her new eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should have an eye on each cheek, an eye on each temple, an eye in the centre of your forehead, an eye on top of your head, and an eye on the back of your head,\u201d said Robin, and Sumia could see that Robin was speaking with her left lipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d said Sumia as she felt the places Robin had mentioned. \u201cSo, I\u2019ve got... seven new eyes, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Robin with her right lipple. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel really weird,\u201d said Sumia, as she looked to her left with all of her eyes, then looked to her right. \u201cAnd some of my hair is getting in the way of my new eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia reached up and pulled the locks of hair on the side of her head back, moving her hair out of the way of her cheek and temple eyes. She then reached around to the back of her head and parted her hair away from her back eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I might be getting the hang of this,\u201d said Sumia. \u201cBut my vision still seems a bit weird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow so?\u201d Miriel\u2019s left head asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, everything to my left and right seems normal,\u201d said Sumia. \u201cBut everything in front of me seems a bit sharper, and everything behind and above me looks a bit flat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Miriel with her right head. \u201cThe flatness of your upper and rear vision may be due to a lack of depth perception.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith only a single eye in those locations, it may be difficult to judge how far away something is if it is behind or above you,\u201d Miriel\u2019s left head continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConversely, the eye in your forehead may be enhancing your forward depth perception,\u201d Miriel\u2019s right head concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Sumia, nodding slightly. \u201cSo, because I have two eyes on the sides of my head, does that mean I have depth perception to my left and right sides, too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is a reasonable assumption, yes,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how are you feeling?\u201d Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... I\u2019m not sure,\u201d said Sumia. \u201cI can\u2019t decide if I want to keep these new eyes or not...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I do have a restoration staff available, if you really don\u2019t want to keep the new eyes,\u201d said Anna. \u201cIt will cost you two hundred gold to use it, though.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I mean, look at me,\u201d said Anna, gesturing at her taurso and her rear pair of hips. \u201cI wasn\u2019t exactly happy with being a humantaur at first, but I got used to it pretty quickly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, do you like being a humantaur now?\u201d Sumia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that I\u2019ve gotten used to it, yeah,\u201d said Anna. \u201cIt helps if you just relax and do what comes naturally with your new form.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d said Sumia, nodding. She slowly turned her head left and right, getting used to her much larger field of view. Since she could see in every direction around her, turning her head didn\u2019t allow Sumia to see anything new. Instead, it seemed like the world was moving around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Sumia,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body as she stood up and walked over to Sumia\u2019s left. \u201cCan you see me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can,\u201d said Sumia, as she focused her left cheek and temple eyes on Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body, while she also focused her right cheek and temple eyes on Lissa\u2019s Sage body, which was walking over to Sumia\u2019s right. \u201cI can also see your other body, over to my right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, now, how many fingers am I holding up with each hand?\u201d Lissa\u2019s Sage body asked, as she raised all four of her hands and held up a different number of fingers on each hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia paused for a second as she counted the number of fingers Lissa was holding up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Ten,\u201d Sumia said. \u201cThree with your left hand and two with your right hand with your War Cleric body, and one with your left hand and four with your right hand with your Sage body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you got it,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body as she lowered her hands. \u201cLooks like you\u2019re getting the hang of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa then walked her bodies back over to the table she had been sitting at, and she sat down on either side of Maribelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you could try walking around for a bit,\u201d said Robin. \u201cI know I didn\u2019t feel comfortable walking when I first tried the multi-eye potion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll give it a go,\u201d said Sumia as she slowly stood up. \u201cI just hope I don\u2019t trip.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust try doing a lap around the dining hall first,\u201d said Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia nodded, then carefully made her way towards the nearest wall. She made it to the edge of the dining hall without tripping, and placed her hands against the wall to steady herself. Leaving her left hand on the wall to steady herself, Sumia slowly began walking along the wall. As she walked, Sumia found it was becoming easier for her to tell what each of her new eyes was seeing. She also started getting better control over where she wanted her new eyes to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019m starting to adjust properly,\u201d said Sumia as she lowered her hand from the wall and continued her lap around the dining hall. She focused on closing the eye on the top of her head, and was able to close that eye while still keeping her other eight eyes open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear,\u201d said Chrom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Sumia as she looked at Chrom with her right eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I take it you\u2019re going to keep the extra eyes?\u201d Robin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d said Sumia as she finished her lap around the dining hall. \u201cIt\u2019s still very weird, being able to see in every direction, but I really do feel like I\u2019m a bit less clumsy now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she finished making her way around the dining hall, Sumia made her way back to her table and sat down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, now that Sumia\u2019s adjusted to her extra eyes, does anyone else want to try something?\u201d Anna asked. \u201cI\u2019ve got a two heads potion, a humantaur potion, a three legs potions, a two thumbs potion, a six fingers and toes potion, a lipples potion, and a tail potion. I\u2019ve also got a duplication tome, a detachment tome, an elasticity tome, an intangibility tome, a melting tome, and a swapping tome.\u201d</span></div></div>",

It wasn\u2019t long before the two reached a decision, and they both picked out their samples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGregor will be trying this one,\u201d Gregor said as he picked up a light blue bottle that contained a light green potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll try this,\u201d said Cordelia as she picked up a tome with a light green cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe humantaur potion and the duplication tome, huh?\u201d said Anna. \u201cInteresting combination.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought so too,\u201d said Cordelia as she examined the duplication tome in her hands. \u201cBeing a single person with two bodies... I\u2019m still struggling to wrap my head around that idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll get used to it really quickly,\u201d said Lissa with her Sage body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know I did,\u201d she continued with her War Cleric body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going back to just one body,\u201d Lissa concluded with her Sage body, as her Sage body\u2019s tail flicked back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd personally, I think the humantaur potion\u2019s a good choice,\u201d said Anna, winking at Gregor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Gregor is thinking it will be making carrying things much easier,\u201d Gregor said. \u201cAnd Gregor is also liking look of humantaur Anna. Is very unique, makes her stand out from sisters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, thanks,\u201d said Anna as she blushed. \u201cI really appreciate that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I think we\u2019ve put this off long enough,\u201d Cordelia said as she began opening the duplication tome. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGregor is very ready,\u201d said Gregor as he uncorked the potion bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen, here goes,\u201d said Cordelia. She then began to read out the incantation in the tome as Gregor quickly drank the potion. Once she finished casting the spell, Cordelia\u2019s body began glowing white. Gregor winced in pain as he grabbed the edge of the table to steady himself, and the light coming from Cordelia\u2019s body grew brighter and brighter. Soon, Cordelia\u2019s glow was blinding, hiding both her and her husband\u2019s transformations. Once the light faded, the changes were complete. Gregor now had a second torso stretching out behind him, ending in a second pair of hips. Gregor\u2019s new back legs were naked, as his new humantaur body had torn through the seat of his pants. Meanwhile, Cordelia\u2019s mouths were hanging open as she stared at herselves. Her new body was completely naked, and was standing a few steps in front of her original body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy goodness,\u201d Cordelia said, speaking in unison with herselves. \u201cThis is incredible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia stepped toward herselves, raising her right hands. Her original body\u2019s right hand touched her new body\u2019s left cheek, and the movement was perfectly mirrored by her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOy,\u201d said Gregor, still gripping onto the table. \u201cGregor was not expecting such painful changes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Gregor lifted his left feet up, then set them down and raised his right feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia turned her original body\u2019s head to look at Gregor, which caused her new body\u2019s head to look in the opposite direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, wow,\u201d Cordelia said in unison as she turned her heads again, looking away with her original body\u2019s head while she looked at Gregor with her new body\u2019s head. \u201cYou look amazing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMany thanks,\u201d said Gregor as he looked over his shoulder at his new humantaur body, then looked over at Cordelia. \u201cCordelia is also looking wonderful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, stop,\u201d Cordelia said in unison as she began to blush. \u201cI\u2019m actually having a hard time telling the difference between my two bodies. Whenever I try to move one body, the other does exactly the same thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she spoke, Cordelia turned her heads so that she was looking at herselves again. She then used her left arms to cover her breasts, while she hid her crotches with her right hands. Cordelia\u2019s bodies were perfectly synchronised, and her bodies were almost like mirror images.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I had the same problem when I first used the duplication tome,\u201d said Lissa with her War Cleric body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiriel ended up putting a blindfold on my original body, and held me still while I dressed myself with my second body,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t have any clothes for Cordelia to dress herself in,\u201d Anna said. \u201cNowi, can you stand up for a second?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing,\u201d said the six inch tall Nowi. The tiny manakete stood up, allowing Anna to pick up the clothing alteration tome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGregor, on the other hand, can use this to cover himself up,\u201d said Anna as she gave Gregor the clothing alteration tome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Gregor as he took the tome. \u201cNow, let us be seeing...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregor cast the spell contained within the tome, and his torn clothing began to mend itself. New fabric began forming over Gregor\u2019s humantaur body as a pair of pants covered up his new legs, and boots appeared on his rear feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I guess I\u2019m stuck like this,\u201d said Cordelia in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe not,\u201d said Sumia, watching Cordelia with her left eyes. \u201cI could go and get some of your clothes for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, there might be another way,\u201d said Robin with her original mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Miriel asked with her left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you know how everyone who uses a tome has complete control over their new form?\u201d Robin said with her left lipple, stretching her arms out to demonstrate her point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe never actually tested if that was possible with the duplication tome,\u201d Robin said with her right lipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head. \u201cYou believe it may be possible for Cordelia and Lissa to control the number of duplicates they have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Robin said with all three mouths as she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt makes as much sense as anything else,\u201d said Cordelia in unison with herselves. \u201cI\u2019ll see if I can make my second body disappear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia looked herselves in the eyes again, which she found to be incredibly soothing. She then closed both pairs of eyes and concentrated on returning to being a single person.</span></div></div>",

When the light faded, Cordelia\u2019s second body was gone, leaving only her original body. After a few seconds, Cordelia opened her eyes and looked around quickly. When she saw no sign of her second body, she sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s so much better,\u201d said Cordelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, it is possible for the duplicate body to be reintegrated into the original,\u201d said Miriel with her left head as she wrote a few more notes. \u201cHow fascinating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder how using extra potions and tomes would affect the reintegration,\u201d Miriel continued with her right head. \u201cWould the original body gain any alterations made to the duplicate? Or would the original body only keep the alterations made when the two bodies were separate?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is also the matter of the number of duplicates that can be created,\u201d Miriel\u2019s left head said. \u201cCan the user create more duplicates of their body? And would these new duplicates retain any additional changes made to the user\u2019s body? Or would any potential new duplicates be copies of the user\u2019s unaltered body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like there\u2019s still plenty of experimenting to do,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I can tell you right now that I\u2019m not being the guinea pig this time,\u201d Lissa\u2019s Sage body said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Robin asked with her left lipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seemed pretty enthusiastic about being the guinea pig before,\u201d she continued with her right lipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m happy with the way I am right now,\u201d Lissa said with her War Cleric body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to have to try and get my bodies like this again,\u201d Lissa\u2019s Sage body said. \u201cIt was hard enough the first time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to help you with your experiments,\u201d Cordelia said. \u201cOr at least, I will be once I\u2019ve gotten used to having two bodies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Cordelia,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour assistance would be appreciated,\u201d Miriel\u2019s left head said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia smiled, and as she did so, her body flashed, and Cordelia\u2019s second body appeared next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Cordelia said in unison with herselves, then frowned. She turned her heads left and right, her two bodies moving in perfect harmony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, not again,\u201d Cordelia groaned in unison, then closed her eyes and concentrated. There was another flash, and Cordelia\u2019s duplicate body disappeared again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeeping myself with just one body is harder than I thought,\u201d said Cordelia. \u201cI have to keep focusing on having a single body. If I lose my focus...\u201d Cordelia trailed off as her body flashed again, causing her duplicate to reappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis happens,\u201d Cordelia said in unison with herselves. There was another flash as Cordelia made her duplicate body disappear yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what you mean,\u201d said Tharja, who appeared to be naked, thanks to her invisible clothing. \u201cI have to focus on staying visible. If I relax my focus for even an instant, I disappear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tharja spoke, her body faded from view, leaving only a floating invisibility tome as the only sign of her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow curious,\u201d said Miriel with her right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do not have to focus on remaining solid any more,\u201d she continued with her left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can choose to switch between my liquid and solid states at any time, without needing to focus to maintain either form,\u201d Miriel\u2019s right head said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps it is simply a matter of experience, or maybe it is a result of my natural affinity for this form,\u201d Miriel concluded with her left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPersonally, I think it\u2019s experience,\u201d said Maribelle. \u201cNow that I have some practice with my detachment ability, I don\u2019t have to focus on detaching or reattaching something. Likewise, I don\u2019t have to focus on keeping my body parts attached to me if I don\u2019t want to detach them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m with Maribelle,\u201d said Sully, tapping one of her hooves on the floor idly. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a potion or a tome, you get used to your new body pretty quickly, but only if you take the time to practice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of new bodies, does anyone else want to try something?\u201d Anna asked. \u201cI\u2019ve still got six potions and five tomes that haven\u2019t been tried yet.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Once she finished loading her saddlebags, Anna sat down on one of the benches. Anna sat her rear hips down on an angle, so that her taurso was also resting on the bench.

Nowi only ate a tiny portion of her meal, due to being only six inches tall. Robin used her lipples to eat while she talked to Miriel with her original mouth. For her part, Miriel fed herself with her left head, and used her right head to converse with Robin. Vaike wrapped his upper left arm around Panne\u2019s shoulders, while he used his two lower arms to eat his dinner and held his drink in his upper right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a few hours of eating, talking and showing off, dinner came to an end.

On her way back, she picked up a large wooden bucket from a nearby storeroom, and carried it back to her quarters. When she entered her room, she set the bucket down next to her bed, then walked over to her desk. Miriel sat down as she opened up her notebook, and began reading through the information she had written down. It was still hard to believe what she had seen and experienced, even now. The strange potions and tomes Anna had received were capable of incredible feats of magic. However, thus far, Miriel had only observed the effects of the potions and tomes. She still had no idea how the magic in the potions and tomes worked, but she was eager to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiriel slowly read through the notes she had written, using both of her heads to read her writing. Her first notes were about how Miriel had adjusted to having two heads, followed by how Lissa and Anna had adjusted to their own changes. Next was Maribelle\u2019s experiences, followed by what she had learned when Chrom and Robin were testing the remaining potions and tomes. The final section consisted of what she had learned by observing the other Shepherds when they had tried the samples Anna had brought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she went through her notes, Miriel opened a second notebook. Using her left head to read from the first notebook, Miriel used her right head to watch her writing as she noted down the current forms and alterations that had been made. Miriel herself had two heads, and the ability to melt herself into a liquid form. Lissa had created a duplicate body for herself, and had promoted her original body to War Cleric while her duplicate body was now a Sage. Additionally, Lissa\u2019s original body had altered hands, with thumbs replacing her little fingers, and her Sage body now had a horse\u2019s tail and the ability to detach body parts. Anna had been transformed into what Lissa had dubbed a \u2018humantaur\u2019, with a second pair of hips and legs having grown out of her rear. Maribelle had the ability to detach and reattach her body parts at will. Chrom had the ability to swap something between himself and another person. Robin had the ability to elongate and bend seemingly any part of her body, and she had also turned her nipples into mouths, which Lissa had recently dubbed \u2018lipples\u2019. Sully now had hooves in place of her feet. Vaike had grown a second pair of arms. Nowi had gained the ability to grow and shrink, and appeared to prefer being at her minimum height of six inches tall. Gaius had gained the ability to mimic the appearance, clothing and mannerisms of anyone he touched, and he had last been seen mimicking Tharja. Meanwhile, Tharja herself now had the ability to turn invisible, and had also rendered her clothing invisible, thanks to the clothing alteration tome. Sumia had seven additional eyes on her head, with one eye on each cheek, one on each temple, one in the centre of her forehead, one on top of her head, and one in the back of her head. Gregor had also become a humantaur, and Cordelia had also given herself a duplicate body. However, unlike Lissa, who claimed she felt more comfortable in two bodies, Cordelia seemed to struggle with having two bodies, and had returned to having a single body. However, Cordelia had also agreed to participate in further experiments, while Lissa had declined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiriel yawned from both heads simultaneously, and finished the sentence she was writing. She closed her notebooks, and blew out the candle with her right head. Miriel took off both pairs of glasses, and set them down on the desk next to her notebook. With her glasses off, Miriel then began to undress herself and prepare to go to sleep. However, rather than dress herself in her sleepwear, or even get into bed, Miriel instead stood naked in the large bucket she had acquired earlier. While standing in the bucket, Miriel imagined herself transforming into her liquid state. Almost instantly, her body liquefied and splashed into the bucket. Miriel felt her fluid filling the bucket out, ripples spreading across her surface as she settled down. Once the ripples on her surface had stopped, Miriel allowed her mind to drift, and she soon fell asleep. Miriel remained in her liquid form, even while she was fast asleep, with the occasional twitch and ripple spreading across her flesh-coloured liquid as she dreamed.</span></div></div>",

This left her wearing no clothing above the waist, but thanks to her lipples, Robin was still technically decent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I have to tell you,\u201d said Chrom. \u201cWith your new mouths, I think you can tell yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFunny,\u201d Robin said, speaking with both lipples in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t hear you complaining, though,\u201d Robin said with her original mouth as she stretched her arms, causing her arms to grow longer. Robin then lowered her arms, but left them at their new length, causing her arms to coil up on the floor, as if they were boneless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, no,\u201d said Chrom as Robin retracted her arms back to their normal length. \u201cI actually like the... what did Lissa call them? Lipples?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right,\u201d said Robin with her left lipple as she turned toward Chrom and walked up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you like them so much, you could try them yourself,\u201d Robin\u2019s right lipple said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe do a little swap?\u201d Robin asked with her original mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom laughed. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not interested in trying them myself. I like them better on you. However, I do have a swap in mind...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom held out his hands, and Robin placed her hands in his. He then made the swap he had in mind, and he felt his chest puffing out as breasts formed under his shirt. He could also feel his waist sucking in a bit, and he felt a pulling sensation in his groin. Meanwhile, Robin\u2019s chest flattened, causing her lipples to lie flat on her chest. He could also see Robin\u2019s shoulders grow broader, while a bulge formed between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had no idea you wanted to be a woman so badly,\u201d said Robin with her left lipple, her voice now deep and masculine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Chrom asked in his new feminine voice. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to be a woman. I might have a female body now, but I\u2019m still a man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I was just teasing,\u201d said Robin with her right lipple as she reached up and began slowly pulling Chrom\u2019s shirt up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust like you are now?\u201d Chrom asked as he gently tugged at his wife\u2019s pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe?\u201d Robin said with her original mouth, with a smirk on both lipples. She stretched her neck forward and kissed Chrom on the lips, then retracted her neck and took a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t mind having sex as a man,\u201d Robin said with her right lipple as she sat down on the bed and pulled off her boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re okay with that, I mean,\u201d she said with her left lipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you think I made the swap in the first place?\u201d Chrom asked as he pulled his shirt off, exposing his new breasts. With his shirt off, Chrom took his own boots off, then walked over to his wife and gave her a gentle push on the shoulder. Robin laughed as she let herself fall backwards while Chrom straddled her. Chrom leaned his head down and kissed her mouth, and Robin stretched her arms down to his waist and began pulling his pants down. As they kissed, Robin arched her back slightly, allowing her lipples to reach Chrom\u2019s breasts. As she pulled his pants down, Robin began using her lipples to kiss and tease Chrom\u2019s new feminine nipples, causing him to moan in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh,\u201d said Robin between kisses. \u201cSounds like someone enjoyed that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re certainly not wrong,\u201d Chrom said as he began to pull Robin\u2019s pants down as well. \u201cBut I think that someone else might enjoy taking this a bit farther.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike you said,\u201d said Robin as Chrom finished pulling her pants down. \u201cYou\u2019re certainly not wrong.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lucina sighed as she looked out the window. She was staying at an inn on the outskirts of Ylisstol, and she could see the Palace in the distance. Her mother and father were most likely there right now. Lucina hated hiding away from them, hiding the truth about herself. She wanted to go over there right now and tell Chrom and Robin everything, but her worries stopped her. How would they react if she told them? What would they say when they learned she was actually their daughter from the future? Her chest ached with a familiar pain, the pain of losing her parents, then seeing them alive and well, young enough to be her siblings...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina shook her head and closed the window, drawing the blinds closed so she could have some privacy. With the window closed, she walked over to the door and locked it. With her room secure, Lucina flopped backwards onto the bed and relaxed, letting her arms and legs hang over the edges of the bed. As she let her focus slip, her arms and legs began stretching, reaching farther than humanly possible. Her arms and legs began to pile up in coils as she stretched herself out. Lucina always enjoyed stretching her arms and legs out like this, but she\u2019d never found an upper limit to how much she could elongate herself before she injured herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a minute of stretching, Lucina retracted her arms and legs. Her hands and feet lifted up from the floor as Lucina\u2019s limbs returned to their normal length, and she sat up. She then pulled her shirt off, leaving her in her bra. The cups of her bra had far more padding than normal, but that was mostly because her breasts weren\u2019t exactly normal. Lucina stretched her arms behind her back and took off her bra, and breathed in deeply through both of her lipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s better,\u201d Lucina said to herself, her lipples speaking in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her lipples free, Lucina walked over to the mirror and examined her reflection. She hated having to hide her body like this. However, until Anna received the potions and tomes that caused this, it was still absolutely necessary. Lucina herself had never actually drank the potion that had given her lipples, nor had she used the tomes that had given her swapping and elasticity powers. Lucina had inherited her lipples and her elasticity powers from her father, Robin, and had also inherited her swapping ability from her mother, Chrom. In fact, that swapping ability was the reason Chrom was her mother, despite the fact that he was a man. Apparently, he had swapped genders with Robin, making himself female and Robin male. Chrom had then gotten pregnant while he had a female body, and had been unable to swap back while he was pregnant. Once Lucina was born, Chrom had immediately swapped back with Robin, making himself male again. However, Lucina considered him her mother, as Chrom had been the one to give birth to her, despite being a man. In fact, while Chrom was Lucina\u2019s mother, he was also the father of her younger brother, Morgan, and her father, Robin, was Morgan\u2019s mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina sighed again, and began putting her bra back on, hiding her lipples. Nobody understood why she\u2019d inherited the alterations her parents had made to themselves, especially since those changes had been brought about by magic. However, that never really mattered to her. She had inherited the changes her parents had made to themselves, as had her friends. Strangely, the potions and tomes that had caused the alterations to her parents instead reversed them when she and her friends used them. Her mother, Chrom had used a tome to give himself swapping powers, but when Lucina had used the same tome, she had lost her swapping power. Not only that, but when a restoration staff was used on her, Lucina had regained her swapping power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Lucina had finished putting her shirt back on, she grabbed her Falchion and returned it to the sheath on her hip. Now fully dressed, Lucina headed downstairs to the inn\u2019s dining hall. After all, she didn\u2019t want to miss out on dinner.</span></div></div>",

You\u2019re my closest friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I mean that... ugh,\u201d Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body groaned. \u201cThat\u2019s not how I meant it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Maribelle asked, then cried out in surprise as Lissa\u2019s Sage body pulled her head out of her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLissa! What are you--?!\u201d Maribelle\u2019s detached head began. However, before she could finish, Lissa\u2019s Sage body pulled Maribelle\u2019s head in and kissed her on the lips. Maribelle\u2019s eyes widened in surprise for a second as Lissa pressed her lips against hers.

Oh, yes,\u201d said Panne. \u201cI was just lost in thought.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the arms, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Vaike. \u201cLook, if you\u2019re really not okay with it...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think your change bothers me?\u201d Panne said, raising an eyebrow. \u201cI am a Taguel, Vaike. I am no stranger to transformations.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yeah, but that\u2019s different,\u201d said Vaike. \u201cThat\u2019s normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTransforming into a giant rabbit-monster is normal, is it?\u201d Panne asked with a playful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you know what I mean,\u201d said Vaike. \u201cYour shapeshifting is a natural thing for you. You were born with that ability. These,\u201d Vaike said as held up his lower arms, \u201cwere created with magic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll admit, that does bother me a little,\u201d said Panne. \u201cThe idea that someone can reshape their own body through the use of magic is a strange one... but perhaps the same could be said of my own transformations.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Vaike asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you said, my ability to change forms is natural,\u201d said Panne. \u201cBut there are many who consider it to be abhorrent. They might consider magical transformation to be more acceptable than natural ones.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Vaike. \u201cY\u2019know what? I think I get what\u2019s really bothering you now,\u201d said Vaike. \u201cYou\u2019re upset \u2018cause you think people are gonna be more okay with my magical transformation then they are with your natural one. Is that it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Yes,\u201d said Panne, lowering her head as she clenched her hands into fists. \u201cThe Taguel were wiped out by man-spawn who refused to accept us for who we were. The thought that your kind despises mine, but still accepts people who change themselves as you did...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay,\u201d said Vaike as he took Panne\u2019s hands in his lower hands, and placed his upper hands on her shoulders. \u201cI know plenty of humans can be jerks, but there\u2019s still lots of good people, too. I mean, has anybody here in Ylisse gotten mad at you for being a Taguel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell... no,\u201d said Panne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee? Nobody hates you because you\u2019re a Taguel,\u201d said Vaike. \u201cAnd you saw how confused everyone was when the other Shepherds came in for dinner, right? Frederick looked like he was gonna have a heart attack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI remember,\u201d said Panne. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen someone go that shade of white before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, right?\u201d said Vaike. \u201cBut that\u2019s my point. It takes time for people to get used to this sorta thing. I can bet there\u2019ll be plenty of people who hate what I\u2019ve done to myself, but I\u2019m not gonna let it bother me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are very few things that bother you,\u201d said Panne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne of the perks of being the Vaike,\u201d said Vaike with a grin. \u201cBut seriously, I think everything\u2019s gonna be just fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaike pulled Panne in for a hug, and Panne slipped her arms between Vaike\u2019s upper and lower shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, my love,\u201d said Panne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny time,\u201d said Vaike.</span></div></div>",

She was sitting on Gregor\u2019s taurso, the part of his body that connected his front and back pairs of hips. Cordelia had loosely wrapped her arms around his waist as he walked through the halls of the Shepherd\u2019s barracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Gregor knows,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, Gregor wanted to know if he could be carrying his wife like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I do appreciate the ride,\u201d said Cordelia. \u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs no problem,\u201d said Gregor. \u201cUnless Cordelia is becoming two people again. Then we have problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t actually become two people, I just gain a second body,\u201d said Cordelia with a smile. \u201cI still need to get used to having both bodies out at the same time, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGregor will do what he can to help Cordelia,\u201d said Gregor. \u201cHe is looking forward to having two Cordelias.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia laughed. \u201cSo am I, surprisingly enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is good, yes?\u201d said Gregor. \u201cAnyway, we are here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregor stopped in front of the door to their room, and Cordelia dismounted from his taurso. Gregor opened the door, and Cordelia followed him inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Cordelia as she shut the door. With the door shut, she walked over to the centre of the room, and her body started to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we go,\u201d said Cordelia as the glow grew brighter. After a few seconds, the glow faded, and a second, naked duplicate of Cordelia was standing directly in front of the original.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are the Cordelias feeling?\u201d Gregor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so confusing,\u201d Cordelia said, speaking in unison with herselves as she looked into her own eyes. Cordelia\u2019s bodies took a step forward, and raised their right hands. Her right hands touched the opposite body\u2019s chests, and Cordelia could feel her hearts beating in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s strange,\u201d Cordelia\u2019s two bodies said. \u201cI can feel fabric under my hand, but I also can\u2019t. The problem is, I can\u2019t tell which body is feeling what.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, Gregor was speaking to the Lissas earlier,\u201d Gregor said. \u201cShe told Gregor that the secret to being two people is blindfold.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Cordelia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs true,\u201d said Gregor. \u201cIf only one Cordelia can see, the other Cordelia can become more independent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that makes sense,\u201d said Cordelia. \u201cBut there has to be more to it than that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, blindfold is only step one,\u201d said Gregor. \u201cLissa said step two was to have new body put clothes on while old body is held still, but Gregor has slightly different idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me guess, you want me to undress my original body?\u201d said Cordelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, new body is already undressed, yes?\u201d said Gregor. \u201cBesides, Cordelia needs to be taking regular clothes off to put sleeping clothes on. And Gregor has seen all of Cordelia before, is nothing new.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is a fair point,\u201d Cordelia said, giggling. \u201cAlright, we\u2019ll do it your way. Do we have anything we can use as a blindfold?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCordelia has old scarf, yes?\u201d Gregor said as he picked the scarf in question out from Cordelia\u2019s wardrobe. \u201cThis will be blindfold. Is Cordelia being ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Cordelia, nodding her heads together. \u201cShe is indeed, being ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery good!\u201d said Gregor as he walked behind Cordelia\u2019s naked body. \u201cGregor is blindfolding this body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope this works,\u201d Cordelia\u2019s bodies said as Gregor tied the scarf around her new body\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGregor is hoping so, too,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, Gregor will hold this body still, while other body takes clothes off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia\u2019s two bodies nodded, and Gregor gently grabbed the wrists of Cordelia\u2019s naked body. He held her arms in place while Cordelia\u2019s original body slowly began to undress herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOy,\u201d said Gregor as he struggled against Cordelia\u2019s movements while she took her shirt off. \u201cCordelia is very strong. Has she been training without Gregor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of Cordelia\u2019s bodies laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d said Cordelia\u2019s original body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI always train with you, remember?\u201d Cordelia\u2019s new body said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, Cordelia is not speaking with both bodies at once,\u201d said Gregor, smiling. \u201cShe is making good progress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not?\u201d Cordelia\u2019s original body asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d said Cordelia\u2019s second body. \u201cI\u2019m starting to get it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent!\u201d said Gregor, as Cordelia\u2019s second body slowly stopped mirroring the movements of her original. As Cordelia\u2019s original body stripped down to her underwear, her second body finally stopped moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I think I\u2019ve got it now,\u201d said Cordelia\u2019s original body, as she walked over to her and Gregor\u2019s bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to take off this blindfold now,\u201d Cordelia\u2019s second body said. Gregor let go of her wrists, and Cordelia\u2019s second body reached up and began untying the blindfold. Meanwhile, her original body reached under her pillow, and took out her nightie and put it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is Cordelia feeling?\u201d Gregor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling much better now,\u201d Cordelia\u2019s original body said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can finally control what I\u2019m doing with each body,\u201d Cordelia\u2019s second body said as she picked out a set of underwear and a second nightie from her wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is good, no?\u201d said Gregor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I still prefer having a single body,\u201d Cordelia\u2019s original body said as her second body dressed herself. \u201cBut now that I can control each body independently, I think I can handle it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGregor is happy for Cordelia,\u201d he said as he took his shirt off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Cordelia asked with her new body. \u201cHow are you handling becoming a humantaur?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs interesting,\u201d Gregor said as he undressed himself. \u201cWalking is not hard, but Gregor always feel like backside is about to smack into something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you haven\u2019t bumped into anything yet,\u201d said Cordelia\u2019s original body. \u201cI\u2019d say you\u2019re doing much better than I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs true, perhaps,\u201d said Gregor as he took his front pair of pants off. \u201cNow, how to do this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Cordelia asked with her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShh,\u201d said Gregor. \u201cGregor is thinking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d said Cordelia\u2019s original body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregor was silent for a second, then sat his rear hips on the bed, with his front pair of legs standing on either side of his rear legs. With his rear hips seated, Gregor kicked his boots off from his rear feet, then pulled down on the clothing covering his taurso. Once he pulled that down, he began pulling his rear pants down. After a few tries, he managed to get his rear pants down around his ankles, wearing only his underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell done,\u201d said Cordelia\u2019s new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMany thanks,\u201d said Gregor. \u201cGregor is glad to have found way to undress himself.\u201d Gregor then yawned loudly. \u201cBut now, Gregor is thinking it is time for bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree,\u201d said Cordelia with her original body, as both of her bodies yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregor then climbed onto the bed, but his humantaur body meant that he could only sleep on his side. Not only that, but another problem soon became apparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to need a bigger bed,\u201d said Cordelia\u2019s new body. \u201cYour humantaur body is taking up my side of the bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe Cordelia will fit if she is only one person?\u201d Gregor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Cordelia\u2019s original body. \u201cWhat if I accidentally duplicate myself during the night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis body would simply fall off the bed and hit the floor,\u201d Cordelia\u2019s new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Gregor can see problem now,\u201d said Gregor. \u201cPerhaps, tonight, Gregor and Cordelia sleep in separate beds?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we have to, yes,\u201d said Cordelia\u2019s original body. \u201cThe room next door is free. I\u2019ll sleep there for tonight, and we can get a bigger bed tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia walked her original body to the door, while her second body walked up to Gregor and kissed him on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood night, Gregor,\u201d Cordelia\u2019s new body said. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe sleeping well, love,\u201d said Gregor. He smiled as he watched Cordelia walk her two bodies out of the room, then closed his eyes and started to drift to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Not at all?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it actually feels pretty natural, which is kind of surprising,\u201d said Sully. \u201cI mean, it was a little weird at first, but it never felt wrong, if that makes sense. But now, after being like this for a few hours, I can\u2019t even tell the difference between having feet and having hooves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Stahl. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really make all that much sense to me, but that might be because I haven\u2019t tried any of the potions or tomes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t see any that you liked the sound of?\u201d Sully asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not really,\u201d said Stahl. \u201cIn fact, some of them seemed really weird, like that one that gave Robin... what did Lissa call them? Lipples?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that one freaked me out a little bit,\u201d said Sully. \u201cI mean, turning your nipples into mouths?

I mean, you\u2019d never fit indoors unless you shrink down a bit... or a lot.

Once she was on the tome, Nowi laid down on the cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMine,\u201d Nowi said, spreading herself out on the tome.

Of course, at her current size, the shrunken dragonstone was about the size of a large grain of sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo the dragonstone shrank too?\u201d Ricken asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep,\u201d said Nowi. \u201cThe tome I used to shrink my clothes must\u2019ve shrunk my dragonstone too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that the only dragonstone you have?\u201d Ricken asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, this one\u2019s just a spare,\u201d said Nowi. \u201cIt\u2019s almost out of magic, so I picked up a new one, which should be in my room somewhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, okay,\u201d said Ricken as he came to a stop. \u201cWell, here\u2019s your room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Nowi said as Ricken opened the door. Ricken then walked into Nowi\u2019s room and carried Nowi and the size-changing tome over to Nowi\u2019s desk. He set the tome down, and Nowi hopped off the tome and onto her desk. She walked around the surface of her desk, marvelling at the giant size of everything. Nowi stopped next to her new dragonstone and looked up at it. While the dragonstone was the same size it always was, it towered over Nowi at her tiny six inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d said Nowi, looking around. \u201cEverything looks so different at this height. It\u2019s pretty neat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, were you going to try out your dragonstone now?\u201d Ricken asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Nowi. \u201cHey, can you stay with me for a few minutes? Just in case something goes wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing,\u201d said Ricken. \u201cI\u2019m here to help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Nowi. \u201cOkay, here goes...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNowi closed her eyes, and focused on the dragonstone in her hands. She could feel the power flowing through the dragonstone, and called upon that power to transform her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Sumia made her way through the Barracks, she marvelled at her expanded field of view. She could see in an unbroken panorama all around her, and could even see directly above her head. Not only that, but it was now surprisingly easy for Sumia to tell what she was seeing with which set of eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia had to admit she hadn\u2019t expected to adjust so well to having so many eyes. Those first few moments had been absolutely terrifying. However, with Robin and Lissa\u2019s assistance, Sumia had been able to figure out how to use her new eyes properly, and now she felt so much better about herself. With the realisation that she could get used to something as strange as having seven new eyes, Sumia had felt a massive boost in her self-confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing able to see in every direction at once gave Sumia a much better feeling of her surroundings. This new awareness of where she was made her feel as if she was less clumsy. However, it wasn\u2019t her expanded vision that had improved her coordination... at least, not directly. Sumia\u2019s clumsiness had given her serious self-esteem issues, and her belief in her own clumsiness had made her even clumsier. With her new-found confidence, though, Sumia believed that she was now less of a klutz. That, in turn, led to actual improvements in her coordination. Of course, if Sumia ever realised that, her self-esteem would plummet again, and she\u2019d become her usual ditzy self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, even with her improved coordination, she was still Sumia. One of her boots got caught on a cobblestone that was jutting out, and Sumia felt herself falling forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d she cried out, swinging her arms wildly to try and keep her balance. To her surprise, Sumia didn\u2019t fall flat on her face. Instead, she staggered forward a few steps, until she ran out of momentum and came to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhew,\u201d said Sumia as she straightened up, then giggled. \u201cAll these eyes, and I still can\u2019t watch where I\u2019m going.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia dusted herself off, then continued on her way. Normally, a trip like that would\u2019ve been incredibly embarrassing for her. However, Sumia actually felt good about herself. While she had tripped, she hadn\u2019t fallen, which was a vast improvement, in her opinion. The fact that she felt like she was becoming less clumsy was another boost to Sumia\u2019s self-confidence. It didn\u2019t completely eliminate her klutzy nature though. That would take time and effort on her part, but her new confidence would be a big help in that regard.</span></div></div>",

Shadowed eyes, long black hair, pale skin, a voluptuous figure, a sheer body stocking and black cape... He looked identical to Tharja in every way. He was even hunched over and clutching the mimicry tome to his chest, the same way Tharja tended to carry her spellbooks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaius smirked, and chuckled darkly. \u201cI really do look like Sunshine,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s... actually a little creepy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he was by himself, Gaius decided it was time to drop the disguise. He stood up straight as his body and clothing shifted back into his normal appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d said Gaius as he rolled his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m surprised she doesn\u2019t get a sore back, slouching like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaius put the mimicry tome down on his desk, then reached into the bag Tharja had given him earlier. He grabbed one of the candies and pulled it out, along with a note that Tharja had left him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBring me these ingredients in three days, or the curse in this candy will take effect,\u201d said Gaius as he read the note. \u201cSo, same deal as usual, then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugged, and tossed the note back into the bag. He then unwrapped the lollipop he\u2019d grabbed and stuck it into his mouth. Gaius then turned to his mirror again, just to check that he was still himself. This time, Gaius saw his own reflection, rather than Tharja\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat gave Gaius an idea. He knew that he had to be touching someone in order to mimic them. That was how he\u2019d copied Tharja\u2019s appearance, and Miriel\u2019s before her. He\u2019d also spoken to Chrom earlier, and had learned that he couldn\u2019t copy someone by looking at them. He had to be touching someone in order to mimic them. However, Gaius wondered if he only needed to touch someone the first time he mimicked them. Maybe he could mimic Tharja again, without having to touch her a second time. On the other hand, Chrom said he hadn\u2019t been able to mimic Lissa a second time without her touching him again. Of course, Chrom had apparently had serious difficulties adjusting to each of the tomes he\u2019d used, and hadn\u2019t really used any of them long enough to adapt to them. Maybe Gaius would have better results...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gaius concentrated on the strange energy that had surged through him when he used his mimicry powers. To his surprise, he felt the power within him, and watched his reflection as his body began to change again. Gaius could feel his body compressing slightly as he grew shorter, and watched as his face began to change shape, becoming more slightly more rounded. Once again, he felt his waist and groin pull in as his chest and hips pull out. However, his clothes grew loose as they morphed into a mage\u2019s outfit, and his headband grew into a wide-brimmed hat as a pair of glasses formed on his face. Finally, his hair darkened a few shades, while still remaining red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFascinating,\u201d said Gaius, now with the appearance of Miriel. \u201cIt appears that I can take the form of anyone I have previously mimicked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he examined his reflection, he reached up and adjusted his glasses. He moved his glasses around by pushing on the frame, much like Miriel did. In fact, the only thing that gave his true identity away was the lollipop stick that was poking out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must remember to tell Specs about this discovery tomorrow,\u201d Gaius said. \u201cBut, perhaps there is more I could learn about this power. Chrom mentioned that he needed to touch someone to mimic them. Perhaps I can do so without that requirement?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Chrom had used the mimicry tome before, Gaius decided to try mimicking him this time. He closed his eyes, and imagined turning into the blue-haired young man. However, try as he might, he couldn\u2019t feel the surge of shapeshifting energy he\u2019d felt before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm,\u201d said Gaius as he opened his eyes. \u201cIt appears that touch is a necessary component to mimicking a new person after all. That is a shame. Still, I now know that it is possible to mimic someone that I have mimicked previously. But can I switch from one mimicked form to another?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Gaius focused on taking Tharja\u2019s form, and he felt the surge of energy once more. However, instead of becoming Tharja, his body started to revert to his normal appearance. Once he was back to normal, though, his body continued to shift. His hair darkened to black and grew longer again as his clothing grew tight against his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s interesting,\u201d Gaius said once his transformation into Tharja was complete. \u201cLooks like I have to go back to normal before I mimic someone else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he was back in Tharja\u2019s body, Gaius examined his body again. Funnily enough, he didn\u2019t feel uncomfortable in a woman\u2019s body. It felt just as natural being female as it did to be male. But just because he had a woman\u2019s body didn\u2019t mean he now thought of himself as a woman. Gaius still considered himself a man, even if his body was female. He wondered if that was a universal thing about swapping genders, or if other people felt differently about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm,\u201d said Gaius as he looked at his reflection, and saw Tharja staring back at him. \u201cMaybe I should try mimicking some more people tomorrow...\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"If my sisters could see me now,\" Anna mumbled to herself with a small sigh as she closed up her shop, having finished up her work for the night. She'd completed her stock take of her new items around the back room, cleaned up the front end of the store after how many people had been dragged through it earlier today, and had even written a letter to her mysterious supplier from the Outrealms, asking for more restoration staves in particular, but generally requesting more of whatever they had to give. She'd briefly pondered if she'd end up with yet more unknown potions and tomes to be tested, or whether she'd just get more of what she already had, but that was a bridge she'd cross when she came to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite running at a loss for most of the day, with the amount of inventory used for testing or given out as samples far outweighing the minimal income she had made, Anna actually considered the day to be quite profitable. Not only did she now know what her mystery products actually did, but many members of the Shepherds were now essentially walking advertisements for her store, showcasing an experience you couldn't get anywhere else in this realm. She'd yet to pen down a proper marketing strategy beyond that yet, though. She'd probably have to come up with something soon, before her sisters managed to discover her mystery supplier themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of her sisters, the fact that she was no longer identical to the rest of her family continued to cross her mind as she headed back to her room in the barracks. She'd always grown up just being one of the many Annas across Ylisse, each just as easily mistaken for the rest. Now, there would be no mistaking her again. She wasn't just any old Anna, anyone would be able to tell at a glance that she was the Anna who belonged to the Shepherds. It almost made her a little excited, finally gaining some sense of individuality, and yet, it kind of felt like she was losing a little part of herself by standing out from her family like that. It was an altogether odd feeling, to say nothing of how the thing differentiating her felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sets of clicks her shoes made on the floor with each step she made rung in her ears, the halls mostly empty with the other Shepherds having returned to their rooms while she worked. She was now far from those first wobbly steps, unsure of how exactly she was supposed to walk with two extra legs. Now it felt incredibly natural, as if she'd had them her entire life. It was almost scary how quickly she'd adjusted. Unlike Lissa or Miriel, though very much like Chrom at first, she hadn't exactly taken well to her transformation to start with. She'd never really intended to become a test subject herself, only taking the potion at Lissa's urging, and she'd felt rather uncomfortable with her new form. In fact, the only reason she'd kept her humantaur form was to prevent Lissa from urging her to try something else. The longer she'd stayed like this, though, the more natural it began to feel, eventually reaching a point where she could scarcely imagine what it would be like to go back to just two legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made a mental note to warn potential customers about that; if you don't like your form, restore yourself quickly or it'll start to feel natural. That wasn't to say she disliked her new humantaur body, though. She had already found a manner of uses for the extension of her torso, from carrying things in saddlebags to standing on her hind legs to reach up higher. It was strange, sure, but it was a useful sort of strange, and as of yet hadn't proved a hindrance beyond learning how to walk again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a yawn, stretching her arms up as she finally reached her room. She briefly glanced at her closet, thinking about all the unchanged pants that would no longer properly fit her. \"...Tomorrow,\" Anna told herself, setting the clothing alteration tome she'd brought with her down upon her desk. Today had been a big day, and right now she just wanted to sleep. With that in mind, she began to strip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything above the waist wasn't an issue, as obviously nothing had changed there. It was below the belt that was an issue. \"Alright, you can do this Anna, it's just a pair of pants,\" she said to herself, sliding her boots off as she tried to figure out how she was going to get this altered garment off. Her pants had been changed to cover both pairs of legs, leaving her a little perplexed as to how to remove it. Ultimately, she decided to just take it one step at a time, and, with her rear hips seated on the bed, shimmied her front legs out of the pants as best she could. It wasn't exactly the easiest thing in the world, prompting Anna to briefly consider switching to skirts in future, but she managed to get it off and over her ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... That's different,\" Anna mumbled, peering down at her front legs' crotch. In amongst all the new sensations of a second pair of legs, Anna had missed some of the smaller things. For instance, she didn't appear to be wearing underwear on her front legs. She couldn't even imagine how she'd get it on properly with her taurso in the way, but it seemed it wasn't necessary anymore, as that which her underwear was made to cover wasn't present. The space between her legs was blank. It was still present, of course, she just hadn't bothered to take notice that it now sat between her rear legs instead. \"Guess I'll have to tell Miriel about that tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding the placement of her genitals were not more important than sleep, Anna continued her quest to get her pants off, slowly pulling it down her taurso, awkwardly reaching behind her to do so, before she was forced to stand for a moment to pull it over her rear, revealing where her underwear had gone. From there, it was just a matter of shimmying it off of her rear legs, which she expected to be more of a hassle than her front legs, given the placement, but was actually a fair bit easier, since the entire garment was now coming off, rather than just the legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTossing the pants to the floor, opting to put it away in the morning, Anna flopped onto her bed, before immediately realising another problem; her bed was made for one person, and her body was more or less one and a half people right now. The angle of her taurso meant she couldn't lay on her back or her stomach, leaving only her side, which left some parts dangling off the bed no matter how she laid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess that's something to add to tomorrow's to-do list,\" Anna grumbled, endeavouring to get a larger bed tomorrow, while doing her best to find the most comfortable way to lay so she could sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tharja held her hand up in front of her face, staring through her invisible hand at the mirror in front of her. There was no reflection visible in the mirror, but Tharja could still see her hand. Her body was surrounded by what looked like a pale blue outline that was barely visible, though it became more noticeable whenever she moved. When she moved, the outline appeared to trail pale blue smoke, as if she were a ghost. Tharja\u2019s clothes also had the strange outline, as she\u2019d made her clothing invisible as well. Of course, it was only her current set of clothes that was invisible. If she wanted to make more of her clothes invisible, she\u2019d need to pick up a clothing alteration tome, and Anna would be sure to make her pay for one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja focused on making herself visible, and watched as her body faded into view. With her body fully visible, it actually became easier to see her invisible clothing, as the blue outline stood out more against her visible skin. Of course, Tharja appeared to be naked when her body was visible, despite a few oddities that suggested otherwise. Her heels lifted the back of her feet up, making it look like Tharja was walking on her tiptoes. Her breasts were also obviously being supported, as if she truly was naked, Tharja\u2019s large breasts would\u2019ve been hanging much lower on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja undid her cape, then held the garment out in front of her. Even though she was no longer wearing it, Tharja could still see the pale blue outline. Curious, Tharja draped the invisible cape over the back of her chair. She had half-expected the cape to disappear once her fingers were no longer in contact with it, but she could still see the outline of the cape. That made Tharja curious. If someone else used the invisibility tome and became invisible, would she be able to see them as well? Or would she only be able to see herself? Then there was the matter of clothing. If someone else made their clothes invisible, would she be able to see their clothes too? Would turning invisible herself make other invisible people visible to her? If she got dirt or mud on her, would that become invisible when it hit her? Or would it stay visible, and give her presence away?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo many questions,\u201d said Tharja with a sigh as she turned herself invisible again. The more she made herself visible or invisible, the easier it became. At first, it was easier to become invisible, and she\u2019d have to focus to stay visible. Now, however, it was like flipping a switch. Once she was visible, she\u2019d stay visible until she wanted to be invisible again, at which point her body would instantly fade from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tharja watched her body fade from view again, an idea struck her. Once she was visible, Tharja decided to make herself visible again, but she wanted to control the speed at which she became visible. As Tharja watched the mirror, she saw a very faint, completely transparent reflection of herself. She concentrated, and her reflection grew a little less faint, while still remaining transparent. Tharja then lifted a hand up in front of her face again. There was no outline, but Tharja could just barely see her transparent hand, and her faint reflection in the mirror through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked, and let herself fade back into invisibility. Not only could she control which parts of her body were invisible, she could also control just how visible she was. And speaking of body parts, she wondered just how much control she had in that regard. Tharja knew she could make something like her head invisible, or make her arms invisible while her hands remained visible, but she wanted to see if she could do something more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja watched her mirror again. This time, instead of her whole body appearing, only Tharja\u2019s skeleton appeared in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow this is interesting,\u201d said Tharja as she watched her skull\u2019s mouth open and close. She looked down at herself, and could see her skeleton through her body. She watched her arms and legs move around, pulled by invisible muscles as she looked herself over. Not only that, but while her skeleton was visible, the blue outline of her body was not, though the outline of her clothes remained. She ran a finger over her face, and saw could feel the invisible flesh of her finger and her face, while the bones of her finger appeared to hover just above her skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow disturbing,\u201d Tharja said, then chuckled darkly. \u201cI like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving found an appearance that she liked, Tharja began stripping off her clothes. She left her invisible clothes in a neat pile on her desk, so that she didn\u2019t accidentally lose them. With her invisible clothes safe, Tharja climbed into bed. She tossed and turned for a while, her naked body invisible while her skeleton remained visible. However, once she fell asleep, even her skeleton disappeared, leaving Tharja completely invisible. The only signs that she was there were the divot in her pillow, and the lump beneath her sheets.</span></div></div>",

In fact, upon waking up, Miriel allowed herself the simple pleasure of simply staying in her bucket in her liquid form. She found it incredibly relaxing, far more so than she expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she knew she couldn\u2019t stay in her bucket all day. Miriel began piling her fluid up, pushing against the wall of the bucket. She pulled herself up the side of the bucket, and let herself flow down the side onto the floor. Once her puddle was out of the bucket, Miriel began forming a pair of lumps on her surface. The two lumps soon gained definition and solidity as Miriel finished forming her two heads. Once her heads were formed, Miriel opened all four of her eyes, and continued forming her body. Her necks soon emerged from her puddle, as did her naked torso and her arms. Her body continued to rise up out of the puddle, but once her waist was out of the puddle, she stopped. Miriel decided to keep her hips and legs fluid, making it appear as if her upper body was floating in a flesh-coloured puddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiriel flowed across the floor to where her clothes were. Miriel had not had the foresight to ask Anna for a clothing alteration tome, and as such, she only had one set of clothing that was suited for her two heads. Because of this, Miriel had to wear the same clothes she had worn yesterday. Normally, she disliked doing so, but she was willing to make exceptions in extraordinary circumstances, and her current situation certainly qualified. Miriel put her shirt on, leaving her pants and shoes off, since she\u2019d have no need for them. Once she was dressed, Miriel retrieved her two pairs of glasses and donned them. With both pairs of glasses on, Miriel\u2019s vision cleared up, which made navigating her room much easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Miriel was dressed to her satisfaction, she made her way over to the door, her liquefied legs flowing across the floor as she moved. However, due to the fact that her legs were now liquid, Miriel was only about half of her regular height, which Miriel only really noticed once she reached the door. At her current height, the doorknob was at eye-level, as opposed to being at the height of her hips when her legs were solid. In spite of that, Miriel was able to open the door to her room without difficulty, and began making her way towards the dining hall, where she planned to join the other Shepherds for breakfast.</span></div></div>",

His chest felt heavy for some reason, so he looked down at his naked body. For a few seconds, he was surprised to see a pair of breasts, and that he could feel his feminine nipples hardening in the morning air. Then he remembered that he\u2019d swapped genders with Robin last night. That meant that he had a female version of his body, while Robin now had a male version of her body. And after that swap, well... hopping the gender fence had been very interesting, to say the least...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning,\u201d said Robin, with her deep masculine voice. She turned her head to look at him, and smiled with all three of her mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLast night was fun,\u201d Robin said with her left lipple, which was flat against her chest, which made sense.

All it took was a little focus, and he could feel his body shifting again as he undid the gender swap. Chrom felt his chest flatten, and watched as Robin\u2019s breasts grew back in. Within seconds, the two of them were back to normal... or mostly normal, in Robin\u2019s case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat feels better,\u201d said Chrom once his body had stopped changing. \u201cBeing a woman was just... so weird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t like it?\u201d Robin asked, using her original mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that, exactly,\u201d said Chrom. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t get used to it. I mean, I didn\u2019t hate it, but it just didn\u2019t feel right. You know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess that makes sense,\u201d said Robin with her left lipple, then yawned with all three of her mouths again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, as much as I\u2019d like to just stay in bed all day, I suppose we\u2019d better get up,\u201d said Chrom as he got out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d Robin said with her right lipple as she stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking the time to freshen themselves up and put on clean clothing, Chrom and Robin were ready for the day ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think we should join the other Shepherds for breakfast?\u201d Robin asked with her right lipple as she and Chrom left their bedroom. \u201cOr should we just eat here in the Palace?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we should join the others,\u201d said Chrom. \u201cThat way we can see how everyone else is adjusting to their new bodies. Unless you\u2019d rather eat now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I can wait,\u201d said Robin. \u201cBesides, given how strange some of these changes are, I think it\u2019s best that we make sure everyone\u2019s adjusting properly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFair enough,\u201d said Chrom, as he and Robin began walking through the halls.</span></div></div>",

Lissa\u2019s clothing was crumpled, and the hair on both her heads was a complete mess. Despite her untidiness, Lissa seemed to not have a care in the world.

For me, that meant stepping forward with the two outer legs first, then stepping forward with the middle leg.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Olivia. \u201cSo it was like two-one, two-one, instead of one-two-three, one-two-three.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess so,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body. \u201cI mean, maybe if I was running, I might go left leg, middle leg, right leg, but I only tried out walking, and I didn\u2019t get very far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia nodded. \u201cAnd how hard was it to get used to having three legs?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly, it wasn\u2019t that hard for me,\u201d Lissa said with her Sage body. \u201cBut that might have to do with the fact that I had already gotten used to having two bodies. Three legs was nothing compared to that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you so curious, anyway?\u201d Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body asked. \u201cWere you thinking of trying the potion yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, maybe?\u201d said Olivia. \u201cI mean, just think of all the dances I might be able to do with three legs... but then I\u2019d have to adapt all my old routines for my new body, and everyone would be staring at my new leg, and using the potions is so painful...\u201d Olivia sighed. \u201cI just can\u2019t decide...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, there\u2019s no rush,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body. \u201cAnna still has plenty of potions and tomes you can buy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd just because there\u2019s plenty of people who have used \u2018em, doesn\u2019t mean you need to join in,\u201d said Vaike. \u201cYou\u2019re dances are great just the way they are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, stop it,\u201d said Olivia as she blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Chrom and Robin had found a seat at the next table over, joining Miriel, Anna, Gregor and Cordelia. Miriel was sitting slightly lower than normal, as Miriel\u2019s legs were currently liquid instead of solid. Gregor was still a humantaur, and Cordelia had only arrived with one body, though she had a spare set of clothes on the table next to her, just in case. Anna had also kept her humantaur body, but her eyes were surrounded by dark rings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d Miriel said with her left head as Chrom and Robin sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning,\u201d Robin replied with her original mouth as she sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay, Anna?\u201d Robin asked with her left lipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna nodded, then covered her mouth as she yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2018m fine,\u201d Anna said. \u201cJust didn\u2019t sleep well. I need to get a bigger bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Oh, because of your humantaur body,\u201d said Chrom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna nodded. \u201cMy taurso and back legs kept hanging out of the bed,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m also not used to sleeping on my side.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Gregor and Cordelia were having same problem,\u201d said Gregor. \u201cCordelia could not be fitting in bed while Gregor was already lying down. Gregor and Cordelia had to be sleeping in different beds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot only that, but I was afraid I might duplicate myself in my sleep,\u201d said Cordelia. \u201cIf that happened, my second body would\u2019ve fallen out of the bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that could be painful,\u201d said Robin with her right lipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThankfully, Gregor helped me get used to having two bodies before we decided to go to bed,\u201d said Cordelia. \u201cAs you can see, though, I still prefer only having one body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that why you have the spare set of clothes?\u201d Robin asked with her left lipple. \u201cIn case you accidentally duplicate yourself again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no, I\u2019ve got the hang of it now,\u201d said Cordelia. \u201cThis is for when Gregor and I help Miriel out later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCordelia has agreed to assist me in determining how the duplication ability interacts with the body alteration potions,\u201d Miriel said with her right head. \u201cWhile we know that using a potion only affects the body that uses the potion, it is still unknown how reintegrating the two bodies affects the potions used.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that sounds like it could be interesting,\u201d said Chrom. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to let us know how it goes later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said Miriel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you\u2019ve found a new way of getting around,\u201d said Robin with her original mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d said Miriel with her left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, it is not an efficient method of locomotion,\u201d Miriel said with her right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile I am capable of travelling at walking speed, I find that my puddle body tends to collect detritus as I move,\u201d Miriel\u2019s left head continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile I can easily eject such matter, I will always end up collecting more,\u201d Miriel\u2019s right head continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot only that, but I risk getting larger objects stuck inside my fluid if I were to leave the interior of this building,\u201d Miriel said with her left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThus, I have decided that I will save this method of locomotion for interior use, and will use my legs for exterior travel,\u201d Miriel concluded with her right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh,\u201d said Anna. \u201cYeah, I never thought of that, but it makes sense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d said Miriel. \u201cI also have to take care with how I dress. If I am not careful, the fabric of my clothing will absorb some of my fluid. While I can remove myself from the fabric, doing so is tedious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how did you sleep?\u201d Anna asked. \u201cI mean, you would\u2019ve soaked into the mattress, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suspected that might happen, so I did not sleep in my bed last night,\u201d said Miriel. \u201cInstead, I acquired a bucket before I retired for the night. By liquefying myself within the confines of the bucket, I was able to sleep quite soundly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, that\u2019s actually a good idea,\u201d said Anna. \u201cI might give it a try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d need to get used to the whole melting thing,\u201d said Chrom. \u201cI know Miriel adjusted to it pretty quickly, but I had some serious trouble with it yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s a good point,\u201d said Anna. \u201cI\u2019m still thinking it over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of adjusting,\u201d Robin said with her left lipple. \u201cThese potions and tomes could cause quite a stir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were getting some strange looks earlier,\u201d said Robin\u2019s right lipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d said Chrom. \u201cI might have to do a public address to explain the situation if things start getting out of hand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I certainly won\u2019t say no to free advertising if you do,\u201d said Anna, earning a laugh from Chrom.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later that day, Anna was standing behind the counter at her shop, tracing her finger over the blob-like insignia on the light blue tome. After the Shepherds had finished breakfast, she\u2019d made her way to her shop and began opening up. Anna hadn\u2019t received any customers yet, and she was oddly thankful. She knew that her new appearance might be a little disconcerting to anyone who didn\u2019t know about the potions and tomes, so she didn\u2019t have to answer any odd questions or deal with someone panicking about her humantaur form. Besides, it gave her more time to try and develop some sort of marketing strategy, beyond it simply being an experience that couldn\u2019t be found anywhere else. Maybe she should market each of the potions and tomes on an individual basis. After all, they all had unique effects, and as such, they all had unique benefits...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna was brought out of her musings by the sound of the doorbell ringing as someone entered. She looked up and saw Cordelia coming in, carrying a bundle of clothes in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d Cordelia said as she closed the door behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna covered her mouth as she yawned. \u201cMorning,\u201d Anna said once she\u2019d finished yawning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs Miriel here yet?\u201d Cordelia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not yet,\u201d said Anna, shaking her head. \u201cBut she\u2019ll probably be here soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia nodded. \u201cIn that case, I\u2019d better get ready.\u201d She placed the bundle of clothes on the counter, then took a step back. \u201cYou may want to close your eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d said Anna. \u201cOh, right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Anna closed her eyes, Cordelia\u2019s body began glowing brightly. Once the glow had faded, Anna opened her eyes to see two Cordelias, one fully dressed, and the other naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you\u2019ve gotten used to having two bodies now?\u201d Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, thankfully,\u201d said the Cordelia standing on the left, which was the original.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I woke up this morning, it felt completely natural,\u201d said the Cordelia on the right, the duplicate, as she dressed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpending the night as two people was a lot more helpful than I thought it would be,\u201d said the Cordelia on the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, the more time you spend with something like this,\u201d Anna said, gesturing at her taurso, \u201cThe easier it becomes to deal with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is true,\u201d said the Cordelia on the right as she finished dressing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that the melting tome?\u201d Cordelia\u2019s original body asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I still can\u2019t decide if I want to use it or not,\u201d said Anna. \u201cOn the one hand, it sounds like it could really take some getting used to. On the other hand, sleeping in a bucket would be a lot easier than getting a new bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Cordelia\u2019s duplicate body, now fully dressed. \u201cIt took some time for Gregor and I to find a big enough bed to fit us both.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince he\u2019s a humantaur, and I have two bodies, we essentially need a bed that can hold four people,\u201d said the Cordelia on the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThankfully, we managed to find one that was big enough,\u201d said the Cordelia on the right. \u201cGregor stayed behind to finish setting it up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rang again, and Cordelia turned both of her heads to see Miriel walking in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello,\u201d Cordelia said with her original body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreetings,\u201d said Miriel, speaking with her left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you prepared for this morning\u2019s experiments?\u201d Miriel\u2019s right head asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am,\u201d said the Cordelia on the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two can head on into the back,\u201d said Anna. \u201cIf you need anything, let me know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiriel nodded her two heads, and headed into the storeroom behind Anna\u2019s shop. Cordelia\u2019s two bodies followed after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do we know about how the potions and tomes work with two bodies?\u201d Cordelia\u2019s duplicate body asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks to Lissa\u2019s efforts yesterday, we know that using a potion or a tome only modifies the body that uses the potion or tome,\u201d said Miriel with her right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, if I drank the potion that gave you two heads with my duplicate body, only my other body would get a second head, right?\u201d Cordelia asked with her original body. \u201cThis body would still be normal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is correct,\u201d said Miriel with her left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever, since you discovered it is possible to return to having a single body, this opens up new questions,\u201d Miriel continued with her right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow does removing the duplicate body interact with the alterations made by the potions and tomes? That is what we are attempting to determine today,\u201d Miriel concluded with her left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia nodded both her heads. \u201cSo, should we use the potions for this?\u201d Her duplicate body asked. \u201cI know the changes made by them are painful, but they are more obvious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d said Miriel. \u201cAnd for our first experiment, I recommend you return to having a single body. I wish to see what occurs if you consume a potion with a single body, then duplicate yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d said Cordelia with her original body. There was a bright flash, and when the light faded, Cordelia\u2019s duplicate body had disappeared. The clothes the duplicate body had been wearing remained standing for a split second, then collapsed as gravity took hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d said Cordelia, back to having only one body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe potions can drastically alter your body,\u201d Miriel pointed out, speaking with her right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt may be prudent to remove your clothing, so as not to damage it,\u201d Miriel\u2019s left head continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat... is a good point, actually,\u201d said Cordelia. She took a few moments to remove her clothing, though she chose to leave her underwear on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll start with something that won\u2019t cause a huge change to my body,\u201d Cordelia said as she walked over to the potions. \u201cSomething like... this one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia reached into a box labelled \u2018TAIL\u2019, and pulled out a clear bottle that contained a black potion. She uncorked the bottle and held it to her lips, tilting it back and pouring the potion into her mouth. Cordelia swallowed, and set the bottle down. Her eyes went wide as she gasped in pain, and struggled to remain standing as the tail grew out from the base of her spine. Bright red hair began to form, trailing down to the ground as the horse-like hair formed over Cordelia\u2019s tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia panted as the pain slowly began to subside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw,\u201d Cordelia groaned as her tail began to swish from side to side. She looked over her shoulder at her tail as the red hair brushed against the back of her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh,\u201d said Cordelia, wagging her new tail back and forth. \u201cYou know, I think I can see why Lissa likes having a tail.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but she only has a tail on her Sage body,\u201d said Miriel with her right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd we need to see if my duplicate will also have a tail or not,\u201d said Cordelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is correct,\u201d said Miriel with her left head. \u201cIf you would kindly duplicate yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia nodded, and closed her eyes to concentrate. There was a bright flash, and when the light faded...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once it finished forming, Cordelia\u2019s duplicate body was naked, as was to be expected. Not only that, but Miriel could see the long red hair dangling behind the legs of Cordelia\u2019s duplicate body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia turned her heads, so that her original body was looking at her duplicate, and vice versa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, both of my bodies have a tail now,\u201d said Cordelia\u2019s original body. Her duplicate body took a small step forward as Cordelia walked her original body behind her duplicate body and knelt down to get a better look at her duplicate body\u2019s tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFascinating,\u201d said Miriel as she started writing in her notebook, watching Cordelia with her left head and her notebook with her right. \u201cThe duplicate appears to take whatever form the user\u2019s original body has at the time of duplication.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s certainly what it looks like,\u201d said Cordelia\u2019s duplicate body, as her original body ran her fingers through her duplicate body\u2019s tail. \u201cDo you want me to go back to being a single person and try a different potion? That way we can make sure this isn\u2019t a fluke.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile I appreciate your adherence to the scientific method, I do not believe that will be necessary,\u201d said Miriel with her left head as she turned a page in her notebook. \u201cReading through my notes from yesterday, I believe I have discovered a precedent for this situation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Cordelia\u2019s original body asked, stepping out from behind her naked duplicate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYesterday, when Lissa first duplicated herself, she was still a Cleric,\u201d Miriel\u2019s right head said. \u201cUsing two Master Seals, she was able to promote her original body into a War Cleric, and her duplicate body into a Sage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever, Lissa had a restoration staff used on her, losing her duplicate,\u201d Miriel\u2019s left head continued. \u201cShe then used the duplication tome a second time, regaining her duplicate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut this time, her duplicate was a War Cleric, rather than being a Sage,\u201d Miriel\u2019s right head concluded. \u201cThus, it appears that the duplicate\u2019s form is based on the user\u2019s original form at the time the duplicate is created.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d Cordelia\u2019s duplicate body said. \u201cSo, we don\u2019t need to repeat this experiment?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I believe I have sufficient data for now,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head. \u201cIf I require more information, we can repeat the experiment at a later date.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Cordelia with her original body. \u201cSo, did you have any other experiments you wished to test?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, as a matter of fact, I do,\u201d Miriel said with her right head as she flipped through her notebook. \u201cI wish to see what happens if an alteration is made to the duplicate, and then the duplicate is dismissed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what do you hope to learn from this test?\u201d Cordelia\u2019s duplicate body asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish to know if the changes made to the duplicate are added to the original body when the duplicate is no longer present,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf that is the case, will the changes then be removed from the original body and applied to the duplicate?\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if the changes are not applied to the original body, will the duplicate retain those changes when it is summoned again?\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you want me to drink a potion with this body, then go back to having one body?\u201d Cordelia\u2019s duplicate body asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is correct,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Cordelia said with her original body as she walked her naked duplicate body over to the boxes of potions. After a few seconds of deliberation, she reached into a box labelled \u2018LIPPLES\u2019. When she pulled her hand out, she was holding a clear bottle that contained a purple potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHopefully, this won\u2019t be too hard to get used to,\u201d Cordelia\u2019s duplicate body said as she uncorked the potion bottle and held it to her lips. She quickly drank the potion, then put the bottle down before the transformation could begin. Cordelia\u2019s bodies gasped in unison, and her hands clutched at her breasts as the pain began. Miriel watched in fascination as the nipples on Cordelia\u2019s duplicate body slowly started to grow wider, forming large mouth-like shapes. A line appeared in the centre of the lumps on her breasts, slowly deepening as the lips formed. The newly formed mouths opened up, gasping for air in unison with Cordelia\u2019s original mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw,\u201d Cordelia\u2019s original body said as her duplicate body opened and closed her mouths. \u201cIt was so weird, feeling that pain in only one body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I believe Lissa mentioned something similar yesterday,\u201d Miriel said with her left head. \u201cAre you ready to proceed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d said Cordelia\u2019s duplicate body, speaking from all three mouths simultaneously. \u201cOh, sorry. I was just trying to figure out why something in my mouths tasted strange.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Miriel\u2019s right head asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d said Cordelia\u2019s duplicate body, again speaking with all three mouths. She then reached up and held her jaw shut while she continued opening and closing her lipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI might be wrong,\u201d Cordelia\u2019s duplicate said with both lipples. \u201cBut I think the saliva from my lipples might actually be breast milk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d said Miriel with her left head. \u201cI will speak with Robin later, to see if she has experienced anything similar.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf that is true, it would allow your breasts to still function as breasts while your lipples are present,\u201d Miriel\u2019s right head said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRegardless, that is not actually the purpose of today\u2019s experiment,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head. \u201cIf you could please go back to having a single body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d said Cordelia with her original body as her tail waved slowly from side to side. \u201cLet\u2019s see if I get lipples on this body or not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash of bright white, and Cordelia\u2019s duplicate body disappeared.

Anna found herself strangely entranced by the way Miriel alternated her sentences between her heads as she spoke, as well as Miriel\u2019s obvious excitement at the discoveries she had made. That was a little surprising to Anna, as Miriel was a rather stoic woman. However, after spending most of the day with Miriel yesterday, Anna had started to pick up on all the subtle little details that hinted at Miriel\u2019s true feelings. Miriel\u2019s voices would speed up slightly, and she\u2019d alternate speaking between her heads after every sentence. Not only that, but sometimes, Miriel would say something with one head, then begin speaking with her other head before she finished speaking with her first head. Miriel would also turn her heads very slightly towards each other, so both pairs of eyes could look at the same thing. At the moment, that one thing was Anna herself, and in all honesty, Anna could stare into those four bespectacled eyes for hours...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she finished speaking, Miriel cleared her throats, making Anna jump slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForgive me,\u201d said Miriel with her left head. \u201cI did not mean to bore you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? No, I wasn\u2019t bored at all,\u201d Anna said. \u201cI heard every word.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d Miriel asked with her right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Anna. \u201cYou were talking about how the duplicate body will always match the original body\u2019s current form when it\u2019s created. And you said that drinking a second potion can remove the effects of that potion, without removing the effects of other potions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr... yes,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head, her eyes going slightly wider behind her spectacles. \u201cThat is an accurate summation of my findings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee?\u201d said Anna, feeling her cheeks warm up a little as she flashed a smile at Miriel. \u201cTold you I was paying attention.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must admit, I am not used to someone paying such... rapt attention to me,\u201d Miriel\u2019s right head said, as a blush began to form on both her faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s important for me to know these things,\u201d said Anna. \u201cThe more information I have, the better I can market all these potions and tomes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I see,\u201d Miriel said with her left head. \u201cSo it is entirely for practical reasons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d said Anna. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I genuinely appreciate everything you\u2019ve done to figure out how these things work. But, at the end of the day, I am still running a business here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head. \u201cAnd I am grateful for the opportunity you have provided.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy pleasure,\u201d said Anna with a smile. \u201cAnd thank you for all your help. Like I said, I\u2019m really grateful for everything you\u2019ve learned over the last few days about... all of this,\u201d Anna said, waving her hand to encompass the potions and tomes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are most welcome,\u201d said Miriel with her left head. \u201cI found the experience quite enjoyable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo did I,\u201d said Anna, who then turned to face Cordelia, who was still present. \u201cNow, is there anything else I can help you with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, I was hoping to pick up one of those tomes that changes your clothing,\u201d Cordelia said. \u201cSince Gregor\u2019s a humantaur and I\u2019ve decided to keep this tail, we\u2019re both going to need to use it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing,\u201d said Anna as she reached under the counter and pulled out a small stack of grey tomes. \u201cI actually grabbed a few of these, one for each person who used a potion yesterday. Can you drop these off for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said Cordelia. \u201cHow much do I owe you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s on the house,\u201d said Anna. \u201cMy way of saying thank you to everyone who was brave enough to try one of these crazy experiments.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s very kind of you,\u201d said Cordelia as she picked up the stack of tomes. \u201cSo, who am I delivering these to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d said Anna as she grabbed a piece of paper and read the list. \u201cLissa and Robin got their tomes yesterday, and so did I... Miriel, I gave you one yesterday, but you left it here by mistake...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia nodded, and handed one of the tomes to Miriel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Miriel said with her right head as she accepted the tome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, who else?\u201d muttered Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are four tomes left,\u201d said Cordelia. \u201cI assume one was for Gregor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, one of them is his,\u201d said Anna. \u201cThe others are for Sully, Vaike and Sumia. And here,\u201d Anna said as she added another tome to the stack Cordelia was carrying. \u201cI\u2019ll add one for you as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Cordelia. \u201cWell, I\u2019d better get moving. I\u2019m sure the others are going to want these sooner, rather than later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing,\u201d said Anna. \u201cAnd thanks again for the help today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia nodded as she smiled at Anna, then turned and headed out of the shop, leaving Anna and Miriel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe I will take my leave as well,\u201d Miriel\u2019s left head said. \u201cI must examine my notes thoroughly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIncidentally, is that a melting tome I see?\u201d Miriel asked with her right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it is,\u201d said Anna, picking up the tome in question. \u201cYou remember the discussion we had earlier? About how you slept in a bucket in your liquid form?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said Miriel with her left head. \u201cYou seemed intrigued by the idea, if somewhat undecided.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been trying to decide whether or not I want to use the melting tome since then,\u201d said Anna. \u201cAnd I think I\u2019ve finally made up my mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d said Miriel with her right head. \u201cAnd what is your decision?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Any other tips?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you are comfortable transitioning between forms, it would be prudent to learn how to move as a fluid,\u201d Miriel\u2019s left head said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cObserve,\u201d Miriel said with her right head as she set down her notebook and clothing alteration tome. Miriel then placed her hands on Anna\u2019s counter top, and Anna watched as flesh-coloured liquid began pouring out of Miriel\u2019s sleeves and onto the counter. After only a few seconds, Miriel\u2019s clothes went limp and crumpled to the floor as she flowed onto the counter. Once she had fully liquefied, Miriel then began pushing her puddle towards the edge of the counter and started dripping over the side. More and more of Miriel began to pour off the counter and onto the floor, pooling around Anna\u2019s four feet. Once all of Miriel was on the floor, tendrils began to stretch out and brush against her surroundings. Miriel quickly retreated away from Anna, moving around the counter and back to her clothing. Once Miriel had reached the pile of clothes, she reached tentacles of fluid out of her puddle and began pulling the clothes towards herself. Miriel submerged her boots in herself as she pulled the rest of her clothes over her puddle. When she was satisfied, Miriel\u2019s clothes began rising up slowly as Miriel began solidifying herself. Miriel\u2019s hats and glasses were pulled onto her heads, which rose up from the neck holes in her shirt. Miriel then began pushing her fluid up through her pants and into her shirt. Within seconds, Miriel had shot up to her regular height, and the remaining liquid flowed down her sleeves to form her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d said Anna once Miriel had finished solidifying. \u201cThat was incredible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Miriel\u2019s left head said as she adjusted her clothes. \u201cI am glad to see that I can reform myself within my clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, you mean you\u2019ve never done that before?\u201d Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that was my first attempt at doing so,\u201d Miriel\u2019s right head said. \u201cEven now, I am still discovering new aspects of my melting ability.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am also discovering extra changes to my body that had slipped my notice earlier,\u201d Miriel\u2019s left head said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor example, I was already aware that my shoulders had widened to accommodate for my second head,\u201d Miriel\u2019s right head continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever, I did not realise that my hips have also widened slightly. My feet are also slightly further apart from my normal stance, most likely to support the extra weight,\u201d Miriel concluded with her left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I, uh, I noticed something like that last night,\u201d said Anna, blushing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d asked Miriel\u2019s right head. \u201cHow so?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, um, you see,\u201d Anna began as her blush grew more intense. \u201cA-as far as I can tell, I, um, don\u2019t have... genitals, between my front legs. It\u2019s just blank skin here,\u201d she said, running a hand over her front crotch to demonstrate. \u201cEverything seems to have been... well, moved, so to speak, to my rear hips.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Miriel with her left head. \u201cHow curious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems there is still much to learn,\u201d Miriel\u2019s right head said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRegardless, I believe I will take my leave now,\u201d said Miriel with her left head as she picked up her notebook and the clothing alteration tome Anna had given her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna nodded. \u201cIf I find out anything new, I\u2019ll let you know later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be greatly appreciated, thank you,\u201d Miriel\u2019s right head said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her notebook and tome in hand, Miriel made her way out of Anna\u2019s shop. With Miriel gone, Anna turned her attention back to the display she had started to set up. After all, if she wanted to sell the potions and tomes, she needed to advertise them...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>An hour had passed since Anna had opened her shop for the day. The display advertising her new goods was finished, but nobody had entered her shop since Miriel and Cordelia had left. As a result, Anna was now bored out of her skull. She leaned forward, resting her folded arms against the counter. Her rear left foot idly kicked the floor while she crossed her front legs, cocking her front and back hips in different directions. Anna opened her mouth wide as another yawn took her by surprise. A lock of hair came loose and dangled between her eyes. Anna stared at the loose hair for a second, going cross-eyed in the process. She then gently blew the hair out of her face, causing the loose lock to flap around briefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna was brought out of her boredom when she heard the bell above the door ringing. Her eyes snapped to the door as a smile formed on her lips, only for it to fade slightly as she recognised the woman walking through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Miriel,\u201d said Anna. \u201cIt\u2019s just you.\u201d She then blinked, and looked at Miriel again when she realised something was off with her. \u201cWait, why do you only have one head?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be due to the fact that I am not actually Specs,\u201d the false Miriel said with a slight smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna frowned for a second, then remembered something from the previous day. \u201cGaius? Is that you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is correct,\u201d said Gaius with a nod. \u201cIf you will excuse me for a moment...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaius\u2019 body stretched out, growing slightly taller as he returned to his normal height. His breasts sucked in as his hips grew less pronounced, and the glasses on his face disappeared as his clothes began shifting as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh,\u201d said Gaius, shaking his head. \u201cWhy does Specs have to use so many big words? It\u2019s exhausting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take your word for it,\u201d said Anna. \u201cAnyway, is there something I can help you with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, there is,\u201d said Gaius. \u201cFirst of all...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gaius spoke, he reached out and poked Anna\u2019s arm. As he did so, Anna watched as Gaius began shifting again. His hair, eyes and clothes all darkened to the same shade of red as a cape formed behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, you could\u2019ve asked before becoming one of my sisters,\u201d Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Moneybags,\u201d Gaius said as he finished mimicking Anna, resting his index finger on his chin. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure you could see all kinds of ways to make a profit out of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe, maybe not,\u201d said Anna coyly as she also rested a finger on her chin. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t discuss my plans with a potential rival.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d said Gaius. \u201cThere\u2019s no profit in that. But this is only part of the reason I\u2019m here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he finished speaking, he once again began to change, shifting back into his original appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you wanted something other than to steal my identity?\u201d Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel too bad, I\u2019ve mimicked half the Shepherds at this point,\u201d Gaius said. \u201cChrom, Robin, Lissa, Vaike, Cordelia...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone that\u2019s used a potion or tome so far, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup,\u201d said Gaius. \u201cThat way, if they need to look normal for something, they can always pay me to take their place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClever,\u201d said Anna appreciatively. \u201cKind of wish I\u2019d thought of that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t work for you,\u201d said Gaius. \u201cAt least not while you\u2019ve got that extra pair of legs behind you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you saw me earlier, right?\u201d said Gaius. \u201cHard to disguise myself as Specs when I\u2019ve only got one of her heads.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you can\u2019t mimic the changes made by a potion or a tome,\u201d said Anna. \u201cI remember that from yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Gaius. \u201cBut did you test the opposite? Let\u2019s say I give myself four arms, then mimicked someone. Would I lose the extra arms while mimicking them? Or would I look like a four armed version of whoever I\u2019m pretending to be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...  don\u2019t think we tried that,\u201d said Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood thing I\u2019m here then, Moneybags,\u201d said Gaius, reaching into his pocket and pulling out a stack of gold coins. \u201cOne potion, please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019ll be one thousand gold,\u201d said Anna. \u201cAnd seriously? Moneybags?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, it was the best I could do,\u201d said Gaius, counting out coins for Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d said Anna. \u201cSo, any preference for a potion? Or do you want me to pick?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Now standing in the room were three identical Cordelias, one fully dressed and two stark naked, all moving in sync with their hands over their privates. Her eyes darted between her bodies, all of her seemingly unsure of where to focus. It was clear that the tome did grant a controllable ability rather than a single second body, but rather than removing her second body, Cordelia had inadvertently created a third.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiriel was naturally the first to recover, and was already postulating over the strange development. \"Interesting,\" she said, continuing to alternate between heads as she spoke. \"It would seem you do possess some amount of control over the number of duplicates after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda had the opposite effect, though,\" Lissa's War Cleric body mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone else could speak up, Cordelia was clamping her eyes shut again. \"I think three is a bit more than I can handle,\" she said, sounding a bit distressed. She seemed to be getting a bit overwhelmed by the sensory overload of three sets of eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, much like how every tome thus far has grant the user control over some kind of ability, every ability has allowed the user to retain their normal appearance while the ability is not in use. Theoretically, this duplication tome should allow the same,\" Miriel suggested. As much she was intrigued by this new development regarding the tome's effects, Cordelia's distress was a bit more pressing than her experiments at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you just got flustered and made a mistake when you tried to get rid of your other body?\" Chrom said, remembering the difficulty he had in controlling most of the tomes at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, or maybe two is the lowest you can go, so you created a new one instead,\" Lissa suggested with her Sage body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, in the meantime,\" Anna interrupted, thinking ahead in case Cordelia couldn't remove her extra bodies, and wanted to reduce the amount of naked people in the room, \"Sumia, would mind...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumia nodded, already understanding what Anna was going to ask. \"Don't worry, I'll go get her some clothes,\" she said simply, before getting up and making for the exit. She didn't stumble even once, though whether that was due to her new eyes or not was debatable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Cordelia uttered quietly, the typically composed knight feeling a bit out of her element at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Anna called behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Returning to the topic at hand,\" Miriel stated, \"Both Chrom and Lissa's suggestions appear to be equally likely. Cordelia, would you mind attempting to remove one of your bodies again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure this is safe?\" Cordelia asked, all three bodies still acting in unison. \"What if the tome only lets me create more bodies and not remove them? What if I end up with four bodies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's up to you,\" Anna interjected before Miriel could say anything more. \"If you don't want to try again, you don't have to. I've still got the restoration staff if you want the ability removed properly, although I'm afraid I will have to charge for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia was silent as she considered her options. She could try removing her bodies again, but for all she knew, she could end up creating more. She could have her duplication ability removed with the restoration staff, but she had promised Gregor that they'd both use one of Anna's items, and she somewhat felt like this would be cheating her way out of that. Of course, she could always choose neither option, and simply try to get used to having three bodies for the time being, until she decided what she wanted to do about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gregor?\" she asked, still not daring to open her eyes again. Three sets of ears hearing was already a bit much, all the murmuring around the dining hall being duplicated threefold, she wasn't ready for three sets of eyes seeing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregor seemed to already have an idea of what was on Cordelia's mind, and placed a reassuring hand on her original body's shoulder. \"Do not have worries,\" he said, \"Gregor is supporting you not matter what you choose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gentle smile came across all three of Cordelia's faces. \"Thank you,\" she said, her bodies nodding. It was reassuring to have him in her corner as she tried to overcome this odd situation she'd put herself in. After much thought, doing her best to tune out everyone else's idle chatter, she finally came to a decision.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Robin closed her eyes, holding her hands to her face as the potion's magic made its effect on her. She had seen how Chrom reacted, but she still hadn't expected it to be this painful. Eventually the pain subsided, and Robin tried to open her eyes again, only to find she couldn't anymore. While some light had slipped through her eyelids before, she now stood in complete darkness, as if the sun had gone out. Her fingers felt the area her eyelids had previously been, only to find smooth skin in its place. She had lost her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she could no longer see, Robin slowly lifted her head up and lowered her hands so the others in the room could see what had happened. All of a sudden, her ears were assaulted by a jumble of voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...\" \"Uhhhh...\" \"WOAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, the reactions seemed my louder than they'd been before. Robin covered her ears, unable to handle the jumbled loud noises reaching her. For a moment, it seemed like some blurry, monochrome images were starting to reach her vision, but they quickly faded away as the room began to quiet down. She heard some muffled footsteps, and then felt someone place a hand on her shoulder. Hesitantly, she lowered her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, Robin?\" she heard Chrom ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I, I think so,\" Robin said, unsure. Even her own voice seemed louder now, and when she spoke, she could have sworn she could see Chrom's face, despite lacking eyes. \"I, I just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom pulled her into a hug, which Robin reciprocated. \"It's alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is ridiculous,\" Robin heard a voice say that she assumed to be Maribelle. \"How is this \"seeing things differently\"? Poor Robin can't see anything now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that is the trouble with trusting the vague descriptions Anna's supplier has given. They seem to be deliberately written in such a way as to give false expectations of their effect.\" The next voice seemed to be Miriel, and naturally, each sentence sounded like it come from a slightly different place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll get the restore staff. I doubt she'll want to stay like this.\" Next was Anna's voice, although she was quieter than the rest. Robin was still able to clearly hear her, though. As the conversation was going on, however, Robin realised she was able to see the group standing just a little was away from her. Obviously she didn't have eyes to look at them with, but when they spoke, it was like a blurry images of the shapes that made up the surrounding area was forming an image in her minds eye, but only while they were speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" Robin spoke up, still wrapped in Chrom's arms, \"I think I can see... sort of. It's like I'm, seeing through sound, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seeing through sound?\" \"How does that work?\" Lissa's voice piped up from two completely separate directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but when you were all talking, it was like I could make out an image of the area around us in my mind. Although it seems clearer when I'm talking myself.\" While the others in the room were talking, her mind's image seemed kind of blurry, but it was much sharper when she herself spoke. Still monochrome, and missing some detail, but still much clearer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Echolocation.\" That was Miriel's voice. \"Some animals are able to locate objects around them by emitting a call and listening for the echo as the sound reverberates off of objects. That would also explain her earlier reaction, as she would likely need more sensitive hearing to accomplish such a feat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that's what it means by \"seeing things differently\",\" Robin heard Anna say. \"Anyway, I take it you want to be restored now?\" Robin could hear footsteps, as the blurry shape of Anna approached.</span></div></div>",

Anna\u2019s new body was dressed in the same red Trickster uniform Anna normally wore, identical to the clothes she had been wearing on her original body before she\u2019d become a humantaur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I work late, I stay here overnight,\u201d Anna\u2019s humantaur body said. \u201cI\u2019ve taken to leaving a spare set of clothes here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that both your bodies are here, perhaps it is time we discuss what we do next,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to head out and man the front desk,\u201d said Anna\u2019s new body. \u201cSince this body is normal, I can take care of any business I might get while you\u2019re testing the new potions and tomes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she finished speaking, Anna\u2019s new body turned and walked out of the storeroom, leaving Anna\u2019s humantaur body with Miriel and Lissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure you\u2019ll be alright?\u201d Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body asked. \u201cYou just got that body, after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna\u2019s humantaur body nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll just be standing and talking with my new body, anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, then,\u201d said Miriel. \u201cHow do we wish to proceed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I could use another potion or tome on this body,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s War Cleric body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr, I could go out and get another volunteer,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s Sage body. \u201cWith my War Cleric body, I mean. Obviously, I can\u2019t go out like this.\u201d Lissa\u2019s Sage body gestured at her centre leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you could use the duplication tome as well, Miriel,\u201d said Anna\u2019s humantaur body. \u201cThat way we\u2019d have a fresh body to test a potion or a tome on.\u201d</span></div></div>",

She'd sold quite a few Master Seals in the past, and she'd never seen one give anyone the wrong class before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. It would seem that despite your bodies not promoting simultaneously, they were both forced into the same class regardless,\" Miriel mused with her right head, before continuing with her left, and continuing to alternate thereafter. \"Perhaps a change in one body sets up the potential for a change in the other, but it still requires the proper energy to set off the change. This could potentially create complications during testing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Lissa's new body asked, as both her bodies turned to face Miriel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, for example, if we were to alter one of your bodies using one of the tomes, it could potentially set up the potential for the same alteration to occur in the other body, only requiring the introduction of magic to set it off. That could then interfere with the effects of a second tome, and falsely give the impression that both tomes performed the same alteration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if we only alter one of my bodies, then?\" Lissa's original body suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or we could use a tome on one and a potion on the other,\" her new body said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Miriel could reply, Anna interjected, having silently watched the exchange for the most part. \"Are you sure you two are the same person?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Lissa's new body asked, turning to face Anna with a look of confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's just, the way you suggested that almost made it sound like the second Lissa didn't want to get left out, and suggested something where you'd both be altered.\" Anna rocked back and forth on her heels, still finding the sensation of having four legs to be rather strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Lissa's original body asked, looking at her new body, which had turned to face her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess it did sorta sound like that,\" her new body continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do control both bodies though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not separate people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna only found that exchange to be even stranger, as if Lissa was having a conversation with herself, when in reality, she was just alternating which body was saying which sentence as Miriel had been doing. Regardless, she kept her mouth shut this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" Miriel interjected with her left head, trying to steer the conversation back on track, \"I do believe it should be acceptable to try another tome or potion on at least one of your bodies. If nothing else, it should allow us to see how a transformation in one body affects the other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa didn't need any more approval than that, as both of her bodies headed over to the supplies, her old body looking through potions while her new body examined the tomes.</span></div></div>",

Thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa smiled at her clone. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps it would be best if you came up with a new name for yourself,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head. \u201cTo help you distinguish yourself from Lissa.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s probably a good idea,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s clone. \u201cUm, how about Liz?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a lovely name,\u201d said Lissa with a smile. \u201cNice to meet you, Liz!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course you\u2019d like it,\u201d said the newly-christened Liz, rolling her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m you, remember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re Liz,\u201d said Lissa. \u201cJust because we have the same memories doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re the same person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I suppose you\u2019re right,\u201d said Liz. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to take some getting used to, that\u2019s all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to find you some clothes,\u201d said Anna, walking off to a different part of the storeroom. \u201cYou can\u2019t stay naked forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz blushed, and tried to cover herself up with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a question for you, Liz,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you still be interested in helping us test out these potions and tomes, or would you rather not be involved?\u201d asked Miriel\u2019s left head.</span></div></div>",

Why does that woman have two heads? And who am I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, hey, it\u2019s okay, we\u2019re not gonna hurt you,\u201d said Lissa, holding her hands out placatingly. \u201cWhat\u2019s the last thing you remember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember anything,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s clone. \u201cI don\u2019t know who you are, or who I am, or anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Lissa slowly. \u201cWell, to start with, my name is Lissa, that woman over there is Anna, and the woman with two heads is Miriel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to meet you, I guess,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s clone. \u201cBut you still haven\u2019t told me who I am, yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s because, um... how can I say this gently...? You, er, you don\u2019t have a name,\u201d said Lissa nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t? Why not?\u201d asked Lissa\u2019s clone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell... because you didn\u2019t exist until just now,\u201d said Lissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa\u2019s clone cocked her head in confusion. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa sighed. \u201cGuess there\u2019s no way to avoid this,\u201d she said. Lissa picked up the tome she had dropped during her duplication and held it out to her clone. \u201cYou see this tome? I used it to cast a spell that would allow me to be in two places at once. That spell created you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCreated me?\u201d Lissa\u2019s clone asked. \u201cSo I\u2019m only a few minutes old?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Lissa, nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that would explain why I don\u2019t have any memories,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s clone. \u201cAnd why I\u2019m not wearing any clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re not upset to know that?\u201d Lissa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa\u2019s clone furrowed her brow in confusion. \u201cWhy would I be upset by that? I know who I am now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but... you\u2019re just a copy of me,\u201d said Lissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure about that?\u201d Lissa\u2019s clone asked. \u201cWe might look identical, but I\u2019m not you. I\u2019m me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell... yeah, but...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAm I acting like you? Talking like you?\u201d Lissa\u2019s clone asked, crossing her arms over her naked breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, no,\u201d said Lissa. \u201cNot really.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t have your memories, either,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s clone. \u201cI might have been created by magic, but I\u2019m still me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess you\u2019re right,\u201d said Lissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad you agree,\u201d said Lissa\u2019s clone with a smirk. She then started looking around again. \u201cNow all I need is some clothes. And a name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go get you some clothes,\u201d said Anna. The shopkeeper walked over to a different area of the storeroom, searching for clothes that would hopefully fit Lissa\u2019s clone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs for a name...\u201d said Lissa thoughtfully. \u201cHow about Liz?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa\u2019s clone shook her head. \u201cSounds too close to Lissa for my liking. I want something different.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cElizabeth?\u201d asked Lissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa\u2019s clone was silent as she thought for a few seconds. \u201cYou know what? Sure, I\u2019ll go with Elizabeth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa giggled, and held out her hand. \u201cNice to meet you, Elizabeth. I\u2019m Lissa.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth smiled, and shook Lissa\u2019s hand. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you too, Lissa.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI brought you some clothes,\u201d said Anna, walking up to Elizabeth with a bundle of clothes in her arms. \u201cThey probably don\u2019t fit properly, but it\u2019s better than nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Elizabeth, taking the clothes from Anna and quickly dressing herself. Once she was fully clothed, Elizabeth turned to face Miriel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I was created by magic,\u201d said Elizabeth. \u201cIs that how you got your second head?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiriel nodded her heads. \u201cI drank a potion that caused me to grow a second head,\u201d said Miriel\u2019s left head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs mentioned earlier, Lissa used a tome to create you,\u201d continued Miriel\u2019s right head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you be interested in testing the potions and tomes with us?\u201d Miriel\u2019s left head asked.</span></div></div>",

While he had taken to the task of leading his group, he found it difficult to plan for battles especially in locations he was unfamiliar with. It had been a good couple hours since he confined himself to his tent and he reaching the point where he thought he might lose his mind. The fact he hadn't had anything to eat in a while didn't help either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Lord Corrin! I finally found you!\" a voice chimed in from behind. The voice belonged to non other than Charlotte, a young woman that was a part of his small army. She entered the tent with a smile on her face, carrying something in her arms, \"I heard you've been cooped up in this tent for a while, so I made a wonderful lunch for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you! That's very thoughtful of you!\" Corrin responded, noting his grumbling stomach once again. \"This is admittedly exactly what I needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte looked ecstatic, \"Really? I'm so happy to hear that!\" she said, handing over the packaged food, \"I poured my heart and soul into this so, I really hope it's to your liking milord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin took the lunch box in his hand and unpacked it, eagerly shovelling spoonfuls of the meal into his mouth, \"This is fantastic Charlotte! The flavours are amazing!\" the prince said, between mouthfuls. After a few more bites Corrin began to feel a bit odd, in fact he felt a little bit tired, \"Uh... I uh... don't feel so... good...\" he muttered slowly succumbing to unconsciousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he completely blacked out he could have sworn he heard Charlotte speaking, \"Thank you milord... you've help more than you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He sat up slowly, his mind still foggy due to the drowsiness of having just woken up but felt that something was a little bit off. First thing he noticed was the long locks of golden hair that felt just into his vision, and as he brushed them away, his now rather dainty hands were brought to his attention. Corrin's eyes widened at this realisation as he stared at the foreign hand that was now moving to his whim. He look down to see he was now wearing a rather skimpy outfit that left his midriff, the inner parts of his thigh exposed, barely covering his now rather empty crotch area. On top of this, the upper half of the outfit barely contained the incredible voluptuous bust that he now had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he even had the chance to react he heard a voice behind him, \"So you're finally awake\". As Corrin turned around he was met with a very familiar face, his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what's going on?\" she said, hearing the rather ladylike voice speaking for him for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you see for yourself.\" the young man replied, gesturing at a nearby mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin frowned in response but took his copies advice, mincing towards the mirror and taking note of the weird way his hips swayed and his breasts bounced as he moved. As he stepped in front of the mirror he saw the image of a young woman dressed in rather skimpy clothing with long blonde hair, tied into place with a large white bow. This rather feminine looking girl was none other than Charlotte, the two of them must have swapped places! \"Why? How?\" Corrin stuttered, a little confused by the whole situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was getting tired of trying to seduce you to marry into a life of royalty...\" Charlotte said in reply, \"So I found a way to get that life for myself.\" he smiled clearly pleased with himself. \"So, now the roles a reversed, you can live my life out as you wish but if you want to take your place amongst royalty again, you'll have to do the charming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin was left in shock, she didn't know how to respond to this.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Corrin's armor turned black from the waist down along with the sleeves. The armor softened as it turned into silk. Next the armor separated at the thighs as his top became a dress. The bottom of his new dress billowed out as the shoulders also puffed up. By now Elise could tell what was happening, but didn't know what to do. Corrin also noticed the change and became embarrassed as he tried to hold the dress down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shoes were next as the heels grew out to become a pair of high heels. Corrin almost fell over not being used to wearing heels and not being able to balance properly. The leg armor was now thigh high heeled boots and the top billowed out as well. The next change was a small bit of physical changes. His skin softened and smoothed as the body hair dissapeared. The last physical change was his hair lengthened and split off into tightly curled pigtails. Most of his hair stayed the same color, but some strands turned purple like his older sis. The pigtails were tied up with black ribbons.  By now Corrin realized that his clothes were becoming like his little sisters. The final changes were pink bows formed on his thighs as the boots were wrapped around with pink ribbons. One more pink bow was at his collar as small parts of his dress became pink. Finally his yato became a healing staff as Corrin stood there in shock. Elise was confused, but she thought it was pretty funny to see her brother dressed like her. It made her feel like he was a twin sister to her. She decided to stay out of sight because Corrin would be suspicious of her since he was wearing her clothes. All Corrin wanted was to get out of sight as he rushed off to his private quarters to change.</span></div></div>",

Corrin was shocked by his thoughts, as his heart started beated faster . He didn't know why, but he seemed to be lost in Leo's eyes. The spell that changed Corrin's clothes also made him now attracted to guys. Corrin had a very hard time denying his feelings as he started falling for Leo. As they got up, Corrin noticed that he was hugging Leo snuggling up to him. His lips were only inches away from Leo's and it was making him blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Leo's part he was shocked and confused. He thought at first that it was his younger sister Elise, but it was actually his older brother Corrin looking like Elise . He didn't know how to feel as his brother cuddled with him. He had to admit that Corrin looked awfully cute dressed like that. Leo didn't want to say anything about that as he asked Corrin why he was dressed like that, while carefully prying Corrin off of him. Corrin still had a bright blush on his face while he fiddled with the hems of his dress. He felt so embarrased, but at the sane time happy that he was caught looking like this by a cute boy. Corrin giggled softly as he told Leo that it happened out of nowhere. Leo guessed it ws some sort of spell, especially considering what happened to Corrin's hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo told Corrin that he would get to the bottom of it and help Corrin. Corrin however, was too distracted to listen as he daydreamed of Leo carrying Corrin, and looking longingly into his eyes. Not knowing how to handle the situation, Leo left to figure out how to help Corrin. Corrin snapped out of his daydream and noticed Leo was gone. Corrin realized he was starting to crush on Leo. He knew he should try to do something so he decided to find Elise. He searched for her thinking she might be involved or know something. Eventually. He found her and went to ask her help. Corrin was torn between his desire to get the spell undone and the romantic feelings  that it gave him.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Corrin was merely walking around the castle leisurely. Not too long ago, he was stuck in his own castle unable to leave or see the outside, so having another location wonder around was a breath of fresh air. Sure, the current situation with his two families was a little messy but it was nice to have a break from all the politics, violence and fighting that war involved. As he was walking he started to feel a little dizzy. His footsteps gradually becoming uneven he steadied himself against the wall as his vision started to blur and his head started to throb. Then suddenly, all his senses dropped out and he felt nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't sure how much time past but suddenly he regained consciousness, finding himself kneeling on the floor. Blinking his eyes a few times to clear his vision he saw that he was still in the same hallway, however the sensations his body was sending him were telling him something was off. Turning his head to the side to look around he was caught off guard by the strange feeling of two weights hanging from his head. He quickly darted his hand up to his head and pulled forward two very long locks of blonde hair tied together on both sides by black hair ties. His investigation only brought attention to his hands which were not only covered in what appeared to be black gloves but were also rather small and dainty, the those of a young girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly looked down at himself and noted what he was wearing, groaning internally. At his neck was a pink bow with an ornate silver rose at it's centre resting above what appeared to be a silver torso piece with black lining similar to the armour he usually wore, however with how tight fitting this was it was clear that he was no longer himself. From under the silver outer layer, his outfit billowed out into a knee length black dress with a pink lining decorating the hem of the skirt. \"W-what...\" he started to utter only to be caught off guard by the girly sound of his voice. While he had his hunches on what had happened to him he needed to confirm it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith help from the wall to his side he slowly stood himself up, now becoming aware of the high-heeled boots that were around his feet. He took a few unsteady steps forward and made his way down the hallway. As he walked it became apparent that the changes he observed as he was on the ground earlier barely scratched the surface. After getting a rhythm of walking in these heels he found that the way his body moved as he took each step felt vastly different. The breeze against his bare legs was distracting as he had never worn a dress before and as he walked his now long locks of hair could be felt bobbing with his steps. As he past a couple maids along the way he noted how wear it was that while we usually looked down at them they now towered clearly above him. He tried to shake these thoughts from his mind as he stepped into his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking across the room he made his way to the full length mirror, his reason for coming here, and was confronted with what he feared. Looking at his reflection he saw a young girl, her hair in twintails held up by two black ribbons on each side framing the young juvenile face. She wore a black dress with puffy shoulders and black gloves, lined with pink at the hem and covered with an outer silver layer around her hips and chest, and her feet were clad in black high heeled boots which he could now see were now decorated with pink ribbons. Between the dress, the boots, the bow at her chest and the earrings he now wore, the amount of pink in the outfit he was wearing made the whole ordeal a lot more embarrassing. As he moved, the girl in the mirror moved, and it was hard to deny that he had suddenly become his little sister Elise, the young budding princess of the Kingdom of Nohr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm, hello?\" Corrin was suddenly snapped out of thoughts by a voice. Turning around he found himself face to face with his own body, or at least the one he was suppose to have. \"Is that you big brother?\" Corrin's body said to him. It didn't take a lot of detective work to figure out who it was inhabiting his body right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elise?\" he responded, the squeaky voice escaping his mouth still a little jarring to hear. His body simply nodded in response. He took a couple steps closer to 'himself' taken aback by how much taller his body was than him at this moment, \"So... any idea how this happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Elise said from his body, \"I wanted to help you out so I decided to try a spell from this book I found but, something went wrong...\" she explained, fidgeting uncomfortably, it was a little weird seeing his body act this way. \"But, I think I can fix it!\" she continued, pulling out the book in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin honestly wanted to trust in his sister but after the way things turned out already, it was clear that maybe letting her cast spells from the book willy-nilly wasn't a great idea. It would probably be a better idea to find someone more experienced to help them out of this situation. On the other hand, if it's simply reversing what happened, maybe it would be simple enough for Elise to do without any worry.</span></div></div>",

He did find the experience being her for a bit fascinating, however he didn't exactly like the idea of staying this way for much longer. Any option that got him back to normal quicker is definitely preferred, and it was just a simple reversal of the spell after all. \"Okay, lets get this over with!\" Corrin said eagerly, the enthusiasm in his voice scarily sounding exactly like the usual Elise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElise began chanting the spell as magical energy began to build around them. It was a strange feeling but his vision began to blur and his head began to throb much in the same way it did when the spell was first cast. The spell appeared to be working with an issue! As the sounds of magical energy started to fade away, Corrin slowly opened his eyes and saw that he was still standing in his room. Rubbing his eyes he looked up and saw his original body still standing there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... I don't think that worked...\" the boy in front of him muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin looked down at herself and sure enough was greeting with the body of a young girl once again. A little bit of worry started to set in looking up at the boy in front of her \"So... what do we do now Big Brother\" she said, her voice marked with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure...\" Elise mumbled in response, \"Wait, what did you call me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin's eyes went wide in shock, she had just called Elise in her body 'big brother', and what's more she didn't even think anything of it until it was pointed out, \"Oh no, I think the spell messed with our heads!\" she said in panic. The more she thought about it, it was true. She was no longer bothered by what she was wearing, in fact she thought the outfit looked rather cute. All the knowledge of swordplay and milltary tactics were gone, now replaced with knowledge of etiquette and spellcraft, and the way her mind formed thoughts was very different to how it had been a few moments ago. She couldn't even remember how long 'she' had been referring to herself as a female. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, we can't lose our cool otherwise we won't be able to figure out what to do\" said Elise, having clearly gained your personality in the similar fashion that you now thought like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the room together you both decide that the best course of action now is to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Elise cast the spell, she continued to watch Corrin, waiting for it to take effect. She wasn't sure exactly what it would do, but just in case it wasn't something he liked, she did her best to hide from view so he wouldn't know it was her who did it. However, she eventually started to grow impatient as nothing seemed to be happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a disappointed sigh. Either she'd done something wrong, or the spell had just been a dud. Or at least, that's what she thought. As she turned away, she missed seeing that Corrin had begun to stumble, suddenly feeling incredibly drowsy. Of course, that didn't really matter, as Elise soon because to feel the exact same way. She was a bit startled, as while she assumed this might have had something to do with the spell, she was pretty sure it wasn't supposed to effect her. She didn't have much time to think about that, however, as she, alongside Corrin, soon passed out, all of her senses fading to black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin groggily opened his eyes, groaning a little at how uncomfortable the floor seemed to be. Though his mind was still a little foggy after waking up, he seemed to recall that he was walking down the hallway of the castle when a sudden wave of drowsiness came over him, eventually causing him to pass out. He had no idea what had caused it, but he hoped it wasn't anything serious, like an enemy spellcaster or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he slowly sat up, he couldn't help but feel like something was wrong. His armour felt so much lighter and softer than it had before, and it felt like there was something hanging from either side of his head. Rubbing his eyes a little, he looked down at himself to see what was going on. In an instant, he was wide awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGone was his black and white armour. Instead, a somewhat cute black and white dress with pink trimming covered his body. The sleeves poofed out and tucked into a pair of tight black gloves. His feet were no longer bare, now encased within a pair of black, high heeled boots wrapped in pink ribbons. Though he couldn't see beneath the dress, he could tell from the way his bare and strangely smooth thighs rubbed together that he was no longer wearing any pants. His underwear seemed oddly soft, and he could feel something similar tightly wrapped around his flat chest. As he frantically took stock of his body, he caught sight of a pair of large, curled pigtails, reaching all the way down to his hips, clearly being the thing he could feel earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, Corrin recognised the outfit he was wearing, and the hairstyle he'd been given; it belonged to his younger sister, Elise. But why was he suddenly wearing Elise's clothes? At first he thought this might be some sort of prank, and someone had put him to sleep and and dressed him up like this, but that didn't really make sense. If these were really Elise's clothes, they should be too small for him, but nothing felt too tight, as if it were perfectly tailored for him, and it didn't explain how his hair had become long enough for Elise's hairstyle. Something strange was going on, and he needed to get to the bottom of it, preferably before anyone saw him dressed as his little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What's going on?\" Corrin heard a voice say from around the corner. Naturally, he recognised the voice, as it belonged to the very person whose clothes he was wearing; his younger sister, Elise. Quickly getting up to his feet, Corrin headed around the corner, somehow managing to not stumble in Elise's heels. There, he found Elise sitting around where he'd been when he passed out, although much like him, she wasn't dressed in her usual attire. Instead, she wore the very same black and white armour he'd previously been wearing, and her hair seemed to have shortened itself into his usual style, although she had kept her own hair colour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big brother?\" Corrin called out, only to immediately cover his mouth once he realised what he'd said. That wasn't what he'd been trying to say at all. It sounded more like what Elise would normally say to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elise, I- Ah!\" Elise responded, reacting in a similar way once she realised what she'd called Corrin. \"That, that wasn't what I meant to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any idea what's going on?\" Corrin asked. He doubted she knew any more than he did, but considering they were in the same predicament, it seemed worth a shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElise looked around nervously, trying to see if there was anyone else in the hallway. \"I, um... Come with me!\" Elise quickly got up and took Corrin by the hand, practically dragging him back to her room. Presumably she wanted to make sure no one saw them like this while they discussed what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they ran, Corrin couldn't help but ponder about ahow natural Elise's clothes felt. They were incredibly different to his old clothes, but he almost felt like he'd been wearing this sort of thing for years. He had no trouble navigating the halls wearing Elise's heels, he knew how to move in a skirt so as not to expose anything, even his incredibly long hair wasn't proving cumbersome for him. Overall, though different, everything felt as comfortable as his own clothes would have been, and he didn't really understand why. Something had clearly changed beyond their clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they reached Elise's room, Elise lead Corrin inside of shut the door behind them, giving them ample privacy to talk. \"So, what's going on?\" Corrin asked. If Elise was acting that frantically, she must have known something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I, uh, I may have cast a spell on you without asking. I'm sorry,\" Elise replied, guiltily looking down at her now bare feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's alright. I'm not mad. But, why did you cast a spell that'd swap our clothes?\" While the ordeal had confused Corrin quite a bit, he was thankful that Elise's spell seemingly hadn't done anything worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's not what it was supposed to do... At least, I don't think it was. I can't really remember now, for some reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even thinking, Corrin said, \"it was supposed to make you into a better version of yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElise seemed a little startled by Corrin's sudden answer. \"Uh, yeah, that's it. How did you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin was equally startled, considering he was pretty sure there was no way he should have known what kind of spell Elise was performing. \"I don't know. It just sort of... came to me, I guess. Anyway, could you reverse the spell now? Your clothes are pretty comfortable, but I don't really want to be seen wearing them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Corrin's request, Elise seemed to be focused on other things, and was staring intently at something. \"Uh, Elise?\" she said, once again using the wrong name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite what she'd said, Corrin was more concerned about what she was looking at, and turned his head in the same direction, only to let out a small gasp. \"What the...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair was looking at the full length mirror that hung from the wall of Elise's room. Corrin expected to see himself reflect wearing Elise's clothes, but what he was saw something entirely different. Reflected on the mirror's surface was the same old Corrin and Elise that they'd always been, only their positions were reversed. Where Corrin stood in Elise's clothes, Elise stood in the mirror, wearing her usual outfit, and likewise for Elise and the Corrin in the reflection. Corrin slowly raised his hand to confirm what he was seeing, and the reflected Elise copied his actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on earth is going on?\" Corrin asked aloud, watching as Elise's reflection mimicked his mouth movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe... Maybe the spell made it so that everyone thinks we're each other, but we still see ourselves as normal?\" Elise suggested, trying to rationalise the bizarre situation they'd been put into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess. If I'm you now, then that'd explain why I know something only you would know, and why we keep messing up each other's names.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Turning away from the mirror, Elise looked over at her desk, which held the spellbook that had caused all of this in the first place. \"We should probably try to fix this. I don't really want to be you for the rest of my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, me neither.\" Corrin approached the book, reading what was written on the open page, although it all seemed very familiar to him now. A small frown appeared on his face. \"Um, I know this is the spell that swapped us, but that's not what it was supposed to do, right? How do we know it'll actually do that if we cast it again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I guess we don't know that,\" Elise replied, suddenly realising that swapping back might not be as easy as she hoped. \"Well, there's still a chance it'll do the right thing. Or, maybe we can find a spell that's supposed to do what this one did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin shook his head. \"I've never seen a spell like that before,\" he said, even though it was Elise's knowledge of spells he was tapping into and not his own. \"Although there could be something on this sort of thing in the library.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do the pair decide to do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>But before the pair could even think about casting another spell, there was a knock at the door. Corrin and Elise instantly froze in place, unsure of what would happen were anyone else to see them this way. Until the door opened and in walked Kaze, the green haired Hoshidan ninja, and more importantly Elise\u2019s husband. He looked around the room with his usual stern expression, though once he spotted Corrin and Elise, his face formed into a smile.<br>\r\n\u201cAh! Here you are Elise!\u201d He said with a voice of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly making his way towards the pair, Kaze opened his arms wide in order to lovingly embrace his beautiful wife. However, instead of sharing his affection with the small Elise, he planted a deep affectionate kiss on Corrin\u2019s lips. Corrin jumped back in surprise, startled at Kaze\u2019s advances. At first, he tried to push Kaze away and break the kiss. But as their lips continued meshing, tongues colliding in an exchange of saliva, Corrin found it harder and harder to escape. His face became red and flushed, heart beating faster and faster. His tongue eagerly played along with Kaze\u2019s, as his loins began to stir up in a heat. Was he\u2026 Was he enjoying this?<br>\r\n\u201cKaze!\u201d Elise yelled in distress. \u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, anyone here was not enjoying the moment it was definitely Elise. She couldn\u2019t believe Kaze was making out with Corrin! However, rather than being jealous she wasn\u2019t the one kissing Kaze, she was more upset at the fact that Kaze and Corrin were displaying their show of affection in front of her. In fact, the thought of kissing Kaze herself kind of grossed her out. Why would she kiss some ugly guy when she could kiss beautiful girls? Elise gulped. This spell was more powerful than she thought! It was already altering her mind heavily, she needed to turn back as soon as she could!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing Elise\u2019s discomfort, Kaze finally broke the kiss with Corrin. \u201cAhh! Sorry about that Lord Corrin.\u201d Kaze said, catching his breath. \u201cForce of habit.\u201d<br>\r\nElise forced an anxious smile. \u201cI-I-i\u2019s fine.\u201d She sighed. \u201cWhat brings you here anyways, Kaze?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Right.\u201d Kaze piped up. He turned towards Corrin, who was still hazy from the kiss. \u201cDarling, little Midori has been acting up for a while and I can\u2019t get her to calm down. I think she needs her mommy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaze\u2019s words bounced around Corrin\u2019s dazed head. Midori wanted him? He was a\u2026 \u201cMother?\u201d He unintentionally uttered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Kaze dutifully replied. \u201cI think she might be hungry. Unfortunately, she hasn\u2019t quite gotten used to the bottle, so I figured if you weren\u2019t busy you could maybe come and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBreastfeed?!\u201d The words burst out of Corrin\u2019s mouth. With his mind still in the clouds, Corrin could barely process what was happening. Kaze wanted HIM, to breastfeed his daughter? But Corrin was a boy! Could he even do that? Yet, at the same time, Midori was his daughter. What kind of mother would he be if he couldn\u2019t at least do that for her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d Elise interjected, before Corrin could give an answer. \u201c\u2019Elise\u2019 here is very busy right now, so she can\u2019t help you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but big brother!\u201d Corrin cried out.  \u201cLittle Midori isn\u2019t even a year old. As her mother, I can\u2019t leave her in distress like this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Elise really wanted to yell at Corrin that he wasn\u2019t Midori\u2019s actual mother, but given that Kaze was here, she decided to stay calm. That kiss really must have done a number on Corrin. He was still blushing and sweating, with confusion painted all over his face. Her memories must have started to mix with his, so she couldn\u2019t let him leave. She had to find a way to change them back before it was too late!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cNO!!\u201d Corrin yelled out, his heart beating quickly, his emotions running wild. \u201cMy little daughter needs her mother right now! I need to go to her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith tear drops forming in his eyes, Corrin dashed out of the room at full speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cElise, no!\u201d Elise yelled in distress as Corrin darted through the door and into the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, she began to chase after him, feeling a new-found surge of speed and power she\u2019d never felt with her tiny body before. However, just as she reached the door, it suddenly shut close right in front of her. A look of bewilderment appeared on her face. Frantically, Elise tried to turn the doorknob, only to find that the door was locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the-?\u201d She whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Lord Corrin.\u201d Suddenly Kaze\u2019s voice came from the other side of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKaze?!\u201d Elise asked angrily. \u201cDid you do this? Open this door right now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t do that Lord Corrin.\u201d Kaze responded calmly. \u201cWhile you might be the leader and commander of this army, I\u2019m sorry to say that the wishes of my wife and child supersede those of my master.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElise could feel her teeth grinding. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry!\u201d Kaze continued. \u201cIt won\u2019t take long! Once Elise is done, I\u2019ll send her right over to you, alright?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Kaze disappeared as fast as he\u2019d appeared. \u201cKAZEEEE!!!\u201d Elise yelled out furiously, as she smacked the door with her fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaa\u2026 Haa\u2026 Haaa\u2026\u201d Corrin huffed tiredly, exhausted from all the running he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped in the middle of the hallway, placing his right hand on the wall to support himself. Gosh he was so out of shape. This was all because he always let his horse carry him all over the battlefield, instead of walking through it for himself. Maybe he should take up Camilla\u2019s offer for some sister-on-sister exercise\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin shook his head madly. He didn\u2019t use a horse to travel the battlefield! Gah! Having Elise\u2019s life was causing her memories to jumble up his mind. And apparently they were also making his body weaker. Corrin sighed. Thanks to his new girly emotions, he\u2019d unintentionally run away from Elise and gotten himself in an even bigger mess than before. He should probably head back to his room and try to find a way to fix this before things really got out of ha-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLady Elise?\u201d Out of nowhere, Kaze suddenly appeared behind Corrin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKa- Kaze!\u201d Corrin yelled in surprise, his cheeks becoming red as he stared into the ninja\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m very sorry to have caused you and your brother to fight, but I really needed your help.\u201d Kaze said calmly. \u201cAlthough I will say, I\u2019m very happy you chose to help Midori and I over him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-of course Kaze!\u201d Corrin spoke confidently, grasping Kaze\u2019s shoulders and staring into his eyes. \u201cI love you and Midori more than anything in the world. I wouldn\u2019t give either of you up, even for my brothers or sister.\u201d The words had all come out of Corrin\u2019s mouth instinctively. Corrin blushed even harder as he realized what he said, averting his gaze from Kaze\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Elise.\u201d Kaze said with a smile. \u201cI also love you and Midori more than anything in the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaze\u2019s sweet voice made Corrin\u2019s heart flutter in joy. He couldn\u2019t understand how happy they made him. If Corrin didn\u2019t know better, he\u2019d actually believe he was the one who\u2019d fallen in love with Kaze, and not that these were Elise\u2019s feelings transferred into him thanks to the swap. Yet, at the same time, the sensations of affection felt so real to Corrin. Almost as if it wasn\u2019t possible for them to be directed at anyone but him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026 You look tired.\u201d Kaze told him. In an instant, Corrin found himself in the arms of Kaze, being carried by the ninja as if it was no problem. \u201cShall I take you to my room then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearts formed in Corrin\u2019s eyes, joy bursting in droves into his mind. \u201cY-Yes please!\u201d He said dreamily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd without wasting a single moment, the two were off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Corrin drew near to Kaze\u2019s room, he began to see what to see what the problem was. Far outside of the room, he could hear Midori\u2019s loud cries and wails. It was actually quite impressive that such a small child could make such a large amount of noise. Stopping before the door to his room, Kaze let Corrin down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we are.\u201d He said with a sigh, opening up the door for Corrin. \u201cPlease come in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin complied without second thought. Stepping into the Hoshidan\u2019s room, it was quite noticeably different from his. The furniture was much more simplistic and less ornate, with everything dyed to Kaze\u2019s signature green color instead of Corrin\u2019s favorite pink. But the part that really mattered was in the corner, a large wooden crib where the loud cries were coming from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to waste no time, Corrin quickly made his way to the corner of the room, with Kaze dutifully following behind him. A little bit of Corrin was scared that he wouldn\u2019t be of any help. He had no experience with children after all, and most importantly he was a boy. But another part of him was determined. This was his- err- Elise\u2019s daughter in pain, and he was the only one who could do anything to help her. What kind of person would he be if he didn\u2019t help?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as Corrin stepped before the crib and took a look at the wailing baby, a loud gasp left his mouth. He ducked inside of the crib and placed the young child within his arms, carrying her with the utmost of care. As he brought her up close to him, he could clearly see her face to face. It was the young baby Midori, with hair that was as white as the snow in the Hoshidan mountaintops. Hair that was as white as\u2026 his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all the proof Corrin needed. This was his daughter, beyond the shadow of a doubt. He was her mother. Anything that said otherwise was fathomably untrue. The feeling of joy that swelled his heart as he watched over her were undeniable. This young crying creature he held in his arms, he loved it more than he\u2019d loved anything else in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFilled with newfound determination, Corrin quickly undid the top part of his elaborate dress. He slid the left strap of his bra off his left arm, letting the padding fall to reveal his exposed nipple to the cold air of the room. Then, with motherly care, he gently lifted Midori\u2019s mouth up to it, allowing the baby suckle away at her mother\u2019s tender nip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, doubt and anxiety filled Corrin\u2019s mind. Yes, he was Midori\u2019s mother, but was also still a boy. The spell had only swapped his and Elise\u2019s life. Would he be able to produce milk for his hungering daughter? But as soon as Corrin felt his nipple tingle, all his worries washed away. Almost as if by magic, milk began to pour from Corrin\u2019s nipple and into Midori\u2019s young mouth. Corrin didn\u2019t know how to explain it, but he didn\u2019t care. His daughter was drinking his milk happily, so he was happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin began to rock his arms side to side lightly as Midori eagerly sucked his nipple. She was so beautiful, the way she hungrily suckled at her mother\u2019s teat, how plump and cute her cheeks were, and how soft and pretty her white hair was. Corrin just couldn\u2019t help but stare down lovingly at the beautiful creature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy to see the scene that was unfolding before him, Kaze stepped forward and placed his arms on Corrin\u2019s shoulders. \u201cBeautiful, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Kaze asked Corrin, looking down onto Midori with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe most beautiful thing in the world.\u201d Corrin responded confidently, not wanting to turn away from the baby. Though this time, the words that came from his mouth were completely intentional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d Kaze laughed jovially. \u201cMaybe the second most beautiful thing in the world\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giggle escaped Corrin\u2019s mouth. \u201cOh yeah? And what\u2019s the most beautiful thing then?\u201d He asked, turning towards Kaze with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou.\u201d Without any warning, Kaze leaned down and planted a kiss on Corrin\u2019s unsuspecting lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time though, Corrin didn\u2019t fight it. On the contrary, he entirely embraced it, meshing his lips and moving his tongue with all the joy in the world. All this love Kaze was giving him, Corrin didn\u2019t want to reject it. It made his heart beat faster, his blush grow redder and his penis grow\u2026 harder. At this point, he couldn\u2019t deny it any longer. Corrin was in love with Kaze. He was in love with Midori. He was in love with being a mother, with being a wife, with having a\u2026 family. This moment, Corrin wouldn\u2019t exchange it for anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, as their lips departed, Kaze and Corrin stared lovingly into each other\u2019s eyes. Kaze smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my\u2026 What a naughty mother.\u201d He said, placing his hand over Corrin\u2019s hardened bulge. \u201cGetting aroused while breastfeeding?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKyaaa! Kaze!\u201d Corrin yelped, trying to move away from his hand. \u201cNot in front of Midori.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaze wasn\u2019t about to let up though. He put his body closer to Corrin\u2019s, rubbing his hand gently over his wife\u2019s erect penis. \u201cOh, come on darling. I\u2019m sure little Midori wouldn\u2019t mind sharing her mother for a minute.\u201d He said, planting little kisses in the base of Corrin\u2019s neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his attempts proved unsuccessful \u201cNo!\u201d Corrin yelled with feign anger, slapping his hand away from Corrin\u2019s crotch. He stomped away from Kaze, his face forming into Elise\u2019s signature pout. \u201cI\u2019m going to feed Midori and then I\u2019m put her to sleep. And until she\u2019s sleeping cozily in her crib, we are NOT doing any playing around. Understood?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d Kaze responded with a smile.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Elise sighed, her hands pressed against the door. How could things go so wrong? All she'd wanted was to help Corrin, but now she was stuck in Corrin's life, locked in her old room, and Corrin had run off with her husband. To make matters worse, though, she could feel her own memories starting to blend with Corrin's. Corrin had clearly already fallen to the same fate, Kaze's kiss muddling his mind so much he could no longer distinguish his own thoughts from those her life had forced upon him. She was doing the best she could to fight it off and retain some sense of self, but the longer she stayed like this, the harder it became to keep Corrin's thoughts separate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd had a look over the book that contained the spell that had done this to them, but she wasn't able to make heads or tails of it. Despite still remembering that she was the one that cast the spell in the first place, it seemed all of her knowledge of magic was stuck inside Corrin's head, leaving her with his swordplay skills. She might still be able to cast it, but she was worried about screwing things up even more. It wasn't as if she had much to lose at this point, but for all she knew, she could accidentally end up switching their bodies to match their lives, or making them forget about who they really were. No, this would have to wait. At the very least, she'd need Corrin to come back and work the same magic she'd done, and at most, she'd need to find someone more experienced with magic to try and figure out what she did wrong, and how to fix it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of that mattered if she couldn't get out of this room, though. Kaze's insistence on having \"Elise\" come with him had left the real Elise trapped, stuck with Corrin's mind trying to eclipse her own. No matter how much she rattled the doorknob, it refused to open, having been blocked from the other side. She wasn't sure exactly what Kaze had done, as the door could only be locked from the inside, but regardless, she wasn't going anywhere until it came undone. As luck would have it though, amidst the silence of the room, Elise began to hear a noise; approaching footsteps. Someone was coming down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Is anyone out there? Please let me out of here!\" Elise shouted, rattling the door once more, hoping to get the attention of whoever it was. She needed them to let her out. She couldn't be stuck here with Corrin's thoughts any longer.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly, Elise heard the footsteps stop briefly before moving in her direction. \"Yes!\" She jerked up in excitement. She would finally be able to leave this room and set things back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unknown figure fumbled with the door for a bit, shaking and nudging it in order to get it to open. When the delectable clicking sound of freedom finally rang sweetly inside Elise's ear. Slowly, the door swung open, revealing none other than the sensual well endowed big sister of the Nohrian family, holding some sort of shuriken in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Camilla! You don't know how glad I am to see you!\" Elise beamed up happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Camilla lunged towards Elise, wrapping her hands around the girl in an enormous bear hug. \"Mmmm and I'm glad to see you, my dearest Corrin~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vibrant red blush colored Elise's face as her head was nestled between Camilla's massive breasts. Usually Elise wasn't adverse to giving her big sister hugs, but something was different now. Her heart beat faster, her organ quenching with desire. It was like being close to Camilla's magnificent mammaries was fogging up her mind. Mmmmm... Her beautiful sister Camilla... What she wouldn't give to-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping out of her trance, Elise quickly pushed herself away from Camilla's embrace. \"I-I-I n-need t-to go-o-\" She stuttered as she tried to make her way out of the room. This spell was having a terribly strong effect in her mind. It seemed like even Corrin's sexual preferences were transferring onto her. If she didn't fix this soon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before Elise could successfully exit, she was pulled back inside by Camilla, who forcefully embraced the girl from behind. \"Aww... I thought you said you were glad to see me. Why do you have to leave so soon?~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElise felt herself having trouble breathing with both of Camilla's breasts hanging on top of her shoulders. \"I need- find- Elise- Kaze-\" Elise's words were barely able to come out of her mouth, her thoughts quickly devolving into an incomprehensible mess of lust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, so you're playing some sort of game with Elise and Kaze? That's wonderful!\" Camilla exclaimed. She wrapped her arms even more tightly against Elise's body. \"I guess that explains why the door was locked with this little thing. But really Corrin, you have to let me join more of your games! I would love to play along with you and Elise. Especially if it's just you~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat poured down Elise's face at unprecedented rates. She was breathing so fast it could be considered hyperventilating. Her mind ran amok with dirty thoughts of what 'games' she wanted to play with Camilla. The marvelously spectacular Camilla was within her grasp. But the door was also just a few steps ahead.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Corrin was wandering the halls of the castle at the time in the morning as he often did. It wasn't long since  he had come to the main castle, and despite all the bad things that have happened between his two families lately, it was liberating having the freedom to wondering around. It was a lot more than he was afforded while he was locked away for most of his life. As he walked suddenly his movement became more rocky, and his steps started to become more unsteady. It was a feeling almost like falling asleep out of pure fatigue, no matter how hard he fought it he couldn't stop his eyelids from slowly closing as the world began to spin around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly the spinning stopped. Slowly he opened his eyes to find his surroundings completely changed from the hallway on the outer perimeter of the castle to the quiet library closer to the centre of the castle grounds. It wasn't only his surroundings but everything about himself felt different, from the way his clothes hugged his body, to the way his hair cascaded around his face. Wait, his hair hadn't been that long before had it? In realisation of this he looked down to see something he never thought he'd see in his life. Long lavender coloured hair ran down from his hair all over his shoulders and no doubt down his back and around his neck and draped over his shoulders was a purple cloth with gold and white edging fastened with a black sash that ran around him and through the valley of cleavage he now possessed. Around his torso was a piece of black and gold armour which showed off a generous amount of cleavage and hugged his now hourglass figure. This all looked incredibly familiar, however he'd never see it from this angle before. Quickly he got up with the intention of investigating himself in a mirror only to almost stumble, only just catching himself on the nearby desk to prevent his fall. His centre of gravity was completely thrown off and on top of that he wasn't aware of the high heeled boots he now wore. He quickly gained his composure and carefully made his way to the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he took each step he was hit by how different everything felt. Because of the new balance of his body and the footwear he now donned each step he took moved his body in a different way. The way his hips swayed side to side with each step along with the jiggling of his breasts was much too foreign for him, however with each step he took it started to come naturally to him until there was almost nothing wrong with it. He could barely remember how it use to feel to walk the way he use to by the time he made it to the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFacing his reflection he saw a mature women with long wavy lavender hair in front of him. The woman wore black armour around the torso which cut off at her breasts, framing the large orbs nicely for all to see. The armour also hugged her figure rather tightly leaving nothing up to the imagination. She had dark coloured gauntlets on her arms that ran all the way to her shoulders, where a thin piece of purple cloth hung around her neck and down her shoulders. On her feet were black knee high, high heeled boots and under them a material that ran to her upper thigh. Oddly, despite the armour that she wore her crotch area was completely exposed showing off her black and gold undergarments, only being obstructed by a sheer transparent lavender cloth that draped from her waist. With every move he made the image of the woman mirrored her, there's no doubt that somehow he had become his older sister, Camilla, the Bewitching Beauty of the Nohr Kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strangest thing about looking in the mirror in this form was that, he didn't feel weird at all. He did know who he was, he was Corrin born of Hoshido but raised as a child of the Nohr royal family, but looking in the mirror and being as he was now felt normal. He wasn't embarrassed by his rather revealing attire, he felt empowered by it. He was interrupted abruptly by his old body rushing into the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I finally found you!\" your body said to you, \"I'm sorry, I didn't know this is what would happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a moment to catch your breath darling, then tell me how this happened.\" You replied, for the first time that husky mature female voice escaping from your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla from your body, explained the spell and the situation that you were both in as promptly as he could. After hearing the explanation you decided...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Corrin was wandering the halls of the castle fairly early in the morning. Despite everything that had happened recently, he was still somewhat glad to not be confined to the Northern Fortress anyone, and to be able to go wherever he wanted. It felt rather liberating compared to the confinement he had experienced earlier in life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked, though, he suddenly started to feel as if something was slowly pulling him forward, forcing him to walk a bit faster. \"Huh? What's going on?\" Corrin wondered aloud. He tried to force himself to stop and stand still, but all that resulted in was him almost falling over. He wondered where this force was taking him, as it continued to pull harder. Eventually he was practically sprinting through the halls just to keep up with this force pulling him along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't keep it up for long. As he sprinted, he ended up tripping. He expected to fall to the ground and tumble along the ground due to how fast he was moving, but the ground never came up to meet him. Instead, the force simply continued to pull him through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the force pulled him around a corner, Corrin suddenly saw another person being pulled through the air. It was his big sister, Camilla, although she seemed to be being pulled backwards rather than forwards. \"Big sister!\" Corrin called out, hoping to warn her before they collided. He tried to move out of the way, but he was unable to change his trajectory, his feet not even touching the floor anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corrin?\" Camilla asked, looking behind her. That was all she was able to say, though, as the two collided in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin expected to feel the pain of colliding with something at such a high speed, or hear the clang of their armour knocking against each other, but there was nothing like that. The collision actually felt rather soft, but the force hadn't subsided. He was still suspended in the air, and he still felt like he was being pulled forwards, pushed into Camilla's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Camilla, what's going on?\" Corrin asked, hoping his sister could shed some light onto the reason why he was currently suspended in the air, being pressed against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corrin, I... I'm not sure,\" Camilla replied. She knew this was likely because of the spell she cast, but she wasn't sure that this was all it was going to do. This wasn't exactly what she'd hoped the spell meant by \"bringing two people closer together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin frowned. So Camilla didn't know either. Trying to figure out how to deal with the situation, he tried to push himself off of Camilla's body, but to no avail. The harder he pushed, the harder the force pulling him towards her fought back. Even stranger, though, was that as he pushed, his armour and clothes seemed to be coming open at the front, revealing his bare body underneath. It wasn't just his armour though; Camilla's armour seemed to be coming open at the back. Corrin struggled to hold them apart, but with one swift tug, the force pulled then back together. Corrin expected to merely collide with Camilla again, albeit her bare back rather than her armour, but this time, it felt different, almost like he was sinking into her. He tried to pull away again, but found the skin of his chest to be attached to Camilla's back. There was nothing either of them could do to resist now, as the force continued to pull them closer together...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Corrin continued to struggle in vain, the force continued to pull his further into Camilla. Camilla wasn't able to see what was happening, due to Corrin being behind her, but she could certainly feel it. She didn't know what the feelings meant, but from the way Corrin was struggling, she could guess it wasn't good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin's body continued to be pushed against Camilla's, slowly changing from a simple skin-deep join to something much deeper. As Corrin's pelvis pushed against Camilla's rear, it slowly went from feeling like he was pressed against it, to feeling like it was stuck around the sides of his hips, to finally being his own. Looking around behind him, Corrin found Camilla's large rear and wide hips sticking out where his should be, although it was covered up a bit better thanks to his own armour merging together with Camilla's. His legs became thicker as well as they merged with his sister's, bits of his white armour connecting together with his Camilla's black armour, and parts of her boots peeling away to reveal their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the feminine shape of his legs and rear, Corrin was worried he was sinking inside Camilla, but as his pelvis finished conjoining with Camilla's he felt a certain part of his own body pop out the front. Even stranger, though, was that not only could he feel his own private parts, he could also feel Camilla's, giving their conjoined body both male and female reproductive organs. That definitely seemed to catch Camilla's attention, as her hands shot to the bulge she now possessed, thankfully being covered up by Corrin's tights as well as Camilla's panties. Corrin had already been rather slim, so not much seemed to change as their torsos merged, save for more of Corrin's white armour wrapping around them and joining Camilla's. It wasn't until his chest was pushed further into Camilla's back that more obvious changes started to make themselves known, as he began to be able to feel Camilla's breasts as if they were hanging from his own chest. Of course, now that his chest had merged with Camilla's, they WERE hanging from his own chest. Thankfully, the combination of their armour seemed to cover them up better than Camilla's alone had, and the strap that ran between her breasts vanished, in favour of his cape draping over the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all that had happened, Corrin expected their arms to merge as well, but oddly enough, they remained separate, his own arms sitting just behind Camilla's, giving their shared body four arms in total. Similarly, their heads remained separate, as Camilla's head moved to the left a bit to make room for Corrin's head atop their shoulders. And with that, the force pulling them together finally ceased, and they slowly dropped back down to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin could scarcely believe what had just happened, but of course, the evidence was right in front of him. The body he now possessed seemed to mostly be that of his sister, but he still had his own arms behind her's, his own head next to her's, and a certain part of his anatomy hanging from their crotch. Some parts of their anatomy might have changed a  bit thanks to the introduction of Corrin's body in the merger, but Corrin couldn't tell right now, besides the obvious bits of his armour merged in together with Camilla's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over to his left, seeing Camilla's head situated next to his own. She was still looking down at their shared body, probably in shock at the whole thing. \"Camilla?\" he asked, hoping to get her attention so that they could try and figure out how to undo this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corrin, I... I'm sorry,\" Camilla said, not looking him in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This... may be my fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I used a spell to bring us closer together, but I never thought this would happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin sighed. Even though Camilla had technically caused this, he couldn't really blame her. After the drama between his family in Nohr and the Hoshidan royal family, he could understand why Camilla would want them to be closer together, even if the spell had some unintended results. They were certainly closer now, so close that they were literally joined together. He might have to try and spend some more time with her after they fixed this just to make sure she didn't try anything like this again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Where's the book you found the spell in?\" Corrin asked, doing his best to think of a way to reverse this now that he knew the cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the castle's library.\" Corrin nodded. That made sense. Not only was the library the most likely place to find a spellbook, but they currently seemed to be standing about halfway between the library and where Corrin had been standing before all this started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's head over there. Hopefully the book also says how to reverse the spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin took a step forward, wobbling slightly due to Camilla's heeled boots. He tried to take another step, but his body refused to move. He certainly had feeling in his left leg, but wasn't able to control it at all, no matter how hard he tried. And then, all of a sudden, it moved on its own. \"Wha?\" he mumbled as he felt the leg move without his input.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems I control out left leg, while you control our right,\" Camilla answered, having figured out why their left leg wouldn't move on Corrin's command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin let out another sigh. They'd really need to learn to work together even if they wanted to accomplish something as simple as walking. At least they both had their own set of arms. \"Well, alright then. Let's go.\" He took another step, and then waited for Camilla to move their left leg again.</span></div></div>",

Corrin and Camilla found themselves having to alternate who was taking each step, and brace for the other people so that they wouldn't fall over. They managed to get into a rhythm eventually, but it was still slower than walking normally. Thankfully, they didn't happen to run into anyone on their way there, keeping their conjoined state a secret for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It should be right over here,\" Camilla stated, leading Corrin over to a small desk within a secluded corner of the library. Just as she stated, the book was there, open on a page concerning a spell for bringing people closer together. Why the spell had been given such a vague title, Corrin had no idea. Perhaps whoever made the book simply wanted to cause chaos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see a way to reverse it,\" Corrin said, quickly reading through the text on the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't be so sure.\" Camilla pointed to a section at the bottom of the page labelled \"Related Spells\". \"Our reversal spell may be one of these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean \"may be\"?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've read through the book before, and I couldn't find a proper description for any of these related spells. All I know is they're supposed to be used after this one, or in conjunction with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we're just going to start casting random spells on ourselves until something works?\" That didn't sound like the smartest idea to Corrin. Admittedly, he wasn't too well versed in magic, but playing around with unknown forces seemed like it would just make things worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you rather us be stuck together for the rest of our lives?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay, good point. Go ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod, Camilla turned her head back towards the spell book, and read out the first related spell, hoping it would undo what the original spell had done.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Corrin should have known something was off from how little had seemed to change in the way his body felt. Looking down at himself, he found his body still clad in his usual black and white armour, but from the way it was shaped, it almost seemed like he was still merged with Camilla. He still had what looked like a large pair of breasts hanging from his chest, and his hips, rear, and thighs were inflated to feminine proportions. If he didn't know any better, he would have said that the separation spell had given him Camilla's body instead of his own, but that didn't seem to be the case. His skin was nowhere as soft, smooth, or sensitive as it had been when he was merged with Camilla, he still seemed to be at around the same height, just shorter than Camilla was, and he could still feel his male genitalia nestled between his womanly thighs. It seemed like he had his body back, but it had been given Camilla's figure, giving him ample feminine curves despite him still being a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, Corrin found that Camilla seemed to be in a similar situation, only in reverse. Her curves has more or less vanish, leaving her with Corrin's boyish figure. She was still female, as Corrin could tell she still had a very small pair of breasts on her chest, but like Corrin, she had still been altered dramatically. They both seemed to have their armour refitted to match the ways their bodies had been altered, which Corrin was a little thankful for at least, since his original armour would almost certainly be too tight for Camilla's figure, while Camilla's armour would fall right off of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't seem to have worked correctly,\" Camilla said, stating the obvious as she slowly picked herself off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that again,\" Corrin agreed, getting up as well. \"So what now? Are we just stuck like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back over to the spell book, the feminine sway in her hips greatly reduced, Camilla suggested, \"Perhaps if we merged and separated again, then it might get it right. Or perhaps one of the other related spells could separate us properly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe there's a spell that can swap us back to normal without merging us?\" Corrin asked, not fond of the idea of having to go through merging with Camilla again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps. Alternatively, we could always just stay like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not exactly fond of losing my figure, but we're separated again, and despite appearances, I'm still a woman and you're still a man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's really going to believe I'm still a man when I look like this?\" Corrin said, grabbing at his inflated chest with one hand. It felt like a breast to the touch, but it seemed nowhere as sensitive as the real thing, leaving Corrin to believe it was just a sack of fat on his chest to complete the figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still a man where it counts, aren't you? Anyway, it was just an idea, in case you're not comfortable with more experimenting to try and get us back to normal.\"</span></div></div>",

Nothing like this had happened when he and Camilla had first merged, the spell just squished them together without any sort of light or fanfare. This related spell was clearly doing something, but Corrin was pretty sure it wasn't doing what they wanted it to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if triggered by that thought, the spell suddenly kicked into action, lifting their shared body just slightly into the air. Corrin could feel a similar pulling sensation to the one he felt the first time, when it had pulled him and Camilla together, only this time, it seemed to emanating from inside of him. Before he could even really react, their body suddenly felt like mush, compressing together as if it had lost all solidity. Barely a gasp was let out by the two of them before their body was simply a blob of flesh, swirling around and mixing, surrounded by their armour. Corrin could swear he could hear Camilla's thoughts alongside his own, and she could hear his, the two minds intermingling. After what felt like ages, but was really just a few seconds, their body began to solidify again, stretching and shifting as body parts surfaced from the mass. Only one body formed from the mass, the pair still stuck together, but it was no longer the same body they'd shared just moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the spell finally ended, Corrin and Camilla reopened their eyes to see just what it had done to them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Almost immediately, the pair could tell their body had changed, simply from the different way the sensations were aligned. Oddly enough, it almost seemed that the parts that had not merged previously were now merged, while those that had were now separate, but stuck together in odd ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin tried to turn his head to look over at where Camilla's had been, but all of a sudden, his neck stopped, and it felt as if it were trying to turn the other way. However, despite that, he did seem to notice there didn't seem to be a second head to his left, and the sudden stop caused a couple purple and silver locks of hair to fall into his peripheral vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" The hum emanated from Corrin's mouth, but he wasn't the one who had done it, and it had come out in Camilla's voice. Getting an idea for what was going on, Corrin allowed his neck to turn the way it seemingly wanted to, looking over to his right. Once again, there was no second head to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We only have one head,\" Corrin said aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we both have control of it, it seems,\" said Camilla's voice, coming out of their shared mouth. Somehow, though they only had one mouth, it seemed their voice changed to match whoever it was that was controlling their mouth. In addition, though they only had one head, it seemed their minds were still separate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a sigh, Corrin looked down to examine the rest of their body, Camilla seemingly relinquishing control to allow him to do so. Strangely enough, his torso seemed completely normal, lacking the curves he'd gained when merged with Camilla. However, considering what he could feel behind him, he had a feeling her torso was still around here somewhere. Their arms seemed to have merged together, stuck to the sides of Corrin's torso, Camilla's black armour mingling with Corrin's white. Unlike their shared control of the head, it seemed their arms worked like their legs had previously, with Corrin controlling the right and Camilla controlling the left. Further down, Corrin could see what appeared to be Camilla's legs sticking out from under his torso, making a rather odd mismatch of body parts. A slight blush appear on their shared face as they noticed a slight bulge between Camilla's legs, Camilla's clothing doing little to hide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange as it may be to share a body with someone, the strangest was yet to come, as Corrin attempted to look around behind them, discovering that he alone controlled his torso, rather than sharing it with Camilla. Behind them, sticking out of where his his rear (or rather Camilla's, seeing as her legs were up front) should be, was Camilla's torso, merged into his by it's pelvis. This second torso pointed its front towards the ground, and its top away from them, leaving Camilla's breasts dangling at the rear like an udder. Where Camilla's head would normally be sat their shared rear, leading down to Corrin's legs, which, oddly enough, he could feel Camilla's genitals sitting between.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, their body seemed to have morphed into some sort of strange centaur-like shape, only made entirely of human parts rather than that of a horse. Experimentally lifting a leg, Corrin realised his could only control the back legs, those that were originally his, but though he could not control parts of it, he still had feeling in their entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is even weirder than the first time,\" Corrin mumbled. Even if it couldn't control them all, it felt weird to have four legs and two torsos all at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least we know that wasn't the right spell,\" Camilla said, attempting to be reassuring, brushing some hair out of their face. Their hair seemed to have mostly retained Camilla's length, but some of Corrin's wild flicks had replaced Camilla's bangs, and his silver hair colour streaked through her purple. Camilla looked down at the spellbook again, briefly fighting Corrin for control before he realised what she was doing. \"Perhaps we should take this somewhere more private. There are still a lot of spells in the list, we don't know how long this will take before we find the right one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Corrin asked, leaving a pause to make sure Camilla's was finished before he took control of their mouth. \"We got lucky on the way over here, but what if someone sees us like this walking through the castle? Not to mention, how do we even walk with four legs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...\" Camilla hummed in thought, wondering whether the risk would be worth it. For the time being, the library seemed deserted, but someone could show up at any minute. On the other hand, heading to one of their rooms would give them privacy, but it'd be a struggle to get there in their current form. She briefly considered casting the spell again in an attempt to reform them into a shape that was more easily managed, but decided against it, realising that it would just as easily leave them even more jumbled.</span></div></div>",

He knew she babied him from time to time, but he never would have expected her to do something like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's not like there's any rush, is there?\" Camilla put on hand on Corrin's chin, turning his head to face her's, and the other hand on their shared hips. Corrin still found it rather strange that he could actually feel Camilla's arms moving around even though he couldn't control them. \"It's not every day you get to experience what it's like to share a body with someone. Why don't we enjoy this for a while before we reverse the spell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin wasn't sure there was anything to \"enjoy\" about this. Not only was he stuck with a body that looked very feminine, ignoring the anatomy contained within his panties, but he only had control over half of it, and would be stuck next to Camilla the entire time. She was his sister and he did care about her, but she could definitely be a bit overbearing at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla, on the other hand, was starting to find the up-side of this magical mishap. This may not have been what she intended when she wanted to bring them closer together, but there was no way Corrin would be able to go back to his Hoshidan family while she shared a body with him, and they'd certainly grow closer due to the cooperation they'd have to use to move their body around effectively. This wasn't a permanent solution, of course, but once she was sure he'd never have thoughts of leaving, then it'd be okay to separate them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I don't know. I still think we should check to book for a way to reverse the spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, darling? It would make your big sister ever so happy.\" She stroked Corrin's face, breaking his concentration for a moment. In that lapse, she took a step in the opposite direction of the library, dragging the foot Corrin controlled along with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Camilla...\" Corrin tried to do the same, but Camilla's foot stood firm. It certainly didn't help that he was still unfamiliar with wearing high heels. Resisting Camilla would prove difficult. She could probably force them to stand there in place until one of them gave up. Perhaps it would be quicker and easier to simply go along with what Camilla wanted. She'd have to get tired of being conjoined to him eventually, right? Then again, even if he couldn't force his way over to the library, maybe someone else would come by to help him.</span></div></div>",

He decided it would simply be easier to go along with what Camilla wanted for now until she let him get the book and reverse this. \"Alright, what do you want to do, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla smiled. \"Thank you, darling.\" She turned Corrin's head to face forwards again and gave him a kiss on the cheek. \"Let's head over to my room. I'd like to properly see what our body looks like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Despite not enjoying this as much as Camilla was, Corrin had to admit he was at least a little curious as to what their combined body looked like. He took a step forward, heading towards Camilla's room, which was followed by another step from Camilla. They continued this pattern as they walked through the halls, slowly getting into the proper rhythm and knowing when the other had finished their step. Their steps felt very different to start with; Corrin's steps were stiff and uncomfortable, while Camilla's felt much more natural, swaying her hips a little, much to Corrin's dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, they reached Camilla's room without incident, and Camilla immediately led them over to her mirror. \"Hm,\" she hummed as she turned their body this way and that, looking at it from different angles. From what Corrin could tell, their body looked basically the same as Camilla's, albeit with two heads, four arms, and armour that was a combination of his and hers. He reached down and pulled aside the cloth that hung from their waist, seeing the bulge that sat there. Despite the strangess of having both male and female genitals at the same time, he was glad to have at least some part of his male self on this rather feminine body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... it's basically your body, but with my head, arms, and... private parts attached.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite,\" Camilla replied, turning away from the mirror, and looking at it over her shoulder. \"Your body has still influenced our figure a bit. Our legs and hips are thinner than mine were, and our waist is a little wider.\" Corrin looked over their other shoulder at the mirror again. He never would have noticed details as small as that, but he supposed Camilla knew her body better than he did. Regardless of the influence his body supposedly had on their figure, they still looked more feminine than masculine, save for the bulge in their panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying anything else, Camilla's hands suddenly, moved around to their back, unfastening clasps on their armour. \"Woah, what are you doing?\" Corrin asked, reaching up and grabbing Camilla's wrists sho she'd stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Undressing. I can't exactly get a good look at our body with all this armour in the way, now can I?\" That was a blatant lie. Camilla's armour had hugged her body tightly, and Corrin's was rather form-fitting as well, so they were still able to get a rather good look at their body despite being fully armoured. Corrin was worried Camilla might want to do more than simply look at their body, but he had to admit that he was kind of curious to see it as well. However, if he let her do this, how deep would the rabbit hole go? How much more until she was satisfied and let him try to separate them?</span></div></div>",

This definitely wasn't the most ideal situation to be stuck in. He wasn't about to let Camilla leave them conjoined, but he doubted Camilla would be so easily persuaded. That left them in a stalemate, standing out here in the hallway, unable to move without the other giving up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla began to run her hands down their shared body, still fascinated by them being stuck together. Thankfully, they were still fully armoured, as as long as she didn't reach for their crotch, it wasn't too embarrassing for Corrin.

The moment she saw him and Camilla, though, she let out a shout. \"AH!

We're having a bit of trouble moving around, so would you mind getting the spellbook from the library for us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, actu-\" Camilla started, hoping to inform Elise that she didn't want to split apart of Corrin just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElise was too quick to reply though. \"A book with a spell to bring people closer together? Okay, I'll be right back!\" She quickly ran off in the direction of the library, wanting to help out her older siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really don't want me to have my fun, do you?\" Camilla asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Camilla, but when \"your fun\" involves being stuck sharing a body with someone else, I can't just go along with it.\" Corrin waited patiently for Elise to return with the spellbook, hoping the reversal spell wouldn't be too difficult to perform.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Corrin crossed his arms and tapped his foot on the ground, waiting for Elise to return, while Camilla looked away, disappointed that her brother would want to get away from her so quickly. However, before Elise returned, Corrin and Camilla both felt something they were rather familiar with; a feeling pulling them forwards, towards the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" Corrin said, realising what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this wasn't expected,\" Camilla said, also a little offput by the pulling. She took a step forward, doing her best to not let them get pulled over. Corrin followed her lead, moving their right leg forward as the force pulled them ahead. While Corrin had managed to keep his feet on the ground for quite a while when it first occurred, now he and Camilla each only controlled one of their legs, and it wasn't long before they lost they balance, and the force resorted to pulling them through the air. It seemed to go quicker this time, probably because they were closer to the library, and it wasn't long before they heard Elise's screaming as she was no doubt being pulled through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as they rounded the corner, their shared body collided with Elise's, their front facing Elise's back. Feeling that she'd come to a stop, Elise looked around behind her to see what she'd collided with. \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry!\" she quickly repeated, panic evident in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elise, did you cast the spell?\" Corrin asked, as their armour began to open up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean to! I was just looking for the book, and I read what was in it out loud. I must have cast it by accident!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin let out a sigh. He had hoped to resolve his situation, but ultimately only succeeded in making it worse. Having already experienced this once, Corrin and Camilla remained fairly calm as Elise's body sunk into their, while Elise looked around at their body in a panic, her hair flying this way and that. As Elise's body was introduced to the mix, their body changed a bit. For one, it became it bit shorter, thanks to Elise being younger than bother Corrin and Camilla. Certain parts of their body became slimmer or smaller, such as their thighs and breasts, although Camilla's voluptuous figure still seemed to dominate their body. Their armour took on a more girlish look as Elise's outfit worked its way into theirs, ribbons and bows wrapping around them, and a skirt billowing out from their waist. Finally, like with the first joining, Elise's arms and head remained separate. Elise's arms, the third pair of arms on the body sat just in front of Camilla's arms, while Corrin's sat just behind. Her head moved up to sit upon their shared shoulders with the rest of them, Camilla and Corrin's heads moving to the left a little to make room, leaving Camilla's head on the left, Elise's on the right, and Corrin's in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, a bit faster than the first time, the merging was over, and the three that were now one were lowered to the floor. Camilla was once again somewhat fascinated by the changes that Elise's introduction to the merger had brought to their body, while Elise continued to look around at their shared body, starting to look more curious than panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so... curvy,\" she said, noticing how much of Camilla's mature curves their body had kept. \"And... that's...?\" Now she looked down at their crotch, realising there were something hanging there that she wasn't familiar with. Were those Corrin's boy parts?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin didn't even know what to think at this point. Not only was he now sharing a body with two people instead of one, but between Camilla's figure and Elise's clothes, this was getting even more feminine, resulting in a rather embarrassing situation for him. He really needed to get to that spellbook and find the way to reverse this spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, perhaps we should go get that book from the library after all,\" Camilla mused. For a second, Corrin thought Camilla had changed her mind about keeping them merged, but he was quickly corrected. \"There doesn't seem to be enough room on our body for a fourth person, so it would be best to avoid having another person join us.\" She didn't want to separate them, she just wanted to avoid their body becoming too crowded. She was right though, it was already pretty crowded with three heads on the same body, so he could only imagine how difficult it would be to fit a fourth on there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, if they went and got the book from the library, he might be able to reverse the spell before Camilla took it from him. As such, Corrin had no objections to going to the library. He tried to take a step forward, using their right leg, of course, but nothing seemed to happen. He tried again, but still nothing. He tried moving their left leg, but that wouldn't move either. \"Hey, I can't move our legs anymore,\" Corrin said aloud, hoping Camilla and Elise might be able to shed some light onto why that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm,\" Camilla hummed. \"Elise, darling, would you mind trying to move our right leg forward?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Sure.\" Elise did as she was told, and just like that, Corrin felt their right leg step forward without this command. Next, their left leg stepped forward, once again without Corrin's input.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that I have control of our left leg, while Elise has control of our right. Since you're in the middle, you don't have a leg to control,\" Camilla explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat just made things even worse for Corrin. Not only was he stuck sharing this decidedly female body with body of his sisters, but he only had control over his head one of their pairs of arms. \"Let's... let's just go get that book from the library.\" He could only suggest it, and would have to rely on his sisters to walk their body over there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Elise answered cheerfully, taking another step forward, then waiting for Camilla to do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla and Elise quickly got into the proper rhythm of taking turns with their steps. Unfortunately for Corrin, they walked in a rather feminine way, swaying their hips to and fro, which was kind of embarrassing considering he could feel himself doing it, even if he wasn't the one controlling it. He looked over at Elise, who had been panicking when the spell was first cast, but now seemed to enjoying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin wasn't the only one who noticed. \"Say, Elise, what do you think about staying like this for a while?\" Camilla asked. She realised that if she could convince Elise to stay conjoined to herself and Corrin, then Corrin wouldn't be able to do much to fight back. They wouldn't even be stuck standing in one place anymore, as he didn't have control over either of their legs anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, really?\" Elise asked excitedly. She was finding this situation to be rather fun, as strange as it was. Since Corrin wanted her to get the spellbook for them, she assumed that they wanted to split apart again, but if they wanted to stay conjoined, she thought it would be fun to stay as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if your brother is okay with it, than I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElise looked over at Corrin's head. They were close together that if Corrin had turned his head as well, their noses would have been squished against each other. \"Please, big brother! I promise we'll take care of your well!\" She did mean that. Since Corrin couldn't move their body on his own, it would be up to Camilla and Elise to take care of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Alright,\" Corrin begrudgingly answered. He didn't like lying to Elise, but he was worried she might try to stall on their way to the library if he said no. He still planned to use the book to separate them when they got there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Elise shouted, a little too loudly considering how close she was to Corrin's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we should still go and get the book, for now,\" Camilla reminded. \"Then it'll be just us three together like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" Elise quickened her pace as they headed to the library, Camilla adjusting to match. Corrin really hoped he'd be able to figure out how to cast the reversal spell before Camilla and Elise put it away somewhere. He wasn't sure how much more of this he was willing to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they finally reached the library, they found that...</span></div></div>",

How would I cast the spell myself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking it over for a while, Camilla replied, \"Well, I suppose it's alright then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla and Elise walked their body over to the book, and Elise pointed at a passage on one of the pages, saying, \"That's the spell that merged us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin looked just below the passage, reading what was written there. \"And there's the spell to undo it,\" he mumbled. Now was his chance. He'd have to read quickly if he wanted a chance at this. Now that they'd confirmed that there was in fact a reversal spell, Camilla would likely take the book and put it away somewhere. He needed to quickly read the spell, and figure out how to cast it. He'd never tried spellcasting himself, but he'd seen Camilla, Leo, and Elise do it before, so he had some idea of how it worked. Not to mention, he now shared his body with two people who were already fairly good at casting spells, so maybe their shared body had some sort of magical energy he could call upon to help him cast the spell.</span></div></div>",

In his excitement at being separate again, he had barely even realised that his body felt different than it before they all merged. His head and arms still felt right, likely because they had never been merged, but the rest of his body felt off. Most importantly, the one masculine part of their rather feminine merged body seemed to have vanished now that he was separate again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe realised what he did. Being inexperienced with magic, he'd managed to mess up the spell to separate them, and although they were separate now, they hadn't been giving the correct bodies when they separated.

He'd ended up with his arms and head attached to his older sister Camilla's body. While he was glad to be free from Camilla's grasp, this certainly wasn't what he wanted. He turned around to look at his sisters, who he could only assume had wound up on the wrong bodies. He turned out to be right, as Camilla's head and arms were on Elise body, while Elise's were on his own. Neither seemed to be upset about the situation like Corrin was, although that was understandable considering neither had objected to staying merged either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this isn't what I expected,\" Camilla mumbled to herself, \"But I can work with this.\" She seemed to be thinking about something deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah... This kinda cool,\" Elise said, somewhat enjoying the feeling of being a man. It was rather different than what she was used to, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin sighed, realising he was the only one not enjoying the situation again. Doing his best not to trip over in Camilla's heels, he walked over to the table with the spellbook, in the hopes of fixing this and getting his own body back. Before he could get the book, though, Camilla quickly swooped in and picked it up off the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Corrin exclaimed, reaching out to take the book from her, only to stumble and fall over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come now, Corrin. You've already ruined our fun once, are you really trying to do it again?\" Camilla asked, stepping out of his reach as he picked himself up off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Camilla-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla cut him off before he could say anything else. \"Elise, you don't mind keeping Corrin's body for a while, do you? I know it's not what we agreed on, but this can still be fun, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure!\" Elise quickly replied. It wasn't every day she got to experience what it was like to be a boy, after all. She didn't even bother to ask how long \"a while\" was going to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, Corrin? You wouldn't want to disappoint both your sisters again, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... I...\" Corrin wanted to object, but even with her head on Elise's body, Camilla had such a commanding presence that it was hard to deny her. It certainly didn't help that he could barely even stand in Camilla's body, meaning that taking the book by force wasn't really an option, even with Camilla's body being much larger and stronger than Elise's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what to do with this,\" Camilla mused, looking at the spellbook in her hand. Corrin knew he had to get his hands on it so he could try and cast a spell to get his own body back.</span></div></div>",

She read out the words written on the page, and suddenly, Corrin felt like he had a splitting headache. Judging by the sounds Elise was making, it wasn't just him either. He held his hands to his head, hoping the pain would go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually it did, but something else felt wrong now. The armour on his arms felt heavier than normal, and it felt like he had a big weight hanging from the back of his head. As he opened his eyes, he saw the purple gloves and black gauntlets that covered his feminine hands, and his left eye could see nothing but purple hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" Corrin mumbled, hearing the feminine voice that came out of his mouth. Camilla had cast another spell, not to put them in the correct bodies, but to give them the head and arms that matched their body. Corrin now had Camilla's head and arms, along with the rest of her body. He looked up, seeing what appeared to be Elise and himself. If he was someone else observing the group, he would have simply seen Prince Corrin spending some time with his sisters, but as a part of this, he knew that none of the three of them were in the correct bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, cool,\" Elise muttered, realising what had happened. She let out a giggle, which sounded odd coming from Corrin's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. Now no one will realise what's going on, and try to end our fun prematurely,\" Camilla said, a sly grin adorning what used to be Elise's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo, good thinking, Camilla. Leo probably would have tried to fix it if he found out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I'll be taking this book back to my room. Didn't you two have a \"spa fortnight\" planned at the local hot spring? You're already packed and everything. Wouldn't want to be late, now.\" Camilla winked at the pair, before walking out of the library, spellbook in hand, still in Elise's body. She had it all figured out now. Although this wasn't her original plan, this could certainly work. After all, even if Corrin was thinking about returning to his family in Hoshido, would he really do so while possessing the body of his older sister? So long as Elise kept enjoying their little \"game\", she could keep Corrin in her body until he no longer had anymore thoughts of leaving Nohr. It was rather convenient that she'd planned her spa fortnight when she did, as it'd allow Elise to keep Corrin busy while she found a good place to hide the spellbook so Corrin wouldn't reverse the spell himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Corrin was even more worried than before. Now that Camilla had fixed up their heads and arms, everyone would just see him as Camilla, and any attempts to convince them that he was Corrin would probably be dismissed as crazy talk. He couldn't rely on anyone else to bail him out of this one. He figured the best course of action for now was to try and follow Camilla to see where she was hiding the spellbook, and the trying to get it once she had left it alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could follow Camilla, though, Elise suddenly spoke up. \"Well, what are we waiting for? We've got a hot spring to get to!\" She sounded far more enthusiastic about the situation than the real Corrin would have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, actually, Elise...\" Corrin tried to explain. He didn't want to go on this little trip to the hot spring, he just wanted his own body back. He hadn't even packed because he never intended on going, but judging by Camilla's statement, he had a feeling she'd gone ahead and packed for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? But you've already planned it, haven't you? Just because you're Camilla now instead of Corrin doesn't mean you should miss out.\" She walked over to were Corrin was still knelt on the floor to help him up. He still wasn't used to Camilla's body, or her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, Camilla planned it. I had nothing to do with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... you're Camilla now! So, how about we go an that spa fortnight you planned?\" An innocent little grin appeared on Elise's (Corrin's) face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin knew she meant well. She probably just wanted to spend some time together or something, and Camilla's spa fortnight created the perfect excuse. However, going along with it would mean spending the weekend in Camilla's body, and letting Camilla run off in Elise's body to hide the spellbook wherever she wanted. Although, after how stressful this morning had been, between being stuck on the same body as Camilla and Elise, and now being stuck in the wrong body, perhaps a nice relaxing weekend was what he needed, even if he'd be experiencing it in the wrong body.</span></div></div>",

She'd usually been rather obedient when he was her older brother, but now he was her younger sister, she commanded more authority than he did. Perhaps it would be quicker to just go along with whatever Elise had in mind, and search for the spellbook later?

Returning to these old halls was like a breath of fresh air to him, and despite the less than favourable circumstances between his two families, he couldn't help but feel at peace for just this brief moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Corrin, however, this momentary peace was about to be interrupted in an unbelievable way. It was imperceptible, save for a slight waver in the air, but a rush of magical energy was flowing through the castle, searching for something. Corrin didn't get a chance to see this energy, but he certainly felt it as it rushed right into him, disappearing within his body as it pushed him back a little, winding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What was that?\" Corrin stuttered as he steadied himself, trying to get his breath back. He didn't see anything, but it felt like something had rammed into his stomach. Unless his enemies were capable of making invisible weapons, he could only assume that his assailant had used magic, an assumption that only proved to be more likely once he noticed how his body felt... strange. That was the only word he could think of to describe it. It was as if his body, his flesh and body, and strangely even his clothing, was becoming soft and malleable, and a pulsing energy source from within his gut was sending ripples through him. The pulses grew in frequency and intensity, forcing himself to brace himself against the wall, or else he'd have collapsed to the floor. It felt as if he would explode if the pulses grew any stronger, and in a sense, that was exactly what happened, though not in a way Corrin could ever had imagined, even in his wildest dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now the pulses were so quick Corrin could scarcely tell one from the next, and it felt as if it were vibrating his entire being. It was at this point that the pulses began to reshape his body, so quickly that he had no time to process what was actually happening. One pulse rushed through his body, stretching it out to make him a little taller, and forcing his limbs into the right proportions. Another pushed flesh away from his torso, particularly his waist. His skin was made soft and delicate, as if he had put much time into taking care of it. His hand and feet were reshaped to become more dainty and feminine. The muscles in his arms and legs grew stronger, and yet less pronounced. Atop his muscles, a soft layer of feminine fat was placed, particularly on his thighs. His hips were forced outwards as his rear grew to match, and a certain something on the other side vanished within him. His chest exploded outwards, two large sphere hanging from his body. His hair rocketed outwards, trailing down to his rear as it covered one of his eyes. His face was restructured, taking on a decidedly feminine appearance, and looking almost sultry and seductive despite his situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough his body was already nigh unrecognisable, the pulses continued, this time reshaping his clothing. It sunk in at his waist, accentuating his curves, and opened to reveal his new breasts. His cape shortened up to his mid-back, and stronger plates appeared at his elbows. Large metal tridents hung from his hips, as material pulled away from his crotch to create some sheer drapings. His normally bare feet were encased withing armoured high heeled boots. Atop his head, a tiara came into existence, horns jutting from either side of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as quickly as it had started, the pulses began to slow back down, Corrin's body feeling like it was solidifying once more, though whether he could even call it his body anymore was debatable. He could do nothing but stare in shocked silence as he looked at the shapely female form he now possessed. He could barely even more without accentuating some difference within his body, from the swaying of his breasts to the void between his legs. Though despite the shock, there was something at the back of his mind, thinking there was something familiar about all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to me?\" Corrin said exasperatedly, before raising his hands to is mouth with a gasp. He recognised that voice. He sounded just like his big sister, Camilla. In fact, with that in his mind, he realised his body was now an exact replica of her's. Well, \"exact\" wasn't entirely correct. Strangely, though he certainly possessed her form, the colour scheme of his clothes had remained the same, his white, black, and blue taking the place of Camilla's black, gold, and purple, and his hair was still the same pale silver. Regardless of the difference in colours, he was still shaped exactly like his big sister, right down to the core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is impossible,\" he mumbled. Corrin had very little experience with magic, so in his world, what he had just experienced was completely unbelievable, and yet, the evidence sat right in front of his eyes. He couldn't be seen like this, he would be mortified beyond all belief. He needed to find a way to turn back to normal, and possible capture whatever villain decided to play such a cruel trick on him. But right now, he wasn't in the right state of mind to go looking for a solution; he wasn't experienced enough with magic to reverse it himself, and he was pretty sure he'd die from embarrassment if anyone saw him in Camilla's shapely form right now. For now, he needed to calm down and clear his head so he could think straight, and for that, he needed privacy. He could only pray he wouldn't encounter anyone on the way back to his room.</span></div></div>",

After hundreds of people, including Queen Mikoto, being killed in an attack on the capital, and the lost prince who had finally returned home turning traitor, the kingdom was in chaos. While her brothers and sisters did their best for the war effort, planning battle strategies and leading soldiers and the like, Sakura did her best to tend to the wounded, those who survived the attack, and soldiers who had been injured in other skirmishes with Nohr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her big brother being branded as a traitor, she wished for nothing more than for him to return. She wanted to believe he was still good on the inside, even though he chose to side with Nohr instead of his family here in Hoshido. She knew that returning would practically be suicide for him, now that he'd been branded a traitor, but after finally getting to see him again after so long, only to have him whisked away again, she wanted him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night, after returning to her room after a hard day of tending to the wounded, Sakura looked through a book she had gotten from Orochi. It detailed several charms that diviners would often use, and despite it being a foolish wish, she hoped there was something that would bring her brother back to her. She eventually selected something that sounded like it might work, a charm that would bring someone back to where they belong, and set about creating the charm. She didn't actually have all the herbs necessary for it, on account of not being a diviner herself, but it was more so meant to be like a good luck charm, something she could pour her hopes into. She didn't actually intend to magically make Corrin appear back in Hoshido. After finishing the charm, and writing Corrin's name on the front of it, she hung it on the back of her door, blew out her candle, and went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Sakura, the charm was indeed magic, although with some herbs missing or substituted, it wouldn't have the intended result listed in Orochi's book. Poor Corrin, having no idea what was happening back in Hoshido, would be in for quite a shock when he awoke the next morning.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Corrin slowly awoke after a somewhat restless night. He could vaguely remember having an incredibly strange dream. He could remember some sort of spirit, and it pulled his soul of his body, and flung it away. He didn't remember where his soul landed in the dream, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering his retainers hadn't come to wake up up yet, he could only assume it was still fairly early, but he felt well rested regardless, so he decided to get up. As he opened his eyes, though, he found himself in an unfamiliar room. He quickly sat up, a little panicked about where he was. This certainly didn't resemble his room, nor any he'd seen in Castle Krackenburg. In fact, from the items strewn around the room and the general architecture, the entire place looked for more Hoshidan than it did Nohrian. Having sided with Nohr, and been branded a traitor by his Hoshidan family, that worried him more than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked around, taking in the entire room, something odd caught his attention. However, this time, it was not something about the room, but rather something that darted in and out of his vision every time he turned his head, as if it were hanging on the sides of his head. He reached up and pulled it around to where he could see it. It was hair, long brown hair. It looked nothing like Corrin's own hair, but from the tugging sensation on his scalp, it seemed like it was indeed attached to him. That oddity then drew his attention to the hand holding the hair. While it still showed signs of labor, it was much smaller, and more feminine looking. Fear furthered its grip on him, as his eyes followed down the slim, but strong, arm attached to the hand, all the way down to a young, female body, clothed in some sort of nightgown. ...HIS young, female body, clothed in some sort of nightgown, he realised. Considering her perspective, he could think of no other explanation. Not to mention, the lacking feeling in his crotch made it obvious he lacked an important part that designated him as male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What happened to me?\" Corrin wondered aloud, hearing a feminine voice escape his lips. He quickly got up off the bed, finding himself to be a lot shorter than he used to be, and searched for a mirror. The only one he could find was a small one sitting atop a nearby dresser, but it sufficed for what he needed it for. In the mirror, he saw the face of a young girl, one he'd never met before. \"That's... me?\" The girl in the mirror matched his mouth movements. Somehow, he had become this girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, he heard a knock at the door. \"Hana, are you in there?\" he heard a voice on the other side say. He recognised the voice, having just heard it some days prior; it belonged to his Hoshidan younger sister, Sakura. Judging by what she'd said, Corrin could only assume that the girl whose body he currently possessed was named Hana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yes, Lady Sakura,\" Corrin replied, not even realising he'd referred to Sakura as \"Lady Sakura\" on pure instinct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door of the door opened slightly, and he saw Sakura's face peering through the crack. \"Are you okay? Normally you'd already be awake and training by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, I guess I overslept. Sorry.\" Corrin did his best to sound convincing, but having never met this Hana girl before, it was rather difficult for him to imitate her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, okay. Just remember, we're heading out to Fort Jinya today, so you'd better get ready.\" With that, Sakura closed the door, and Corrin heard her footsteps walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin let out a breath he hadn't even realised he'd been holding. It was bad enough that he'd woken up as a girl, one he'd never met, but to also be back in Hoshido, where he'd been branded a traitor? Now he was even more on edge. If anyone realised who he was, he'd be thrown into the dungeon, or worse. He supposed all he could do until he figured out what had happened was pretend to be this Hana girl. From the way Sakura had spoken to him, and the multitude of katanas lying around the room, he guessed Hana was probably one of Sakura's retainers, or at the very least, one of Sakura's friends who was part of the Hoshidan army.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how could he even find out how this had happened? He had no idea where to start. He didn't even know if the culprit was Nohrian or Hoshidan. If only he had some help, but who could he turn to? If he revealed his identity, he'd either be laughed at for spouting nonsense, or he'd be locked up for being a traitor. Corrin let out a sigh. The situation seemed hopeless. For now, he supposed he should carry on with Hana's life, and get ready for the day.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning Corrin awoke as the sunlight from a nearby window shined brightly on his face. As he tossed and turned in bed, refusing to get out of bed he noted how oddly comfortable he felt. The clothing he wore appeared to be made of a light, sheer fabric which left his body feeling less encumbered than usual as he slept. Additionally, for some reason the garment had a lot of freedom in the legs, allowing the skin of his inner thighs to rub together, something he never felt before. As his awareness came back to him he slowly a lock of silver hair obstructed his vision. While he did wear his hair a lot longer than most other guys, it was nowhere near this long normally, the wavy locks looking to be long enough to reach halfway down his back. Standing up, he steadied himself, unprepared for how different the balance of his body felt, as he waddled his way awkwardly towards the vanity at the opposite end of the room. Staring back at him through the reflective glass was a young woman with long silver hair and red eyes. She shared many similar features with his usual self that this girl would easily be mistaken for his twin sister. She was simply wearing a dark nightgown that showed off a generous amount of cleavage. Corrin hesitantly raised his hand to his chest, squeezing one of the breasts he now had, and as he did a wave of pleasure unlike he had felt before passed over him as he involuntary let out a rather feminine yelp in response. His hand then went down and patted his crotch confirming that his equipment downstairs had completely been changed out. He was 100% a woman, the one staring back at him in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he had a chance to process anything a familiar face bursted into the room, \"Good morning Corrina!\" a young pink haired maid chirped, her smiling face then changed to a look of worry, \"Wait! You're not dressed? That's very unlike you...\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-Felicia?\" Corrin uttered in response, clearly a little confused. \"Wait.... dressed for?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia looked confused, \"For work... we maids are expected to be up before any of the other palaces residance to clean, prepare meals... you know this!\" she said, \"It's okay... I-I'll help you get dressed, you might be able to get ready before any of the Royal Family notices!\" the young maid walked over to Corrin and started to help him get undressed. Corrin's mind was reeling, somehow he had become one of the castle maids, and what was more, Felicia who had been his own personal maid didn't think anything strange of it. As his nightgown was stripped off, Corrin was almost unprepared to be confronted with his new naked for yet, for some reason he didn't feel anything looking at himself. He wasn't attracted to this young woman in the mirror and looking at himself felt oddly normal. And as soon as the nightgown came off, he was now dressed in full uniform. A black knee-length frock dress hugged his new body tightly, a white apron now tied at his waist with a large white ribbon at her back. The dress was a piece of clothing he hadn't worn in his life and the way it left his thighs exposed to the air was a odd feeling, he felt vulnerable. Her legs were now clad in long black socks and a pair of high heeled shoes were now worn on his feet. Completing things, Felicia tied her silver hair into twintails, finishing the uniform by placing the iconic maid headpiece on his head. He looked eerily similar to Flora as he looked at himself in the mirror. As he stood there confronted by his new reality as a maid, he couldn't help but be disturbed by how normal he felt like this. Even his demeanors, the way he stood, his back straight and both hands on over his groin, he looked no different to any other maid walking around the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an attempt to gather more information about what was happening Corrin spoke up, \"Ummm, Felicia? Have you woken up Prince Corrin yet?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis question was met with another worried expression on Felicia's face, \"Prince Corrin? There is no such person... we serve under Prince Floyd of Nohr...\" she said, \"Ummm... are you sure you're okay Corrina? Wake up late, forgetting our master, this is very much unlike you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... I'm okay, I just had trouble sleeping last night...\" she responded. It would appear as though Corrin's wish from the previous night had been granted. Flora appears to have become \"Prince Floyd\" over night, but in an attempt to fill the void of the missing maid, it had also changed her into a maid! As she walked out of the room she decided it might be a good idea to greet Flora in this new reality and see if there was some way to reverse everything. On the other hand she could hep Felicia with the chores. After all, she kinda owed her for helping out this morning.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Corrina decided that she should probably go check on Flora. After all, she wasn't very fond of the idea of being a maid for the rest of her life, and if there was anyway to reverse meeting Flora would probably shed light to exactly what had happened. As she minced down the castle hallways with a feminine stride she finally reached the doorway to her old room. Hesitantly she pushed opened the doors and entered. Inside the room she was greeted by a young man with short blueish-grey hair dressed in a silver attire very similar to what she had often worn in her old body. As the man faced her Corrina felt herself move almost automatically, \"P-pardon my intrusion Lord Floyd, I wasn't aware that you had already awoken...\" she stuttered out, bowing deeply. A deep red blush appeared on her face which was an odd combination of shame of acting unlike a proper maid, along with the embarrassment of almost naturally reverting into a maid like demeanour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man smiled, \"Ho... that's quite alright...\" he said, \"Though I will say I'm surprised at how naturally you're adjusting to your life as a maid Corrin!\" Looking up to face the man again after bowing, Corrina found a wide grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait, how did you know?\" she said, clearly shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs young prince took a few steps forward, Corrina was suddenly stuck with a realisation on how much taller than her he was. He almost towered over her new petite frame, \"Well, I was rather shocked to wake up a man this morning, but I made a wish on a shooting star. I wished I was born royal but this is far from what I expected to happen!\" he looked incredibly pleased with what happened, despite what he was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I also made a wish on that star...\" the young maid uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloyd's expression changed into a look of shock before bursting into laughter, \"Ahahaha, seriously? What did you wish to be a maid or something!?!\" <br>\r\nhe cried, gasping for breath as he cackled hysterically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrina blushed, \"N-no... I...\" he averted her eyes from Floyd clearly embarrassed, \"I was worried about you so I wished I could do something to help you... so you could have a break...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... is that so...?\" Floyd said, a little taken a back, \"How sweet... and here I thought you were nothing but a spoilt noble like your siblings...\"he walked up closer to Corrina and put his hand to her chin, lifting her face to look at him, \"I... don't know if we can reverse this, and to be honest I don't really want to. But I promise I'll always look out for you... same way you did for me...\" as he said, this Corrina found herself overcome with an odd feeling of affection for the man in front of her. He was quite handsome and hearing him say that he'll look after her made her feel overjoyed. Was she falling in love... with a man? No, it was improper for a maid and her master to have such relations she thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thank you, Lord Floyd...\" she said, still blushing furiously, \"I-I have some chores to attend to so I shall take my leave...\" Corrina curtsied and rushed out of the room, too embarrassed to look Floyd in the eye as she left.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, already acting as though she were always a maid... how cute...\" Floyd muttered, clearly amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Corrina walked down the halls again, she felt a little scared. She'd have to live her life forever as this young maid, serving a man that use to serve her in another reality. She wanted to be angry at this weird reversal of roles but to be honest she felt kind of happy. She had made the ultimate sacrifice for the well-being of her master and nothing makes a maid happier. Her mind being torn apart by her old self and her new maid persona she decided to focus on her tasks. She could think about what to do later. </span></div></div>",

It had a been a long while that he'd been staying in the Kingdom of Nohr but finally he was back at home with his true family in Hoshido. Unfortunately, while he was ready to accept his new family he felt that the same might not have applied in reverse. He was a Nohr raised and to add to that with his appearance, his own mother, the leader of the kingdom had died. This of course meant that the people of Hoshido didn't readily accept him and this bothered him greatly. As he wondered the camp his thoughts were interrupted by a tap on his shoulder, and as he turned around he was faced with the Diviner of Hoshido, Orochi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prince Corrin, what troubles you?\" she asked, her concern for him marred a little but the smile on her face, \"The look you wear is one I've seen your late mother wear many times in the past. If there's anything I can do to help you just let me know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt her request Corrin explained his situation, how he felt guilty about his upbringing in Nohr and how he wished he understood his Hoshidan roots a little better. In particular how he wished he understood his blood siblings a little better than he did right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I have a charm that could help you...\" she offered with a hint mischief in her tone of voice. She offered Corrin a talisman about the size and shape of a bookmark. It was decorated with red and gold patterns around the edges and the material a rather thin wood. \"Take this and think about who you wish to draw closer to. When you've made a decision, simply write the name of who you wish to understand more and the charm should immediately begin to take effect.\" with this task done Orochi began to walk away, \"Oh one more thing, if you find yourself a little lost you're more than welcome to ask for help again. I'll be waiting.\" she winked with a playful smirk on her face and walked away, leaving Corrin with the talisman and his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in his quarters, Corrin sat at a table with the talisman in front of him. He wished he had the opportunity to get to know everyone at the camp but he appreciated the opportunity to grow closer to even one of them. After careful consideration, he had made his decision and took his brush in hand on write on the talisman the name... </span></div></div>",

Suddenly it hit him, he didn't have dark hair, nor was it long enough to obstruct his vision. He looked down hoping that his hair had just mysteriously grown out but to his disappointment he was greeted with a sight he'd never have seen from this angle. Around his neck was a yellow muffler which went down his back much like a cape, but this fact was quickly brushed aside at the sight of a large valley of cleavage now attached to his chest now being contained by what looked like a pink garment of some sort, though not so effectively that it didn't do  good job of showing off his newly acquired breasts. He brought his hands up to squeeze his breasts to see if they were real and was met with a strange sensation he'd never experienced before. He decided not to dwell on that feeling and lowered his now gauntlet clad hands, looking around the room to find a mirror. He promptly rose to his feet, briefly caught of guard by his shifted centre of balance thanks to his new assets and went to inspect himself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFacing him in his reflection was a rather mature looking woman with long dark hair covering her right eye, the fringe on her left side tied into a cornrow braid and tied with a white bow. She wore gauntlets on her wrists and sleeves over her arms that were separate from the rest of her outfit. The garment she wore was made of a pink silky material and was a combination between a kimono and a qipao, with a brownish coloured leather obi around her torso accentuating her hourglass figure. Her wide womanly hips were guarded with two black kasazuri on each side the only pieces of clothing or armour blocking the full view of her exposed thighs. She wore shin guards on the lower part of her legs and her feet were clad in wooden sandals, \"K-Kagero...?\" she stuttered in the voice of a mature woman that caught her off guard. There was no doubt in her mind now, somehow she had become Kagero, her brother Ryouma's retainer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he had time to take in his current predicament he was interrupted by someone walking in, \"Kagero!\" a commanding voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around Corrin was face to face with her older brother Ryouma, \"Y-yes Lord Ryouma!\" he replied, almost naturally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've sent out Saizo to perform reconnaissance on the enemy camp, I need you to do a quick sweep of camp to make sure the perimeter is secure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-understood.\" she replied, her voice quivering a little bit. As Ryouma left the room Corrin was confronted with a strange feeling. Her face was flushed and a feeling of nervousness washed over her as Ryouma entered the room earlier, and as additionally there was a strange foreign feeling emanating through his new womanhood. In fact he felt differently about the young lord, his feelings of admiration of respect were now replaced with a strange attraction for him... as a man. She quickly shook the thought from here head, \"It's not proper for a ninja such as myself to seek out a relationship like that...\" he muttered almost as a reflex. Corrin started to realise that she had not only become Kagero in the flesh, but had begun behaving as she would. In fact she had been referring to herself in a feminine manner for a while now without noticing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to check the perimeter as Lord Ryouma had ordered her but as she left the room, she was greeted by Orochi. \"How goes your day so far dear friend?\" she greeted with a warm smile. Corrin was at lose for how to react, she had heard that Kagero and Orochi had a long history but she had no idea to act as this woman's friend. However before she could respond, Orochi's smile slowly turned into a mischievous grin, \"Enjoying your vacation, prince? Or should I say former prince?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you knew?\" Corrin replied in shock, probably the first act he performed out of character for Kagero, \"More importantly what happened!?!\" she questioned in panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly trying to stop herself from bursting into laughing, Orochi continued, \"The Talisman silly. I decided check on you to see who you chose to understand better. I was expecting to greet Lord Ryouma from your body but I suppose to spirits had other plans for my little charm!\" she explained, \"The charm swaps the souls of two people in order to help the one person better understand the other. But I guess the spirits feel as though you'll learn more about your brother from the eyes of his retainer.\" she clearly seemed rather amused at how your situation unfolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin was still trying to process what had happened \"Okay so, that explains how this all happened, can't you just reverse it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, I have very little say in how the charms worked. I mean I didn't even know it would turn out this way. Once the spirits decide you've learned enough about your brother, they'll reverse the spell.\" she explained, \"In the meantime, I've already informed <i>Prince Corrin</i> of everything and you can count on him to keep up appearances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I can't do this!\" Corrin replied, \"I... I don't know why but I don't see Lord Ryouma in the same way I usually do... I...\" her face flushed just thinking about his previously encountered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned in close and whispered into her ear, \"Oh <i>Kagero</i>, it's natural for you to feel that way about Ryouma. After all you are a woman right now... in mind, body and spirit...\" she lightly squeezed one of her breasts in order to emphasis her point, \"Let's just hope the spirits decide you've learned enough about your brother before you decided to go and marry him.\" she teased. Corrin blushed heavily, though the comment was made as a joke the thought disturbingly made her think of Lord Ryouma which only awakened again the feelings of attraction from before. Thankfully Orochi snapped her out of that train of thought, \"In any case, I hope you enjoy the experience. Few men get to experience what life as a woman is like so try and enjoy yourself... well maybe not too much...\" she said jokingly, \"If you need any help, like a love fortune or something, let me know. I'm more than happy to help. After all, we've been besties since we were little girls.\" Orochi turned around away giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin was stunned and unsure of what exactly he should do. Maybe she should go see Lord Ryouma, after all the sooner she learned whatever she was suppose to this whole thing would be over. However, the feelings of attraction Kagero's body felt for Ryouma scared her a little bit and she wasn't sure if she was quite ready to confront that right now. On the other hand, it might be a good idea to check how Prince Corrin was doing. Or rather, how Kagero was doing in his original body.</span></div></div>",

Where Takumi, Hinoka and Ryouma had strong resolve, a commanding presence and held themselves with confidence and self assurance, Sakura seemed rather she and had a quite demeanour.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As he finished the final stroke of the name, the Talisman appeared to glow warming before a gust of wind began to swirl around it. As the vortex of wind began to grow he began to lose all sense of weight, before he suddenly felt a rush like he was being ripped away before his mind went blank. Then that lack of feeling dissipated, and he began to feel as if he was shrinking and being cramped into a small space, as if something was constraining him, trapping him within and solidifying around him. And then he slowly regained the sensation of his limbs, easing into the feeling of a normal bodily experience... except everything felt strangely out of place. He opened his eyes to find that somehow he had been transported outside in a courtyard of the castle grounds. The bright sun flared down, only obstructed by the shade of a nearby cherry blossom tree. As he took a moment to enjoy the moment of peace outdoors where he found himself, a leisure so rarely afforded to him during this uncertain times of war, light breeze blew past brushing a lock of long pink hair into view, swirling past his legs and causing what felt like a thin cloth to flutter around his bare thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese consecutive sensations snapped him out of his moment of tranquility as alarm bells began to go off in his head. His hand darted up to his face and caught lock of hair, and inspected it. While it was true that he didn't exactly keep his hair short, this lock of hair he had caught was definitely a touch longer than his usually was and it's pink, cherry blossom hue couldn't be more different than the silver he usually had. His eyes were now draw to his hand grabbing the hair. It was rather small and delicate unlike his usually rough hands forged in combat, it's fingers were long and slender and the gloss of the trimmed fingernails undoubtedly feminine, connected to these hands were thin arms now covered in a sleeve made of a white material. Looking down, much to his surprise he saw the body of a young woman made clear by the modest mounds on chest. The clothes he was now dressed in were rather tight, hugging his new feminine form, with the exception of red skirt and the hanging white cloth of her upper body garment which twirled around him as the breeze blew past. As he moved his legs the delicate skin of his inner thigh brushed against one another, bringing attention to his bare legs and the lack of a certain part that represented his status as a man. His face flushed red, \"I wanted to get to know Sakura better, but this ISN'T what I meant!\" he muttered. Even though his delivery was a lot more more firm than anything Sakura would normally say, hearing her high-pitched voice come out of him was probably the strangest thing he'd experienced so far. He decided the best course of action was to find himself. Besides, if he was in Sakura's body right now it was probably safe to assume she was in his, and she was probably confused and terrified. On the other hand it would probably be a better idea to find Orochi and have her reverse what happened. But he wasn't going to accomplish anything standing here outside, so he promptly made his way back to the barracks area where both Orochi and his body likely were at that very moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked towards his destination he couldn't help but find how different the body he was in. To begin with, Sakura's body felt a lot lighter than his own body and was rather small, and the way the air freely swirled around his upper thighs was incredibly distracting for him. Though, he'd be lying if he didn't enjoy this just a little but, after all in the hot summer weather, the stuffy armour he wore into battle wasn't exactly comfortable so he enjoyed the freedom of movement a little bit. Though thinking on movement, the act of walking in this form was also a rather odd experience. His wider hips gave him a more effeminate gait. His hip would jut out to the side first, the legs only following on after that. Sure, it probably felt natural for girls to walk this way, but he couldn't quite get use to it. Though eventually the fear of falling over, the the thought of appearing out of place left his mind as he had reached the Barracks. He decided the smart thing to do first would be to...</span></div></div>",

Knowing how timid she usually was, she was probably panicking, having suddenly found herself in her older brother's body. He still didn't feel quite comfortable walking around in Sakura's body, and not going to see Orochi yet would mean he'd be in Sakura's body for longer, but he was willing to endure to make sure his sister was okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe eventually reached his own room without incident, and opened up the door without bothering to knock. Inside he was he own body standing at his desking, turning the talisman over in its hands worriedly. \"Sakura?\" Corrin asked, still a bit put off by the fact that he was speaking with Sakura's voice instead of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn shock at someone walking in, Corrin's body flinched a bit as it turned towards him, dropping the talisman on the desk in the process, before it properly processed what Corrin had actually said. \"B-Big brother?\" he body asked in a nervous tone, confirming that the swap was indeed mutual, and Sakura was now in Corrin's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin breathed a small sigh of relief now that both he and Sakura were accounted for, and nodded in response to Sakura's question. \"Are you alright?\" he asked. It seemed like a silly thing to ask, considering neither of them could really be considered \"alright\" at the moment, but he struggled to think of what else he could really say to comfort her in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I... um, h-how did this h-happen? W-Why am I you?\" Sakura asked, clearly distressed by the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin gestured towards the talisman on the table. \"Orochi gave me a talisman that she said would \"help me understand someone better\" if I wrote their name on it. I had no idea this is what she meant. I'm sorry. If I'd known, I would have never written your name down.\" He placed a hand on her shoulder, trying to be as comforting as he could, although it just served to remind him of how much smaller he was now, only just reaching his former body's shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's okay. It's not y-your fault.\" Sakura seemed to be gathering what little courage she could muster, although her stutter was still clearly coming through, even in Corrin's body. \"So, w-what now? How do we s-switch back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin let out a sigh. \"I'm not sure. Orochi obviously didn't explain to me how the talisman works. I don't suppose you know anything about this sort of thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura shook her head. \"I m-mostly work with healing magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in that case, our best option is probably to go see Orochi. I'm sure she'll be able to change us back, or at least explain how the talisman works so we can do it herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay...\" Sakura didn't seem entirely too sure about Orochi willingly cooperating, but she agreed it was probably their best option. Corrin still founding it odd to see his body acting so timidly, let alone seeing his body from this perspective at all, but he supposed he'd just have to bare it until they could get Orochi to swap them back. Hopefully they wouldn't encounter anyone else and have to try and mimic each other, as Corrin had a feeling Sakura wouldn't be up to the task.</span></div></div>",

He slowly pushed the large door open, finding his body actually struggling to move the heavy ornate door to the room of the royal diviner. Upon entering, he was greeted with the sight of Orochi seated on the ground at a low legged table with a bottle of sake sitting on front of her. Clearly you weren't interrupting anything particularly important. She greeted you with a warm smile, \"Please Lady Sakura, have a seat.\" said, gesturing to the Zabudon pillow across from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking her up on her offer, Corrin minced his way across the room and sat on the ground and sat on the ground, first kneeling down and then tucking his legs under his thighs in proper sitting form for the Hoshidans, his thighs again rubbing against each other under his skirt as he tried to adjust himself. Orochi simply sat across from him, clearly waiting for him to speak. \"I don't know exactly how to say this... but I'm not <i>'Lady Sakura'</i>...\" he said, his more uncomfortable tone in this case actually sounding rather close to the real Sakura. He looked up at Orochi expecting a reaction, only to see her warm smile distort into a mischievous quirk. She started laughing hysterically, tearing filling her eyes as this happened. Corrin could only sit there, confused at the reaction of the woman in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochi slowly started to compose herself, \"Ah... of course I know who you are! Who do you think gave you that Talisman!\" she said, wiping a tear from the corner of her eye, \"Of course, I was surprised that you chose Sakura for this charm. I was expecting you to choose Ryouma or Hinoka actually but look at you, ever the caring older brother... or I suppose little sister now?\" the mocking tone of her voice was starting to irritate Corrin but he kept his composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How <i>did</i> you know I chose Sakura... I only just got here...\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochi smiled, \"Well, I visited her a moment ago. I knew you'd use the charm eventually so I checked on you from time to time throughout the day.\" she explained, \"Oh, but don't worry your pretty little head about her she's doing fine now.\" As she finished speaking she pulled out a similar looking Talisman and started writing on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay so you've had your fun...\" Corrin said, forcing a smile on his face, \"Now please switch us back. I'm sure Sakura isn't happy being me, not to mention we're in the middle of the war! Even if she is in my body she doesn't know the first thing about swordsmanship, and I could barely push open your door let alone wield a sword as I am now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochi merely sighed and took a break from writing to look up at him, staring him straight in the face, \"Need I remind you, <i>you're</i> the one that asked for this. On top of that while you may be unhappy with this, I'm not reversing this as Sakura seems rather pleased with this arrangement.\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Corrin was shocked by Sakura's apparent reaction to the swap, he continued to argue, \"Even so it's too dangerous! She can't be me, she's never fought a battle in her life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochi appeared to have finished writing on the talisman on the table as she now picked it up and held it in her hand, \"Don't worry about that, I've already fixed her. As she is now no one would be able to tell the difference between her and the normal you.\" Corrin didn't quite understand what she was saying but before he could talk back again she spoke up, \"You however need to be fixed! The sweet, gentle Lady Sakura I know would never raise her voice like that to me!\" she raised the hand with the Talisman in it and slammed it on the table, a furious burst of energy surging forth from it rushing towards him. He put his hands up to try and defend himself but the light simply passed through them and bombarded his head. He felt dizzy as his vision began to blur, as he felt a little bit nauseous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the feelings passed he blinked a couple times and looked up at Orochi, \"W-what did you do..?\" she said, clenching her hands to her chest, a look of uncertainty on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochi smiled warmly, \"Oh dear princess, I simply fixed you. You're right, a young lady such as yourself doesn't belong on the battlefield. You can barely lift a steel sword let along swing it around at other people. So I took those skills from you, your rather rough manner of speech and masculine demeanour and replaced it with something more fitting of a princess...\" she explained, clearly proud of her handy work, \"And don't worry about your Big Brother Corrin, I've already given him everything he needs, same as you. So... do you still think you'd still fair better in battle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Corrin wanted to talk back, to demand her to reverse everything, but she was too afraid to raise her voice against her. And besides, she was right, in this weak delicate body there was nothing he could do to help the battle at the frontlines, and even if that isn't how things were she couldn't even fathom how to fight someone one-on-one. The knowledge she had spent building during her childhood, all the years of sword training, it was all gone. She didn't even remember how to properly hold a blade let alone brandish it against someone. The very idea of rushing into battle terrified her. Staying behind, healing the wounded, tending to the fallen, it safer... helping other people like this is the best she could do. As reality began to hit her hard, she looked to her left where a mirror hanged against a wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at her reflect she was greeted with the image of a demure little princess sitting at a table, her pink hair bound by a white and red ribbon that was tied at the back, held in place on the sides by two golden flower shaped hair clips. The cherry blossom coloured hair framed a young innocent looking face, and fell onto a white cape like cloth that draped over her narrow shoulders. She was wearing the rather tight shine maiden outfit that highlighted her slender and delicate form, and a blue ribbon adorned her waist. Looking at the girl in the mirror, there was no one more unsuited to the battlefield. It was rather odd but looking in the mirror she didn't feel anything was out of place, in face, it was stranger to her that she had ever been a man before this point. It wasn't obvious to her prior but after considering it, she felt incredibly comfortable in the shrine maiden dress. Pushing these thoughts to the side and summoning all her courage, she spoke up a bit, \"S-so... I'm stuck like this from now on?\" she said meekly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose I could swap you back if the both of you wished it...\" she said, playing with her hair a little bit, \"Or you could stay like this. After the charms I cast you are Lady Sakura, in mind, body and spirit. How about that, you got your wish, no one understand her better than you now\" she teased, \"For now I think you should go visit your brother...\" Orochi stood up from her seated position, \"Now if you'll excuse me I have some business to attend to, but feel free to come by anytime.\" and with that Corrin was quickly ushered out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had happened was unbelievable! It's like her life had been completely taken from her, and if she didn't do anything about it she'd be Sakura for the rest of her life. It was even starting to become difficult to think of herself as Corrin. Though while her situation seemed grim, Orochi had given her an out. All she had to do was find Sakura in her old body and convince her to swap back! </span></div></div>",

Even thought this was truly her room, or at least use to be, she couldn't shake this odd feeling that she was intruding. After inspecting the room it appeared as though Sakura was else where for the time being. Her train of thought was promptly interrupted as someone behind her suddenly grabbed her shoulders, \"Kyaa!\" she squealed in shock, probably the most girly sound that had escaped from his lips so far. Slowly turning around she found that the person who had grabbed her was the very person she was looking for. \"C-Corrin...?\" she uttered, still a little shaken from the shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man in front of her chuckled, \"I'm sorry, did I startle you?\" he asked, concern in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... y-yes, I'm fine though...\" Corrin replied, looking up at who was now her brother. It was now brought to her attention how much taller her old form was as she barely reached the height of his old bodies shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... I guess Orochi finished with you then...\" he said smiling warmly, \"My old body is so small... and I can't believe how timid I use to be...\" Sakura was clearly a little bit amused by the whole situation. He put his hand on her head and gentle stroked her hair, \"I know you promised to protect me, but I guess our roles are a little reverse now aren't they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words from Sakura strangely eased Corrin a little bit, and while he wouldn't admit it, being pet by her older brother was quite nice. Though he was determined to accomplished what he went there for in the first place, \"About that... d-do you think we could swap back?\" she asked shyly, \"I... I don't think I can live like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura frowned, \"I'm sorry, but I really don't want to...\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis answer shocked Corrin, \"B-but why...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've always been so hopeless growing up. I've wanted to help my siblings in battle my whole life but, I just couldn't muster the courage. But now, I can! For the first time in my life I feel confident, like I could take on anyone, and I have incredible sword skills to boot.\" he explained, \"I'm sorry but for now, I can't give up this opportunity!\" from the look on her face, Corrin could tell he was dead serious. \"So, at least for the time being, I'm Corrin, Prince of Hoshido... and your older brother...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin's heart sank, it looked as though her old life was out of her grasp for good. She wanted to cry, scream, do something! But before she could, her older brother embraced her, \"And I swear I'll keep you safe! The battlefield isn't a place for a delicate flower like yourself Sakura.\" she suddenly felt at ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long moment of silence Corrin spoke up, \"I... I understand...\" she said, \"But... if you want to go back, let me know!\" she realised that this was probably all she could hope for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! And if you ever want to talk about anything, I'm here for you.\" he replied, smiling once again. With that the two of them parted ways to live each others life.</span></div></div>",

Spiritual energy surged forth from the rather small piece of parchment paper making him feel as though he was being pushed away from himself. As he started to lose consciousness a lack of feeling overtook him as it felt like he was being pulled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if almost no time passed at all he was bombarded with various sensations as you suddenly found himself in the corridor inside the castle grounds. Corrin stumbled due to suddenly going from a seated position immediately to a rather brisk walk without much explanation and to add to that, the balance of his body felt completely off. Unable to steady himself properly in time he stumbled to the ground. After the fall, he began to brush himself off and taking stock of himself to make sure he was alright, only to be met with a body he was not expecting to see, especially from this angle. A few locks of his now dark purple hair fell from his head and now rest above two foreign growths on her chests. Now bound rather tightly by a white piece of a clothing, the way they rose and fell with each breath he took all but confirmed to him that these pillows of flesh were now a part of his body. Hold his hands in front of him, he noticed that the rough hands of a young man were now replaced with rather dainty hands unfit for swordsmanship, his slim wrists now both adorned with rather large circular black and red bracelets. From under the braclets, a purple cloth encased his sleeves up his arms by leaving his shoulders exposed, attaching to the garments around his chest with white cords. His shoulders weren't the only parts of his bodies unusually exposed as the garments binding his cleavage didn't cover anything else, leaving his midriff completely bare. On his lower half he was wearing Hakama-like pants that went down to just below his knees that had parts in the front open showing off a bit of his thighs. Holding the Hakama pants his place around his womanly hips were red chords that went around his waist, fastening a black buckle in front of him. The buckle had the Hoshidan crest on it and white tassels hanging from the bottom of it. As he stood himself up his attention was brought to the Geta sandals which were now on his feet, something he was not use to as he usually preferred to walk around bare footed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the evidence in front of him, it was pretty clear that some how he had become the Hoshido Kingdom's royal Diviner Orochi, the very person who had gifted him the Talisman that he assumed was the cause of this. Sure he wanted to understand her better, but this was far from what he had in mind! If he correct in assumptions, Orochi was probably in his body sitting in her quarters where he was before this whole ordeal began. Quickly he made his way towards his quarters, trying to ignore the awkward sensations this body was sending him. From his large hips moving side to side with each step, to his boobs jiggling as he moved and his long hair brushing the bare skin on the back of his torso, it was all rather foreign and embarrassing. It was almost like walking through the castle grounds crossdressing, only he was the only one aware of how odd he was right now. As he approached his quarters, he burst into the room without knocking, what he was greeted with was the embarrassing scene of his body posing in front of a mirror. \"Uh... what are you doing...?\" Corrin asked, a little taken aback by how ridiculous what he was witnessing was. He was a little distracted by hearing the feminine voice that spoke for him, but decided not to think about that for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Prince Corrin I take it...\" Orochi replied, grinning widely, \"You know, when I gave you that talisman I expected you too write Ryouma, or Takumi or even Sakura... the thought of you in the body of your sweet little sister would have been rather entertaining..\" turning too you the look on her face look rather amused, \"But I did not expect you to chose me dear prince, I have to say I'm rather flattered. So... have you learned what you wished too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrins face flushed in embarrassment, \"More than I could ever want to...\" he muttered. He had heard Orochi had a rather mischievous streak from several people in the army, but as he hadn't been here for that long, this is the first time he'd experienced it first hand. To think she intended for him to become his own little sister, unthinkable! \"Well... you've had your fun, I hope you enjoyed your prank but... I'd like to go back to being myself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochi's face suddenly became serious, \"While I admit the outcomes for this charm would have entertained me regardless, this is not a prank. I was dead serious about this...\" she said, taking a few steps towards him, \"So, until I feel like you've learnt enough about what it is like to be me, I shall be the young prince Corrin, and you will be Orochi, the royal Diviner.\" Corrin was taken aback by this response, yes he wanted to understand Orochi a little better but outright become her was unthinkable to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, switch us back! I can't be you, this feels too weird. It's uncomfortable to just walk around as you, not to mention I don't know anything about Divining. And we're in the middle of a war, you don't know the first thing about Swordsmanship, what if you die out there!?!\" the desperation in Corrin's voice was incredibly uncharacteristic especially considering it was Orochi's voice delivering the words. She appeared to be considering Corrin's pleas seriously and after some thought, a smile flashed across her... or rather the face of Corrin's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I suppose you have a point...\" she said, pulling out a Talisman. After a few seconds of chanting the talisman exploded in flames, releasing a burst of spiritual energy. A familiar blinding light filled the room as the magic enveloped the both of you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A throbbing pain emanated from Corrin's head as her vision returned to her. As his looked up, he still saw the figure of Prince Corrin's body in front of him and looking down at herself sure enough, he was greeted by the body of a woman. \"What did you do?\" she inquired, her head still hurting a little bit from the effects of the unknown charm that had just been cast. Oddly enough, the young man in front of her didn't respond but walked to the corner of the room, picked up an iron sword and offered it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rather than explain it, I think showing it to you would probably be better...\" he said, a cocky smirk uncharacteristic of your old self flashing across his face. Reluctantly, Corrin took the blade in her hand looking at it blankly. He was unsure of exactly Orochi was expecting of her in handing her the blade, he looked up at him looking for more direction, \"Go on, show me the swordsmanship you spent years in the Nohr Kingdom practicing...\" the confidence in his voice was starting to rub her the wrong way. Looking down once again at the blade he was oddly confused, he grasped the sword in his dainty hands and gave it a couple clumsy swing. Holding the weapon felt incredibly awkward and for some reason he couldn't quite understand how to wield such a tool. Her confusion was interrupted as Orochi started to chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Orochi you are <i>not</i> suited to this kind of thing, let me show you how it's done.\" he said, taking the blade from her hand. He showed off a few rather flashy sword techniques and then placed the sword back where he had taken it from, \"Wow, Xander taught you well... or I suppose he taught me well now...\" he said, smirk still prominently featured on his face. Corrin's confusion was only amplified, how had Orochi been able to use the blade to effectively? she had assumed that the reason his swordplay was so clumsy was due to her small hands and physically weaker body, but now she wasn't so sure of that. On top of that, when Orochi mentioned Xander, he had briefly forgotten that he was referring to her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stole me swords skills!?!\" Corrin said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochi once again laughed, \"Oh no no, not exactly. You made a good point, we won't be able pull off being each other with out a little more help so I decided to make it a little easier on us. So I took a few of your memories, your swordskills, and a little bit of your personality, and replaced them with some of mine. Knowledge of divining, a few of my lovely personality quirks, even how I do my hair in the morning. I even gave you a few of my memories of our late mother.\"as he explained, Corrin could only stand there in stunned silence. \"And of course that's not all, I've taken the liberty of making us more comfortable in our new skin. You are now a woman in mind, body and spirit. Congratulations!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that it was pointed out to her, she realised that everything she had said was true. Almost out of curiosity, Corrin walked up to the mirror to inspect herself and found that the strangest thing to her, was that nothing at all felt strange to her. Face to face with her own reflection she saw the same mature woman she expected to see, dressed in Hoshidan clothes. The exposed midriff, the shapely female body, the rather large breasts on her chest, all these things did seem odd to her at all. In fact if anything, it was difficult to imagine that she had ever been anything but the beautiful woman she was looking at. The long styled purple hair now reminded her of the mornings she'd spent styling it into a Nihongami like hairstyle. It was rather elaborate with the use of various Kanzashi to keep it in place but she was quite happy with the look. After all, it reminded her of the times Lady Mikoto looked after her as a little girl. A little distracted by the new memories flooding her mind, she turned to her old body once again, \"Please, I can't do this! I'm <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Corrin</span> Orochi, not <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Orochi!</span>\" she yelled out, confused by the shifted around words that came out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as you can see there's not a lot you can do besides ride it out!\" Orochi replied with much enthusiasm, \"So if we're old settled now, I believe I should go see my older brother Ryouma, we promised to do some training today.\" he stated as he started to take his leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Shouldn't we at least set some ground rules or something!\" Corrin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so. You live your live <i>Orochi</i>, and I'll live my life...\" he replied, clearly enjoying it a little too much, \"Though if it makes you feel any better, I'll try not to form any romantic connections with anyone. Though, if you wanted to go and find man for yourself, I don't think a young man like me has much of a right to be lecturing a grown woman about love...\" she said coyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin's face turned a bright red, and she had not even considered that aspect of herself being altered. Before she could even question it herself, she started to take notice of how handsome the young prince standing before her was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll be leaving now! Make sure if you get married to at least let me know...\" she said, laughing as she left the room. He was once again left alone with his thoughts. Somehow her suggestions had made things worse and as was demonstrated before, it was probably unlikely she could tell anyone what had happened to get help on the matter. It was frustrating but she was stuck like this, at least for the time being. \"I can't believe <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Orochi</span> Prince Corrin would do this. If Lady Mikoto was still around, she would teach him not to be so disrespectful to older women...\" she muttered, again a little disturbed at how the thought had some out. She decided it was probably a good idea to leave Prince Corrin's room, regardless of what she decided to do next.</span></div></div>",

She was probably the most hardworking individual in the entire army, never missing a single day of training. And yet at the same time, she still made sure to look after Sakura.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the ink hit the talisman an energy almost exploded from it, overwhelming all of Corrin's senses. He couldn't see due to the blinding light, the loud hum of the talisman made it impossible to hear anything. He felt as though he was floating in empty space, unable to feel anything around him, before the room began to almost spin around him. As a rush of feelings overwhelmed him he faded out of consciousness. And then, almost as if he barely blinked his eyes everything returned to him without warning. It appeared as though he was standing in one of the outdoor hallways of the castle ground. More notable than that though, he was standing face to face with a tall young man with long red hair tied in a ponytail. Corrin never considered himself a very short but, this man towered above him, his head barely standing as tall as his shoulders. As he awkwardly turned his head up to look at his face, he realised he was facing the pegasus knight from their army, Subaki. He didn't remember him being this tall. Now paying more attention to the one in front of him, Corrin noticed the rather confused look on his face, \"Ummm... you alright...?\" he said in a concerned tone, \"I know you care about your training or whatever, but you'll be no good to Sakura if you burn out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin wasn't quite sure of what he was talking about, but responded nonetheless, \"I'm fine...\" he started, but then trailed off upon hearing a soft, feminine voice speaking for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSubaki sighed, \"You don't seem okay.... I mean you were just yelling at me and suddenly stopped, staring at me in silence....\" he said, placing his hand on his head, \"Just... look after yourself. I know we don't always get along, but I do care about you Hana...\" he said, petting his head a couple times. Corrin blushed as a fluttering feeling came from his abdomen. After this Subaki turned around and took his leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin didn't completely process everything Subaki said until he had already left, but after a couple moments his eyes widened in shock. Did he just call him Hana? All of a sudden everything his him, the locks of light brown hair that fell into his view was something he only took notice of now. Additionally the hair was longer than he was use two, a few locks on it teasing the skin on his nape in an unfamiliar way. He looked down to see that he was wearing a pink kimono-like garment, tied at the waist with a red sash. The way it pulled in narrower at his waists brought to mind the different proportions of the body he now occupied. He wore a white and gold chest plate over the silk clothes he donned that likely now contained a modest pair of breasts, though this was a though he'd rather not dwell on. Additionally, the exposed skin of his thighs was quite a bit different, as he usually wore attire that covered a majority of his body. It would appear as though the talisman had indeed given him a means of understanding Hana better, by becoming her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I guess that explains why Subaki looked so tall...\" she muttered to herself. The very idea of becoming another person was quite strange. While Hana was one of the strongest and most skilled warriors in the army, her build was still rather petite and slender. She was a fighter very similar to herself, making use of speed and technique to compensate her lack of overwhelming physical strength. While this seemed like a pretty good opportunity she was rather torn as it appeared as though the talisman was definitely used up in the process of being cast. Did that mean she was stuck like this? Was that such a bad thing? It probably would be a good idea to check if Orochi had a way to reverse this. On the other hand, maybe she should check on her own body. After all, if she was Hana then Hana was probably her.</span></div></div>",

To the people, Valla was a kingdom to help forge the peace between both kingdoms. However, the people didn't know the truth about the former Valla, rules by a mad Anankos beneath the Bottomless Canyon. The new kingdom was comprised of the northern territories of both Kingdoms. It was hard to get Valla's citizens under control with some still holding a grudge, but with the efforts of Corrin, Azura, and her other allies they managed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Corrin decided to take a day off from politics to visit a former ally, Charlotte. Corrin had an unusual friendship with Charlotte. Corrin was aware of Charlotte\u2019s truth face but seemed to gotten over it as she thought her understood Charlotte more. Corrin offered her a place as a member of the castle guard and Charlotte took it. However, today was Charlotte\u2019s day off and Corrin thinks spending time together as friends rather than being strictly Queen and guard. She did oddly notice Charlotte becoming a little distant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin arrived at Charlotte\u2019s home. She knocked on the door showed her face. A few moments later, Charlotte opened the door to find Corrin. \u201cYour majesty! W-wait brings you here.\u201d Charlotte asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought I could spend some time together like I used to with everyone back in the army. But a little differently.\u201d Corrin replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. Then come in!\u201d Charlotte insisted as she quickly took Corrin inside. Charlotte showed Corrin around her home except for the basement. Charlotte briefly mentions it but says she doesn\u2019t have much there. They both sat down at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about I show you my new recipe? I perfected today and it only needs to be warmed up.\u201d Charlotte offered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d Corrin replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte smirked as she went to prep the food. A few minutes later she came back with a nice warm meal. \u201cEat up. It may be the last one you may ever want!\u201d Charlotte cheerfully said as she put a plate for Corrin and herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin smiled as she began to eat. Corrin remembered Charlotte\u2019s great cooking and this tasted even better since then. Charlotte seemed to enjoy herself too. After a few minutes though, Corrin found herself getting dizzy. \u201cCharlotte? What\u2019s-\u201d Corrin muttered before losing consciousness\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was almost akin to a purr but from a human being rather then a cat which struck as odd. To her, it would seem that the once wolfskin had now become something more feline. Meanwhile, she would not notice the swaying of her new sleeker tail while her ears occasionally twitched with the passing of a lone fly. The who predicament was a good bit to process, but would only grow worse as a new sensation arose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo summarize, it felt like her chest was building up something within. The idea of this was only solidified when said bust sloshed slightly with the passing of time. Eventually, two nubs would rise to later leak a small trickle of white liquid. Mewling, Velouria had no idea of what was going on with her body now. Whimpering even more now, she would only stare at the lactating nips.</span></div></div>",

That way she coud make people better in a number of ways. She looked around for his first victim and she found it in Eliwood. Eliwood was a bit injured and Serra jumped in to heal him. Eliwood said it was just a scratch, but thanked her for the heal anyway. Eliwood didn't notice that the hair on his body began to dissapear. As the days went by,Serra kept finding time to heal Eliwood. With each cast he was moving more and more into becoming Serra. He lost a couple of inches while his body was becoming more and more slender. His hair was growing a bit and deep in the roots, there was a lovely pink color trying to overtake it.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a long day of battle.  The army had gotten into a rather large battle with morphs on the Dread Isle, the battle had to be spread out for miles across the battlefield leaving the ranks thin.  Eliwood as leader of the army insisted on not putting others in danger and going after a large group alone, but the tactician Mark always insisted for some reason to slit groups off into 2, usually one man and woman.  It was a wide theory in the army that the tactician was secretly trying to play matchmaker with the soldiers, but since it actually seemed to work in most cases nobody complained too much.  So was such a matter today, Mark insisted Eliwood travel with the cleric turned powerful light bishop Serra.  And Serra was very happy about this, what better way to add more of her influence of the army by turning the leader into a close copy of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle raged on, and after every encounter even if Eliwood only had a scratch, Serra would heal him with her magically modified staff.  Eliwood found it a bit bothersome, after all he could always just use a vulinary or just deal with a few scratched but Serra always insisted.  And after a few hours of battle she began seeing results, Eliwood's red hair was becoming much longer, down to below his shoulders.  Eliwood also was no almost tripping over his armor that his body was becoming too small for.  After slicing through what he hoped to be the last morph with his mighty gigantic sword Durandal Eliwood collapsed on the battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord!\"  Serra called out giving Eliwood the last tap from the modified heal staff before it finally broke.  When Eliwood looked up to Serra, she saw that his face was now closer to her's than his.  It was much softer and his armor was now practically falling off of him.  \"Serra, I think something's wrong, I may have been effected by a weakening poison of some sort.  Did you bring a Restore staff with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not lord Eliwood, they were all used up after the last battle.\"  Eliwood cursed quietly to himself not wanting to swear in front of a lady.  Serra put a hand on Eliwood, \"Let me help you out of that armor to get a look at you to see how you've changed...by the poison.\"  Serra smiled at her little lie and helped Eliwood remove his top layer of armor and let out a fake gasp.  \"My lord!  You have a bosom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliwood thought Serra's statement was the most ridiculous thing he'd ever heard, had the girl not seen a man's pecs before?  But sure enough when he looked down he saw he had a very distinctly feminine chest.  \"What the...\"  He said and he felt a surge of confused adrenaline as he stood up and moved behind a bush and check his lower half.  Eliwood called out in a voice that he now noticed was much higher than his own, \"I've...I've become a woman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerra was elated, her spell had worked!  Eliwood now looked like a woman who was a mix of himself and Serra.  Serra wished Eliwood looked more like her, but he still made for a cute girl.  Something Serra could help out more with even without the use of magic.  \"My lord!  I mean, my lady, no wonder you were getting so tired waling around in that armor.  If I wore something like that all day I'd have passed out, here, put this on.\"  And Serra with a gleam in her eye took a spare dress from her bag that she brought for this exact occation and practically jumped into behind the bush with Eliwood who was in too much shock to fight against the determined bishop.<br>\r\n________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two army members began the trek back to camp Serra couldn't help but admire her handywork.  The marquess of Pherae was practically unrecognizable with his long red hair now tied up in pigtails, his perky breasts that were contained in a long blue version of Serra's lilac colored dress that she thought really brought out his bright blue eyes even more.  Although he was still carrying his old armor and weapons in a sack that he was practically dragging.  Apparently he didn't think it was a good idea to leave his armor and legendary sword around on the ground although Serra thought it made Eliwood look rather silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two made it back to camp and went straight for Mark's tent.  Eliwood wanted to tell the truth, but Serra insisted that they should say Eliwood stayed behind to nobelly protect a small village for a while and sent a cute cleric in training to help with the army.  Eliwood agreed with this mainly because he was a little embarrassed by his current form and didn't want the leader of the army to be seen as not as strong as he was before.  After all, now he could barely hold a sword.  But Serra had been good enough to teach him to use a staff on the journey back so he could still contribute to the army.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yoo hoo!  Mark!  Your favorite cutie of St. Eliminate is back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark who was looking down at the weird purple device he used to plan out tactics rolled his eyes upon hearing the grating voice and looked up to say, \"Good, I don't believe you and Eliwood have a proper Support so I will pair you up with...who is this young lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerra gave the made up story about Eliwood leaving and this young cleric who she named 'Ellie' was joining the army.  Eliwood expected Mark to be furious that Eliwood had not showed up back at camp but instead seemed rather excited.  \"This is great!  I leads to more pairing options and evens out the gender balance more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliwood felt a bit annoyed, it seemed the rumors of the tactician pairing up men and women on the battlefield for romantic reasons might be more true than he thought.  Mark approached Eliwood and looked him up and down, Eliwood went to cover up his chest instinctively, he didn't like being looked over like this.  Eliwood could have sworn he heard the tactician mutter, \"Seems a bit under leveled, but I can fix that,\" and he went back to his little purple planning...thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ellie, I'm going to send you on a training mission with one of the men to see how you do.  Be sure to use your heal staff a lot to gain experience.  And report back to me later so I can check your progress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliwood felt embarrassed to be talked to like this, but wanted to still help the army in any way he could and left the tent to meet who he'd be training with.</span></div></div>",

They aren't that tough, but can do real damage to green unit npc citizens.\"  Eliwood simply nodded his pigtailed head, he'd been hearing the tacticians odd terms for too long to question what they meant.  \"So Ellie, I want you on a training mission to get some on the field training.  I want you protected so I think I'll try pairing you up with...Hector.  Yeah, I can see the two of you together for some reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hector?  Oh no, isn't there anyone else in the army you could have me train under?\"  Even though he was practically unrecognizable with the body and dress of a female cleric, he still didn't want his best friend to see him like this.  \"No, I need someone with a high CON to take care of you just in case things go poorly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliwood reluctantly agreed, after all, Mark had never steered him wrong before.  Mark came with 'Ellie' to meet up with Hector.  The hulking man was practicing weilding his massive axe Armads taking down huge trees in a single swing and then carrying the whole tree to a pile being used by the army.  Being so physically weak now, Eliwood actually trembled a bit in the presence of his best friend.  He thought sadly that if they had one of their practice duels now Hector would wipe the floor with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon telling Hector the mission the axe lord laughed and said, \"About time I saw some action today.  But I doubt I'll even need the assistance to take those small fries out.  They'll never pierce my armor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true your defense is absurdly high, but the brigands could have a mage to give you trouble.  Besides, every mission must be in pairs.  It's the rule.  Now you and Ellie go and take out the brigands.\"  And then muttered under his breath, \"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\"><i>And build Support Levels so you can get married and have beautiful babies together.</i></font>\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\"  Eliwood asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.\"  Mark said quickly and ushered Hector and 'Ellie' who was freshly equipped with heal staffs from the armory off to the battlefield.<br>\r\n________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHector was mowing down the low level axe wielding bandits with little to no trouble.  Every axe swing just dinged off of his armor.  Eliwood would have marveled at his friends skill, but felt every self conscious because this was a battle and he was just sitting on the sidelines doing nothing.  Hector continued slicing through villains with glee when Eliwood saw a spark in the distance.  To his horror Eliwood saw the skies darken as a robed figure chanted on the far side of battle.  \"Hector!  Look out!\"  Eliwood shouted and with every bit of strength his cleric body could muster he pushed Hector just far enough out of the way for the bolt of lighting to miss him.  But the pigtailed Eliwood took the full force of the blow instead.  Hector looking in horror at the seemingly lifeless body and in one swift movement threw a hand axe that embeded itself in the offending mage's neck.  With the brigands retreating Hector rescued the physically frail cleric by hoisting the girl over his shoulders and ran for safety.<br>\r\n________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Eliwood woke up it was night but he couldn't see the stars from his back because all he could see was Hector's concerned face over him.  \"You're awake!  Thank goodness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?  How am I alive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good question.  Even though you don't have much battlefield experience Ellie, I figure that you have a lot more Resistance than the average person.  You survived a full force critical lightning bolt that probably would kill most men. But it was still a stupid move to take the blow for me.  I could have taken it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liar!  There's no way even with all your armor you could have agh!\"  Eliwood winced as he tried to stand but stopped as he felt a pain in his ribs.  He looked down and saw a hole in the blue dress he wore over his heart where the bolt had hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't move, the Elixir I used is still doing it's work.  You'll be all better by tomorrow.  I'll recommend you stay back at the base in the medical tent though.  You're too frail for the battlefield.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not frail!\"  Eliwood shouted at his friend, \"I would not have been hurt if you hadn't overlooked that mage.  You would be dead if I hadn't stepped in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well...says you.\"  Hector didn't say anything as he turned away to focus on the fire, \"But if you insist on being on the battlefield.   I want you to stick with me.  That way I can protect you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I can protect you too.\"  Eliwood insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHector just chuckled dismissively, \"Sure you could.\" </span></div></div>",

I don't care if it's just a squirrel.\"  Hector went to sleep leaving against a tree still with his heavy armor on.  Eliwood smiled at his friend, he always admired the strength and caring of his friend, even though if he did wake him up over a squirrel he'd probably be pretty annoyed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours passed and Eliwood stoked the fire thinking about what in the world his future would hold if he didn't return to normal.  How would he explain this to everyone.  To his mother.  And to Hector.  Feeling a bit ashamed he thought it might be best if he just didn't tell them anything and let them think he retired to battle morphs on the dread isle if he couldn't find a cure, he almost didn't notice a rustling in the distance.  Quickly Eliwood extinguished the fire as to not draw undo attention and then he reached for his trusty sword.  Only of course to find he now wielded only a Heal staff.  \"Curses.\"  Eliwood muttered to himself quiestly as he inched quietly to Hector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHector was dreaming wonderful dreams of life, love, happiness, and battle.  He tended to have good dreams after a good battle.  But he awoke to a warm breath on his neck that whispered his name.  Hector opened his eyes to see the most beautiful pair of big blue eyes he'd ever seen.  The eyes were attached to a beautiful face that had a finger in front of it's cute lips as it bade him be quiet.  \"More bandits.\"  Eliwood whispered to Hector who reached for his trusty axe.  Ready to protect that face he'd never really paid close attention to before now Hector made swift moments towards the rustling bushes.  Eliwood was frustrated by his friend but chased after to provide support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few quick axe chops later three bandits probably from the same group from the day before, lay defeated.  As Hector admired his handywork Eliwood hit him with the heal staff.  \"What were you thinking?  We didn't know anything about our enemy and you just charged in without thinking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just the way I fight Ellie, besides it works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to get yourself killed if you keep doing that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're starting to sound like my friend Eliwood always complaining about my fighting style.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because Eliwood cares about you and doesn't want you to get hurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why do you say it?  Do you care about me too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do you...!\"  Eliwood covered his mouth before he could continue.  It was so dark neither friend could see each other blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHector didn't want for Ellie to see him look flustered at what he took as her confession, \"Let's go back to the fire.  Nothing should bother us for the rest of the night.\"</span></div></div>",

But Eliwood put a soft hand on his shoulder, \"Don't start the fire back up, it could attract more brigands and we both need a good night's sleep.  We have a long journey back to camp tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\"  Hector simply said before leaning back up against his tree.  But he did not sleep, he wanted to make sure Ellie was comfortable first.  Out of barely open eyes he saw the cleric lay on the ground and adjust uncomfortably as though she wasn't comfortable in her own body.  Wanting to comfort his girl who he felt drawn to, Hector left the tree and did what he rarely ever did and removed his armor so he could lay by Ellie comfortably.  Upon seeing a bare chested Hector approach him, Eliwood asked, \"What are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you look cold and uncomfortable.  And since we aren't using a fire anymore I thought my body was the next best source of heat.  Come on, we'll keep each other warm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliwood wanted to call Hector a pervert for wanted to lay next to a young woman he just met, but Eliwood knew Hector better than that.  He could be brash and harsh, but he was a noble gentleman and would never take advantage of a person.  \"Very well.\"  Eliwood said and turned his back to Hector.  Even though his eyes were closed, through Hector's sheer presence Eliwood could practically see the giant of a man lay down next to him and put his chest against his back.  He felt his massive arm drape over his smaller body.  It felt like Hector's arm was bigger than his body.  But it felt oddly comforting rather than intimidating.  The two lay next to each other.  Neither slept or even tried to.  They just silently enjoyed each other's warmth and company.  Everything about this felt right to both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally as the sun rose Hector whispered, \"Ellie, I'm going to protect you with my axe, my body, and my heart if you will let me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I welcome that Hector, and though I'm not strong now.  I will work to master the magic I now have to use and make sure I can protect you too.  Just please...don't run off like a wild man...without me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise.\"  And Hector kissed the neck of the red headed cleric and she turned to return the kiss in kind.</span></div></div>",

The leader of the army, the Great Lord Hector stood side by side beside his newly engaged love the now bishop Ellie.  The couple could not look more different.  Hector was adorn in his usual thick plates of armor wielding his massive axe Armads and Ellie stood beside him adorn in a gorgeous gown designed by Lyn for battle and decorated by Serra with lots of fancy trimmings that made her look like a queen on the battlefield.  She had a book of light in one hand, a staff in the other, and a rapier at her hip that she was oddly amazing with much to the surprise of all but her and Serra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were now leading the charge against a dragon that had come out of the gate.  Hector and Ellie looked at each other, smiled, and nodded.  \"The usual plan?\"  Hector asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charging in isn't exactly a plan.\"  Ellie smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just the way I like it.\"  And without waiting for a reply he charged in with Ellie not even a step behind.  Spells of light blinded the dragon as it began breathing it's fire wildly narrowly missing it's targets but missing nevertheless.  Hector spun his axe in the air so quickly it could have lifted him off the ground and with a force unlike any that had been seen in 700 years, Hector slammed the legendary axe down upon the dragon's skull splitting it in two.  The day had been won.  And in the rush of their victor, Hector and Ellie shared a kiss.<br>\r\n______________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff in the distance the tactician Mark looked not at the field of battle but his small purple box that he called a GBA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hector succeeded his brother as Marquess of Ostia.

Sain, the green lance of Caelin left the woman's bathhouse where he had been following lady Lyndis as he was having a conversation and 'accidentally' follower her into the changing area where lady Priscilla among many other ladies were not pleased to see him.  Still Sain had an ever present smile on his face, although is never say die attitude had taken a bit of a hit from his 1000th unfortunate encounter with the fairer sex.  He walked past his superiors Wallace and Kent who both had a look of disgust on their faces which hurt Sain's pride a bit.  He eventually went to the horse enclosure to take care of his horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well boy, it seems that once again the ladies of the army are too concerned with themselves and the war to be bothered with my love.  It is a shame.\"  Said said to his horse when a chipper voice came form behind him.  \"What's wrong Mr. Sain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid turned and saw the face of the chipper 14 year old mage Nino carrying a big and strange looking spell book.  \"Well my sweet little Nino, and please just call me Sain, you are a bit young to understand, but just know that when you get older I do hope do not break as many worthy hearts as the other women of the army.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you not found your special someone Sain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpain's right eye twitched a little bit, \"No my dear, I have not, I feel that somewhere in this army is someone who would be much better with my love at their side, but alas all the women must have their eye on another.  It's the only explanation for their attitudes towards me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Sain, but maybe I can help!\"  Nino said happily.  Said choked on air and began to cough, \"Nino, I'm afraid that just wouldn't do, I am looking for love now and you are far too young for me.  Although if you kept that in mind in about 3 or 4 years...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNino looked confused at Sain but said, \"I don't know about what you're saying, but Uncle Canas and Erk have been teaching me to read better and I think a spell in this book can help you.  It has something about finding love opposite to what you're looking for, or something like that maybe.  I think means it will help you find love where you're not looking.  So can I do the spell for you?  Can I?  Can I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSain didn't want to disappoint or discourage the young mage so he put on his winning smile and said, \"Of course young Nino, I'm sure your spell will be the perfect charm for me to find my love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right!\"  Nino said as she immediately opened the book and began to chant.  Said suddenly noticed the world around him becoming dark.  It felt like a wind was coming out of nowhere as the pages of Nino's book began to turn wildly and strange color's lit the sky which had gone from blue to black in a matter of seconds.  Nino continued her chant and Sain found he could not move away, he was entranced.  And after Nino finished the spell she shut the book and Sain blacked out.<br>\r\n________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid awoke the next morning and after rubbing his head for a minute remembered the last thing he'd done with Nino and the spell the day before.

Perhaps it was a dream.  Sain remained in his blanketed isolation until he heard Nino's cheerful voice said, \"Hi Miss Sain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not call me Miss Sain!  I am Mr. Sain!  I mean, just call me Sain.  And what the heck did your spell do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNino still looked cheerful as she sat on Sain's bed and said, \"Well, you said you were having trouble giving love to the girls, so I thought you could share your love with the guys in the army.

I just wanted to go out and spend a wonderful evening with a beautiful girl and now you've turned me into a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something wrong with being a girl?\"  Nino asked innocently, she still seemed to think she'd done Sain a great favor.  Said wanted to snap but seeing the happily confused look on Nino's face made his frustration and anger disipate quite a bit.  He couldn't stay mad at that face, even if it did take away his manhood.  Said took a breath and counted to 10, \"Ok Nino, this quite the surprise, but do you think you can turn me back to myself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I can't do that!\"  Nino said now sounding  a little sad, \"You can't?\"  Sain said feeling his heart sink.  \"Yeah.  Erik and Canas are still teaching me to read magic better so I need more lesson with them before I could undo it.  Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine.  It's fine.

Said still had to do his part for his country and his lord Lady Lyn.  So Sain stayed in the shadows near the back of the room hoping to not be noticed by anyone.  A few gave the new girl a few odd looks, but they let the girl be in peace as Mark began his presentation.  \"Ok everyone we've got a wide map to cover with a lot of reinforcments for the enemy.  So we need to split up into pairs.  Preferably one boy one girl unless I say so.  I will walk around the room and give everyone their assigned partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSain stayed by the wall hoping he could actually stay on guard duty with Merlinus so he could avoid interacting with his peers but Mark had other plans.  \"You are...the new girl.\"  Mark somehow manage to hide his smile when he looked at who he knew was Sain.

Although you will find that there are...some men in this army who will try to...take advantage of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpain's eyes widened, surly Kent wasn't talking about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sure if there is such a man.  He's probably just complimenting women on their beauty that he admires.  It's not something sinister I'm sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent hesitated, \"I'd like to believe so, but as his superior officer I must look upon him with strict standards.  I expect much form him, yet I constantly find myself disappointed.\"  Said felt his heart sink to the ground, he felt only a few inches tall.  Was this really what his best friend in this army thought of him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent continued,  \"At least as far as off the field antics go.  On the field of battle I trust no one more with my life, if you are ever with him on the battlefield you should consider yourself honored to be in the pretense of his lance work.  But enough about him.  Please tell me about yourself, I'd like to know more about my combat companion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I think I need to think about something.\"  Sain said feeling a bit down after what he just heard.  If this was what his best friend thought of him, what did the army as a whole think of him?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sain was so distract by his conversation with Kent that he had to get away.  Instinctively he went to the place that gave him the most joy.  Just outside the woman's bathhouse.  He had never really peeped on the ladies in there...at least maliciously.  He just loved and admired the beauty of women and when they left the bathhouse he felt the women had an air about them that made them more irrisistable than normal.  He flirted with many a woman in this spot and professed his love but they all turned him down, and now after talking with Kent he felt like the whole army thought ill of him because of this.  Sain's pretty eyes were so blurred with tears he didn't even notice when someone sat down beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like you could use a friend.\"  A kind voice said to Sain as she offered the paladin a handkerchief with patterns of Sacae.  \"Lady Lyndis!\"  Sain said wiping the tears from his eyes and standing at attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn gave a soft chuckle, \"Please, this isn't the middle of some fancy dinner or meeting.  Please just call me Lyn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I knew that.  Sorry Lyn.  I'm...Sadie\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you Sadie.  And don't worry.  It's all okay, you're the new girl, and I know that must be hard for you.  But you don't have to feel nervous.  Everyone here is of fine character.  We watch each other's backs as though we are brothers and sisters.  We are a family and we welcome you with open arms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSain had always felt the same way about the army but now he wasn't so sure, \"Does everyone feel that way about everyone?  What about...some guy I heard about who everyone doesn't like especially the ladies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...did you meet Sain?\"  Lyn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the stories are true.\"  Sain felt lower than low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to understand Sain can come across as a shameless flirt...and he kind of is.  But he is a truly great and noble man.  He flirts because he is so full of love and wants to share that love with others and I don't mean that in a perverted way believe it or not.  His probably is that he can't help but flirt with every girl he meets at least once per conversation.  It's an ill I wish I could cure of him, but if I did he wouldn't be Sain.  He holds nothing back in his personal life and on the battlefield.  It makes him an ally unlike any other in the wars, but after they are over I don't know if he will every find anyone who can match his passion.   But I hope he does, and I hope he doesn't compromise himself to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"  Lyn's words were hitting very close to home for Sain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can see you're a woman of passion.  No one cries like this unless they are.  I feel like you would get along well with him.  I want him to find someone to make him happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not you?\"  Sain couldn't stop himself from asking the question he'd had on his mind since he first discovered the beauty of Sacae, even before he had learned her name or heritage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyn seemed taken aback, \"I suppose it's not impossible.  But I have been so busy with Caelin I haven't let myself think about anything personal.  Maybe one day after all this is over I'll let myself think such thoughts.  But not now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA trumpet sounded in the distance.  \"Come on Sadie, it sounds like it's time for battle.  Let's go ahead and get with our partners.  I swear Mark sometimes is more interested in playing cupid than tactician.\"</span></div></div>",

With each heal,he was becoming more and more like the high maintenance pink haired girl. eliwood's hair now went down to his shoulders and was now a very light red color. His body was becoming even more girlish and Eliwood had lost a lot of muscle mass. His skin was silky soft, which along with his smaller size and fewer muscles left him very dainty an fragile. his clothes and armor also began changing and the armor was now soft fine silk that with each heal became tighter and the color closer to white. All of these changes made Eliwood weaker on the battlefield leaving him to get injured more. This meant that Serra could heal him more, speeding up the changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes started to work their way to Eliwood's mind. He was a lot more feisty now and impatient with a sharper tongue. He was becoming very stubborn and demanding. Eliwood was getting very needing and childish, always wanting something from someone, and overreacting when he didn't get his way. He began spending a lot more time with Serra. Originally he thought she could be a bit insufferable, but now he realized people were just being unnecessarily harsh to her.they were pretty much inseparable and Serra brought him into her hobbies and interests Eliwood's old interests were beginning to be replaced by Serra's girly pursuits. Eliwood was much more cowardly and didn't want to fight very much. It was for the best since Eliwood's sword skills were mostly gone, there place being taken by makeup skills. Serra was hopeful that very soon, the transformation would be finished as she continued her healing.</span></div></div>",

Small breasts came out of his chest while his male parts disappeared. Eliwoods's armor and fully turned into soft white silk. The top and bottom part fused together to form a tight slinky white dress. The sleeves split apart to form fancy white gloves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliwoods's personality became even more haughty and egotistical. He was now incredibly needy and made demands fom everyone while making sharp comments. His mind was full of all kinds of girly interests and hobbies.He no longer had any interest or skill in fighting. He traded in his sword for a healing staff. The old Eliwood was gone and in his place was a bratty, girly, cute pink haired cleric. Serra and Eliwood gave a haughty laugh as they did their makeup and with their stubbornness got soe boys to buy them food. The two wondered what to do next.</span></div></div>",

As much as Eirika hated to admit it, the fight was wearing her out. Between the war with Grado, and the rising threat of the Demon King's fiends, she and the rest of her small army had had practically no time to rest. She couldn't back down, now, though. There were people counting on her, and she knew the rest of her army must be feeling the fatigue just as hard as she was. She just had to press on for the time being, she couldn't let everyone else do the fighting for her while she rested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, unbeknownst to Eirika, Seth wasn't the only one who had noticed her fatigue. Lurking in the shadows, an enemy Shaman was observing her from the shadows. He had obtained a very special tome recently that would be instrumental in eliminating the threat that this troublesome princess posed. Fatigued and vulnerable, the Shaman waited until Eirika lowered her guard, surveying the battlefield, and then leapt into action. Approaching just enough that she would be in range of his special tome, he cast his spell on Eirika, before retreating back to cover to watch the effects taking place.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Eirika surveyed the battlefield, looking for an opening she could take or a weak point in her army's defenses that she could reinforce, she suddenly felt a strange tingling all over her body. It was similar to the feeling she got when a staff was used on her, but none of the staff users in her army were anywhere nearby. She figured it must have been the work of an enemy healer of some sort, and decided to try and take out whoever it was before she succumbed to the effects of whatever staff they were using on her. However, she found herself unable to do so. For some reason, her legs didn't seem to be obeying her commands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What? What's going on?\" She'd seen the effects of offensive staves before, like Sleep and Berserk, but she couldn't remember encountering anything like this before. She tried in vain to get her legs to move, as the tingling feeling intensified, but to no avail. The feeling was maddening. It had all but vanished from her upper body, but it continued to intensify in her legs, building up as if it were ready to burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then all of a sudden, it did. Her boots suddenly burst apart as her legs began to grow. If not for her legs being firmly planted to the ground, she'd almost certainly have fallen. Her legs grew longer, thicker, stronger. Her feet hardened, toes shrinking back inside, as they became a pair of hooves. A fine coat of brown hair coated her equine legs, while much thicker, coarser hair grew out from her waist, where her human torso met her equine lower half, hanging out the bottom of her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEirika was understandably afraid right now, shocked into silence, but the worst was far from over. The back of her skirt was suddenly lifted up as a second pair of equine legs suddenly erupted from behind her, ruining her underwear in the process. Her new back legs eventually touched the ground, but not before an entire horse-like body had ground out behind her, all coated in the same brown hair that coated her from legs. A long, horse tail erupted from her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the transformations seemed to stop, but Eirika was still in shock. Her legs had basically been replaced with the body of a horse, with her torso where the horse's head and neck should be. In a moment of clarity, she recognised her new form as that of a Tarvos, half-man, half-horse creatures that served the Demon King. Whoever was responsible for this had turned her into a fiend! Her legs seemed to be able to move now, but even if she wasn't still in shock, she had no idea how to move around as a quadruped, which would hamper her mobility greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to her shocked silence, none of her army had noticed her predicament just yet, as she desperately tried to calm herself. If this was anything like the effects of Sleep or Berserk, she should still be able to reclaim her human form with a Restore staff. Of course, that meant exposing her new form to at least one of the healers in the group, and actually walking over to them with her new horse-like body. She sighed, doing her best to figure out how to walk like this, thankful that at least whatever had gone on was done with her, and the offending enemy didn't seem to still be nearby.</span></div></div>",

Ephraim had gotten a message about some ruins that held ancient writings about the sacred stones. The royal spearman had misjudged his information however and when his forces arrived at the quiet ruins they were met with an ambush of Grado forces. Maintaining their position at the center of the ruins Ephraim's army was doing well at fighting even at such a disadvantage however the arrival of the leader of the enemy forces signaled trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValter the Moonstone, a general of Grado known for his cruelty alongside his great skills, had swooped in atop his mount and decided to meet Ephraim head on. There were a few others around, but with so many positions to defend Ephraim would have to fend for himself. \"Ah, here's the little meal that keeps managing to slip out of my fingers.\" the mad Wyvern Knight said with a grin as Ephraim merely glared at him with his lance at the ready. \"Coming against me head on like this was a mistake. I've come out of worse situations unharmed with my enemies scattered on the ground. Even you won't stop me.\" the lord declared proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon rider merely laughed to himself. \"Oh no, don't misunderstand me! You are indeed a tricky little thing with a rather painful edge to you. That's why I'm going to try savoring my hunt in a brand new way. You think yourself smart, but this was my ambush you fool! Coming to the most easily defensible place in the ruins is a tactic anyone could have thought of!\" he said with a wicked tone as he pulled out a black stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, then even this-\" Ephraim began to say as he realized that he walked right in to Valter's hands and hurriedly tried to devise a plan before he could spring whatever trap he had hidden in such a place.</span></div></div>",

It was a simple little ball of dark magic created by the druids of Grado, but it would do well for what he had in mind. When the dark magic released from the orb formerly invisible red runes began to glow across the floor where Ephraim was standing. \"You should feel honored prince, it took a lot of blood, sweat and tears to make this ritual. Ehehehe, well really just blood and tears.\" Valter said with glee as Ephraim attempted to run out of the circle before being forced back by a magical barrier, then tried to stab his way out with his spear. \"Such a naughty little boy. Seems like someone needs an attitude adjustment.\" the madman added playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrimson lightning soon sparked inside the circle as Ephraim found himself clutching his head in pain, the lightning starting to surround him. It didn't hurt like a normal attack, he had taken the strikes of lightning tomes in the past, but this was a ringing pain that hit not just his body but his mind. \"Arrrrgh...stop this...I shall not...fall to your trickery!\" he shouted, the lord having some fight in him. But even as he spoke he felt strange things enter his mind, dark and sinister thoughts about betraying and slaying his friends...and an adoration for Valter. No, there was no way he could let this spell twist his mind like this! Ephraim was so busy dealing with the mental effects of the spell that he hadn't noticed much of his armor had fallen off from the red sparks leaving mainly only his clothes left.</span></div></div>",

No escaping this time.\" Valter said, very happy that this pest would finally be dealt with in a very enjoyable manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seal glowed brighter as the red magical lightning surrounded Ephraim and caused him to float in the air. \"D-Damn...you...\" was all her could get out before the magic surrounded and totally consumed him. He could feel his morals fading, death and blood going from a necessity to a pass time as he saw Valter and felt his heart beat with admiration. As his mind was being changed so too was his body, his hair growing out and becoming a more vivid turquoise color before being wrapped into short twintails. His body paled, and his face was coated in this white makeup, his lips being stained a jet black and dark eye shadow appearing over his eyelids while a very thick coat of eye liner surrounded his eyes. A black heart appeared on each cheek as well, while lower down his clothing began to alter. His armor already blown off, his clothing altered and expanded greatly as they turned into a large frilly black and red gothic lolita dress with some lace and gothic heart designs along it. Long gloves covered his hands and fancy black boots with long striped black and white stockings his feet. He looked extremely feminine now, and was nearly unrecognizable and the transformation finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValter got off his Wyvern as the ritual ended and Ephraim slowly fell to the ground on his feet. When he opened his eyes, they opened up very wide and a cheerfully sinister smiled appeared along his black lips to give him quite the creepy expression. Giggling, the corrupted lord skipped over to Valter and gave him a kiss on the cheek before wrapping around his arm. \"It is an honor to serve you Master Valter, tehehe~\" he said with a wide grin. His very essence was corrupted to it's core by that ritual. His troops, his sister, none of that mattered to him. All her cared about now was serving his darling Valter. \"It worked even better than I expected! Hahaha, I could get used to this!\" Valter said, his enemy now his arm candy.</span></div></div>",

There had to something in there that would get Alm to like her back, or at least, that's what she believed. The longer this war went on, the more apparent it became that she would not be able to win Alm's heart through normal means, as it already belonged to someone else. She tried to be happy for him, to just be there to support him as a friend, but she couldn't handle it. She was desperate now, and was willing to resort to magic in order to get what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she reached her tent, she immediately slammed the book down, and started flipping through the pages frantically, looking for what she needed. She may have glanced past several useful spells in her haste, but she ultimately found something that seemed like what she needed. Supposedly the spell was meant to \"make the target like you\". That sounded perfect! Snatching up the spellbook in her hands, she quickly ran off to find Alm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter not too much time searching, Faye managed to find Alm practicing his swordplay just outside the camp. He was focused on his training, and hadn't noticed her approach. That was good; if Alm realised she was trying to cast a spell on him, he might try to stop her, and then he'd definitely never like her back. Using what little magic she'd learned from Kliff and Silque, Faye read out the spell, casting it on Alm. Unfortunately, if she hadn't been in such a rush, and had bothered to read further than just the title, she might have realised that the spell had a very different meaning in mind when it said it would \"make the target like you\"...</span></div></div>",

That boy was proving quite a problem for the Rigellian Army, even having bested Berkut on multiple occasions, but thanks to a little manipulation, he had stopped him march on Rigel for the time being, and was instead headed towards her abode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Alm was no ordinary soldier. He was one of the Brand Bearers, and he would be quite useful to her own plans. Nuibaba had been sacrificing young Rigellian girls in order to retain her own youth, but if she sacrificed a Brand Bearer, she should become immortal. There was only one issue; Nuibaba wasn't sure if Alm was a suitable sacrifice. In the past, she had specifically sacrificed young girls, and despite being a Brand Bearer, Alm did not meet that qualification. Perhaps being a Brand Bearer would make him a suitable sacrifice, regardless of his gender, but Nuibaba wasn't going to take that risk, especially considering there was another Brand Bearer who would be a more suitable sacrifice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't luring Alm to her abode for nothing, though. There was still much that could be done. For example, if Alm wasn't a suitable sacrifice, perhaps she could simply make him into one. So long as he kept the Brand on his hand, other modifications shouldn't effect his status as a Brand Bearer. Although, there was no guarantee that changing his body would make him a suitable sacrifice. Instead, she could make him her slave, warping and twisting his mind and body to her will. She could have him lure the other Brand Bearer to her abode, ready to be sacrificed. As Alm continued to near her abode, Nuibaba weighed up her options about what she should do with him.</span></div></div>",

He was almost certain there were more important things he could have been doing right now, but his commander, Anna, had insisted that he help out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Order of Heroes depended on their summoner being able to summon heroes from other worlds to aid them in battle and bolster their ranks. Normally, this would be done by purchasing a summoning stone using orbs, and then having their summoner fire the divine relic Breidablik at the stone to activate their summoning ruins, and call forth a new hero. Unfortunately, the Order was in a bit of a tough spot at the moment, and orb supplies were running low. As such, Anna had sent the Order out to where these summoning stones were usually found, in the hopes that they'd be able to find some before the people who sold them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfonse didn't know how much luck the others were having, but his search was proving fruitless. He'd found not a single summoning stone in all the time he'd been searching. He was considering just giving up and heading back empty handed, since there didn't seem to be any hope of finding any. However, as luck would have it, just as he was turning around to head back to Anna, his foot collided with something hard hidden in the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? Is this...?\" Alfonse mumbled to himself, reaching down into the grass to pull out what he'd found. As he suspected, the smooth, round, object was indeed a summoning stone. A small smile graced his face as he realised he'd no longer be going back empty handed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Alfonse only got the briefest of glimpses as the colour of the stone before it suddenly began to glow, as it had been activated by Breidablik. \"What? What's going on?\" Before long, the glowing light began to spread out from the stone, engulfing the surrounding area. Alfonse had a feeling he was in trouble now. Normally, their summoner stood back away from the stone, the give the new hero ample room to appear, but somehow, the stone seemed to be summoning on its own with Alfonse stuck right at the centre. Most people would probably have dropped the stone and ran, regardless of what it might do or which hero was contained within, but for some reason, Alfonse couldn't bring himself to drop it, and he was stuck standing firmly in place with the stone clenched in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the light grew blinding, Alfonse felt a wave of energy rush through him, the summoning being performed. He just hoped that whatever side effects standing in the middle of a summoning might have weren't too severe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did the stone do to Alfonse?</span></div></div>",

Alfonse wiped the dirt of his clothes. Wow, he didn't realize he was dressing so plain at the moment. This drab boring outfit was functional for battle, but no fun at all. Something prettier and with more purple would be very nice. Oh, and if he could get something that accentuated his muscles and male organ that would be great too.

His body still felt kind of weird, but thankfully, nothing seemed to be out of place. In fact, after some thorough examination, he concluded that nothing had changed about him at all. There was also no evidence of any Hero being summoned, leaving Alfonse to wonder what exactly the light as about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe still held the stone in his hand, but its light had dimmed, as if it had already been used up. Clearly it should have done something, but with nothing obviously different about himself, a no new Hero standing beside him, he had no idea what it might have done. With a small sigh, he began to walk back to base, clutching the stone in his hand, allowing the mystery roll around in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alfonse! There you are!\" Anna called out as Alfonse approached. It seemed he was the last to arrive, having travelled the furthest out from the base. Anna stood alongside Alfonse's sister, Sharena, and the Order of Heroes' summoner, Kiran, and behind them was a small pile of summoning stones. \"Did you find anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one, Commander,\" he said, a little embarrassed as he presented the stone he was carrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like it's already been used,\" Kiran mused, more familiar with summoning stones than the rest of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it does. It looked normal when I first found it, but then it suddenly started glowing, and the area round me lit up, like it was summoning something, but there was no one besides me when it faded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one seemed to have a solid answer for what had happened, being just as clueless as Alfonse had been when it first happened. \"Was that all that happened? Nothing else changed after the stone lit up?\" Kiran asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my body felt a little strange, but nothing seemed to be different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Sharena decided to speak up, sounding as excited as ever. \"Oh! Maybe the stone's power went into you! Maybe you can summon other Heroes now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sharena, I don't think that's how summoning stones work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's worth a try, at least,\" Anna suggested. \"We won't know what happened if we don't try anything. Plus, if you can summon using the stones power, that's going to save us a lot of orbs.\" Of course Anna would be thinking about ways to save money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfonse sighed. \"Very well.\" He took a few steps back, just in case it really did work, closed his eyes, and concentrated. He wasn't sure if he should be focusing on any one Hero in particular, and so instead, he just tried to focus on the weird feeling that hadn't entirely subsided within him. Eventually, a light reached his closed eyes, much to his surprise. Was it really working? Unbeknownst to him, however, it wasn't the stone that was glowing this time, nor was there a pillar of light to signal the arrival of the new Hero. Instead, it was his body that shone, glowing brighter to hide the way it reshaped into a new form, taking on the appearance of a Hero that could have been summoned with his stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat colour was the stone he found, though?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Yet another transformation story I had on my mind that nobody has done. This one is Fire Emblem. While not one of Nintendo's more well known franchises, I feel it's earned it's place. Here's the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. For Characters Robin and Corrin, Their default male and female designs will be used for simplicity. I know they can be customised, but let's not make things too complex.<br>\r\n2. No doing a simple gender bender for those two characters either. What I mean is don't just turn them from male to female(and vice versa). The reason for this is because you'd be just turning them into their variant that already exists, and that would really provide much in terms of story. Simple gender bender is alright with everyone else, but be more creative with these two.<br>\r\n3. No stories about a Manakete transforming into a dragon. That's cheating because it's a natural transformation for them. You'd just be writing an ordinary Fire Emblem story by doing that. That goes for any natural transformations. You could have somebody who's not a manakete get turned into one.<br>\r\n4. Playable Allies who start off as enemy characters go in the category of playable allies. That said, If they are only playable for one chapter in the game and later defect to fighting for the enemy (such is the case of Orson from Sacred Stones), those ones are placed in with enemy characters.<br>\r\n5. Awakenings DLC allies do not count for playable in Awakening. Amiibo characters do not count for playable allies for Fates. Also, any characters that are acquired as allies post game in their respective game do not go in that category either such as main enemies in Sacred Stones.<br>\r\n6. This should go without saying but, don't go killing off whoever the main focus of the story is. If the protagonist dies, there is no story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up, We have one character who is a special case. That Character is Anna. It's established there is already more than one Anna, and she appears in many games as an NPC. She's playable in Awakening and Fates. The said, She will be in both the Playable and non Playable categories. The reason for this being differentiating the playable Annas from the non playable Annas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's that. We can begin whenever.</td>",
