Boring... Batman still in the Batcave's ICU after a recent battle with Bane. <span class=\"clgrey\">Hey squirt, whactcha doin?</span> Nothin. Only being mindnumbingly bored. <span class=\"clgrey\">Want me to play with you then?</span> No! Whenever you want to \"play\" with me, I always end up unconscious. <span class=\"clgrey\">Well SORRY that crime fighting makes my feet all sweaty. And dont act like you dont LOVE it.</span> I really dont. <span class=\"clgrey\">Really? Wanna play a game then?</span> Sure, cause I'll win! <span class=\"clgrey\">Ok then, here are the rules. Your face will be my footstool for the next 10 minutes, if you: A.) Pass out or B.) Show interest of ANY kind in my feet, then we do this my way. If by some miracle you win, we'll do it your way.</span> You're on! <span class=\"clgrey\">Cmon. Sit.</span> She pats the ground in front of her and starts taking her thigh high boots and socks off. You sit in front of her and mentally prepare yourself. In all honesty, you do love her feet, they're so soft and smell pretty nice on days when she's not running around with you and Batman all day. But since Batman's down and out, neither of you have been on a mission in weeks. So hopefully Barbara's feet smell nice... Batgirl places her feet on your face. They're so soft, and they smell like roses... literally... That combined with her natural foot smell makes you take a big whiff... <span class=\"clgrey\">Ding ding ding! We have a winner! Wow, you lasted about 5 seconds.</span> Cheater! You made sure your feet smelled really nice so that I'd lose! <span class=\"clgrey\">Figured that out all by yourself did you? Your detective skills are truly worthy of Batman.</span> You simply glare at her angrily through your mask. <span class=\"clgrey\">We obviously wont be going on missions anytime soon. Why are we still in costume?</span> Dont change the subject cheater! You bring up a valid point though. <span class=\"clgrey\">How about we change into something more comfortable then?</span> Whoa! I know you're only like 3 years older than me. But that's kinda extreme! <span class=\"clgrey\">If you continue to model yourself after Bruce you'll be alone your whole life. I meant our regular clothes.</span> Oh... I'm embarassed now... You say as you blush.<br>\r\n<u>10:15 AM, Wayne Manor Living Room</u><br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">Oh! That's nice. A little to the left squirt.</span> You wanna rub your foot yourself? <span class=\"clgrey\">Ok! Ok! Do it however you want.</span> You smile at her in a way that says \"Ha ha, I win!\" The doorbell rings. You wanna get or should I? <span class=\"clgrey\">Alfred will get it.</span> Right. You switch to her other foot and start to rub it. A woman steps into the living room, who is it?</span></div></div>",

How is Bruce doing?</span> <span class=\"clgrey\">He's doing alot better. Thanks for asking Selina.</span> Bruce is in the ICU. Why are you dressed so hot? <span class=\"cgrape\">Aww! Aren't you a precious little kitten!</span> How degrading. <span class=\"cgrape\">What? You dont like cats? It was a complement. Translated it means: Well, aren't you cute.</span> Oh. Yeah cats are cool, they dont bark or make loud noises, and you dont have to let them out when they do their business. Thanks then, I guess. <span class=\"clgrey\">I've got some studying to do, I'll catch up with you two later.</span> Selina sits next to you on the couch and kicks her heels off. She then puts her feet on your lap. W-why'd you do that? <span class=\"cgrape\">I saw you massaging Barbara's feet when I walked in. And these heels kill my feet.</span> I l-lost a b-bet. <span class=\"cgrape\">Why so nervous?</span> She wiggles her toes a bit, wafting their scent towards you. They're painted a sexy hot pink color. The smell is starting to get to you. Another 3 seconds pass and you go to town kissing and licking her feet madly. She pets you like a cat the whole time. <span class=\"cgrape\">Good kitty.</span> The name no longer bothers you, as you're way too interested in her feet to care about anything else right now. She pulls her feet away. Why'd you do that! <span class=\"cgrape\">You need to learn some control. Trust me, you'll thank me later. Now, give me a proper foot massage and I'll consider giving you some more fun time at my feet.</span> Fine. <span class=\"cgrape\">Fine what?</span> Fine Selina. You grab one of her feet and start rubbing it, making good use of your videogame skills by masterfully working your fingers on her feet. She's... Purring? Happily the whole time. <span class=\"cgrape\">You did a purrfect job. Where'd you learn to do that?</span> I play alot of videogames. She brings her foot up to your face and pinches your nose with her toes. She then unclamps it and you take in a strong whiff. It only serves to further your lust because her feet smell like Lavender. Thank you Selina. <span class=\"cgrape\">You've earned it little kitten.</span> She smiles at you. You continue sniffing her foot for the next 15 minutes or so. She takes foot away again, but this time you dont complain. Selina taps her fingers on her chin, wondering what to do next. <span class=\"cgrape\">Alright little kitten, you've served me well. Why dont you do whatever you want to my feet.</span> Wha-whatever? <span class=\"cgrape\">Anything you want cutie. Dont be so shy, I know you're still a kid. But maybe an \"Old lady\" like me could teach you a thing or two.</span> She winks at you. You're not old! You've probably got 5 years on Barbara, tops. You're gorgeous. She smiles at you seductively in an almost evil way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1: <span class=\"cgrape\">Let me slip into something more comfortable.</span> She comes back dressed in her Catwoman costume, ties you up with her whip, and gives you a foot-job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #2: <span class=\"cgrape\">Would you like a foot-job to... Calm your little friend down?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #3: <span class=\"clgrey\">Hey guys, I'm back.</span> (Double foot worship)</span></div></div>",

How are ya doin?</span> Dr. Quinnzell? <span class=\"clgrey\">Harley Quinn? Why are you here?</span> <span class=\"cred\">I'm flattered that ya recognized me without my costume. But why I'm here is a secret.</span> Harley pulls out a... straw? And shoots a dart at Barbara, knocking her out. What'd you do to her? <span class=\"cred\">She looked a little tired, so I helped her catch a few Z's. Now as for you...</span> What are you gonna do to me? <span class=\"cred\">Nothing major, I just want you to have a Heart to Heart with Harley Quinn!</span> So you're gonna give me dating advice? <span class=\"cred\">I am a certified psychologist. So tell me what's wrong sweetie.</span> She sits on the couch and crosses her legs. Nothing's wrong, I'm fine. <span class=\"cred\">Really? So you're tellin me that you dont have any problems finding a girlfriend. And you dont have mad lust for certain parts of ladies?</span> Who told you about my foot fetish!? <span class=\"cred\">You did. Just now.</span> She cracks an evil little smile. You facepalm yourself realizing what you've just done. Harley starts taking off her tennis shoes and her socks, revealing that she has black nail polish on her left foot, and red on her right. She wiggles her colorful toes to get your attention. <span class=\"cred\">Hey munchkin! My eyes are up here!</span> What? Oh, sorry. <span class=\"cred\">It's ok sweetie. I'm used to guys drooling all over me. But usually different parts. Tee hee. Now c'mon, why dont you show my feet how much you love them!</span> You walk over to the couch and sit down next to her. You grab her left foot and start rubbing it, making sure to focus on her toes. <span class=\"cred\">Mmm. That's nice. Ok, other foot now.</span> You grab her left foot and begin rubbing it, again making sure to focus on her toes. <span class=\"cred\">Good job munchkin! Ok, since you did such a wonderful job rubbing my feet, I'll let you have a little fun. Go for it footboy!</span> You grab both of her feet and bring them up to your face. You take huge whiff and her feet kinda smell like vanilla. After a few seconds however, the smell is making you too horny to not start licking her feet. <span class=\"cred\">Ooh! I gotta get people to do this more often.</span> You switch to sucking on her toes one by one, just like lollipops. Then you shove five into your mouth at once. <span class=\"cred\">Such a good little munchkin.<i> I might even try to seduce you into becoming my new sidekick...</i></span> Harley wiggles her toes inside your mouth to get your attention. You look up at her. <span class=\"cred\">Now that I have your attention. I wanted to ask you a question.</span> You take her toes out of your mouth. Sure. What is it Harley? You say blissfully. <span class=\"cred\">How would you like to become my new sidekick? Mista J used to have one called Prank. Maybe I'll call you that...</span></span></div></div>",

Prank!</span> You put on the costume as instructed. What about my face? <span class=\"cred\">I'll help you with your makeup.

In one fluid, yet savaging blow, the fiery projectile collided with your upper torso, sending you flying backwards. The sheer impact of the fireball was enough to derail your momentum even before you hit the ground. Your hand instantly dropped the second Batarang that you were aiming at Ivy\u2019s chamber, mere seconds away from being launched as you began your downward spiral towards to the ground.<br>\r\nIt was the ultimate shot, the biggest shot, and unfortunately, the last shot that you could endure. You had survived countless waves of inmates, chemically altered beasts, even reality-bending nightmares, but you could not survive the wrath of Poison Ivy. <br>\r\nYou were unceremoniously thrown off your feet as the fireball penetrated your suit, nearly burning your armor into ashes. Thankfully, your protective armor managed to lessen the damage, but at the cost of its own integrity. <br>\r\nWith an emphatic thud, you crumbled to the floor a fatigued, beaten, but most importantly shell of your former self. Sudden discharges flowed throughout your suit as System: Malfunction notices flooded your visor. You could barely hit the seismic sounds of Ivy\u2019s pet behemoth grow nearer over the sudden pounding of blood in your ears, as well as the stiffness of your joints. The fight knocked out of you, a cold sweat began running down your spine as the sudden realization hit you.<br>\r\n<i>You failed. <br>\r\nYou failed not only yourself, but all of Gotham for that matter. You had failed to stop Poison Ivy, whose threat eclipsed even the Joker\u2019s at this level. Now enhanced by the Titan formula, Ivy was even more powerful than before, and with her fanatical ideology, the innocents of Gotham would pay the ultimate price, that is, if there still is a Gotham tomorrow.<br>\r\nBut more importantly than that, you had failed yourself. You had failed to uphold the promise you swore upon your parent\u2019s grave, that you would fight injustice and bring order back to the streets of Gotham. That you would devote your entire life towards extinguishing crime from the face of the earth, and strive to make sure your parent\u2019s sacrifice would be worth something. <br>\r\nOf course, you knew that the legend of the Dark Knight would never last forever. You knew that there would come a day where you would fall, and hopefully others would rise to take your place. But never did you even suspect that that day would come today, when the people of Gotham dependent on you the most, or even by the hands of Poison Ivy. </i><br>\r\nIf only to punctuate that sudden realization, Ivy\u2019s triumphant laughter broke your train of thought, and immediately dug into every inch of your skin. It was the laughter of a woman who at long last tasted the fruits of victory, and she was pleased. <br>\r\nA sudden numbness began overwhelming your joints and muscles as you felt the behemoth\u2019s seismic movements grow even closer. Fatigue from an entire night of doing the work of a hundred men had slowly been eating away at your resolve, but now, you were out of energy to spare. You had exhausted your own physical limitations, and even at peak condition, the human being couldn\u2019t take but so much. <br>\r\nGritting your teeth angrily, you tried shaking that numbing feeling, rolling around, even bulging your biceps, but with every sound you tried moving, an aching pain punished you. Even your body knew that you had been defeated. <br>\r\nSoon, the behemoth collided with the ground, causing a small shockwave that gave you goosebumps. The sounds of the vine chamber opening caused you to shudder, knowing full well that the vindictive plant queen would much would probably to do the honors...<i>personally</i>. <br>\r\n\u201cYou came <i>so </i>close, Batman,\u201d came her taunting sneer, as the cracked chamber finally slid open, and Poison Ivy stepped out. <br>\r\n\u201cBut no man is a match for my babies. Not even you,\u201d she taunted yet again, her words slicing through your skin like knives through butter. <br>\r\nIt was that fact that she had finally lived up to her own arrogant tagline that irked you to no end, the fact that her plants actually did defeat you!<br>\r\n<i>\u201cBut you realize that now, don\u2019t you?\u201d </i><br>\r\nYou instinctively cringed as the sound of Ivy\u2019s bare feet approached, her soles loudly plodding on the ground. It was almost humiliating, just listening to her footsteps knowing full well that you can\u2019t do anything to stop her or her plants. <br>\r\n\u201cYour precious Gotham is mine now, darling. My children will enjoy tearing down your little paradise brick by brick, and the blood of those murderers will provide proper nourishment for my babies,\u201d she sneered, absolutely taking her time, relishing in watching you squirm. <br>\r\nOut of your peripheral vision, you could make out her blurred red-and-green form sauntering towards you, one hand on her hips, and a vindictive grin carved all over her unblemished face. <br>\r\nDressed from head to toe in a floral green, her alluring, promiscuous nature had certainly been reflected by her attire. Her official <i>Arkham Asylum</i> patient uniform was shed in favor for a more seductive look, only retaining her jacket. She wore no pants, instead revealing her long, shaped legs and bare feet, symbolizing her connection with the Earth. Her groin area was covered with a leafy green foliage pantie stretched to fit her hips, and her <i>Arkham Asylum</i> jacket was largely unbuttoned, only keeping two buttoned at the middle to contain her cleavage. Sleeves rolled up, her fingernails were also adorned with red nail polish.<br>\r\nDespite her human like appearance, Ivy was clearly more plant than woman. Her genetic coding had been infused with plant DNA, causing her body to emulate a more plant-like appearance. The newly created chlorophyll running through her veins had caused pigments in her body to color her skin a leafy green from top to bottom. Her poison-laced lips were a crimson red, perhaps make her more vampiric. To cap it off, her hair was a fiery red, not bound by any material to allow it to flow more freely, creating a more natural, untamed look. Her eyes of course, were a light green. To add to those bizarre features, vines had latched on her body, maneuvering in such a manner as to resemble body tattoos. They seemed to be already embedded within her skin. Covering her body in a darker shade of green, the vines only seemed to emphasize Ivy\u2019s connection with nature.<br>\r\nHowever, based on your...<i>distinct </i>position, the most noticeable part of Ivy, weirdly enough, were her bare feet. Her toes adorned in a bright red nail polish, she strutted towards you at a very \u2018supermodel\u2019-esque pace, showcasing her very desirable body, but it was her feet that stood out the most, so much so that you could vividly describe the process of her step. <br>\r\nHer heel collided briefly with the floor first, before her sole gently rested on the ground, allowing her toes to grip the long grass. Finally, she lifted her foot up and after showing her quite sexy arch, began to place her other foot forward, repeating the process. In a way, it was actually quite alluring, attractive perhaps. <br>\r\n<i>Of course, that could probably be the concussion talking. </i><br>\r\nHer delicate, poison-tipped lips curled into a vindictive smile as she finally came to a halt on one side of your cowl, now towering above you. <br>\r\nYour vision finally cleared to the sight of her painted toes, smudged slightly from your back-and-forth duel, now centimeters from your mouth. Out of the corner of your eye, you could make out her absolutely<br>\r\n\u201cHurts, doesn't it?\u201d Ivy sneered vindictively, now just pouring salt over your open wounds. <br>\r\nGroaning slightly, you tried turning away, but sharp pains in your torso and legs disagreed. <br>\r\nShe merely snickered evilly under her breath, absolutely relishing your wounded state. <br>\r\n\u201cDid you really think, Batman, that you could beat Mother Nature all by yourself?\u201d she chided with the playful tone of a schoolhouse teacher. <br>\r\nA pained groan escaped your charred lips as she knelt down beside you, her pheromone cloud beginning to circulate around you, only enhancing her flowery scent. <br>\r\n\u201cPamela\u2026..please,\u201d you croaked out weakly, but Ivy hushed your pleas by closing your lips together with her index finger. <br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not in any position to make demands, darling,\u201d she purred in a sexy drawl, before letting her delicate fingers caress your bruised cheekbone, her nails gliding over your charred flesh and slash marks. <br>\r\nGrinning from corner to corner, she cradled your head in her forearms, like a mother cradling her newborn, stroking your face gently before her lips curled into a triumphant grin. <br>\r\n<i>\u201cHowever, you are going to give in to mine.\u201d  </i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The head of Ivy\u2019s botanic monster finally crashed to the ground, creating shock-waves that dusted your weary cape, the dust littering your already torn and bullet-hole ridden cape.<br>\r\nAs the chamber collided with the door, you could barely make out Ivy still inside, her body limp and motionless as an effect of the empathetic connection she had to her \u201cbabies.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Whatever they felt she felt, only worse</i>,\u201d you grimly thought to yourself, a Batarang still in one hand.<br>\r\nYou had been fighting Ivy for the better part of ten minutes, evading her fireballs and taking down the hypnotized Arkham staff she managed to ensnare with her pheromones. The battle was over for her, but for you, the war was only beginning. Joker still had an abundant supply of Titan with him, and now that Ivy\u2019s threat had been neutralized, you could focus on taking him down.<br>\r\nMemories of the last few moments flashed before your eyes, as you recalled how one decisive Batarang through Ivy\u2019s protective shell was enough to down the self-appointed plant queen, the Batarang only adding to the cracks already protruding from her shell. With that blow, you had defeated Poison Ivy, if only barely.<br>\r\nYou instinctively cringed as her seductive voice rang through your head, her vines choking you with the vengeance of a boa constrictor. Plus, your suit was still partially burned from all the toxic bubbles that had slammed into your body armor. Even with all your gadgets, it was Ivy\u2019s own hubris that cost her everything. Her own arrogance that would become her downfall.<br>\r\nShe had unknowingly made herself vulnerable every time she peeled back her outer shell to the cocoon, a mistake that you gladly took advantage of. With every Batarang that connected, you could feel her mental control over the monster deteriorate, and finally, with one last shot to the toxic temptress, she lost full control of the primal beast.<br>\r\nGingerly approaching the chamber, you drew your always trusty Explosive Gel. Out of your peripheral vision, you gazed at her fallen warriors, the hypnotized Arkham staff who lay unconscious on the ground, the unintended casualties of your duel with Poison Ivy.<br>\r\nFinally reaching the outer chamber shell, you couldn't help but glare at the defeated villainess, her body still wrapped in vines. Out of pity for the former scientists, you refrained from quipping out any one-liners, instead resolving to end this before innocents in Gotham could be harmed by her radical fury.<br>\r\nSpraying the chamber with the Gel in the shape of a fitting Bat symbol, you instinctively stepped back as your finger closed around the trigger, preparing for detonation.<br>\r\nJust as your thumb touched the trigger, Ivy suddenly snapped out of her dazed form, instantly realizing what was happening. She futilely jumped at you, her fists pounding the shell from inside.<br>\r\n\u201cPlease Batman don\u2019t! Don\u2019t hurt my babies!\u201d she pleaded, her eyes almost begging you.<br>\r\n\u201cYour \u2018babies\u201d would've destroyed this island as well as Gotham. I\u2019m shutting you down Ivy,\u201d you retorted stoically. <br>\r\n\u201cNo please!\u201d she whimpered, causing you to shudder inside, realizing the lows Ivy was willing to drop to protect her children.<br>\r\nStill, for a second there, you nearly hesitated, and risked her taking advantage of your sympathy. But you of all people knew that Ivy was just like the other criminals, perfectly willing to leech off of your own sympathy and use it as her own personal ammunition.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Pamela, but I\u2019d be risking the lives of every single man and woman on this island, as well as thousands more in Gotham if I just \u2018let you go.\u2019\u201d you ultimately refused, your thumb pressing down on the trigger.<br>\r\n\u201cWait, I know where the rest of the guards are!\u201d she suddenly blurted out, at this point resorting to any means necessary to protect the plants.<br>\r\nDeciding to humor her pleas, you rolled your eyes, knowing that you had already rescued all the Arkham staff.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d you growled, becoming more and more irritable.<br>\r\n\u201cThe men, the guards who wanted to lock me back up in that cell. I only converted half of them to my cause, the rest I\u2026..<i>locked away</i>,\u201d she confessed, a sly grin spreading across her face when she realized that she had the edge over you.<br>\r\nKnowing that Ivy would resort to any measures to protect her babies, you continued pressing the question, hoping to knock her off guard.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean, locked away?\u201d you demanded.<br>\r\n\u201cIn the penitentiary, while you were busy in Killer Croc\u2019s lair. I had captured ten of the meat-sacks, and had my \u2018babies\u2019 lock those monsters away in those other\u2019s lunatic\u2019s cells. Quite fitting, now that I think about it.\u201d She stopped to savor your irritable expression before continuing. \u201cKnowing that you were coming after me, I couldn't risk them going free with their hands stained in the blood of my poor children. When I locked them inside, I filled the room with an airborne toxin, one of my newest creations. They\u2019ll be dead within the hour.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if I say you\u2019re lying?\u201d you snarled through gritted teeth.<br>\r\n\u201cSo you <i>don\u2019t</i> want to save your people?\u201d she purred, a clever grin brewing on her face knowing that she had you in check, with only one way out.<br>\r\n<i>Her way.</i><br>\r\nYou narrowed your eyes, knowing that she had a point. It was too big of a risk to let her go, but also too big of a risk to jeopardize those guards if she was indeed telling the choice.<br>\r\nReluctantly, you put down the Explosive Gel, taking a minute to ponder the legitimacy of her confessional. From a psychological standpoint, you knew that a person would do anything to escape capture, even compromising their trump card. But from a logical standpoint, it didn't add up to why Ivy would risk losing her advantage over you this quick.<br>\r\nStill, you had an advantage as well in the form of the Gel, and you intended on pressing that advantage.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat keeps me from pulling this trigger right now and killing every plant in this greenhouse, Ivy?\u201d you continued, trying to call her bluff.<br>\r\n\u201cMorality, conscience, try a sense of obligation darling. I know that you of all people couldn't live with yourself if those poor innocent officers met their end right now. Their blood would be on your hands dear, not mine,\u201d she pointed out, her seamless logic even catching you off guard.<br>\r\nAmidst your internal tug-of-war of the issue, Ivy had mentally summoned a vine to her aid, the lone plant slithering across the ground behind you. Crawling over the unconscious bodies of her brainwashed muscle, the vine was nearing you at a breakneck pace, and you couldn't be anymore oblivious.<br>\r\n\u201cWe do this, we do this my way, Ivy! No tricks, no going back on your word. We do this, we do it my way, and mine alone. You so much as breathe in my direction, and I\u2019ll make sure you never walk again!\u201d you growled.<br>\r\nIn response, she merely flashed a seductive smile at you, her face still pressed against the cracked shell.<br>\r\n\u201cOh come now Batman. I thought you knew me better than that,\u201d she smiled, causing you to collectively cringe.<br>\r\nNow shelving the Explosive Gel, you started to break open the shell to release Ivy, when she did the one thing that you should've seen coming from the moment she started lying. <br>\r\n<i>She outsmarted you.</i><br>\r\nThe vine wrapped around your wrist just as you were about to pound through the shell, catching you by surprise, and to your utter regret, off guard.<br>\r\nWith your hand now ensnared by Ivy\u2019s vine, you attempted to slice through it with your gauntlet blades, only for another vine to curl around your neck, constricting you. As it tightened around your throat, you were forced to stare at Ivy, who waved at you almost mockingly, her eyes taunting you.<br>\r\n\u201cAfter all, if you knew me, you\u2019d know that I\u2019d rather die than help you, you pathetic meat-sack,\u201d she snarled, as another vine wrapped around your waist.<br>\r\n\u201cBut don\u2019t worry darling, at least their deaths will be quick, painless even, but for your crimes against nature Batman, you will die a beaten, broken man by my feet,\u201d she smiled, before flicking her fingers towards you dismissively.<br>\r\nObeying their mistress, the vines threw you backwards, your arms flailing wildly through the air as you attempted to regain some sense of balance. Landing hard on your neck, the momentum carried you over on your sides. Rolling over on your back, you opened your eyes just in time to see your Explosive Gel, right in front of you.<br>\r\nWithout thinking, you lunged at the gun, only for fate to reveal its cruel hand. Just as your fingertips touched the gadget, one of Ivy\u2019s vines pounded it into the ground, crushing it into pieces just as you were about to grasp it.<br>\r\nYour eyes widened in surprise as you instead picked up the remains of your \u201csecret weapon\u201d against Poison Ivy, the gel splattered across the floor and the machine parts littered across the gooey remains.<br>\r\nTurning towards the plant queen with an unmistakable fury in your eyes, you saw how she managed to regain control over the beast, and willed the creature to lift itself off of the ground, its cracks still visible.<br>\r\nA confident smile decorated her face, as she leered at you from above, the vines once again wrapping around her body, keeping her tethered to the creature.<br>\r\n\u201cNow, what are you going to do, little man?\u201d she grinned, as the plant creature reached its full height.<br>\r\n\u201cYou made a mistake, Isley. I\u2019ll make sure you won\u2019t make another one,\u201d you snarled, drawing a Batarang from your utility belt.<br>\r\n\u201cA mistake dear? No, I\u2019m afraid it was you that made the mistake, Batman, when you decided to go up against Mother Nature,\u201d she proclaimed proudly, as the plant creature roared at him.<br>\r\nIt was at that second that you knew what you had to do.<br>\r\n<i>Defeat Poison Ivy.</i></span></div></div>",

Her face was absolutely livid with fury, and you merely smiled at her chagrin. <br>\r\n\u201cGood, then maybe you\u2019ll start listening to reason, Pamela,\u201d you smiled in return, clearly relishing in her infuriated expression. <br>\r\nUpon first glance, any other male would've been immediately entranced by her quite alluring and seductive appearance. The former botanist was almost naked, save for a foliage pantie that stretched between her hips, covering her groin area as well as a red Arkham City jacket that she left unbuttoned save for one at the very center, containing her cleavage. <br>\r\nHer skin complexion was a leafy green, a likely side effect of the effects of her \u201cfailed\u201d experiments years ago. What appeared to be vines decorated her body almost like body tattoos. Her fiery red hair was untamed, dropping down from her shoulders. Her eyes, a lighter shade of green, were visibly annoyed as they glared at you. Her toes, as well as her fingernails, were painted a bright red. <br>\r\n\u201cReason? You are the<i> reason</i> why my \u2018babies\u2019 fear and despise you pathetic meat-sacks, and you will be the reason why I destroy Gotham, darling,\u201d she screeched instead, defiance still prevalent in her. <br>\r\nYou sighed, knowing that she was far too stubborn to give up, at least not willingly. <br>\r\n\u201cCase you haven\u2019t noticed Pamela, your \u2018reason\u2019 for all this stemmed from Professor Strange, who brought you to Arkham City in the first place. Now, he\u2019s dead and you\u2019re fighting an already lost battle,\u201d you tried to reason with her, but to no avail. <br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps love, but you, like the rest of your precious Gotham, will join Strange soon enough,\u201d she smiled, before gesturing at you yet again. <br>\r\nAs if on cue, even more of her vines burst out of the ground, causing you to narrow your eyes irritably as they lunged at you, their mouths positively beaming with greenish liquids. Mere seconds after she mentally ordered the command, you let your honed instincts kick in. <br>\r\nThrowing yourself to your right, you let your shoulder hit the ground first, allowing for you to successfully roll to your feet, a Batarang drawn in each hand just as the vines whistled past your body. <br>\r\nThe vines made a U-Turn and continued pursuing you, but it was too late. <br>\r\nWithout hesitation, you hurled the projectiles at them, the twin Batarangs whistling through the air as they impaled their respective vines, the now limp vines flailing to the floor. <br>\r\nYou turned back to Ivy, who gestured at you yet again, her beautiful face now blemished by an ugly scowl. <br>\r\nJust as she flicked her finger at you, you could feel a rapid, almost violent vibration in the ground beneath you. As the ground continued to rumble, you quickly threw yourself backwards, not wanting to find out what lay beneath. <br>\r\nJust as your shoulders hit the ground now seven feet away, the ground that previously housed you suddenly exploded, a giant six-foot tall wooden spike shooting out of the floor where your feet were mere seconds ago. It would have impaled you, had your instincts been a few seconds slower.<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s new,\u201d you remarked aloud, before drawing another Batarang in one hand. <br>\r\nStill visibly agitated, Ivy gestured at you again, causing yet another one of her serpentine vines to unravel from the ceiling. Only this time, the vine was much larger than the previous ones, its sides decorated with sharp thorns. <br>\r\nWithout seconds of sensing your presence, the vine lashed out at you, but you were ready. <br>\r\nHurling the Batarang at it with extreme precision, the projectile flew through the air as it neared its target, now only feet away.<br>\r\nBut just as it was about to slice through the plant, the vine suddenly changed trajectory, instead maneuvering around the projectile with the agility of a cobra. <br>\r\nYour eyes widened at this unexpected act of strategy by the vines, but what surprised you even more was what came next.<br>\r\nWhile you missed your target, the vine certainly didn't miss its target, slashing you right across the cheek upon arrival. <br>\r\nWith a grunt, the combined momentum behind the vine\u2019s blow sent you flying backwards, as you landed on your stomach hard, your jaw sliding across the floor before your body skidded to a stop. You rubbed your cheek sorely, as an angry blotch soon formed on your already bruised and battered face. <br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re predictable, darling! Did you really think your little \u2018toys\u2019 would stand a chance against my babies? Unlike you Batman, my babies adapt to their surroundings. The only question is: can you?\u201d came Ivy\u2019s seductive purr.<br>\r\nOut of the corner of your eye, you could barely make out the vine hurtling towards you yet again, this time the very tip of its mouth aimed at your very vulnerable spine. <br>\r\nOnly this time, you were ready for it.<br>\r\nYou let your body grow limp as it neared you, instead waiting until it was within range. Within seconds, the vine was almost upon you, and you sprang into action.<br>\r\nFlipping over on your back, you hurled a freeze grenade at it just as it was about to impale you, the grenade flying through the air. A blue aura briefly erupted from the projectile before it finally exploded, containing the vine in a very large block of ice. The ice quickly stretched throughout its long snake-like body, successfully containing the plant, causing the forces of gravity to kick in. <br>\r\nWith a thud, the now limp vine crashed into the ground, splintering into several pieces in the process. <br>\r\nJumping to your fight, you smiled at the seething Ivy, still partially in shock. <br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one who's been busy since Arkham Asylum, Ivy. I've gotten some new upgrades,\u201d you grinned, much to her chagrin.<br>\r\n\u201cI see. But even your \u2018toys\u2019 can\u2019t save you from Mother Nature, Batman. And I\u2019m just getting started,\u201d she declared, before raising her hands, closing her eyes in deep concentration.<br>\r\nYou started to hurl a Batarang at her in her brief moment of vulnerability, but something stopped you. Or rather, someone. <br>\r\nJust when you were about to throw the Batarang at her, what looked like a human arm suddenly shot out of the ground. Except it was green, very green.<br>\r\nYou openly gaped as more of its body was revealed, the humanoid now digging its way out. First, its shoulder, then its torso, then its leg, then its head.<br>\r\nThe only problem was: it was your head.<br>\r\nIn a very crude twist of irony, its head was bat-shaped, or rather, shaped like your own cowl. Fitted with your own signature ears as well as the half-mask, a sinister smile crossed its face, as its entire torso became visible now. Same utility belt, same chest-plate, same cape. its skin felt genuine, except that it wasn't. Its brown skin complexion was actually a college of thinned tree roots working in perfect cohesion, merely creating the illusion of skin. Its suit had the same light blue/black color scheme, save for a starkly different insignia. A rose symbol. <br>\r\nYou nearly dropped the Batarang out of sheer disbelief, as Ivy somehow successfully managed to duplicate your own appearance into one of her own \u201ccreations.\u201d<br>\r\nWith one final push, the plant look-alike crawled out of the hole, much to the pleasure of the vindictive Ivy, who laughed at your shock. After brushing some dust off its shoulders casually, it turned to you, and began leisurely walking towards you, its fists clenched. <br>\r\n\u201cYou look surprised love. Is it because you have finally met your match, or perhaps, is it because the realization finally dawns on you, that you can\u2019t defeat Mother Nature?\u201d Ivy cried gleefully, as the creature continued stalking towards you.<br>\r\n\u201cYour plants are cute, Pamela, but if you think one of your bush sculptures will stop me, you\u2019re as delusional as ever,\u201d you declared heroically, trying to conceal your initial shock.<br>\r\n\u201cGood point. How about three?\u201d she quipped.<br>\r\nAs if on cue, two more Batman-look-alikes suddenly burst out of the ground, identical to the original in every way. They quickly turned to their leader, who nodded at them in return. <br>\r\nLike a collective brain, they simultaneously began stalking towards you, a three-on-one advantage. <br>\r\nYou narrowed your eyes, now forced to contend with three of Ivy\u2019s \u2018champions\u2019, as well as keeping the plant queen herself at bay. Still, a look of uncertainty began to dawn on you, as you involuntarily began backing away.<br>\r\nThe toxic temptress obviously noticed your reluctance and capitalized on it.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong Batman? You look scared,\u201d she sneered seductively, crossing her legs in her leafy throne.<br>\r\nDeciding to test just how similar they were to the original, you experimentally hurled your Batarang at one of them.<br>\r\nLike you feared, the clone caught the Batarang in mid-air, the blade just inches away from impaling its eye socket. It then almost casually crushed the steel projectile with both hands, before tossing it over its shoulder like a crumpled up piece of paper. <br>\r\n\u201cYour toys won\u2019t save you this time, darling, and neither with the Boy Blunder. Tonight, I'm going to destroy Arkham City, then, your beloved Gotham,\u201d she continued, absolutely beaming at your plight.<br>\r\n\"Once I get through with them Isley, I'm coming after you,\" you growled through gritted teeth.<br>\r\nIn response, she merely laughed exotically.<br>\r\n\"I doubt it.\"<br>\r\nThe clones soon surrounded him, their facial expressions blank but their fists clenched. You could tell that they were just waiting for their mistress to give the order.<br>\r\n\u201cBut first, I think I\u2019m going to enjoy this. You had your chance Batman, now time to die like the rest of the meat. Boys, if you will,\u201d she smiled, taunting you with a thumbs-down gesture.<br>\r\n<i>\u201cKill him.\u201d  </i></span></div></div>",

It soon became painfully obvious to you that going to Poison Ivy was an ill-fated decision, especially given the quite recent history between you too.<br>\r\nAfter all, you were responsible for her current state thanks to the Titan overdose, and if only to add fuel to the fire, you destroyed the mass majority of her plants at the old Arkham Island. <br>\r\nAnd as the vines continued to slither around your writhing body, your sudden realization of this truth couldn't be more obvious.<br>\r\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come here, Batman,\u201d came her taunting sneer, as the vines continued strangling you, denying you even a moment\u2019s rest.<br>\r\nAnd while your resilience was enough to power through the first couple of minutes, you had to rely on pure adrenaline and willpower to survive the next. <br>\r\n\u201cPamela, please,\u201d you pleaded, couching out between every wheeze in your voice. You could hardly breath, yet made out those two words, another example of your resiliency.<br>\r\n\u201cPamela Isley died a long time ago, darling. Maybe you should\u2019ve thought of that before you decided to intrude on our garden and take what so rightfully belongs to us,\u201d she smiled coyly, as the vines continued curling around your arms, the thorns pricking your body armor. <br>\r\nStill wincing heavily, you were starting to lose feeling in your legs as the vines continued entangling you in their intricate web of pain. The much larger vines had wrapped around your knees and ankles, rendering you immobile while the more smaller and agile ones wrapped around your neck and torso, effectively choking you. <br>\r\nLifting you off the ground, the vines suddenly tightened down on your midsection. You barely fought back a shriek through gritted teeth and determination, but even that was running out. And as you groaned audibly, your teeth clattering with every squeeze, you knew that deep down, Ivy was enjoying this.<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, darling! Scream for me, make this interesting for me! After all, with a snap of my fingers, I could kill you in a heartbeat! Why don\u2019t I give you an example?\u201d she purred evilly, before playfully snapping her hands together.<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the vines constricted around you with the strength of a boar, almost impaling your insides with your elbows. And as you felt their thorns tearing through your chestplate and digging into your exposed flesh, you could feel a surge of white hot pain emitting from your ribs. It was agony beyond the meaning of the word, and you could do nothing to stop it.<br>\r\n\u201cAaarrgghhh!\u201d You instinctively flinched as the first cry escaped your lips, the next few soon to follow. As soon as you heard it echo, you knew Ivy was listening. <br>\r\n\u201cYou can do better,\u201d she sang mockingly, before snapping her fingers yet again.<br>\r\nWith that, the thorns drew blood, drilling through your skin and lacerating your flesh in a crude pattern. Screaming out loud in pain, you knew that Ivy was absolutely ecstatic, knowing that she was exerting a certain degree of physical as well as mental dominance not shown by any of your other rogues. <br>\r\nFor as long as you held out, you soon found it futile to even struggle against the vines, for they were simply too relentless, too powerful for you to overcome. Fatigue had worn on your joints as well as a collection of bruises and cuts which had already accumulated over the course of the entire night. Factoring in Joker\u2019s diseased blood which had already weakened your internal systems as well, it was safe to say that you were clearly not running on 100%. <br>\r\nNoticing the resignation almost radiating from your body, Poison Ivy snickered wickedly, knowing that she was finally victorious, and that you had finally fallen victim to her vines. <br>\r\n\u201cNow now, I think our dear Dark Knight has had enough, my loves!\u201d she smiled, beaming at your plight. <br>\r\nObeying their mother\u2019s commands, the vines would loosen their death grip over you, gradually unraveling one at a time. Even though they weren't strangling you, you could still feel your insides being squished as they relented, your breaths becoming more and more realized. <br>\r\nAs soon as the last vine retracted from your chest, you collapsed in a heap, barely able to stand. Still wheezing form the vice grip, you panted heavily, and clutched your shoulder blades, which were still throbbing in pain. Tracing over the deep lacerations made by her vines over your exposed skin, you winced with every touch. <br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you thought you could contend with Mother Nature, and lost, little man,\u201d Ivy chided playfully, before beginning to saunter towards you. Her hips swaying about, you could barely make out her silhouette growing closer and closer. <br>\r\nIn the meantime, you barely managed to lift your head up as she neared you. From your peripheral vision, you could make out the plant queen almost taking her time sauntering down her throne to the ground, her hips swaying voluptuously. <br>\r\nPigmented in floral green from head to toe, the former botanist was truly a specimen to marvel. She only wore the standard Arkham City jacket, only two buttons at the center containing her cleavage. Her hair was a fiery red, untamed and freely flowing down her shoulders. Her legs were well-shaped, with leaves decorating her thighs and ankles. <br>\r\nThanks to your somewhat grounded position though, the first part of Ivy to come into sight would be her toes, each appropriately adorned in red nail polish. You couldn't help but notice how fitting they looked compared to the rest of her body, the red-and-green color scheme indicative of nature itself. <br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re ours now, Batman,\u201d Ivy purred seductively, her words rolling off her tongue in a sexy drawl.<br>\r\nShe finally came to a stop in front of you, as if she was showcasing her quite attractive physique. Still in a daze from the vice grip, you could still make out the green blur in front of you, as it finally cleared to reveal a leering Ivy, a triumphant grin spread across her face. <br>\r\n\u201cNow what ever shall I do with you, Mr. Batman? After all, you and I both know that your crimes against my children must not go unpunished, especially after what you did at the island,\u201d she purred, almost scolding you in a disciplinary manner. <br>\r\n\u201cYou were endangering the lives of the entire Arkham staff as well as the inmates, Isley. You had to be stopped!\u201d you tried to reason with her, but even you knew the futility of your words. <br>\r\n\u201cHah, those pathetic meat-sacks had it coming. After all, they were the ones who locked me up in that cell for months on end, separating me from my babies, torturing me with their pained cries for their mother.\u201d She stopped for a moment, and shuddered, as if repressing a bad memory. <br>\r\nShe reaffirmed her glare with a bright smile before continuing. <br>\r\n\u201cBut that\u2019s all in the past now, darling. After all, I have you now Batman, and I intend to make you pay, in <i>full</i>,\u201d she smiled.<br>\r\nShe started counting with her fingers, as if trying to think of crude ways to \u201cpunish\u201d you, her brow wrinkled in deep concentration. <br>\r\nSoon, you turned to desperation as a last resort, and decided to reveal your true motives for entering her lair. At this point, trying to entice the plant queen with an even trade would be most wise, especially given your current position.<br>\r\n\u201cPamela, please! I need a cure for Titan poisoning,\u201d you finally blurted out, catching even her off guard. <br>\r\nShe gave you a slightly puzzled look, before a clever, almost dominant grin settled in. And with that reveal, she leaned in towards you, a curious twinkle in her eyes. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d she smiled, tilting her head in mock confusion. <br>\r\n<i>You hated when she did that.</i><br>\r\n\u201cJoker poisoned me with his own blood, still contaminated with the Titan strain. And I know that you managed to cure yourself of the Titan overdose yourself back at the asylum. I\u2019m not asking for any favors Ivy, but an even trade,\u201d you proposed.<br>\r\nIn return, she merely laughed girlishly, almost in hysteria over your proposal. Tilting her head back, you could almost see tears rolling down her eyes before she calmed down, and flashed you yet another seductive grin. <br>\r\n\u201cAnd why should I help you, darling?\u201d she chided, stroking your chin affectionately.<br>\r\nDespite her smug exterior, you could tell from her eyes what she really wanted you to say. And as much as it would pain you, you had to give it to you. <br>\r\n\u201cBecause I can give you what you want,\u201d you said, your eyes concentrating on her.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d came her slightly bored reply. <br>\r\n\u201cPayback, revenge for your babies, a sense of fulfillment, of accomplishment even,\u201d you told her.  <br>\r\nShe raised an eyebrow, now piqued by your offer.<br>\r\n\u201cGo on,\u201d she prompted. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever it takes Ivy, anything that you want me to do. Give me the cure for the Titan formula, and you can have me, body and soul,\u201d you added, as if to sweeten to deal.<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure do know how to make a girl happy, Batman. Your offer is tempting, I will admit, but unfortunately for you dear I am the ultimate temptation,\u201d she smirked cleverly. <br>\r\nYou gritted your teeth angrily, having to swallow your pride and to a greater extent, your dignity. <br>\r\n\u201cThink about it, Ivy. I won\u2019t fight back this time. You can do whatever you want with me, finally do what you've always wanted,\u201d you continued to pressure, causing her eyes to glimmer mischievously. <br>\r\nShe cupped your chin with one hand, maintaining eye contact with you before continuing. <br>\r\n\u201cI should kill you, darling, for hurting my babies. But there\u2019s always a time for that. And besides, I have something more fitting for the likes of you,\u201d she finally accepted, albeit reluctantly. <br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019ll take my offer?\u201d you implored, your voice shaky.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll take <i>my</i> offer, darling,\u201d she corrected, caressing your bruised cheek with one finger.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d you asked, slightly afraid.<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you\u2019d never ask,\u201d she said, giving you a mischievous grin before saying:  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWhat?\u201d you instantly bellowed, absolutely arranged by this quite demeaning deed. <br>\r\nIt was finally those three words that finally broke you out of your stupor, that finally brought you back to the grim reality of it all. <br>\r\nYour struggles became reinvigorated as well, the vines sensing your struggles grow tenfold within seconds. But alas, Ivy had anticipated your resistance to this quite unorthodox request.<br>\r\nIn a split second, vines shot out of the crevices from the degraded floor and quickly wrapped around you in a floral web, binding your wrists behind your back and rendering you utterly defenseless, much to the delight of the plant queen.<br>\r\n\u201cYou heard me,\u201d she purred seductively, before standing up and extending her bare foot towards you. <br>\r\nDespite your struggles, the vines curled around your neck, before forcing your neck downwards, and subsequently your vision dropped to Ivy\u2019s (admittedly) well pampered right foot. <br>\r\nWith several vines adorned around the naked limb like tattoos, her slender arch created a visible shadow on the ground. The bright red nail polish adorning each of her shapely toes was a perfect companion to her floral green skin color, a surprisingly fitting contrast of red and green that certainly warranted a lingering yet curious from your lingering eyes.<br>\r\nEven Ivy noticed your lingering gaze and cooed softly as she sensed your hesitation. \u201cAs I told you long ago lover, no one can resist Poison Ivy. Not even you.\u201d <br>\r\nYour eyes narrowed as you glared back at her in solemn defiance. \u201cI\u2019d rather kiss the dirt six feet under.\u201d<br>\r\nShe made an offended sound as she cocked her hips to the side in an overly seductive pose. \u201cYou\u2019d rather die than do such a painless, harmless little thing as to kiss my foot?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you really want, Pamela? What's your real game here?\u201d you growled angrily, still struggling against her floral webbing.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, my dear Dark Knight,\u201d she purred. \u201cI only want you to admit the truth that\u2019s so apparent even the World\u2019s Greatest Detective must admit: that I am better than you. And what better way to show that than to kiss the feet of your obvious superior,\u201d she declared pompously, her hubris almost as palpable as the humidity. <br>\r\n\u201cI may be dying, but I\u2019m not that desperate. You\u2019d have better luck getting Harley to abandon the Joker than me prostrating myself just to satiate your ego,\u201d you snarled.<br>\r\nA twitch in her domineering smile betrayed a twinge of sympathy for the former Arkham Asylum psychiatrist turned psychopathic jester for the Joker. Poison Ivy had always had a soft spot for Harley Quinn, which could only be expected considering their similar backgrounds.<br>\r\nUsually, that was a weakness you could exploit but the plant queen quickly saw through and with a snap of her fingers the serpentine vines coiled around your already battered torso once again.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, but you <i>are </i>desperate, Batman. Why else would you come to me to give you an antidote for the Titan? You could\u2019ve thawed out that snowman Victor Frieze in Penguin\u2019s little museum if you wanted a possibility of a cure, but you knew that only my purity could cleanse you of the Titan strain. I really am your last hope now aren\u2019t I?\u201d she replied snidely, clearly relishing the control she had over you both physically and verbally.<br>\r\n\u201cNot.....that.....desperate,\u201d you maintained through gritted teeth as the vines continued restricting against you.<br>\r\nKneeling down in front of you, she playfully ran her fingers across your left cheekbone, the bruise left by Harley\u2019s baseball bat still throbbing as her fingertips touched it. Her presence mere inches away from you caused you to instinctively flinch, as the aura of pheromones around her attacked your senses on all sides and immediately began affecting your perception of the red haired vixen.<br>\r\nYour near indomitable will always cancelled out Ivy\u2019s pheromone suggestion before, but in your weakened state of mind and every ache and sore in your body now exacerbated thanks to the Titan coursing through your veins you were now becoming more and more susceptible to her influence.<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Tsk tsk </i>Batman. You could make all of this pain, all of this hurt go away. Just like that. All you have to do is pucker up, and give Mother Nature a little kiss. What\u2019s so bad about that?\u201d she grinned, her lower lip curling into a pout as you strained yourself not to lunge at her.<br>\r\n\u201cI-I can\u2019t,\u201d you finally grunted, just barely fighting off her control much to Ivy\u2019s utter amusement.<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t or won\u2019t, darling? You can\u2019t degrade yourself, but you can let Strange and his army of meat-sacks take over your city. Your <i>precious </i>Gotham, left ripe for the taking by those murderers and rapists. All because you wouldn't kiss my feet. You\u2019d rather see your city burn then humble yourself. You know, for all of your self-righteous talk you\u2019re just as arrogant as me, Batman,\u201d she sneered vindictively, her words piercing your skin like knives.<br>\r\n<i>Perhaps it was your impaired judgement thanks to her pheromones, or maybe it was the Titan formula finally seeping through into your disciplined psyche thanks to all of the poisoned blood pumping through your veins but somehow you found an unsettling truth in Poison Ivy\u2019s words.<br>\r\nFor all your bravado and unwavering nobility in the face of death, it would all mean nothing if you were to succumb to the Titan formula. Hugo Strange would initiate Protocol 10 as planned, which would no doubt create cataclysmic consequences for Arkham City. The Joker would have his last laugh as dozens in Gotham General perish from his poisoned blood. Countless innocent political prisoners and Arkham City staff within the prison would also be hunted down like animals and killed for the entertainment of psychopaths like Victor Zsasz and the Riddler.<br>\r\nAll because you were too proud to lower yourself this one time.<br>\r\nMuch as you would hate to admit it, the redhead\u2019s words struck a rather notable chord with you and you couldn\u2019t ignore it. You were sacrificing the needs of the many whom you sworn to protect just to preserve your own dignity, when it should be vice versa.<br>\r\nThe needs of the city must always come before your own. Always.</i><br>\r\nHer smug grin only grew wider as she saw the mental tug-of-war take place over your conflicted face. \u201cHaving second thoughts, are we?\u201d<br>\r\nThe resignation in your voice, after moments of expedited soul-searching, told her the whole story. \u201cYou\u2019ll keep your end of the deal, Ivy. The cure for a kiss.\u201d<br>\r\nTilting her head sideways, she playfully wagged her finger at you before leaning in even closer.<br>\r\n\u201cSilly Bat, I already told you. You\u2019ll do exactly as I say, and <i>like </i>it. Once I\u2019m satisfied, you\u2019ll get your cure,\u201d she chided.<br>\r\nYou quickly bit back a retort, realizing that at this point she had the higher ground and that it would be very advantageous for your own self-preservation and subsequently the protection of Gotham to simply acquiesce with her degrading demands.<br>\r\n<i>\"For now at least,\"</i> you reasoned to yourself.<br>\r\n\u201cFine,\u201d you grunted reluctantly under your breath, averting her gleaming eyes.<br>\r\nRefusing to give her the satisfaction initially, she quickly cupped your chin with her fingers and forced you to look her square in the eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cSay it again, darling. I want to see the words come out of your mouth,\u201d she snarled through gritted teeth, her lips curling into a smug grin as she could almost smell the defeat radiating off you. <br>\r\nDespite it all, you defiantly shot her your infamous soul-piercing glare that would render any superstitious and cowardly criminal weak at the knees. Unfortunately, due to current circumstances it lacked its usual fear factor.<br>\r\n\u201cYou win,\u201d you spat out venomously, barely containing your contempt for the plant queen. \u201cI\u2019ll kiss your feet.\u201d <br>\r\nAnd just like that she let your chin droop down and stood up with a triumphant smile, visibly pleased at your capitulation. <br>\r\n\u201cSee, that wasn\u2019t so hard was it, darling? You and your false bravado, always making things more difficult than they need to be. We both know you came to me for a reason, Batman. Because you need me. Only I can make you whole again. But my generosity comes with a price, and I fully expect to enjoy the fruits of our bargain,\u201d she declared, her hands on her curved hips. <br>\r\nYour eyes reluctantly dropped to her painted toes, pressed down against the dirt as her heel lifted off the ground. Glowering at the limb you would soon pay oral tribute to, your eyes couldn\u2019t help but admire her near immaculate blood red nail polish, her petite arches, her baby smooth heels, her everything. <br>\r\n\u201cTell me, Dark Knight, and be honest. What do you think of my red nail polish?\u201d she taunted just to rub it in further, arching her foot upwards so you could see her slender toes pressed against the ground. Despite your humiliating position, even you couldn\u2019t deny just how aesthetically pleasing the color was especially contrasted against her floral green flesh. <br>\r\n\u201cYou like it, don't you love?\u201d she added coyly, no doubt noticing the lingering stare you gave her extended foot.<br>\r\nSwallowing a lump of saliva as well as whatever remaining pride you had left, you mustered up your response.<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d you grunted feebly.<br>\r\n\u201cYes <i>what</i>?\u201d came her amused response, her hands on her curved hands as she struck another voluptuous pose. <br>\r\nSeething in silent fury, you could only grit your teeth in frustration. \u201cYes......<i>mistress</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGood boy!\u201d she cooed approvingly, lifting her right leg above your cowl and playfully patting the base of your mask with her foot. You did nothing but scowled as she slowly traced her painted toes down your face, yet another humiliating act that caused her to snicker inwardly in triumph. <br>\r\nAfter trailing down your chin, her toes touched the ground again, stretching and scrunching against the dirt floor anxiously as they awaited your literal lip service.<br>\r\n\u201cNow kiss my toes, Batman. <i>All </i>of them,\u201d she demanded in a dominant sneer, her words hovering above you as you lowered your neck and proceeded to: </span></div></div>",

Frustration.</i><br>\r\nBut all of those paled in comparison to the utterly demoralizing realization that came shortly after your lips pursed together and pressed against the vixen\u2019s painted toenail.<br>\r\n<i>You liked it.</i><br>\r\nThe Dark Knight, that inspired fear in the hearts of the most vile and villainous of Gotham City\u2019s criminal underbelly, who single handedly brought down entire criminal empires with his intelligence and resilience, who also filled the halls of Arkham Asylum with a rogues gallery of psychopaths and career criminals, had just willingly subjected himself to the worst kind of humiliation possible at the hands of his greatest female adversary and somehow derided a perverse pleasure from it.<br>\r\n\u201cSee, that wasn\u2019t so hard, was it?\u201d came her taunting purr as you kissed her big toe. Your tongue briefly brushed up against her flesh as you stared back at her beaming down at you with that condescending look of hers. <br>\r\nIn that moment, you wanted more than anything to wipe that smug grin off her face. You wanted more than anything to muster your strength back up, reach for that spare Batarang in your gauntlet, escape from her floral trap and simply take the cure by any means necessary.<br>\r\nBut there was a small part of you, inexplicably growing larger and larger by the minute, that liked the taste of her skin against your battered lips. That welcomed this sudden reversal in the usual power dynamics between you and your rogues\u2019 gallery. It was truly a startling emotional dichotomy you were forced to grapple with. <br>\r\nOn one hand, you hated how she was doing this to you.<br>\r\nYet somehow inexplicably, you also craved this sexual frustration that was awakening within you. <br>\r\n\u201cWell, keep going. My other babies are getting jealous, Dark Knight. Won\u2019t you make them feel better too?\u201d she sneered, wiggling her other toes as well. <br>\r\nThen, swallowing whatever dignity you still had left you reluctantly bent down yet again and quickly plastered another quick kiss on her next longest toe. <br>\r\nImmediately sensing you trying to get through this quickly, Ivy immediately jolted her foot forward and into your open mouth.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you-<i>hmmphhh</i>?\u201d you gagged as her big and index toes entered in your mouth and rested on your tongue.<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Tsk tsk</i>, Batman. You\u2019re not making my babies feel very loved,\u201d she scolded, wagging one finger in your face disapprovingly as the two toes currently in your mouth stretched out and began scratching at your uvula.<br>\r\nTasting a mixture of her sweaty odor and some dirt that had accumulated underneath her toenails you held back some choice comments as she merely chuckled. <br>\r\nThen, just as soon as she put them in she sensually withdrew her toes from your mouth. Wiping your saliva off on the ground, she resumed her high arched pose for your viewing pleasure.<br>\r\n\u201cNow, where were we?\u201d she smiled, her emerald eyes gleaming in sadistic pleasure at your humbling at the hands, or rather the <i>feet </i>of Poison Ivy. <br>\r\nThis time, you lingered a bit longer on her next toe. The sounds of your lips puckering against her toes must\u2019ve been music to the redhead\u2019s ears, because you could certainly feel the excitement and near ecstasy radiating off her scantily clad body.<br>\r\n\u201cOh. You have no idea how long I\u2019ve waited to see you in your rightful place, Batman. Like all the other meat-sacks will soon be. Worshiping Mother Nature,\u201d she exclaimed triumphantly, as you finally planted one last lingering kiss on her pinky toe.<br>\r\nOffering you the next one after she wiggled all of the toes that you had just finished kissing, Ivy was clearly enjoying every second of seeing you humble yourself like this for her entertainment.<br>\r\nIt was heaven for her, and hell on earth for you.<br>\r\nYet despite your mental objections, something in you began to change as you began planting more lingering and meaningful kisses on her foot. Not immediately, but gradually you felt a change in how you viewed her bare feet.<br>\r\nBefore, they were simply disgusting appendages used to degrade and demoralize you. But now, with every second that your lips remained planted on her skin they became more...<i>stimulating </i>for your senses. <br>\r\nAnd as ashamed as you were to admit this, by the third toe on her second foot you were beginning to crave the salty taste of her sweat lining the sides of her toes. The feel of her womanly flesh against your bruised and battered jawline. The scent of her unwashed and pungent toes wafting into your nostrils. <br>\r\nYour disciplined mind fought against this idea, but your body had all but succumbed to it. Each time she plopped a toe in your mouth, your taste buds exploded in euphoric pleasure. Every caress of his tongue against her satiny bottom caused waves of pleasure to ripple through your body, especially in your groin area.<br>\r\nHer mocking laughter boomed above and all around you. <br>\r\n\u201cLook at how <i>pathetic </i>you are, darling. To think that you somehow defeated me at the peak of my abilities at the Asylum is simply galling. But here you are, <i>worshiping </i>my feet.\u201d <br>\r\nThen, as if that same impulse somehow bypassed your honed mental faculties and gained control of your body, your tongue shot out and licked in between her middle and ring toes. Pulling back into your mouth a few specks of dirt mixed in with what could possible be her toejam had quite the effect on you.<br>\r\nMore surprising than that, it had quite the effect on Poison Ivy.<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Oooooh.</i> Momma liked that,\u201d came her sexy drawl, her voice suddenly husky and wanting, or at least more so than usual.<br>\r\nHer toes even began curling and clasping together in response as a heavy sigh escaped her lips. <br>\r\n\u201cDo that again, Batman,\u201d she half ordered half purred in a husky whisper, almost compelling you to make her aroused wish your command.<br>\r\nAnother sigh drenched in ecstasy escaped her lips as your tongue explored the area between her ring toe and pinky toe, causing her to almost shudder in euphoric bliss. <br>\r\nNow with the bitter taste of her foot odor as well as the ground that she had walked on now firmly ingrained within your taste buds, you somehow found yourself becoming fixated with what you were doing. <br>\r\nIt was quite possibly the equivalent of a recreational drug activating that dopamine high in your brain, only replaced with the natural taste of her bare feet. <br>\r\nSo much so that you found yourself going back to doing just that after you finished kissing her pinky toe. Your tongue soon became blackened with the sweat and dirt glistening from her soles as you continued licking between her toes with the slavish attention of a dog trying to please its master. <br>\r\nThe irony of that metaphor had hit you like an anvil from above, but you quickly jettisoned that from your mind as you found yourself hopelessly addicted to worshiping your archenemy\u2019s bare feet. <br>\r\nJust as you were about to fully indulge yourself, she suddenly turned away from you. And just like an addicted user being denied his high, you let out an almost childish whimper as she stood with her back facing you. <br>\r\nShe was still breathing heavily as your head remained bowed, both in shame for the shell of the man you\u2019ve become to become whole again and more surprisingly in anticipation for what she has to say about this. <br>\r\n\u201cYou know what I think, Batman?\u201d she finally said, one hand on her hips as she continued to face away from you.<br>\r\nThis was the point where you would retort back in a last-ditch attempt to regain control of the situation, but unfortunately your actions had spoken louder than whatever words you could summon at the moment. <br>\r\n\u201cI think you\u2019re enjoying this. I think you like worshiping my <i>sexy </i>feet. I think you crave my taste, my scent, my everything. Am I correct in this assumption?\u201d she smiled.<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t bring yourself to deny or argue against what was being said. Tilting her head back towards you with an absolutely sinister grin plastered across her face, you could only look back down.<br>\r\nTo her, your silence was the only answer she needed. <br>\r\n\u201cLike I told you once before lover, no man can resist Poison Ivy. Not even a Batman,\u201d she smiled softly, her hand slowly creeping towards her groin area. <br>\r\nMost humiliating of all, instead of seeing her sneering face you were instead met with her bare ass, curving into her slender back. <br>\r\n\u201cTell me how much you want my feet, Batman!\u201d she cooed in a singsong voice, as she lifted the other foot up to showcase her narrow and well-shaped arch.<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2026\u201d You were at a loss for words. Now is usually the time for a clever rebuttal, a snarky comeback, anything to tell off the former botanist. But you couldn\u2019t muster the strength to defy her again. Couldn\u2019t, or more appropriately wouldn\u2019t.<br>\r\nThe words were almost out of your mouth before you even knew what was happening. <br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve the most beautiful feet I\u2019ve ever laid eyes on. I-I want your feet more than anything. More than anything. More than...Gotham\u2019s well-being. More than\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nThankfully she held up a hand to silence your frantic ramblings.<br>\r\n\u201cGood boy,\u201d came her approving purr, one last condescending insult to emphatically rub in the inevitable: that Poison Ivy had broken the Batman. <br>\r\n\u201cDo you see now how foolish you were, trying to attack your master? Gotham may be your city, but you are in my world now Batman. And look at you now. On your knees like the dog you are, rightfully worshiping the feet of your mistress. Harley may have feared you lover, but you\u2019re just another meatsack who thought himself worthy of Mother Nature. And since we now both know how wrong you were,\u201d came her scathing sneer, her words evoking a paradoxical blend of pure hatred and arousal that only fueled your sudden longing for the plant queen.<br>\r\nShe then presented her other dirtied sole to you, her wrinkled flesh blackened with dirt for your awaiting tongue.<br>\r\nPoison Ivy then uttered the command that would forever seal your fate:<br>\r\n<i>\u201cLick.\u201d</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the image of the maniacal Joker vanished off of the T.V monitor, you couldn\u2019t help but heave an almost sympathetic sigh for the now scorned Harley Quinn, who must be fuming behind the doors now that her \u201cMr. J\u201d had finally deserted her, leaving her to the wolves. You could only imagine the pent up aggression brewing within her, that same aggression now being channeled into an ill-fated vendetta against you.<br>\r\nThe doors flew open, releasing the now feral Quinn, who sprinted towards you at a breakneck pace. <br>\r\n\u201cDie you big ugly bat!\u201d she sneered while running at you. <br>\r\nIt was almost superhuman how she was able to contort her body into a running cartwheel, before performing a backflip. The metal in her sexualized nurse uniform jingled almost rhythmically against her steps as she came at you. <br>\r\nYou almost irritably rolled his eyes as the elusive yet seductive Harley Quinn continued to run at you.<br>\r\nPreparing to use Quinn\u2019s momentum against her, you continued to stand, waiting for Harley to make the first (and last) move in your confrontation. Assuming the position to combat her offense, you prepared to block her kick.<br>\r\nJust when things couldn\u2019t be more perfect, a wrench was thrown into your plan in the form of a lone inmate.<br>\r\nAs she neared you, one of the inmates who miraculously managed to recover from the beatdown grabbed your leg, preventing you from moving forward. His face was a squashed tomato, but somehow, he remained loyal to her, sacrificing himself. Crouching next to him, you grabbed his throat with one hand, cocking the other behind your head. <br>\r\nSnarling, you snuffed out his brief resistance with a well-aimed punch to the head.<br>\r\nStill, the inmate\u2019s sacrifice was not all for naught. Turning back towards Harley, you realized that it was you underestimated her distance from you, and as a result, paid the price for underestimating the feisty fatale. With a cry, she maneuvered her body into a flying weapon, her legs aimed straight at you. <br>\r\nHer heeled boot cracked off the side of your head, her entire body weight behind the flying heel kick. The momentum behind the kick also caused you to stagger backwards, her boot digging into your cheek. <br>\r\nWincing, you nearly crumpled to the floor, but managed to ground yourself on both feet. Rubbing the bruise on your cheek, you cursed yourself, severely underestimating Quinn\u2019s ability as a fighter.<br>\r\nQuinn landed on her feet, a victorious smirk on her face as she realized that the kick connected. <br>\r\n\u201cDid that hurt, Bat-Brain? I hope so, Mistah J\u2019s gonna hurt you a lot worse when he\u2019s done with you,\u201d she smirked, lunging at you again. <br>\r\nThis time however, you were wise to her antics, and as soon as she tried the flying heel kick, you sidestepped it, using her own momentum against her. You grabbed her ankle in mid-air, changing her trajectory by throwing her overhead. <br>\r\nHarley\u2019s head bounced off the metal rails as she crashed into the railing, her body crumpling like a paper bag. She whimpered in pain, rubbing her head.<br>\r\n\u201cNot as much as I\u2019m gonna hurt you if you don\u2019t tell me where Joker is,\u201d you snarled, a fiery resolution in your eyes, as you wiped a drop of blood from his lips. <br>\r\n\u201cHey, what was that for?\u201d she demanded angrily, rubbing the side of her head still aching. <br>\r\nYour hands clenched, you stalked towards the downed Harley.<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d you demanded once more, your voice growing increasingly infuriated.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you think I know, Bat-freak?\u201d she growled, silently reaching behind her back. <br>\r\nMentally rolling your eyes at her predictability, you nevertheless gave her the benefit of the doubt as you neared her.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to tell me, or you don\u2019t walk for the next 6 months!\u201d he threatened, grabbing her arm.<br>\r\n\u201cHow about I just slice you up instead?\u201d she snarled, lunging at you with the knife. <br>\r\nWith ease, you used her momentum as leverage, grabbing her wrist and twisting it backwards as soon as the blade slashed through the air. Before Harley could even react, you easily twisted her arm behind her back, your hand still grasping her wrist with an ironclad grip. She desperately swung at you with her other arm, but that proved to be futile, as you grabbed her other arm, unapologetically snapping it behind her back. <br>\r\nNow in full control, you continued to twist Harley\u2019s arms behind her back as leverage, pain contorting through her face. She struggled tenaciously, but your sheer muscle power overpowered her flexibility. <br>\r\nHarley shrieked in pain, but you paid her no mind, your only priority being to locate the Joker. <br>\r\n\u201cDrop it!\u201d you growled in her ear, referring to the knife she was still holding.<br>\r\nReluctantly, Harley dropped the knife, the blade clanging against the cold floor. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna ask one more time Quinn. Where is Joker?\u201d you growled, jerking her elbow forward for emphasis.<br>\r\n\u201cHow should I know?\u201d she retorted.<br>\r\n\u201cLet me think. You\u2019re Joker\u2019s own personal cheerleader, you practically worship the ground he walks on. Anytime he needs an asset to help solve his problems, or a punching bag for him to exhaust his anger, you\u2019re his go-to gal, aren't you?\u201d you snarled.<br>\r\n\u201cShut up,\u201d she whispered back, stifling back a sniffle as some of your words started to hit home.<br>\r\nStill, you knew the cerebral game better than anyone, and this sort of mental dissection was the only way to get to Joker. <br>\r\n\u201cLets face reality Harley, because from what I can see, you\u2019re way out of it. Joker doesn't give a crap whether anyone, not even you. You think he cares about you, you\u2019re more delusional and gullible than I thought. He only cares about himself and his own personal agenda, and you, you\u2019re just a stepping stone to those goals. Face facts Harleen, you\u2019re just a tool,\u201d you continued.<br>\r\n\u201cShut up,\u201d she repeated, her voice becoming hardened.<br>\r\n\u201cJoker doesn't care about you. If he did, then why do I see the bruises running down your back, the scars on your chest? You\u2019re nothing more than an expendable pawn Harleen, and I\u2019d hate to be the one to break it to you, but Joker doesn't give a crap of whether you live or die in here,\u201d you finished, continuing your mental dissection of her. <br>\r\n\u201cSHUT UP!\u201d she suddenly yelled, taking you by surprise. <br>\r\nBefore you could react, she rammed her head backwards, catching you in the nose with a headbutt. You could feel the blood running down your nose, decorating your already battle-scarred face. You staggered backwards, but kept your grip on her.<br>\r\nTaking advantage, Harley ran her feet up the rails, using that you lift her body over yours. Kicking off the rails, she jumped into the air, freeing her arms in the process. Her flexibility soon became her ace in the hole, as she landed on the ground behind you.<br>\r\nNow with the upper hand, Harley shoulder tackled you, focusing all of her body weight into ramming your sides into the metal rails. <br>\r\nYou grunted as your head bounced off the metal, your face dangerously close to the barbed wire. In a twist of irony, Harley twisted your arm behind your back, keeping you glued to the wall. With the other hand, Harley smeared your cheek against the metal, trying to force it into the barbed wire surrounding it. <br>\r\n\u201cYou think you know me, huh B-Man? You think your little \u2018mind games\u2019 will work on me? Mistah J loves me, he just gets a bit cranky when things don\u2019t turn out the way they\u2019re supposed to. But that\u2019s alright, I can make it all better again, once you\u2019re dead,\u201d she snarled angrily.<br>\r\nRecovering from her surprise attack, you took advantage of her amateur hold, you reared your other arm back, smashing her face with a hard elbow.<br>\r\nAs soon as she relinquished her hold, you sprang into action, turning at her and connecting with a harsh backfist to the cheek.<br>\r\nHarley nearly crumpled to the ground, her hands and knees the only things still holding her up. She sorely rubbed the bruise on her cheek where your fist had hit her. <br>\r\nBefore you could finish her, she suddenly buried her face in her hands, crying out loud. Her cries failed to phase you, as you continued to cock your fist back. Still, you had already disarmed her of her only visible weapon, and you could just as easily suppress another surprise attack. <br>\r\n\u201cYou hit just like Mistah J. He never held back either,\u201d she whimpered, her face still buried in her palms. Her stifled cries started to awaken a streak of sympathy, perhaps pity within you. You knew of the abusive relationship sustained between the two, it remained an enigma to you. Most of the time, you would arrive to foil their schemes only to find Harley just as beat up as the other henchmen. And yet, something kept Harley going back to him, almost like she needed the psychopath. It befuddled you how this could be, and yet, it seemed to be clear to Harley.<br>\r\nFinally, you decided to take a more diplomatic approach, approaching her in a friendly yet cautious way. With one arm, you started to wrap it around her shoulder, comforting her as she cried. <br>\r\n\u201cThen again, he never hesitated!\u201d she suddenly yelled, lunging at you.<br>\r\nCursing yourself for being so naive, you found yourself the victim of a sharp roundhouse kick to the face, her red boot just burying itself into your mouth. The kick almost downed you, but you only caught the very tip of her boot. <br>\r\nThe blow sent you reeling backward, allowing for Harley to kip up, a clever grin on her face. Staggering backwards, you wiped the line of blood from your mouth, cursing yourself for letting your guard down. <br>\r\nDropping to one knee, you spat out a glob of blood as she sauntered towards you, her hips swaying. <br>\r\n\u201cWould you look at that, Bats? Your thick skull nearly broke my shoe,\u201d she sneered, running her hand down her thigh, all the way down to her knee high red boot, which seemed to be even looser. Bending down, she ran her fingers down the metal straps, some of which seemed to be unzipped. <br>\r\n\u201cLets make this interesting B-Man,\" she grinned mischievously, starting to unzip her boot. <br>\r\n\"You really want to do this the hard way Quinn?\" you sighed, cracking your knuckles.<br>\r\nHarley laughed before uttering her next statement. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lunging at her with a Superman punch to the jaw, a seemingly routine way to end conflicts, Harley countered accordingly, using her agility to duck the fist as it sliced through the air. Using the momentum, she continued to stretch herself forward, until she could touch her toes. <br>\r\nBringing her left leg forward, she then nailed you with a scorpion kick, a move only achieved by the most flexible of martial artists, by shooting her left foot over her back and directly into your face. In doing so, she literally performed a handstand so she could keep balance.<br>\r\nYou tasted blood while staggering backwards, the kick catching you off guard. Literally tasting her boot in your mouth, you finally managed to create distance between her, as you tried to rethink your plan.<br>\r\nAn irritable growl carved into your face as Harley stood up and mockingly bowed, a clever grin painted on her face. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m curious, whatcha\u2019 think B-Man? 6? 7? I think extra points should go to you, it really looked like it hurt!\u201d she sneered, as you wiped a drop of blood from your mouth. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m warning you Quinn, I don\u2019t have time for your little \u2018games.\u2019 I want to know where Joker is. If you\u2019re not willing to talk, you should know that I know other ways to get it out of you,\u201d you growled, already irritated about wasting so much time dealing with her. <br>\r\n\u201cThe only way to get to Mistah J B-Man, is through me. And you\u2019re not getting past me!\u201d she snarled back, her hands on her hips. <br>\r\nYou almost smirked at her cockiness, but you couldn\u2019t afford a witty retort. Joker was out and about, and unfortunately, the only information about his current whereabouts was through Harley. You of all people should not mistake her flirty nature for weakness, but time was running short, and you couldn\u2019t afford to pull punches.<br>\r\nDeciding to end this quick and mercifully (for her), you mockingly beckoned her with your fingers, smirking slightly as an indignant expression formed on her face. <br>\r\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m a joke, don\u2019t you? Well, lets see who's laughing after I\u2019m done pounding your skull in!\u201d she yelled. <br>\r\nWith a cry, she took the offensive, breaking into a cartwheel to gain momentum. Landing on her feet, she continued to run at you at a frenzied pace, giving you enough time to accept a battle stance. <br>\r\nUpon arrival, Harley lashed out at you with a quick flurry of punches and kicks, starting with a spinning heel kick that would\u2019ve knocked out Muhammad Ali in his prime. You just barely managed to block it with a quick forearm to the ankle, but that was only the beginning.<br>\r\nShe continued throwing kicks at you, her feet practically dancing as they fired at you on all cylinders. Thanks to your superior technique, you were able to parry every single one with a well-timed open hand slap, but she prevented you from countering by throwing fisticuffs at you. <br>\r\nBlocking one of her low kicks with one hand, you were unable to prevent Harley from landing a quick lab to the mouth with her right fist, her knuckles nearly breaking a tooth. Gritting your teeth angrily, you proceeded to violently back-slap her as soon as you ducked her roundhouse to the face, her nose practically running into your fist.<br>\r\nStumbling backwards, the blow nearly took Harley out, but she managed to ground herself on one knee before completely collapsing. <br>\r\n\u201cThat was good,\u201d she remarked, her eyes still glimmering insanely in the heat of battle.<br>\r\nNow with renewed ferocity, she lunged at you again, this time assaulting you with relentless kicks to the side and knees. Her uncanny speed and quickness catching you off guard, you were barely able to block her attacks, this time Harley had managed to get the advantage. <br>\r\nShe feigned a hard round kick to the sides, to which you instinctively blocked with one hand, only for your palm to hit open air as she pulled out at the last possible second. Not realizing your mistake until a second later, you winced as she instead twisted her leg in mid-air, her heel instead connecting against the side of your head.<br>\r\nStaggering back a step, a wave of dizziness had clouded your vision for a second as the kick bounced off your temple, allowing Harley to follow up with a devastating spinning heel kick to the face. <br>\r\nYour head rolled sideways as her foot once again cracked against it, your eyes squinting to see Harley rise to her feet, a proud look on her face. <br>\r\n\u201cThat was better,\u201d she mocked, once again taunting you by making the beckoning motion with her fingers. <br>\r\nJust seeing Quinn outsmart you like that enraged you, causing you to impulsively race at her with clenched fists. <br>\r\nYou swung at her wildly, only for the flexible fatale to fall back on her palms while in a stretched position, once again emphasizing her flexibility. Cursing yourself for abandoning technique, you managed to pull the fist back before your momentum could betray you.<br>\r\nNow on the ground, Harley winked at you before bringing her knees up and smashing both feet into your stomach, knocking the wind out of you. Nearly doubling over, you found yourself straining for breath for a moment as her feet rammed into your torso.<br>\r\nJumping to her feet, Harley noticed you doubling over, and tilted her head curiously. A second later, she ran at you, but instead of attacking, using your back as a backboard to flip over. Her back touched yours, as she rolled off your spine, now behind you.<br>\r\nBefore you could respond with a back elbow, she connected first with a spinning heel kick to both knees, causing them to buckle. Landing on your back, your vision became blurry as your head bounced off the concrete. The ceiling light dominated your vision, but you could barely make out a sneering Harley next to you, lifting her boot as if preparing for the coup de grace.<br>\r\n\u201cLucky for you B-Man, I can\u2019t rough you up too much for Mistah J\u2019s surprise party. But I intend on leaving you a souvenir to remind me by!\u201d she laughed insanely, stomping down on your face with her purple boot.<br>\r\nInstinctively, you rolled to your side as her boot slammed into the pavement, letting you catch your breath. <br>\r\n\u201cHey no fair! You weren't supposed to-\u201d Quinn complained, only for you to kick out her legs from under her mid-sentence. With an \u201cUuummphhh\u201d, Quinn fell on her side right next to you, moaning as her head bounced off the pavement.<br>\r\nBefore she could recover, you jumped on her, quickly assuming the dominant position on top and pinning her wrists. <br>\r\n\u201cHey get off me, you creep!\u201d she screamed, trying to maneuver her body from under you. She twisted her head back and forth as you cocked one fist overhead, ready to punch her. <br>\r\nShe struggled incessantly, but your sheer weight had outweighed her struggles. She continued to struggle, trying weakly to wedge her knees in between her and you in order to kick you away. <br>\r\nBut before you could finish her, you noticed something out of your peripheral vision. During her struggling, something had briefly popped out of her cleavage. Squinting your eyes, you managed to stop the tip of a sheet of paper,<br>\r\n\u201cHey, hands off the merchandise!\u201d Harley protested, but you paid her no mind. <br>\r\nYou quickly grabbed the shriveled up sheet of paper and with one hand, held it up to your eyes. Unrolling it, you saw a whole list of names. <br>\r\n\u201cThis must be Joker\u2019s party list!\u201d you figured out silently, as your eyes darted off the list, noticing the names that had been \u201ccrossed out.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYou weren't supposed to read that B-Man!\u201d she argued, only for you to unapologetically clamp her mouth shut with one hand. <br>\r\nWith one hand off of her wrists, Harley started to reach into her pocket, her fingers wrapping around something small. Oblivious to you, she slowly revealed another gadget of her quite expansive inventory, a can of pepper spray. <br>\r\n\u201cWhy the smiles nex-?\u201d you started to demand, only for Harley to reply by spraying you in the face with pepper spray. <br>\r\nYelling out loud, you quickly shield your face with both arms to prevent another face full. Now with her legs free, Harley easily kicked you off of her, but you hardly protested it. <br>\r\nThankfully, your cowl prevented the spray from entering your eyes, but it had still managed to cloud your visor vision, giving Quinn time to scurry away from you on her elbows and knees. <br>\r\nWiping the liquid from your mouth, you finally switched back to normal after noticing how she was getting out of your reach. Before she could make it back to her feet, you grabbed her ankle, keeping her anchored to you. She protested sharply, turning on her back and only mildly annoying you with kicks from her free foot. <br>\r\n\u201cYou just can\u2019t get enough of me, can you B-Man?\u201d she yelled in between kicks. <br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Joker?\u201d you demanded, only to receive a boot to the face as a response.<br>\r\nNow agitated by her naive loyalty to the Joker, you started to reel her back in like a fish, only for her to increase her struggles tenfold. Now lashing out with several shots to the head, you could only hold on for so long, and your grip on her leg was decreasing. <br>\r\n\u201cMistah J doesn't want you ruining the surprise, so he hired me to keep you occupied, idiot! In case you\u2019re still dense-headed, here\u2019s a reminder!\u201d she laughed, bringing her knee back all the way back to her chest before launching it directly at you.<br>\r\nAs her boot connected with your nose, you were forced to relinquish the hold, reeling backwards in order to tend to the now broken nose caused by the jester. As you howled in pain, she managed to crawl away. <br>\r\nRolling on your back, you ran your fingers under your mask, only to find them bloodstained seconds later. Cursing wildly, you tried to wipe the blood from your face. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna make you bleed for that, B-Man!\u201d she yelled to the left of you. <br>\r\nTurning towards Harley, you instead saw the toe of her boot embed itself within your ribs, causing you to collapse to the ground. You grunted as you felt yourself being turned over on your back by her foot.<br>\r\nGlaring almost helplessly at her, you snarled as she raised her red boot once again to stomp on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Feel free to review)</span></div></div>",

Hearing her faint moans, you sighed, knowing that you managed to buy yourself some time.<br>\r\nClutching your sides, you spat out a glob of blood as you rolled over on your stomach, trying to recover. <br>\r\nResting your head against the tiles for a second, you sorely rubbed your now broken nose, subsequently cursing yourself for underestimating Quinn, especially at such a high-risk situation like this. <br>\r\nReaching into your utility belt, you produced some gauze from one of your pockets, a successful method of suppressing the bleeding, at least for now. Quickly stuffing it inside your cowl, you made sure to spread it over your nose so it can soak up any blood. <br>\r\nYour face paler than usual thanks to Harley\u2019s barrage of kicks, you spat out another glob of blood before clambering to your feet, leaning on the metal rails for support. After sighing in utter exasperation after being stalled so long, you turned to Quinn, who was also leaning on the rails for support.<br>\r\nLuckily for you, it seemed like Harley was just as fatigued as you, as indicated by her body language. <br>\r\nShe was barely able to stand on two feet, and it seemed like her acrobatic moveset had finally taken its toll on the vixen. You could hear her panting while leaning against the railing, her body constantly deflating as she inhaled and exhaled. She also grabbed the back of her head, which seemed to be the exact spot where her head first bounced off the pavement. You could spot a bulging bruise starting to form on her neck, ever the more reason to capitalize on this sudden streak of luck.<br>\r\nPushing yourself off the metal rails, you started to make your way over to Harley, who was still using the railing as a crutch to stay on her feet. Your cape dragged as you stealthily crept over to her, your fists clenching anxiously as you prepared to neutralize her once and for all. She was already too busy panting heavily to even notice you, an opportunity that would not present itself again.<br>\r\nShe nearly collapsed as soon just as you started to lunge at her, her knees buckling violently. Still hanging on to the railing, she tried unsuccessfully to pull herself up, only for her legs to start trembling again, probably from the dizziness now circulating through her head.<br>\r\nYou briefly caught a glimpse of her face as she tried to stand her. Instead of the usual smug expression or childish sneer, you instead saw a grim snarl, emphasized by the utter look of defeat on her face. Her eyes now glared at you almost sadly, as she evidently realized the reality of her situation, that she failed her pudding. <br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead Batman, finish me off! It\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do to Mistah J, isn't it? Hit me again, I double dare you. It won\u2019t be the first time, I can guarantee you that!\u201d she snarled defiantly, managing to raise one fist.<br>\r\n\u201cHarley, you\u2019re hurting yourself here. Tell me where Joker is, and I can promise you that I won\u2019t hurt him, as long as he doesn't hurt me,\u201d you deliberately lied, trying to appease the already unpredictable and irate Quinn.  <br>\r\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m that gullible B-Man?\u201d she demanded.<br>\r\n\u201cI think you\u2019re tired Harley, tired of all the pain and abuse Joker\u2019s put you through. I know I am. I can make that stop, but you need to help me. I can bring him in, unscathed, not a bruise on his body, if you cooperate. Help me, and I can promise you that once this is all cleaned up, I can help you,\u201d you implored, trying to appeal to Quinn\u2019s better judgement. Unfortunately for you, you still doubted she even had one.<br>\r\n\u201cY-you won\u2019t hurt my pudding?\u201d she stammered, shocked by your compromise. <br>\r\n\u201cYou have my word,\u201d you replied solemnly. analyzed the idea in her head, the thought at least piquing her attention. <br>\r\n\u201cReally, well\u2026.?\u201d she gaped, trying to comprehend every word that you just said, as well as the words that she would say.<br>\r\n\u201cJust like reeling in a fish,\u201d you smirked silently, as she twirled her ponytails. Finally, a look of resolution appeared on yo<br>\r\nWell, when you put it like that\u2026...\u201d she started to say, before suddenly kicking you in the gut.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry B-Man, but I only answer to one man, and that\u2019s Mistah J!\u201d she yelled. <br>\r\nLurching backwards, you once again cursed yourself for uncharacteristically letting your guard once again. She had played possum, and like a novice, you had fell right into her trap. Your hands clutching your stomach, you found yourself unprepared to prevent her next onslaught of acrobatic offense.<br>\r\nSnarling wildly, you blindly swung at her as she ran at you to finish her combo, her body easily evading the blow by ducking underneath your armpit. Before you could retract the fist, she suddenly shot up with a savage uppercut to the chin, her fist carving itself into your jaw.<br>\r\nStaggering backwards, you managed to wiped a drop of blood from your mouth as she swung at you again with a hard-hitting haymaker. This time, your veteran experience kicked in, and you managed to intercept the blow in mid-air with an expertly timed karate chop. <br>\r\nBefore she could try again, you lashed forward on your other hand with another karate chop, this time your palm hit her elbow with considerable force. She instantly shrieked in pain, retreating backwards as her right arm instantly went limp. <br>\r\n\u201cOw! What did you do to me, Bat-freak?\u201d she growled, clutching her now limp arm as it dangled helplessly in the air. <br>\r\n\u201cI just hit one of your many pressure points Quinn. This one is a personal favorite of mine. It can remove all feeling from the victim\u2019s arm for hours on end. In your case however, you won\u2019t be able to feel the rest of your body in the next five minutes,\u201d you explained smugly, relishing in her moment of vulnerability as she glared at you resentfully.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna pay for that B-Man!\u201d she promised, lunging at you yet again despite her unmoving arm.<br>\r\nShe almost desperately swung at you with her other arm, only for you to easily slap it away with another karate chop. Yelling at you irritably, she attempted a roundhouse to the face, only for you to expertly duck just as her foot swung through the air.<br>\r\nAs she landed, you waited until the right moment before finally countering with a decisive fist to the face as soon as her momentum finished twirling her around. As your knuckles smashed into her face, you cringed as you felt her skin crumble behind it, her nose feeling gooey as it touched your glove. <br>\r\nWith a cry, she fell face first on the pavement, her body nearly growing limp in the process. Her hair was now in ruins, her blonde hair sprawled around the floor. She still remained stirring, which only further infuriated you. <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s over Quinn!\u201d you snarled irritably, as she rolled herself over on her back. <br>\r\n\u201cNot until\u2026.the fat lady sings!\u201d she retorted once again, bringing her legs up and kicking you directly in the groin. <br>\r\nThanks to your protective cup, the impact was mercilessly lessened, but only by so much. As both soles of her foot smashed against your groin, you still felt a surge of pain emitting there, and your hands instantly dropped down to it. The surprise move had still stunned you,  enough to bring you down to your knees. <br>\r\nNow at her level, Quinn took advantage by tattooing your face with another vicious kick before turning over on her belly and crawling away. You reeled back, and managed to fall back on your elbows, you fingers grabbing the gauze to make sure she didn't further injure your nose. Thankfully, the gauze held strong. You still noticed her attempting to flee from you, and a blind rage began brewing inside of you. <br>\r\nIncensed at her resiliency as well as stubbornness, you grabbed onto her ankle, refusing to let her go. Your fingers tightened around her boot, as your sheer weight held her in place. <br>\r\nTurning towards you, Harley howled in frustration as she attempted to kick you off. <br>\r\n\u201cWhy won\u2019t you just leave me alone Batman?\u201d she cried, as you continued holding on to her leg.<br>\r\n\u201cBecause you won\u2019t let me,\u201d you answered, now grabbing her leg with both hands. <br>\r\nHarley desperately clung on to the metal railing, her fingertips barely able to touch, as you tried dragging her back towards her. <br>\r\nOblivious to you, your incessant pulling had loosened all the straps on her purple boot, the shoe slowly sliding off as you continued holding on to her. <br>\r\nHarley turned over on her sides and continued kicking you with her free foot, only for you to lean back out of her ranger, much to her chagrin.<br>\r\n\u201cStay still B-Man!\u201d she cried, as you finally managed to pry her fingers off the railing. <br>\r\nJust as her fingers were forced off, she immediately tried to grab on to them again, only for you to easily pull her back.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re finished Harley,\u201d you snarled, raising your fist as a symbolic coup de grace.<br>\r\nHer eyes widened in fear, but just before you could deal the finishing blow, her purple boot suddenly popped off, along with her fishnet stockings attached to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Feel free to review, critique, or comment on. I always reply to any e-mails, and you're always welcome to add on to my stories. Sorry it takes a while to get these out, but I often have to watch episodes/play the actual video games to get an actual idea of these characters. Plus, I have to choreograph the fights as well. From the looks of it, I hope that I represented the Arkham version of Quinn well. If you have any suggestions, feel free to e-mail me.

The steps were hurried, rushed, almost like something, or something was giving chase to this mysterious figure. It was the middle of the night in Gotham City, with a raucous thunderstorm not yet relinquishing its grip over the crime-infested city. The skies were lit up with occasional streaks of lightning, which struck down on the Earth with a fiery intensity. <br>\r\nEventually stopping to lean next to a parked car, the figure quickly turned over the shoulder, obviously keeping an eye out for whoever, or whatever might be chasing after it. Another bolt of lightning illuminated the figure, revealing none other than Poison Ivy.<br>\r\n        Clad from head to toe in green, she almost nervously scanned the area for any signs of him. She leaned in on the rear view window of the vehicle to get a better look at herself. Her face was almost painted with a certain look that can only be achieved by meeting him, a look of fear. Her forehead was visibly dripping with sweat, and her mouth was curled almost in an uncharacteristic whimper. Her body inhaled beneath her green almost signature spandex costume. She wore a thick brown trench coat concealing her spandex outfit, probably to remain conspicuous. Ironically enough, this plan seemed to have backfired, given the company that was tailing her.<br>\r\nIvy almost nervously tried to smooth out her red hair, but just as her hand waved a few strands away from her face, a familiar blur suddenly popped out of the corner of her eye. Thanks to the car\u2019s reflection, she was able to make out its iconic two bat-shaped ears.<br>\r\n        Instinctively, she twirled around, rolling down her coat sleeve. Attached to her right wrist was her signature repeating crossbow, the metallic ring glimmering in the darkness. She expertly aimed it towards the shadows, her thumb just itching to press down on the pressure pad, to activate it.<br>\r\n        \u201cThought you could catch a single woman like me off-guard, did you Batman?\u201d She demanded, her arm fixed firmly on the corner of the street that she just saw him.<br>\r\n        \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stop acting like a coward and face Mother Nature, meat-sack,\u201d she proclaimed, trying to make her words as threatening as possible to hide the nervousness inside of her.<br>\r\n        She kept the crossbow aimed at the shadows, but after a few moments of silence, no movement had been detected.<br>\r\n        \u201cFace me Batman!\u201d she demanded, almost out of desperation but the only response <br>\r\nshe got was the continued downpour of rain, the droplets pounding against the sidewalk. Her voice only echoed through the street, which had been devoid of human life for over 2 hours.<br>\r\n\tReluctantly, she took a deep breath and shrugged off that instinctive response inside of her, somewhat assured that he wasn't there, that he was probably off somewhere else in Gotham. She heaved a sigh almost out of relief, before backing away, each step careful and precise.<br>\r\nStill not completely assured, she kept her eyes fixed on the street, her crossbow still trained in front of her. Her eyes darted from left to right, up to down, even up to the rooftops. As another round of thunder crackled, she eventually lowered her crossbow, coming to the conclusion that she was simply imagining things, a hallucination if anything else. Her paranoia must be catching up to her.<br>\r\nCombing back her fiery red hair, she cracked a nervous smile before turning around to see: <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wiggled comfortably in her light green outfit, as she crossed her legs. <br>\r\nThe malevolent yet binary Two-Face smirked matter-of-factly at her as he continued to toss his signature two-piece coin into the air, now symbolic of his distorted sense of right and wrong. The condescending and slightly amused Penguin merely chuckled in his corner, while shuffling up a new set of playing cards, a cigarette loose in his mouth. The maniacal yet always comedic Joker giggled under his breath, his bleached white skin a surprising standout in the crowd of dastardly villains. The cannibalistic Killer Croc stared at her, his blank expression indicative of his simplistic yet feral behavior. <br>\r\n\u201cWith exploding pumpkins?\u201d came the Joker\u2019s mocking reply, his cynical tone laced with every word that he spoke. <br>\r\n\u201cI would've hit him with a rock,\u201d interjected Killer Croc. <br>\r\nHe glared around the table hopefully, only to receive a murderous glare from Two-Face, a playful smirk from Ivy, and a pondering look from Penguin. Joker merely laughed, as he always did. <br>\r\n\u201cYes, despite Croc\u2019s idiocy, your plan while intriguing in theory, was rather\u2026...<i>incomplete</i>. Your little pumpkins, while cute, simply lack a sense of theatricality. Exploding pumpkins, how cliched. And your execution, how horrendous. Overlooking such a textbook mistake like his Batmobile was your first downfall, but not even having a contingency plan in case you failed? Honestly, if you wanted a more original plan you should\u2019ve asked Croc to throw a rock at him,\u201d the opulent and quite extravagant Penguin scoffed, even chuckling at his own joke.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, or maybe you should\u2019ve poisoned him over a candlelit dinner. Worked with me,\u201d Dent mumbled angrily as well. <br>\r\n\u201cSorry to disappoint Harv, but at least my plan wasn't exactly one-sided,\u201d Ivy replied curtly. <br>\r\n\u201cCare to bet?\u201d Two-Face snarled, brandishing his infamous coin. <br>\r\nThe two former lovers exchanged glances, their eyes indicative of their downright murderous feelings towards each other. The former DA had been poisoned by Ivy, who had targeted him for his involvement in the construction of Stonegate Penitentiary, and the now turned criminal had kept a grudge, even despite his now split-personality. <br>\r\n\u201cNow now, let\u2019s not get out of hand here. Someone could lose an eye, and the last thing that anyone of us civilized people want is to start looking like Dent, am I right?\u201d Joker smiled, playfully shuffling his cards. <br>\r\nDent now turned his attention towards him, his blue, severely scarred flesh revealing itself in the light as he seethed at the Clowned Prince of Crime. <br>\r\n\u201cGet out of my face clown,\u201d he growled. <br>\r\n\u201cWhich one?\u201d shot back the Joker playfully. <br>\r\n\u201cThe one that\u2019s about to shut you up\u2026...<i>permanently</i>!\u201d came his firm response. <br>\r\n\u201cCome now Harv, I\u2019d hate to get your blood all over my new suit. After all, my dear Harley just got finished pressing it for me,\u201d the Joker laughed, causing Two-Face to draw a .45 pistol from his suit as well. <br>\r\n\u201cGentlemen gentlemen, must we fight? After all, it is your turn, Dent,\u201d the Penguin said bored, his sophisticated voice slurring over his own words. <br>\r\n\u201cYes, listen to Dr. Birdbrain Dent. After all, I\u2019m not the one who tried to poison you,\u201d the Joker pointed out, causing Dent to grab him by his collar all the way across the time. The Joker laughed weakly as Dent literally pulled him to his feet, pressing the muzzle of the gun against his bleached white forehead. <br>\r\n\u201cHey, I ever tell you guys about the time I fought Batman in the quarry?\u201d Killer Croc suddenly spoke out.<br>\r\n\u201cShut up Croc!\u201d the two yelled in unison.<br>\r\n\u201cGee, jump on the real freak in the room,\u201d Croc mumbled miserably, as he leaned back in the chair. <br>\r\n\u201cThanks for reminding me clown. And say, you've been real lucky to survive this long against the Bat, what with him and the GCPD turning Gotham upside down looking for you. But we all know that everyone\u2019s luck has to run out sooner or later. Let\u2019s see if you\u2019re as lucky as you are funny,\u201d he snarls, brandishing the coin while simultaneously closing his fingers around the Joker\u2019s throat. <br>\r\n\u201cSay Harv, didn't Mommy ever tell you that pointing at someone was downright rude? I\u2019m gonna have to take that coin away from you,\u201d the Joker chided weakly, Dent\u2019s fingers still wrapped around his throat. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna end you clown, but lets see how many times it takes the coin to agree with me,\u201d Two-Face smiled, holding the coin up for the Joker to see. <br>\r\nJust when it seemed that the situation couldn't be even more palpable, the seductive voice of the former botanist burst through the tension.<br>\r\n<i>\u201cNow now boys, no need to fight over little old me!\u201d</i><br>\r\nThe two instantly twirled around to see Ivy, who flashed them both seductive smiles. They looked on in bewilderment as she yawned, feigning boredom, before leaning back on her chair and resting her boots on the table. She playfully twirled around a strand of her fiery red hair as they continued to glare at her. <br>\r\n\u201cAnd besides, I never finished my story,\u201d she added, causing Dent to narrow his eyes irritably. <br>\r\n\u201cYou had your turn witch. Now before I off this clown, I\u2019m gonna tell of the time I nearly snuffed out the Bat,\u201d he declared triumphantly. <br>\r\n\u201cOr the time your breath nearly caused global warming in the West Indies,\u201d the Joker added, still chuckling despite his predicament. Two-Face cocked his pistol, his index finger closing around the trigger.<br>\r\n\u201cHeads I put a bullet in your thick skull right here and now. Tails I tie you up to a railroad track, and watch your insides get splattered all across the tracks. Either way, I win!\u201d he snarled. <br>\r\n\u201cSuit yourselves. You\u2019re only missing out on what\u2019s shaping up to be a grand affair. Still, I guess killing yourselves is better than knowing what ever became of our dear Dark Knight,\u201d Ivy smiled cryptically, causing them to both freeze in their tracks.<br>\r\nPenguin immediately stopped dealing cards, a renewed interest in his eyes. Croc was dumbfounded, his reptilian eyes widened in shock. <br>\r\n\u201cI thought I killed him with the rock,\u201d Croc mouthed out loud. <br>\r\nTwo-Face reluctantly let go of Joker\u2019s suit and turned back to the vixen.<br>\r\n\u201cYou got five minutes witch. I don\u2019t like what you\u2019re spewing, and you get a bullet in the head too,\u201d he said, before returning to his seat. <br>\r\n\u201cYes, for once I agree with the walking slot machine. I haven\u2019t had that cold chill of a certain someone stalking me since I put a bomb in the mayor\u2019s evening pie. More on that later,\u201d the Joker smiled, straightening his tie. <br>\r\n\u201cI agree with the clown. My operations have been running smooth lately, something quite peculiar given the nocturnal nature of the Batman. Consider me piqued as well,\u201d the Penguin agreed.<br>\r\n\"So what happened to the Bat?\" Dent demanded.<br>\r\n\"Funny you should ask dear. Why don't you ask Batman himself?\" she added, a knowing smile in her face as she reached for her boot. Penguin narrowed his eyes as her gloved fingers grabbed the shoe. But instead of reaching inside of it, Ivy merely tugged at the leather before dramatically sliding the boot off, revealing her bared foot. <br>\r\nThe quartet of villainy were almost captivated by the siren as she unveiled her left foot, a bared beauty if any other. Her foot, petite just like her, was pale white, not a single blemish on it. Her toes were surprisingly adorned in pitch black nail polish, and she wiggled them sexily as they continued to stare at her. Dent was unimpressed, while Killer Croc sat with his mouth wide open, revealing his razor sharp teeth. Joker continued laughing, and Penguin smirked as he twirled his cigar in his mouth.<br>\r\nIvy held the boot in one hand, the other hand curled around the wooden chair. <br>\r\n\"Excuse the gesture boys, but my piggies haven't breathed in days now,\" she smiled playfully, continuing to flex her toes. <br>\r\n\"Uhhhhhh...nice nail polish Ivy,\" Croc complemented slowly, his eyes focusing on her toes. <br>\r\n\"Awww, well aren't you a doll Croc. I figured you boys might enjoy it, given that its a nice little transition into business of my own,\" she added, before brandishing the shoe. <br>\r\nDramatically, she reached into the boot, and pulled out something that would take them all by surprise, if not utter disbelief: the mask of the Batman.<br>\r\nThe cowl of the Dark Knight, once the symbol of fear amongst all criminals in Gotham City, was now an ordinary piece of fabric in the hand of Poison Ivy, her fingers stretching through the eyelids. Two-Face snarled in disbelief, and the Joker gaped out loud, his usual playful attitude gone. The Penguin nearly spat out his cigarette, and drool now slid down Croc's mouth.<br>\r\n\"<i>That's....not...funny</i>,\" came the Joker's blank reply, drained of his usual flair. <br>\r\n\"Intriguing. It appears that our toxic temptress has finally gotten the upper hand on the Dark Knight. How utterly, utterly surprising,\" the Penguin mused after a brief silence.<br>\r\n\"Isn't that what Batman used to wear?\" Croc asked.<br>\r\nIt was only Two-Face who snapped out of the initial shock and slammed his fist into the table.<br>\r\n\"Hold it witch. What kind of sick joke is this?\" he roared, much to Ivy's utter delight.<br>\r\n\"Hark who's talking,\" Joker replied, in a obligatory sort of way.<br>\r\n\"I assure you Harv, that this is no mere illusion. I am living proof of this,\" she pointed out, to which he jumped out of his chair, a murderous glare in his eyes.<br>\r\n\"Not for long you ain't!\" he roared, aiming his pistol at her.<br>\r\n\"Please Harvey! Do you really want to kill the same person who did what none of you could do, and defeated the Batman? I think the coin agrees with me,\" she pointed out smartly, causing Two-Face to reluctantly take his seat.<br>\r\n\"I believe explanations are in order, Mrs. Isley,\" the Penguin prompted.<br>\r\n\"Yes of course. Now, as I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted,\" she smiled, relishing the villain's shocked expressions for a moment before continuing her story. </span></div></div>",

Do whatever version you want, I like all forms of Catwoman <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bigsmile.png\" alt=\"*Bigsmile*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Bigsmile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

I'm only stealing from the people who stole from me, so I'm not stealing.</span> Where did you get the stuff in the first place? <span class=\"cgrape\">I stole it.</span> You give her that look. <span class=\"cgrape\">What can I say. I'm a cat burglar.</span> She smiles at you. Whatever. So who stole from you? <span class=\"cgrape\">Well I already kicked Two-Face's ass and took my stuff back. But with him being obsessed with the number two and all, he only had half. His goons have the rest. That's why I need your help.</span> Why not just ask Batman? I thought you two had a thing? <span class=\"cgrape\">We do. But with his morals and all. I knew he wouldn't help me, so that's why I asked you.</span> Works for me. So do I get some kind of reward for all my trouble? <span class=\"cgrape\">I'll think about it.</span> She says as she runs her gloved hand down your chest and winks at you.<br>\r\nTwo hours later... After Catwoman takes down the last goon, she picks up her duffel bag and starts walking back to her apartment. Um, Catwoman? <span class=\"cgrape\">Follow me and you'll get your reward.</span> She again winks at you.<br>\r\n<u>11:45 PM, Catwoman's Apartment, Arkham City Residential District</u><br>\r\nCatwoman throws her duffel bag in a closet and sits on her couch. So? <span class=\"cgrape\">Oh. Right. Your reward. As a reward for helping me, you get to rub my pretty little paws.</span> Huh? <span class=\"cgrape\">My feet smart guy.</span> How is that a reward? <span class=\"cgrape\">Oh please. You think I didn't see you stare at my feet every time I kicked a guy in the face or wrapped my legs around a guys neck?</span> I uh... <span class=\"cgrape\">Admit it. You have a foot fetish dont you?</span> What if I do? <span class=\"cgrape\">Then it's only that much more fun for you. Plus these boots kill my feet!</span> Fine Catwoman, you win. <span class=\"cgrape\">Selina Kyle, you?</span> Nightwing... <span class=\"cgrape\">Cmon, I'm not even wearing a mask. You can trust me with your secret identity. Batman trusts me with his...</span> Fine... Dick Grayson. <span class=\"cgrape\">Weren't you in the circus when you were a kid?</span> Yeah, my family was the famous Flying Graysons, of course that was until my parents were killed by a mob boss... <span class=\"cgrape\">I feel bad for you now, little Nightwing's parents were taken from him unfairly, just like Bruce...</span> Catwoman takes off her boots and flexes her socked feet. The natural smell of a woman's sweaty feet is starting to get to you. Any minute now you'll be in a haze...  You take off your gloves and grab one of Selina's feet. You slowly start rubbing her foot and she starts... Purring? She really takes the cat thing too far... <span class=\"cgrape\">Mmmm... That's nice. You know you're really good at this. I can never get Bruce to do this, not even when we're in our civilian clothes.</span> Now that I think about it, you do look familiar. I remember you from when I was a little kid. <span class=\"cgrape\">Ding ding. Lightbulb moment. Why dont you take my socks off now? It'll be better for both of us that way.</span> She says as she winks at you. <i>She must get pretty lonely if she's really as sexual as she acts... </i> You peel off both of her socks and admire her shiny black nail polish. She wiggles her toes to get your attention. <span class=\"cgrape\">Hi, Catwoman here. I did ask for a massage not a staredown.</span> Sorry. You continue rubbing her feet, sneaking a whiff here and there. Until finally your hormones get to be too much and your start kissing her feet all over. <span class=\"cgrape\">Tee hee, you kind of remind me of Isis right now. She's always buzzing around my feet like that.</span> You stop kissing for a second. I remind you of your cat? <span class=\"cgrape\">Mhmm.</span> Wonderful.

Your speed, strength, and healing factor get a boost when the moon is full. Word around the superhero community says that Catwoman is planning to hit the jewelery stores tonight. And who better to take down a cat than a dog... than a wolf... When you transform, you can do it one of two ways. The more apelike bipedal form you use when you need a big strength boost, and the stealthier quadrapedal form that's alot quicker and looks kinda like a big wolf, you can pass for a Husky in this form, allowing for deep infiltration. That's why you're one of the best vigilantes in Gotham. You decide to go Husky tonight... wolf tonight... and try to get the drop on Catwoman. You causually walk into the jewlery store, the guards see you and think nothing of it. Now, you wait... Presumably hours pass and everything seems normal. That is, until guard #3 doesn't show up. The guards always turn that one corner every 15 minutes... A few minutes pass and the other two guards never round the corner either... She must be here... You casually peek your head around the corner and see none other than Catwoman, helping herself to the many types of jewelery. You sneak behind her and prepare to strike. But Catwoman turns around with cat-like reflexes and ties you up with her whip. You could go beast mode and break out this predicament. But then you lose the element of surprise. <span class=\"cgrape\">Mangy mutt. Who lets a dog into a jewelery store anyway? Who am I kidding, dogs dont talk.</span> Catwoman finishes up and drags you with her, presumably to her hideout. <span class=\"cgrape\">I'll teach you to sneak up on me, dumb dog.</span> A little while later you arrive with Catwoman at her apartment.<br>\r\n<u>Catwoman's Apartment</u><br>\r\nOn your way in her cat hisses at you, which you respond to by growling at it. <span class=\"cgrape\">Dont you threaten Isis you stupid dog!</span> Catwoman bops you on the nose, which actually really hurts... Catwoman puts out a bowl of milk for Isis and only glares at you. She is really not a dog person... <span class=\"cgrape\">Ok little doggie. Time for your obedience training... And dont you dare bite me, or this whip... is gonna be used as a whip.</span> Catwoman walks over to you and begins untying you, now is your chance, now is your time to strike.

Now come get your reward.</span> She says as she wiggles her toes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1: You give in to your urges<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #2: You resist them a bit longer, but Catwoman cracks the whip (Literally)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #3: Catwoman's cat Isis is actually an Animagus (Witch that can turn into an animal at will), double foot temptation!</span></div></div>",

This causes you to involuntarily start to peel Harley's sock off. She responds by using your lips to get her other sock off.

At least the pay is good, right? You took this job so you could pay your way through the GCU Forensic Science program, and also take care of your aunt. She is really the only family you have left, after your parents died in that failed robbery when you were just a boy. Without her, you would have been  bounced around Social Services for most of your childhood. You will always be grateful for everything she has done for you. The least you can do is help out with the bills. People always told you that great things come from adversity. Maybe for superheros. All you have to show for your tragic life story is a strong moral code and student loans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least the artifact you are guarding seems interesting. The Sandals of Athena were on loan from Themyscira as part of an outreach program to the Kingdom of Man. This is a really big stride forward in diplomatic relations with the notoriously isolationist Amazons. They were supposedly made for Athena to wear during her long nights planning stratagems for battles the next day. The were then gifted back to the Amazons and passed down from queen to queen, granting any who wore them the wisdom and power to conquer any enemy. Apparently even Wonder Woman has worn them! This is why they are here, as part of the Justice League Exhibit here at the Gotham Museum of History. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all of that is very cool, you were interested in them for another reason. You just so happened to have a pretty big foot fetish, and a major crush on the local super-heroine population. The idea that Wonder Woman wore those shoes turned you on like crazy! At least it gave you something interesting to fantasize about while sitting in a chair for hours on end. Unfortunately it also made you more than a little distracted, which was easily taken advantage of. You didn't notice but you were being watched, through rose-tinted goggles, from on high. Sitting in the rafters was none other than one of your favorite morally ambiguous super-persons, Catwoman! She had already scoped out the whole place and knew you were the key to getting one of the most valuable artifacts on the market right now.

It's because the second Poison Ivy is a plant clone created by the original so that she can live a happy and peaceful life while the clone acts as a decoy and continues to act as the original once did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>3:00 PM, The Old Gotham Greenhouse, Gotham City Botanical Gardens</u><br>\r\nYou throw the new herbicide birdarang that Batman just developed and hits Poison Ivy directly in the chest and embeds itself slighty in her skin. <span class=\"clgreen\">Uggh.</span> She bends over slightly in pain. All of the sudden a large rose bud grows out of the ground and out pops... Poison Ivy? Ok Ivy. How are you doing that? <span class=\"cgreen\">I swear. You cant do anything right you useless clone! You're getting beat by Robin! Batman's sidekick!</span> <span class=\"clgreen\">Herbicide... He has herbicide...</span> She says weakly. <span class=\"cgreen\">And you let that stop you?!</span> Now that you think about it, Poison Ivy has been looking a tad different lately, and now you know why. The original starts shooting darts at you from her wrist mounted dart launcher as the clone limps away behind some ferns. From behind you are ambushed by a tree-man and knocked out.<br>\r\n<u>6:00 PM, Ivy's Hideout, Gotham City Outskirts</u><br>\r\nYou are just starting to come to and hear Poison Ivy still scalding her clone, you pretend that you're still knocked out. <span class=\"cgreen\">I'm giving you one last chance to redeem yourself. You make Robin fall for you without the assistance of any pheremones and I might consider letting you keep your job... of living. Got it?</span> <span class=\"clgreen\">Yes Ms.Ivy.</span> Poison Ivy sticks her clone in the arm with some kind of needle, probably to nullify her pheremones. She then leaves the room, leaving you with the clone. Uggh, my head... <span class=\"clgreen\">Did you have a nice nap?</span> Poison Ivy says as she grabs your hand and puts it on her boob. Whoa Ivy. That's so... not like you... <span class=\"clgreen\">What are you talking about? I'm always like this.</span> She laughs nervously. Are you feeling ok? <span class=\"clgreen\">Kiss me...</span> She grabs your shirt and pulls you closer. Whoa. I kinda like living! <span class=\"clgreen\">Relax, I can give non-poisoned kisses too you know.</span> You ca- mmph! Mmm... Ivy's lips are amazingly soft and it just feels... right... She pulls away and looks at you. She looks distressed. <span class=\"clgreen\">It's not working! I'm dead... I'm so dead...</span> You are acting really weird. <span class=\"clgreen\">I'm just stressed. Supervillainy is hard work. And my plan to seduce you to get back at Batman isn't working.</span> From what you heard the original Ivy say, this Ivy is obviously lying. Even if she is evil, you cant let her be destroyed just because she failed. Hey Ivy. Since I'm not leaving here any time soon, do you want me to help you relax? <span class=\"clgreen\">Why not. I already failed...</span> You grab one of her legs and start pulling her black boot off. Poison Ivy's nose twitches a little. <i><span class=\"clgreen\">His pheremone levels just spiked. Maybe I'm going about this the wrong way.</span></i> Poison Ivy wiggles her toes a bit. Her nails are painted black, you were almost sure they were gonna be green, but maybe that's the original's thing. <span class=\"clgreen\">How about my other boot sweetie?</span> Uh. Sure? You grab her other leg and pull off her boot. With both of her feet bare, she casually puts them on your lap. You take that as a hint and begin to massage her feet. Her toes scrunch happily as you are rubbing her feet. <span class=\"clgreen\">Do you think I'm pretty?</span> Of course. Why? <span class=\"clgreen\">No reason.</span><br>\r\n<u>6:30 PM, Ivy's Hideout, Gotham City Outskirts</u><br>\r\nThe door opens and the original Poison Ivy walks in. <span class=\"cgreen\">Ok, times up... Oh...</span> Poison Ivy sits next to her clone and and puts her booted feet in your lap. <span class=\"cgreen\">You should've reported this to me as soon as you discovered it.</span> <span class=\"clgreen\">I'm sorry Ms.Ivy.</span> <span class=\"cgreen\">No need for formalities around our guest dear. Besides, we're practically twin sisters...</span> You grab the original Ivy's green boots and pull them off. Ivy traces around your lips with her stocking clad foot, and you immediately suck them into your mouth. She forces the other Ivy's feet out of your hands, and puts her foot in their place. The clone says nothing and only smiles. <span class=\"cgreen\">You know you want to Robin. Reach right up there and take off my stockings!</span> I uh... <span class=\"clgreen\">Oh my Ivy. I think he's a virgin.</span> <span class=\"cgreen\">I believe that you're right Ivy.</span> You blush wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1: <span class=\"cgreen\">Let's fix that!</span> <span class=\"clgreen\">Agreed!</span> (You are the first Robin, now an adult who eventually becomes Nightwing. Deflowered by Poison Ivy?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #2: <span class=\"cgreen\">Just this once, I'll do it for you.</span> (Foot worship of Ivy and her clone)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #3: Batgirl swoops in! And is captured and hypnotized by the Ivys</span></div></div>",

What are you doing here? <span class=\"clteal\">You have no right to call me that anymore! It's Freon now.</span> Freon freezes your legs to the ground and pushes the desk out of the way. You try to break free. <span class=\"clteal\">Dont bother, at this temperature that ice is as hard as steel.</span> She hovers over to you and grabs both your cheeks with her hand and moves you head side to side. <span class=\"clteal\">And to think, all this because you wanted me.

Why did you do that? <span class=\"clteal\">The deterioration of our DNA wasn't the only thing I found on your computer.</span> I didn't put that there. Other people use that computer. <span class=\"clteal\">We'll see about that. Care to make a wager?</span> Whatever. <span class=\"clteal\">Ok then. I'm going to rest my feet on your face for 15 minutes. If you show any interest. Any at at all, then you lose. If I win, you will be my unquestionally loyal footslave until I get bored of you. If you win... then have your way with me. Deal?</span> Too easy, you say smugly. Freon moves her feet into position, as they touch your face, they feel really cold obviously but also really silky. The cold should help you win this. But after about 15 seconds her feet warm up and start to feel really nice on your face. The urge to lick them rises with every second that passes. You're about 5 minutes in when Freon starts wiggling her toes on your forehead. Thafmm chtinf! <span class=\"clteal\">What's that?</span> She briefly removes her feet to allow you to speak. That's cheating! <span class=\"clteal\">I never said I couldn't tease you.</span> Why you- mpfff! Another 5 minutes pass and one foot leaves your face, only to aquaint itself with your crotch. Mmm! After a a few seconds she finds a hot spot and your tongue shoots out of your mouth. <span class=\"clteal\">Ding ding ding! We have a loser!</span> Hey! Again. You cheated! <span class=\"clteal\">Such strong words. I prefer... persueded...</span> You glare at her angrily. <span class=\"clteal\">Dont give me that look! Plus you'll love being my footslave. Here!</span> She shoves five of her toes into your mouth and you feel better. <span class=\"clteal\">See? Tee hee. Now then...</span></span></div></div>",

Not unlike any other in Gotham. You're on a routine solo perimeter sweep. You personally hope Batman never has kids of his own, who would let a 13 year old run around a city like this at night by himself! Anyway everything seems quiet... Too quiet... All of the sudden a huge vine wraps you up, while a second with a flower sprouts and sprays you in the face, knocking you out. <br>\r\n<u>2:45 AM, Ivy's Hideout, Location Unknown</u><br>\r\nYou awaken in a green house of some sort. <span class=\"cgreen\">Naughty little humming bird, snooping around my garden.</span> It's Robin. <span class=\"cgreen\">Whatever. There are too many bats and birds in this city to keep track of anymore. What are you, like the third Robin now? Didn't the Joker kill the last one? Ha. Pathetic!</span> Dont talk about Jason that way! <span class=\"cgreen\">Did I strike a nerve little bird?</span> <i>Wait. Stop giving her the satisfaction. Batman taught you better than that.</i> <span class=\"cgreen\">Oh, so you're the strong and silent type like Batman now? Let's see how long you keep that composure of yours under the presence of pheremones. He he, you seem to be at an age where you're especially vulnerable to your own hormones.</span> She slowly walks toward you in a sexual way. You try to struggle, but the vines aren't the only things preventing your escape. You really dont have all that strong an urge to escape. Poison Ivy comes up and gives you a kiss! On the cheek. It burns a little at first but then you start to feel really funny. Poison Ivy waves her hand and the vines release you. She comes over and helps you up, almost like a mom helping up a little kid that fell. Why are you helping me? What's going on? <span class=\"cgreen\">You know, I dont even know what that will do to you. I've never tested lips to cheek before, only lips to lips, and you know how that works...</span> Your arm slung around her shoulder, she walks you over to a weird vine couch. On the way over, you happen to look down at her bare feet, the way her toes spread ever so slightly when she takes a step. She doesn't seem to notice your focus on her shiny green toenails. You get to the couch and plop down on it. <span class=\"cgreen\">I'm having fun with our little science experiment. Aren't you Robin?</span> Whatever. She sits next to you and causually puts her feet in your lap, much the way girls Barbara's age probably would do to their boyfriends. Ivy... <span class=\"cgreen\">Sorry. Hope you dont mind that I spread out a bit.</span> W-whatever... <span class=\"cgreen\">Is that stutter I detect? Are you turned on? By only my legs? This is exciting! I think I know what my pheremones did to you now!</span> She takes one of her feet and pushes it into your crotch, the initial impact hurt a little, but now you are really enjoying her feet near your privates. On a total impulse you grab her other foot and shove her toes into your mouth. It smells like flowers and tastes like oranges. <span class=\"cgreen\">I might not let you go now Boy Wonder. Oh how I've longed for a foot fetisher to come into my life! Albiet artificially, but I'll take what I can get! You'll be glad that I'm barefoot all the time, I know you'll love it here! Any objections?</span> You continue happily sucking on her toes. <span class=\"cgreen\">I'll take that as a no!</span></span></div></div>",

All the intel was gathered within a week, obviously she was not one to hide herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly open the lock-picked door to the apartment you have traced Harley Quinn\u00b4s steps into. To your surprise, it looked quite normal. Nothing unusual, you remarked internally as you reached for your pistol, mounting a suppressor on it as you made your way further into the house, shutting the door behind yourself. Quite soon, you found her. You saw the shadow of two high-heeled boots under a slightly elevated door frame leading to the bathroom. You crouched, picked an angle and fired two shots. Slowly, you moved towards the door and opened it. You almost gasped when you saw two boots set on the ground, before the wooden door collided with your face, sending the gun flying from your hands. You fell on your back, dizzy from the hit. Then, you saw a slim frame in the doorway. That must have been her. A woman with unusual make-up that strolled towards you. You attempted to get on your feet, but a stockinged foot landed on your chest, and the woman\u00b4s hand raised a gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldnt do that if I were you, darlin.\" She mused, grinning. You let your arms rest above your head as she straddled your waist, button by button taking off your shirt, then pants, leaving you only in your boxer shorts. During all that, you were movementless, not knowing what to expect from her. She arose once more, setting her foot on your stomach and slightly caressing your skin with her stockings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, why would you try to get rid off me, eh? Not nice. I think I will have to teach you a lesson.\" Her foot traveled to your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lick my foot.\" She ordered, aiming down the gun to punctuate her command. You did not have to be begged twice, your tongue running along her stockinged sole again and again, until you could feel her sweat in your mouth. She forced her foot on your cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was nice. And you did it all from your own will!\" She giggled, pressing the trigger. You blinked in shock, but it did not fire. Instead a cartoonish paper popped from the mooze, with <b>BANG<b> written boldly across it. She pranked you. Using the moment, you grasped her ankle with your hand and pulled, her foot landing on the carpet. You flipped her other foot with your leg, and in a moment you were upon her, pushing her wrists to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled again, even though her back was against the carpet and you were on her. Her legs arose, locking at ankles and you felt pressure on your hips, suffocating. She giggled again and again, and you let go of her wrists to try and pull apart the scissors of her legs. She exploited her gained freedom of movement,seizing her shirt and pulling it over your head. Your face was between her breasts. She quickly shifted, and was now atop you, your hands under her legs, your face still under her shirt. </b></b></span></div></div>",

Some prisoners tried to attack you whenever they had a chance, but your fellow guards prevented it. Other prisoners tried to ignore you, until you forced them to pay attention. Other prisoners... Well, they were really lonely. Some needed an ear to complain to and some needed a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut one prisoner went quiet and paid attention whenever you were in sight. They were Harley Quinn. It was usually with a small, quiet smirk or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fellow guards liked to rib you about it. Some claiming that the madcap mistress of mayhem was going to replace  Joker with you in her bed. Others thought she was planning on attacking you the moment she could. Another group thought since she was sexy, she was going to try and use her body to get you to help her escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever the latter was mentioned, it brought about 'only Ivy does that!' and such. And that brought up the times Ivy and Harley were together and if they had sex together. And that brought up  ribs like, 'Try to get Harley to convince Ivy to sex you up!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo during a ribbing, the alarm went off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riot in sector seven and spreading! Newbie, stay here!\" One of the others guards said before they all left. You pressed a button and the doors leading outside the wing sealed by a heavy-duty portcullis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prisoners in the nearby cells weren't many. They tended to be the female henchmen of various supervillains.  As such, you sighed when you saw Harley Quinn in one of the cells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you passed by her cell, you heard a tapping. Taking a moment to stop and look into her cell, you saw that she had tapped the bedframe. At the moment, she was laying on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, ms. Quinn?\" you asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile formed on her face as she crossed her legs, letting one of her feet hand in the air.

I mean she is beautiful, funny, independent, and quite kinky apparently. What's not to love? Oh, yeah. That whole criminally insane and violent thing. That's a bit of a damper on things. Poor choice or not, your body really wants to agree to this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe can tell that you are on the ropes and makes one final push. \"You know you want to!

Oops, I wasn't supposed to say that last part out loud. Oh well, doesn't matter. You can forgo that pain and instead get to play with my little footsies! Or they can play with you, whatever you prefer.\" She gave another little giggle at the end, indicating that she was expecting an answer. So what's it going to be?

And unluckily for you, they overheard the discussion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmmylou Brown, a farmer's daughter that was almost superhuman from her father's experiments, was the first to speak.

Our feet are pretty much like goddesses. Free us and we'll let you do whatever you want with them... or maybe we'll let our feet do whatever we want with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly, a long-haired Blonde, walked up to the cell and wiggled her feet just outside the cell door.

She was a improved duplicate of a previous clone. Her skin was pale, her hair was a darker red. She stood next the door and held her toes just outside the door. She called herself 'Ivy'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Poison Ivy! I lived with Red! She ain't into men!\" Harley yelled as she shook the cell door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVioley and Lily replied in stereo, \"Except when she can dominate them on her terms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was some mocking laughter. You turned around once more and saw that the laughter came from a former-henchwoman of Baby Doll's, Mariam. She leaned against the cell door as she said, \"All of your feet are barely toned... Except for EmmyLou, but who wants Farmer feet? All that dirt.. My feet are well toned from training to be a bodyguard and I still keep training. At worst, the're quite sweaty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see who guardboy goes after!\" Harley exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at that, all the women stuck their feet out the cell door as much as they could. Emmylou looked like it was a bit of a tight fit for her feet to slip through.</span></div></div>",

Almost every choice you have made your entire life was sound and logical. You were a good student, a good son, and look what it got you? A shitty job keeping an eye on the worlds most dangerous psychopaths and misanthropes. It seems about time to make a few insane decisions! At least it will be a change of pace. Besides, its a madhouse! What better place to get a little crazy? The only thing left to do now is make up your mind, so who will you pick? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Harlequin of Hell Harley Quinn? She seems fun, plus she deduced your secret first so she is definitely clever. A bit of playful domination and teasing, probably nothing too rough. Although she is certifiably insane so she may be a tad unstable... What's life without a little risk though, eh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Leafy Lovers Lilly. Violet, and Ivy? All three of them are kind of creepy, yet arousing at the same time. The domination probably wont be as playful with these three but it would be a foot in the door with Poison Ivy. Many a men have lusted after her... foliage, so to speak. Many men have died over it too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Farmer's Fairy(Alliteration is hard at 3am) Emmylou Brown? Her large soles are rather mesmerizing, to say the least. Sure they are a little dirty, but depending on your preference that could be a plus. And you never know who she might know...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Boisterous Bruiser Mariam? Her feet might not be quite as large as Emmylou's but they are much more toned. A bit sweaty, but that could be a plus or a negative depending on how you look at it. Plus she can arrange a meeting with Babydoll. Her tiny, cute soles are probably super soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that all of the options and choices have been laid out, who will you pick? You should probably hurry, time is a factor and who knows how long you have stood here thinking about all this...</span></div></div>",

Sure it was a little creepy, but maybe that's part of the appeal. She flexed her cute, tiny pale soles in your direction. This brought attention to her red and black checkered toes, while also having the added benefit of waving some of the smell over to you. It was faintly sweet, almost like cotton candy. Wait, how did she get nail polish and scented anything in here? Doesn't really matter you suppose.  She taunts Emmylou, \"Looks like these little side dishes are more than enough to satisfy my man, Sasquatch!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmmylou withdrew her feet from the bars. It was quiet for a moment before she spoke again, \"I know when I am beat Harley, but I think you are forgetting that the games not over yet. You still have competition, and next time i will win!\" She sounded put out, like a girl who spent her life being rejected and has gotten used to the pain. Man, you feel kind of bad. At least Mariam is just staring daggers at you from behind her cell. That's comforting. Hopefully who ever you pick can keep you protected from her, because she seems like the type to hold a grudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you ponder that wonderful thought, a voice sounds off from your other side, \"He would be a fool to choose anyone other than us.\" You turned to see Ivy, Violet, and Lilly standing with there toes poking out just past the bars. They were all painted different shades of green, with Ivy's being the darkest and Lilly's being the lightest. Seeing how they had your attention they decided to speak. Ivy took the lead, seeming to be the defacto leader of the terrible trio, and spoke, \"Harley may be fun, but she won't be committed to you, not like us. She has her beloved Mr. J. We can give you our undivided attention, can she say the same? Plus everyone knows more is better, and three is greater than one. It's simple arithmetic.\" As she finished speaking all three girls began to wiggle their toes, wafting the scent of their feet over to you. It was like a bouquet, floral and feminine. Your knees started to go weak and your heartbeat spiked through the roof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost started walking towards them, but you heard a small voice in the back of your head calling out to you. Wait, that's not your voice, it's Harley's! \"Hey, snap out of it,\" Her voice became clearer as she spoke, \"It's their pheromones messin' with you, G!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly turned to her cell and steadied yourself on the rail. God, your head hurt. It was hazy and hard to focus, but you feel vaguely in control again. Do you want to be though? It felt so good to just roll with the chemicals. What could Harley offer that they couldn't? You looked up and saw her beautiful feet and gorgeous face, but what struck you was her expression. She seemed... worried? About you? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spoke once again, almost crystal clear this time, \"Stay with me G! There messin' with your head! Hold your breath and count to ten for me, okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, you followed her advice and by the time you were done your head felt fine. Woah. That was terrifying. You weren't in control of yourself for a minute there, at it scares the shit out of you.Yet your boner has only grown harder, almost at its limit, just from a whiff of pheromones. That's one hell of a mixed message your body is sending you. Now you needed to choose, Harley or the Ivy gang. Is free will really that much of a big deal? That's up to you dear reader!</span></div></div>",

Sure some of them were farmers, but most were... well, ones very interested in the animals as weapons,\" Emmylou said, sounding really angry as she stared in Mariam's direction. She looked at you with embarrassment and said, \"Sure I can introduce you to the farm lasses. A number of them would like the attention of a manly guard like yourself. The others?

Her lovely butt was now mere centimeters away from your face. No matter how hard you tried, Harley was a sex harlequin goddess who apparently had full command over your body.

I assure you that he'll do it. And the two of you will be that much closer, or even inseperable.

How dextrous are you with your toes? <span class=\"crose\">I can write cursive with my feet. Why... Oh my... I dont think I'm ready for that... Most guys like for a girl to use her mouth for that.</span> Terry's not most boys. Do you want my help desensitizing you? <span class=\"crose\">If you dont mind sweaty feet.</span> Dana says taking a slightly more dominant tone. You think she might be on to you now... <span class=\"crose\">Why dont you go ahead and peel my socks off hmm?</span> I'm s-sure Terry will love your more d-dominant side... You slowly peel Dana's sweaty socks off, to which she wiggles her toes happily. They really dont smell all that bad, kinda like sweaty fruit if that makes any sense... <span class=\"crose\">I had blueberry foot lotion on earlier, but I think I sweated a little of it off. But you dont mind do you?</span> O-of course n-not. Her feet are absolutley stunning. They're kinda small, maybe a 5 or 6, and she has the cutest little toes, which have a sexy shiny dark purple polish on them. H-he might like if you- <span class=\"crose\">Why dont you just show me? You know, since you're the expert and all.</span> She winks at you. You grab her sexy little feet and bury your face into her soles. <span class=\"crose\">That feels really nice... I kinda like his... Can we try the licking now?</span> You pull your face away and slowly run your tongue up her sole from the heel, tasting a sweaty fruity taste. <span class=\"crose\">Oh my... Honey that's not ticklish, it's something totally- Oooh- different. You can go all kinds of crazy on my feet now...</span></span></div></div>",

Be gentle?<span class=\"cblue\"> Just for you.</span> But wait, wouldn't you get all sorts of... <span class=\"cblue\">Super immune system, I cant get diseases or anything like that. Oh, and um... Sometimes I lose control of my powers when I get turned on... you know, I've had them leave with burns, frostbite, broken bones... Dont worry, I live close to a hospital for a reason.</span> How old are you? <span class=\"cblue\">Twenty. Why?</span> Just curious is all- whaa! She pulls you up and gives you a hug... which kinda hurts. She releases her vice grip on you. <span class=\"cblue\">Ok, to become my servant, all you have to do is kiss my hand.</span> I can do that. She extends her hand, shiny red nails glistening in the sunlight. You proceed to kiss her hand.<span class=\"cblue\"> Good boy. Just for fun why dont you kiss the ends of my fingers?</span> Why?<span class=\"cblue\"> Because I'll give you a special reward.</span> Oh fine. You oblige and kiss the ends of her fingers. For some reason that shade of red is so familiar to you. You've... worked with it before. It then dawns on you. Hey Supergirl? <span class=\"cblue\">You can call me Kara sweetie.</span> Ok. Kara?<span class=\"cblue\"> Yes? </span>Where'd you get the nail polish?<span class=\"cblue\"> I made it.</span> From what?<span class=\"cblue\"> Oh, you know... stuff... </span>She says as she twirls her hair around her finger. Like?<span class=\"cblue\"> You know um... Red Kryptonite... </span>What! You mean I just... It's in my system now... The effects are random I dont know what'll happen to me now... I might turn into a fish or something!<span class=\"cblue\"> No you wont. I know exactly what'll happen to you. My last servant couldn't take it... </span>What? I'm scared now... <span class=\"cblue\">I'll show you. </span>She grabs your arm and whisks you off with her. A few minutes later, you arrive at her apartment. <br>\r\n<u>12:15 PM, Supergirl's Apartment, Downtown Metropolis</u><br>\r\nShe lets go of you and whooshes around her room. About 15 seconds later she steps out wearing civilian clothes. I still know that you're Supergirl. How does changing your clothes and hair, and then putting on glasses keep your identity safe? <span class=\"cblue\">Most people aren't as observant as you, as far as 99.99% of the world's population is concerned, I'm just a girl from Smallville who moved to Metropolis.</span> So uh. What was this thing you wanted to show me.<span class=\"cblue\"> Right! Follow me. </span>She grabs your arm and whisks you into her room. <span class=\"cblue\">Now... </span>She pushes you onto her bed and crawls toward you like some kind of animal. Then, she does something strange. She plops her butt down onto your chest and then puts her bare feet on either side of  your head. All of the sudden you smell something, you cant quite put your finger on it, but whatever it is, it's really turning you on. Kara, what kind of perfume do you have on? It's making me really turned on right now. <span class=\"cblue\">I'm not wearing perfume, this smell is all natural.</span> I thought that was Poison Ivy's schtick? <span class=\"cblue\">Want me to tell you what's going on now?</span> Please. <span class=\"cblue\">Ok, you asked for it.</span> She moves her legs and rests both of her soft bare feet on your face, which you oddly have no objections to... You even get the urge to start licking her delightful soles. After about 5 minutes, she pulls her feet away. <span class=\"cblue\">Ok, that was your treat. But now your training begins.</span> Training?<span class=\"cblue\"> You know, like learning to give me good foot massages and pedicures. What do you say sidekick?</span> Pardon? <span class=\"cblue\">Cmon, I know that you can build some kind of super exosuit for yourself and help me out.</span> Didn't you get the memo? I'm a super<u>villain</u> Kara. <span class=\"cblue\">Tisk tisk. Too bad. I guess I'll just have to deny you access to my feet.</span> You cant do that to me! <span class=\"cblue\">I can and I will. You're lucky that I dont put you in a pink outfit that has footboy plastered all over the front.</span> Fine. You mumble bitch under your breath. Her eyes glow red and she glares at you. <span class=\"cblue\">I have super hearing... Remember that.</span> Her eyes turn back to normal. Fine, I'll help you. <span class=\"cblue\">Goodie! I'm gonna let you know now. If I catch you doing ANYTHING evil. Automatic no feet for a week. Am I clear?</span> Yes Kara, you say obediently.<span class=\"cblue\"> Good, you've learned your place...</span> She pats you on the head.</span></div></div>",

You wont like it if you call me a bitch one more time...</span> You decide it's better to just shut up. You put on one of Kara's not girly sweaters, the scary part is that it actually fits relatively well... Ok Kara, I'm ready to go-oooo! Supergirl grabs your arm and whisks you away to who knows where...<br>\r\n<u>The Fortress of Solitude, The Antarctic</u><br>\r\nSupergirl changes into grey sweatpants and a white tanktop, she's barefoot. Remember before when I said that I can build robots and stuff? <span class=\"cblue\">Yeah. What about it?</span> Well I can do it with my mind. Your eyes glow and and all of the random junk laying around flies towards you and you make a light exosuit for yourself, hopefully at least matching Supergirl's strength and agility. <span class=\"cblue\">You think that tin can is gonna help you? Ha ha, good luck!</span> Supergirl flies at you and you instantly fly behind her and grab her arms. She flies up into the air and starts rapidly spinning. The monitors in your suit are telling that in a few seconds you'll pass out from the G-Force that Supergirl is generating. You have no choice but to let go and get slammed into a wall. Supergirl comes over to help pull you out of the wall. I dont need your help you alien bit- Wait I didn't mean that! It slipped out! Supergirl glares at you angrily as she rips a large hole in the front of your exo-suit and pulls you out. <span class=\"cblue\">Time to learn a lesson in respect.</span> Supergirl drags you to a lab of some sort.<br>\r\n<u>Fortress of Solitude, The Lab</u><br>\r\nShe pushes some buttons on a pod and the door opens. She tosses you in and the door slams shut. The pod fills with a purple liquid and before you know it you're totally submerged. You feel like you've shrunken a couple inches and you feel your weight change and redistribute in different places, also certain places feel a little... lacking... Your view of Kara changes as well. Instead of seeing her as a bossy bitch, you think of her more like a princess that deserves your utmost respect. The liquid starts to drain and the doors open. This new weight distribution makes you fall face first out of the pod, right at Kara's bare feet. You sheepishly look up at her. <span class=\"cblue\">So. How do you feel?</span> I feel... AHHHHHHHH! You scream at the top of your lungs then cover your mouth. You slowly put your hands on your chest, only to be met with two nice fleshy lumps. They're quite noticible too, about a C or D cup. Your nervously reach down your pants, only to find nothing... but a slit... You start to sort of crab shuffle away. <span class=\"cblue\">Oh no you dont! This only half of your punishment.</span> She grabs you by the collar with her toes and you cant move any further. W-what else could you possibly do to me Kara? <span class=\"cblue\">I dont think I like your tone...</span> I'm so sorry Kara! You begin to gently kiss the toes that are holding your collar. <span class=\"cblue\">This is a nice improvement at least...</span> C-could you let me go now please? You look up at her pleadingly. <span class=\"cblue\">Hmm... Maybe I set the personality recalibration too high... Sure honey.</span> She unclamps her toes and you stand up to face her... boobs... You're at least 2 or 3 inches shorter than her now. You look up at her. <span class=\"cblue\">Maybe I'll keep you like this. You're so innocent looking...</span> <i><span class=\"cred\">That's what you think you stupid bitch!</span> Hey! Dont talk about Kara that way! <span class=\"cgreen\">She's so hot...</span></i> Your pervert personality takes over and your hands shoot up to Kara's chest. They're just so perfect, you say, voice dripping with lust. <span class=\"cblue\">I guess you still have your old sexuality then?</span> You're so cute Kara. I could just eat you up... You stand on your toes and attempt to kiss Kara. <span class=\"cblue\">Wait a minute... Your eyes were brown before and after you came out of the machine. Now they're green...</span> Well honey, your machine split my personality into three parts. The normal and also the sweet little suck up, is Brownie. I'm everything about me that is sexual, my name is Lust. And all of my agression and negative feelings toward you, her name is Wrath. <span class=\"cblue\">Oh my...</span> Now shut up and pucker up... <span class=\"cblue\">No! If we're gonna do it we do it my way!</span> Kara slaps you. Oh. You really shouldn't have done that... Now you're gonna let Wrath out... Your eyes change from green to red and you lunge at Supergirl, who easily holds you back. Stupid bitch! You attempt to bite her arms, but your angle is bad and you get nothing. You're breathing really heavily and eventually your breathing slows down. <span class=\"cblue\">Are you calm?</span> Yes. I'm good now Kara. Just dont slap me so hard next time. Got it slut? <span class=\"cblue\">Excuse me! Wait you're eyes are still red...</span> I'm not angry all of the time, I just have a really, really short fuse. People also tell that I'm rude and abraisive. <span class=\"cblue\">Could you turn back into Brownie please?</span> Whatever... Your eyes turn from red to brown. Supergirl! You jump at her and hug her. <span class=\"cblue\">I should have you tested...</span> Tested? You say eyes welling up with tears. Like some animal? <span class=\"cblue\">No no no! Just to see what's going on in your head.</span> Ok. You say sniffling. But first... You grab Kara's bare feet and gently nuzzle them, after a few seconds however, Lust's personality takes over and you kiss and lick Kara's feet like crazy. <span class=\"cblue\">Ready for testing now honey?</span> Mmmm... Anything for you baby...</span></div></div>",

She zips around the lab at superspeed and when she stops she has a small round device in her hand, it has a brown, a green, and a red dot all in a trifecta formation. <span class=\"cblue\">Can you build something to fit this?</span> Of course I can. I'll do anything for you my super smart hottie. <span class=\"cblue\">Just hurry. Brownie is the only one of your personalities that wont drive me insane...</span> Your eyes glow and you make a new suit of armor from the scraps of the old one and some other new stuff that you just happened to see laying around the lab. You assemble the armor around yourself and plug in the device Supergirl built into the indent in the center of your armor's chest. Kara immediately pushes the brown button and Brownie's personality takes over. <span class=\"cblue\">Wrath is the only one of your personalities that will be even remotely functional in combat. I want you to at least try and stay Brownie when we're not on missions ok?</span> Of course Supergirl! An alarm goes off and one of the flat crystals on the wall shows a video, like a TV. <span class=\"cblue\">Looks like Metallo's on a rampage in Downtown Metropolis. Brow-</span> Just call me Triple Threat. You say taking a serious tone. Supergirl zips around and in a second is in her costume. You hit the red button on your chest and Wrath's personality takes over. You engage your helmet and warm up your jet boots. Hey Supergirl? <span class=\"cblue\">Yeah?</span> Hope you like the new skylight! You say as you blast through the roof, leaving a gaping hole in the ceiling. Supergirl sighs as she flies through the hole, giving it a patch with her ice breath before catching up to you. <span class=\"cblue\">What the hell Triple Threat? You know that Superman is gonna kill ME for this right?</span> Eh. <span class=\"cblue\">You...</span> Look Supergirl, do you want me to direct my anger at you... or Metallo? <span class=\"cblue\">Fine. We'll talk about this later.</span> Yeah. Later loser! You activate the afterburners, breaking the sound barrier, causing a shockwave that makes Supergirl do a sort of backflip before regaining her balance...<br>\r\n<u>Downtown Metropolis</u><br>\r\nAs Supergirl arrives, she finds you straddling Metallo and beating his head in with a short metal pole. <span class=\"cbgreen\">Supergirl. Please call your guard dog off! I surrender! I'm begging you!</span> <span class=\"cblue\">Triple Threat!</span> You were taking too long. I wasn't gonna just stand there and let Metallo terrorize the city. <span class=\"cblue\">You dented his head!</span> So? He's a robot. <span class=\"cblue\">No, he's a cyborg. You could've given him permanant brain damage!</span> This nut case is already messed up in the head, I just beat some sense into him. <span class=\"cblue\">Just cuff him and leave him for the police.</span> I have a better idea. You take the pole that you just bludgeoned Metallo's head in with and shove it into his chest, shattering his Kryptonite heart. He red optical light goes dim. Problem solved. So is he like dead now or... <span class=\"cblue\">He's just deactivated...</span> Supergirl walks up to you and hits the brown button, causing Brownie to take over. Oh my... Did I do that? <span class=\"cblue\">Yes. And I think it might be too dangerous to let you go with me on missions.</span> I have a question. <span class=\"cblue\">Yes?</span> Why not just leave Metallo deactivated forever? Wont his brain eventually die from old age anyway? <span class=\"cblue\">As awesome a plan that is. It's Superman's call not mine.</span> More like Superpuss... you say as your eyes briefly flash red. Supergirl notices the light on your chest briefly flash from brown to red. <span class=\"cblue\">I guess you cant be locked to one personality...</span> Since we're close by, why dont we just go to your apartment? <span class=\"cblue\">Sure Brownie...</span> Hey Supergirl? <span class=\"cblue\">Yes?</span> What would happen if I hit all three of these buttons at the same time? <span class=\"cblue\">I really dont know...</span> You hit all three buttons and all of the light turn white, while your eyes turn grey. <span class=\"cblue\">Brownie?</span> How about you just call my \"normal\" personality Eva? <span class=\"cblue\">I give up... Ok Eva. Let's go home.</span> Yeah yeah, I'm coming.<br>\r\n<u>Supergirl's Apartment, Downtown Metropolis</u><br>\r\nYou retract all of your armor into a wristwatch looking thing and stretch out. Kara changes into her normal clothes and flops down on the bed. Something wrong Kara? <span class=\"cblue\">Tired... of keeping you in line...</span> She says as she scrunches her toes, their shiny blue polish immediately catching your attention. <span class=\"cblue\">Is something wrong Eva?</span> N-nothing, nothing at all... Kara notices and amps up the teasing accordingly. <span class=\"cblue\">Hey Eva? You wouldn't mind giving my feet a quick rub would you?</span> Your eyes are progressively turning more green... I'd l-love to Kara... You quickly sit at her feet and begin to rub them for her. Lust has nearly taken over already, the slightest provocation would let her out completely... Kara knows this, and she playfully pinches your nose with her toes. Your watch lights up green, and your eyes turn green. It's been a while hasn't it Kara? <span class=\"cblue\">Hey Lust. Why is it that you're the easiest to let out?</span> You're just so cute... It's a wonder I even go back inside at all. You grab the foot that's on your face and shove its toes into your mouth happily sucking on them for the next... who knows how long. After a while Kara pulls her foot away and instead of staying Lust, you revert back to Eva. Well that was embarassing... <span class=\"cblue\">Hmm... I guess I sort of fixed you...</span></span></div></div>",

Where did you get those? They're so pretty! Brownie's personality takes over as your personality control device starts to fail. Supergirl...

Kara opens up each of the three hatches and places a matching gemstone in each. Emerald for Lust, Ruby for Wrath, and Chocolate Diamond for Brownie. <span class=\"cblue\">There.

You say perking up and jumping on Supergirl in a flying hug. Kara uses her X-Ray vision on the device and can see just a small hint of purple in each of the crystals. You finally let go and Kara gets changed into an outfit that looks like an all black version of her old costume, with the S being silver instead of red. Why keep the S? <span class=\"cblue\">I happen to like the S. Now quickly get suited up.
