The drow's armor was like that of a Samurai, plate squares on the shoulders and pieces of place covering black leather underneath. He carried a pair of katanas at his side and a rifle on his back. This drow, Daresh, knew the power of these weapons and his own power could break through this dungeon. He sat here, waiting, knowing that he would be found to have no relation to the incident, a razing of a city, that had landed him here. The drow's ebony skin was starkly contrasted by his long straight white hair, that went down to his waist. He bore a scar across his face from below his right eye to the center of his left cheek. His red eyes were watching in the dark when...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The dungeon door swung open for the admittance of a strange person and five guards. This stranger only took four steps before stopping slowly, allowing the others to filter into the room behind him. A bright blue was the color of his eyes with a dark ring of brown around the edges and these first landed on the prisoners. He surveyed each one with a hint of speculation, except for the drow. Finally he nodded, a signal to the guards, and they all moved around him to the prisoners and prodded them out of their chairs and moved them across the room and out the door. All except for the drow. It was just him and the drow now, alone in the dungeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stranger took his leather gloves off and adjusted his cape which was not elaborate at all. In fact, hardly anything he wore, or was adorned with, was eye-catching. All except for that amulet which hung loosely around his neck. If anyone was keen enough to spot it, they would see a green stone set in a black stone, rounded in shape. And his hair? Well, it was as dark as the shadows in that dungeon, shoulder-length and hanging free. But perhaps to a drow those shadows were not so dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am called Kaden.\" His gaze now fell easily on the drow. \"I want to know what you were doing in Tyme?\" Of course he referred to the city which had been razed and brought to ruins. By the time his men had arrived on the scene there was not much they could do to save it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His ebony skin was nothing compared to the sheer fear-inducing might of his crimson red eyes. He clearly was not afraid of this man. His weapons were laying to the side. He didn't even need them. \"I truly am disappointed that even this kingdom does not live above stereotypes.\" he said. He leaned forward to get a better look at this man. \"I had just stopped at the inn when a fire started in one of the buildings.\" he continued, \"I ran over, hoping to put out the fire before it got too high, but found that the raiders were spreading to the rest of the town.\" he looked up at the moon, as if he was recounting it in the shadows of the great orb. \"Never had I seen such speed performed by such a ragtag band.

Perhaps Kaden was trying to visualize the picture, considering that most of the buildings had been ruined and destroyed when his legion arrived. Or perhaps it was the word 'streotypes' that held him in such a moment of silence. ....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced at the drows weapons. Kaden was no fool to underestimate the speed and dexterity of his race, and was fully aware that the prisoner could easily turn the tables on him. But Kaden had nothing to hide nor nothing to loose. He, himself, carried no weapon at all. He never found a use for weapons since he could wield magic as sharp as any swordsmaster.  It was clear to Kaden that all signs pointed to the drows innocence, too. The man came on his free will as a prisoner and could have escaped at any time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Daresh dropped his gaze from the moon Kaden met his fierce, red eyes. \u201cTyme is the third city on the outskirts our kingdom that has been attacked and destroyed, and because we cannot find out who is behind this the officials are hungry to pin blame on anyone. It is unfortunate for you, being a drow, to have been in the wrong place at the wrong time. Your race is the perfect candidate to point fingers at. Innocent or not, I am afraid that my commander will judge you as guilty and set ready your date for execution.\u201d Kaden took two steps towards the window and found the moon, yet still watched Daresh very carefully. \u201cAs I see it, you have three options which I present to you. You can stay as a prisoner and meet your trial but, as I mentioned before, I am afraid it will not fall in your favor no matter how strong the evidence stands towards your innocence. Option number two: you can skip the trial and escape.\u201d Kaden reached out his hand and pointed at the drow\u2019s weapons. \u201cNothing is stopping you from breaking out of here and I can assure you that I will not stand in your way. But understand that once you are gone I will have to sound an alarm and you will be marked as the perpetrator behind these attacks on our cities until the real identity of the attacker is revealed.\u201d Kaden now walked away from the window and stood in front of the drow. \u201cOption number three: you can uphold your innocence by helping us find the name of the person who is attacking our nation. I will personally walk you out of this compound and set you free to find the attacker if you agree to take one of my men with you so that he may contact me of your progress.\u201d He studied the facial features of the drow for a split second before turning away. He walked towards the door with his back on the drow and paused, with his hand resting on the handle, \u201cthe choice is yours but I must hear it right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Right now the other prisoners are being interrogated to get as much information out of them as possible before their execution which will take place tomorrow morning.

When he saw Kaden the man stepped a little farther in and said, \u201cIt is the same as the other prisoners we caught at the other two cities. They will not reveal their leader. From what we can understand out of their horrible speech it is as if they do not know who sent them to destroy the cities.\u201d The man stole a glance at the drow. \u201cI bet you he knows who sent him. Drows are not as half stupid as orcs.\u201d Then, the soldier saw the weapons in the prisoners hands and became alarmed. He drew out his own weapon and placed the sitting drow at his sword\u2019s tip. \u201cGive up your weapons you cursed swine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaden quickly brought out his hand and laid it on the upper forearm of the soldier and nudged him a few feet away from the drow so that the tip of his sword was not as close as it once was, yet was still pointed. Kaden looked at Daresh and continued what he was saying as if he was never interrupted in the first place, \u201c\u2026anyone, and you are going to have to play by our rules until your \u2018moment\u2019 arrives.

Welcome, Meshnel.\" Daresh said, standing up, cutting his chains with one of his katanas, and cutting the bars. The katana he used had blue runes all over it, obviously enchanted. \"Ah, Daresh, always getting into trouble.\" Meshnel said, melting the bars in the skylight. \"Well, Kaden, I suppose I won't be standing trial after all.\" Daresh said, bowing towards him. Daresh's cloak glowed and unfolded into a pair of vampire wings as he flew out of the dungeon. \"Oh, he's half-vampire.

Kaden took a step away as the man burnt to a crisp and fell like ashes to the ground. His eyebrows furrowed in frustration at the death of one of his men but there was no time to linger on the incident. A man appeared in the same room wearing red robes and Kaden threw up a shield to prevent one of those fireballs from hitting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemons were okay and so were drows, but Kaden had a personal dislike for vampires. He stood in defensive silence as they unfolded their wings and flew out of the window of the dungeon into the night sky. Kaden always knew that Daresh would eventually escape, he just didn't expect to find someone come to his aid and help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they were gone the magician picked up the sword of the vanquished guard and blew the ashes off of it. If the drow was innocent for helping in the attack against Tyme, his friend Meshnel was certainly guilty for murdering one of his guards. This brought a frown on Kaden's face as he moved to the door and opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dungeon door opened to a hallway which was lit by oil lamps that illuminated the stone pathway every eight feet or so. At the end of the hallway was another door and a guard stood at this one. \"Rilk,\" Kaden called out to this guard, \"The drow prisoner has escaped. Send a message to the outpost on the outer wall of Tyme and have them assemble their archers. Tell them to shoot down anything that does not resemble a Morwhol Mount. Send another message to our sky scouts and have them try and track their trail. Also, I want to see Tanin at once.\" KIaden would raise an alarm throughout Tyme, just like he told Daresh he would have to do should he escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRilk jerked in readiness the moment Kaden started issuing orders but hesitated to act when they were given. He stumbled in his words..\"But...but sir, drows...they, they do not fly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaden turned away from the guard and started walking in the opposite direction. \"This one does fly.\" His voice could be heard by the guard, but it was more of a statement then an answer, Rilk thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The first floor kept many horses, the second floor was used as storage space for supplies and food, and the third floor kept Morwhol Mounts. These flying creatures were rarely aggressive at all. In truth, they were very gentle and peaceful in many ways. They only had two legs that perched on large T-poles and had a very long whip-like tail that wrapped around the pole to keep its balance. Because of their very large wings and aerodynamic body build they were excellent fliers with a great ability to do almost any maneuver in the sky. Their two legs had talons but they were short and stuby and they had no front legs or arms at all. These creatures were bred in small villages and then transported to the army to be used as sky scouts. At best, someone could possible ride one of these creatures armed with a bow and arrow and attack..but very rarely would you find a Morwhol Mount, itself, engaging to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was one of these creatures that Kaden had readied by placing a saddle on its back and a bit in its mouth when Tanin reached the stables. The boy climbed up the ladder to the third floor and found its reins being placed into his hands by Kaden. The boy took the reins and wrapped them around his hand but stood there very confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now is your chance Tanin.\" Kaden explained, \"Ride this mount and track down that drow and report back to me what you find. I will tell them that I sent you after him. Then, after a few days...disappear. The Order of Onul will think you have been killed and will forget about you. In this way you can get out of here and you can start a new life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Kaden,\" the boy frowned, he was about fifeteen years old, \"The Order of Onul is my home, I have known no other place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaden raised his hands and placed them on the boys shoulders, drawing him closer so that he could have direct eye contact with him. Kaden could see the color of the boy's eyes which were the same shade of brown as his, void the bluish center. But faintly, you could almost see the same color of blue forming in the center of Tanin's eyes. Day by day Tanin's eye color was beginning to look exactly like Kadens. \"If they find out what you've got then your life will be over. The Order of Onul will no longer be your home ...only a prison. You must go and escape before you mature or they will find out about you.\" Kaden nudged the boy closer to the Morwhol Mount, prompting him to get into the saddle. \"You must hurry before that drow and his friend travels too far. This is the only excuse I can find for you to get away and fake your death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy started to climb into the saddle, reluctantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure you report back to me a couple of times to make it look like you are truely following my commands. Do you understand boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanin nodded his head sadly, \"Yes sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd without another word Kaden released a rope that caused a large window to spring open. At the sight of fresh, open air the Morwhol Mount spread its wings and quickly unraveled its tale from the pole and took flight.   </span></div></div>",

Tanin had very little experience in riding one of these creatures so he did his best just to try and stay in the saddle. While clearing the initial buildings of the city he could see archers assembled on the walls. They were all searching the skies with arrows ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff in the distance he could make out some more mounts in the sky and they seemed to be circling in confusion, trying to search for the drow. As Tanin neared the outer wall of the city he saw that some of the flying creatures had been struck down, even cut in half in some places, but the riders seemed to be uninjured. He led his mount to follow the path of fallen morwhol's until there were no more to be seen and still, he flew beyond to the border of Andolsi's land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at the border, when his mount was flying above the tree tops, that he spotted the drow and his friend. They had just landed with their wings folded up behind their cloaks and they seemed to be talking to each other. Tanin quickly pulled his mount out of site, flying the creature behind a dense row of tall trees, hoping that he had not been spotted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart was racing now as reality of what he was doing settled in. Everything had happened so fast that he had hardly any time to register what was going on. He started to mumble and curse under his breath at the foolishness of Kaden's plan. Did Kaden not realize that Tanin barely knew how to create a contact channel with magic to relay information? He barely knew and understood the basics of wielding and weaving magic and now that he was running away from the Order of Onul ... he may never learn.</span></div></div>",

Not once did it flicker or waver in its creation. The voice of Onri\u2019di Nuil was so clear that it sounded to Kaden like he was standing in the same room with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have assembled for yourself many enemies within the Order. Just yesterday I was trying to ease old Ferrin\u2019s mind over your stubborn refusal to train or mentor someone.\u201d His voice was deep and rough but it held a sense of smoothness that came from the many speeches Onri\u2019di had to make throughout his official sovereignty in the Order of Onul. \u201cOf course, no one knows our little secret that you are different from the others. It would be impossible for anyone to learn from you. So I defended you, my slave, and gave old Ferrin a book of ancient mutterings to keep his mind away from you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaden stood in the lavished room of his quarters facing the large vision. He did not say anything to his master knowing that his voice was not welcomed at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now I find myself having to defend you again against the accusations of Bruenor. He insists that you helped that drow escape. There is no explanation as to why the most powerful and undefeated magician in the Order was unable to stop two flying men. It took me a very long time to calm him down. \u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe the drow is innocent of relation to the attacks, master.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have the Officials of Andolsi breathing down my back demanding a name of someone who is responsible. I need that drow!\u201d Onri\u2019di\u2019s voice was more quick and stern this time. \u201cInnocent or not, he will suffice!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaden dropped his head and Onri\u2019di sighed heavily trying to relax himself from a possible anger assault on his slave. \u201cI was fortunate to have stumbled upon you when I did. My position of power and rule in this organization has come by your hand. You are also the man I trust more than anyone\u2026more so because you are unable to lie and are always honest. But the Furian blood that runs in your veins, the very blood that gives you your enhanced powers and keeps you from lying and always speaking the truth, can be cumbersome to me at times. If it were not for your strong sense of Furian honesty you would not have let that drow escape, and I could be watching him die slowly in execution. His death would suffice the Andolsi officials long enough for us to find the person responsible\u2026 if that drow is as innocent as you believe. I have sent a party of soldiers and magicians to track down this flying drow. In the meantime I want you to move the entire legion westward towards Lysti Lake City.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaden raised his head and looked at his master. He had been bound to this man for a good part of his entire life. Onri\u2019di answered Kaden\u2019s unspoken question, \u201cThere are rumors that Lysti Lake City is where the orcs are headed to attack next.\u201d</span></div></div>",

She really had a dislike for these animals and would rather travel on foot but the entire entourage was moving fast, covering as much ground as possible. She had very long hair that was dark enough to be called black, but truly there were brown strands if the sun hit it just right. Her pale flesh was smooth and her green eyes sparkled with a life on their own. Her attention glanced at Bruenor who had just dismounted his horse. All the other horses could be heard breathing heavily through flared nostrils as their riders, both soldiers and magicians, tried to ease them to stand in place after running them so hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruenor walked up to one of the dogs with something in his hand and Anenfel, the elven woman whose job was to record everything that happened, looked hard to see what it was. The dogs were hideously ugly with very large pig-like noses and very small, pointed ears. They had long legs and a long slendor tail with a body covered in coarse fur. Three of the dogs were franticly sniffing for the scent they had temporarily lost and the fourth was eagerly waiting for Breunors hand. The magician uncurled his fingers to reveal some rifle shells and fired bullets that had snapped bows in half and all four dogs pressed their noses up to the objects to smell them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnenfel had never seen such objects before. She had heard that the weapon the drow used was rare in Andolsi and only the weapons master could explain what they were. She didn\u2019t have to wait long before the dogs had raised their heads to the sky and caught the scent again. The breed of these dogs were renowned for their incredible tracking abilities and their tails stood straight up as they bounded off towards the border. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruenor jumped into the saddle of his horse and kicked it to speed while waving for everyone to follow fast. He cursed under his breath for having to be out here tracking this drow down. This should have been Kaden\u2019s job for it was the old fool who let the prisoner escape to begin with. Slave or no slave, Kaden was favored by Onri\u2019di. But it was of little matter that Kaden got to move to Lysti Lake City and fight orcs while he had to tromp through the forest and find a drow because Bruenor was looking forward to executing the dark elf part vampire himself.</span></div></div>",

He walked back over to where the Morwhol Mount was. He had sent a message to Kaden of the whereabouts of the drow but he wasn\u2019t sure if it got through or not. His vision\u2019s hardly worked no matter how much he practiced on casting the spell and creating it. He checked the rope that he had tied to a limb to keep the mount from flying off and said, \u201cMight as well get a closer look at these guys since we will be leaving in the next day or so for our own adventures.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanin left the mount tied up and he walked towards the direction where he had last seen them. Trying not to be seen he sneaked between tree trunks and bushes until he found them. While bending low behind a thick berry bush he watched them crawl into a castle-like-tent and he muttered to himself, \u201cWhat the\u2026.?

Curiously he got close enough to extend a hand and touch it, but just as his fingertip was about to poke one of its walls he suddenly found himself falling. Or wait, he wasn\u2019t falling! Was he being pushed down or was he growing smaller? Either way he found himself being pushed through the door of the mini castle and inside its structure. His eyes were wide from surprise and fear at what was happening and the first thing he saw after being telekinetically pushed through its door was the two men. He jumped backwards and stared at them\u2026 kinda speechless.

By unwavering rules, slaves and freemen were not allowed to challenge each other for rank in the Order of Onul.  Bruenor would inherit the sovereignty of the Order not from birthright, but from his extraordinary magical talent and his free status when Onri\u2019di Nuil passed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were about thirty soldiers and twenty magicians included in this search party and they all sat on horses. Bruenor turned around to his men and was quick to give his orders. He dispersed them out in a circle around the enchanted castle so that it was surrounded. But he made sure they were of a great distance, a distance out of cannon range away. He mixed magicians with soldiers so that the magicians could aid the soldiers in attack and defense if needed. And making sure that everyone was dismounted and on their feet, he had the horses tethered in three groups and ordered for everyone to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so wait they did,\u2026 not desiring to send a message to those the enchanted castle occupied nor desiring to start an attack right away.

His tone much more calm in the respect that Daresh could have lashed out at him. \u201cI do not have to prove anything that I believe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a loud noise from above the castle, outside. It sounded like a large explosion with pebbled rain in its wake. They could feel the ground tremble under their feet and Tanin thought at first that the ceiling was going to fall. His knees bent and he cowered only before he discovered that the castle held strong and steady against the attack.</span></div></div>",

He started his attack against the castle, trying to break it down by launching a spell. All the magicians were involved, meditating and chanting to pull it off. Tiny earth fragments floated up from the ground with an arcane, blue glow surrounding them. Tons of them floated up above the castle until they met directly above and accumulated into a large ball. This ball grew until its circumference was about the size of a large wagon wheel and just before it launched downwards onto the ceiling of the castle it was ignited with a fire that burned blue. To Anenfel, it looked like a giant comet that fell onto the castle and exploded, sending its shard fragments in all directions. There was a one minute interval between each attack from the giant comets because it took so long collecting the material to create the large rock, even with all magicians helping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnenfel recorded everything she saw. From a mental concentration her magic allowed her to scroll the events down onto a journal that currently sat in the capital of Andolsi. It took a very well, seasoned journalist to do this and there were only a few of them in Andolsi. In this journal she recorded their search, the discovery of his castle/fort, the way Bruenor started the attack, and even the Morwhol Mount they found tethered up nearby.</span></div></div>",

A gentle breeze pushed some dead leaves across the ground where a giant slash formed into existence. It spread open to reveal a perfect oval, a rift in space, and out of it stepped a giant orc. When the creature was clear the teleportation spell quickly vanished like it had never happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the looks of his heavy armor and deadly weapons, and the way he stood proud, one could tell he was a leader. His size was very intimidating and muscles covered every inch of his body. The orc slightly lifted his chin and regarded the person who wrapped himself in dark robes. \u201cMy men\u2026executed.\u201d The orc said in the unlearned language. \u201cyou didn\u2019t stop it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch is the price of battles my friend.\u201d The concealed man answered, \u201cIt would have created an outrage if I would have voiced against the executions. I cannot afford any chances on my identity being revealed. Besides, you let your men tear down those sculptures in Tyme that I had asked you to spare. It is a pity you had to do that\u2026I really loved those statues.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orc shifted his foot and side glanced. \u201cSculptures look the same\u2026. as walls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we will put the matter behind us. It is important that we make strong our alliance so that our goals are accomplished. I am holding true to our bargain and will give you what you desire, when my desire is reached first.\u201d The hooded figure stepped forward once in eagerness of his next words, \u201cthere is an Andolsi army defending Lysti Lake City my friend. Do you think you can destroy it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orc snapped his body into professionalsim, almost offended that he was asked such a question. \u201cWe will crush bones\u2026and walls\u2026and kill, destroy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smirk formed on the face of the dark man. \u201cGood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teleportation portal opened back up behind the orc, showering the creature with its light and catching his attention. Taking the cue, the creature turned around to enter it once again so that it could teleport him to his orcish army and move them against Lysti Lake City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly when the portal vanished once again, and another gentle breeze graced across the ground, did the robed figure address another creature who had been hiding in the branches of a tree. \u201cThe orcs will succeed against Lysti Lake only because of their numbers. But for sure, they will win. Then, we move onto our bigger plans\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hidden creature jumped from its place in the tree, unfolded its wings to catch a break, and landed on the ground without a single sound. It was a demon, and its red eyes pierced into the darkness of the hood that covered the mans face. \u201cWe need a cover-up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo and visit our drow then and see if you can persuade him to join.

He took a deep sigh and closed his eyes, trying to block out all the commotion from the scene outside. He was deftly aware of Daresh moving to take care of the new methods of attack against the tent because he started to whisper some chanting words. These words were a driving force to the magical manna in the world and when he spoke them the magic began to obey and weave into a spell, all invisible to the naked eye. It wasn\u2019t long at all before an oval materialized into reality and Kaden\u2019s face appeared. Tanin smiled, proud to find that the vision was clear and unwavering in its creation. Almost perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaden smiled too. \u201cThere you are. You have gotten better at that vision spell.\u201d Kaden\u2019s voice was clear and if one didn\u2019t know better it could sound like he was standing in the same room with all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah well\u2026\u201d Tanin replied, stealing a glance at Daresh who had finished doing whatever he needed to do to keep the attack at bay, but then looked back at the vision, \u201cPeople always said I work well under pressure.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat pressure?\u201d Kaden probed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanin gave a nod in the general direction of Daresh.

I hate to see someone falsely accused for an offense they did not make and I apologize for the search party. But some things are just out of my hands and I have no control over them. It is fortunate that you know your magic, otherwise Bruenor would be having a field day with you. Maybe some time in the future, when all this madness dies away, we can sit down together and relax. Perhaps I could exchange something with you and you could show me your modifications to the Brellen castle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute!\u201d Tanin jumped in, rotating the vision so that he could see Kaden\u2019s face. \u201cYou mean to tell me that you believe this drow is innocent?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Kaden answered Tanin. \u201cThat is what I believe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow so?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA lot of factors.\u201d But Kaden realized that his short answer did not satisfy the young boy, so he continued and offered one of those said factors - a very obvious one. \u201cIt just seems unlikely that a person would go to such extreme effort to not kill anyone if he was standing in league with the orcs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanin dropped his head and closed his eyes, \u201cbut why did you send me out here to track his location if you thought him innocent?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaden\u2019s expression became hard, but his tone did not detect it. \u201cYou forget the main reason why I sent you on your own path\u2026.\u201d He let his sentence trail off, allowing the boy to pick up on the indications of what he was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanin raised his head slowly and looked back at Kaden. He could see his blue eyes clearly and knew that his own eyes were changing to the exact same color. It would only be a matter of time before there would be no indication of the original brown hue that Tanin\u2019s eyes possessed. He could also read Kaden\u2019s face and saw that the man was worried about him.

This man was old in age with silver hair and wearing a long robe of gold. \u201cI apologize that our barracks are not big enough to house all of your men.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe men will erect their own tents Mayor. It is no trouble at all.\u201d Kaden responded with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mayor walked up beside the magician and looked out over his city. \u201cThat much fog in our sky has never been seen before. It has got my people very suspicious and nervous. They say that the other three cities of Andolsi witnessed a sky of fog before the orcs came and destroyed them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will defend your city with our lives, mayor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA boy ran onto the balcony with a red face\u2026it was clear he was out of breath. \u201cWe have lost contact with the NorthPoint Outpost. We cannot bring anyone up in a vision.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mayor frowned. \u201cThe NorthPoint Outpost is the furthest most base before the Moloch Mountains begin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaden nodded. \u201cI will gather my company and visit the Outpost myself.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tanin was swinging that longsword around, very awkwardly. At one point he lost balance in a swing and the sword, which seemed a little heavy to him, fell from its angle and clanked its tip on the stone floor. He held the hilt in both hands and catching his breath he said to Meshnel, \u201cI always thought that weaponry \u2026.would be easier\u2026to learn then spells. Now I am not too sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had been practicing for about an hour and the workout was strenuous on Tanin. He lifted the sword back up from the ground and held it out like he was going to attack Meshnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut suddenly something appeared right in front of his face out of nowhere. It was a hideous face with red eyes that glowed with fire and a snarling mouth that showed pointed teeth. Tanin yelled, truly freaked out, and dropped the sword like it was the cause of the vision. His eyes were wide with fear and he looked around to try and find what he had just saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you see that?! Meshnel\u2026Daresh\u2026did you see it?!\u201d He swerved around, stepping over the sword, and tried to find what he had just seen. That step was miscalculated though and his ankle got caught on the hilt and he tripped and fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a ripple of laughter that echoed in the room and a deamon materialized enough to show itself before everyone. It was very tall and thin with black, leathery skin. It almost looked like a human except its arms were abnormally long with fingers that ended in sharp points. Its face was human except for the mouth of pointed teeth and its eyes, that burned with depths of fire, was the most intimidating of all. It was a spiritual deamon and it stood there for a moment and watched Daresh and Meshnel very accurately when its amusement with Tanin was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpiritual deamons differed from other demons. This particular deamon was caught and bound in the spiritual realm and was never allowed to pass the barrier into the real world. If one would strike at it with a weapon the weapon would fall straight through as if the creature was never even there. They worked differently from the demons that lived in the materialistic world also. They were the creatures in the stories when you heard about someone being possessed by the devil. They were after your soul and were masters in the fields of manipulation, persuasion, intimidation, coercion, and seduction. Spiritual deamons played and attacked your mind\u2026never the physical body. If they found one tiny piece of your mind that bent to their will then they would latch on like a leech and stay until that person was entirely possessed by them. Most times people were attacked by spiritual deamons without ever seeing them at all. It was those thoughts of suicide, anger, murder and the likes that were the weapons of these creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so this deamon showed itself before the three men. Because of its inability to touch the realistic world it was truly no threat to their lives at all and, if it found no foothold on their minds, it would no doubt leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words came into Daresh\u2019s mind telepathically from the deamon. <i>\u201cI was sent to deliver a message\u2026\u201d</i> Its eyes seemed like it could delve into the depths of Daresh\u2019s soul. It waited for the drow\u2019s response, too.</span></div></div>",

Even if the creature was after possessing his mind this would not be the right time. Spiritual deamons were precise creatures and only attacked when the timing was right. It was not after the drow\u2019s mind, or soul, but was after something else instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cWe would make it worth your trouble if you would join us in our plans.\u201d</i> The telepathic message came once again to Daresh. The other two men, Meshnel and Tanin could not hear anything. <i>\u201cWe know how to reward our friends.\u201d</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deamon began to move in the air, circling Meshnel and then coming up in front of Tanin where it paused. Its words still directed towards Daresh, and him alone. <i>\u201cThese two friends of yours do not even have to know that you have joined our efforts. It can be our little secret. A secret that you will be greatly rewarded for if you keep it.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deamon then turned its back on Tanin and looked directly at Daresh again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanin pounced upon the opportunity. He had previously gotten up from where he had tripped on the floor and had picked up that sword he had been practicing with. Swinging a hefty swing he slashed the edge of that sword across the deamons back, only to find it hit nothing and fall through in an unexpectant clank to the ground. Tanin blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deamon did not even acknowledge the boy and his attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cThe person I represent will give you whatever is in his power to give. All you have to do is lead the orcs into battle.\u201d</i> <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
