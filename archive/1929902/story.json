Glory and honor awaits you!<br>\r\nThat's what they told you before they sent you on this mission to scout a Horde camp. You've been sitting in the head of the Barrens for weeks now, struggling to sleep in your little tent as you kicked your sweaty legs around, both the hot air and fear of being discovered keeping you awake. You've heard of what they do to prisoners, after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night though, while you were almost asleep, you opened your eyes wide as you heard something moving outside. Multiple footsteps, whispering... Your tent had been found. In terror, you froze still, hoping that they'd just leave you alone. However, this seemed hopeless. Judging from voices, there was a whole unit of Horde here; women, men, orcs, trolls, goblins... Closing your eyes, you just felt like wetting yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you opened them again. You can't do this. You're the best that Stormwind has to offer! One human matches one hundred orcs after all! Or, that's what they told you at the bootcamp at least. Grabbing your one-handed sword, you got up from your blanket and charged outside, wearing nothing but a rag around your waist. \"FOR THE ALLI-\" was all that could be heard of your mighty warcry before something knocked you out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext time you opened your eyes, first thing you realized was that your only rag had been stripped off, revealing your member. \"Huh, wha..?\" In confusion, you tried to move your hands to cover yourself up, only to then find yourself cuffed to the wall, your hands against the wall above your head, leaving you sitting on the ground helplessly. \"HELP! SOMEONE!?\" You shouted, but no answer was heard. Until someone walked in... you could hear them talking... it was...</span></div></div>",

The beast itself looked muscular by default, the ornate armor only adding to its imposing presence. You shiver as he locks eyes with you and approaches. The tauren takes off his gloves and helmet, placing them on a nearby table. A calm smile adorned his face as he walked right up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The others told me you charged out by yourself against at least a hundred of us. That's brave. Resilient even. I like my captives... resilient.\" He cracked his knuckles, maintaining that same smile. You didn't think tauren would be capable of this sort of interrogation, but you were ready to spill the beans before he spilled your guts. The giant axe on his back was almost as big as you. You'd heard stories of tauren cleaving their opponents in half in one swing, but only now did you see that those stories were underselling the truth by a large margin. Your captor seemed to notice you staring at his weapon and pulled it from his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't be afraid, I'm not gonna use this. Just chopping you up would be far too quick, no fun at all. Let's see if you have some potential in those puny human bones.\" He set the axe aside and as you were about to ask him what he was talking about he drove a large fist into your gut. He stood back and pinned you against the wall, his open hand pressed against your chest. He felt your heartbeat racing and your swallow breaths. With minimal effort he leaned in until you screamed in pain, causing him to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and I are going to have some fun together. But not here in this stuffy dungeon. Let's take you someplace... nicer.\" With those words he threw a punch at your head, knocking you out once more. When you came to the first thing you felt was the binding still present around your wrists. You look around. Where did the tauren take you?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You knew these dry grasslands well. You were back in the Barrens. Desolate and rugged terrain as far as the eye could see. Only the hardiest of wildlife survived out here. You grab your head, feeling a small welt from the tauren's blow. You look down and see a big bruise where he punched you in the gut. Your haziness was scattered by a piercing scream. It sounded human. You looked around and saw the tauren, clad only in some rough cloth pants, wrestling with another human. He looked to be a prisoner like yourself, stripped down to nothing and desperately holding on against his much larger opponent. He'd just received a nasty hit to the gut, yelling out in pain. The tauren just smiled. You could see him sweating, but you doubt it was from the fight. The heat in the Barrens was unrelenting. You had been given the small mercy of being left in the shade of a tree. When the large bull sees you stirring, he pauses his fight to talk to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're up. Finally. Don't go anywhere, I'm almost done 'interrogating' your friend.\" You raise an eyebrow with curiosity. He was doing what now? \"Oh, don't look so surprised. Nobody even tell you how tauren interrogate someone? We wrestle them into submission and squeeze the answers out of them. Literally if need be. Your friend here is tough, but even he told me about your camp.\" He turned to the panting human. His body was covered in bruises. \"You got anything more to add to that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe haggard man shook his head. He'd been beaten half to death by this monster. Between the heavy blows and blistering heat, he didn't have the wits to do anything other than obey. He cracked a wry smile when the tauren congratulated him on helping the Horde. His grin slowly faded as the beast walked up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now normally I'd leave you here with nothing so you can try and claw your way towards freedom. But I'm afraid we've got orders not to do that anymore.\" Before the man realized what this meant the tauren wrapped his arms around him, lifting him off the ground. Your eyes grew wide in horror as the hulking beast began to apply a spineshattering bearhug to his helpless victim. The man cried out for mercy before screaming in agony. The tauren was undeterred, simply putting on more pressure as he squeezed the puny human in his arms. As he neared the man's breaking point his smile grew bigger. His mighty muscles strained and with a sickening wet crunch the man's screams fell silent. Sputtering and gurgling was all that was left for him as the insatiable brute just kept on squeezing. To your horror the tauren manages to draw several more crunches from the human's body before discarding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's for the vultures. Now it's your turn.\" He spoke calmly, seemingly oblivious to the man he just crushed to death with his bare hands. He picked up a small knife from his pile of gear and used it to cut through your bindings. Before you got up he held you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you run I'll break every bone in your body and make sure you're awake to feel all of it. You were brave enough to charge a hundred of us, so I don't want to see any cowardice against just me. If you tell me everything I might even be tempted to ignore my orders and let you go. Whether you're still healthy enough to crawl to safety at that point is up to you. Now on your feet.\" You slowly get up, your legs still unsteady after days of captivity. The tauren was ready to wrestle, beckoning you to come closer and show him your might. A glint catches your eye. At your feet was his knife. He'd forgotten to stash it after cutting your bindings. It could give you the advantage you need to overcome the tauren, but he would not go easy on you if your plan backfired.</span></div></div>",

Were you really going to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the Alliance!\" You roar, jumping onto your feet and charging towards him. In spite of his ready stance he seems caught off guard by your bravado, but it doesn't take long for reality to bring you back down. As you charge into him it felt like you'd just slammed into a wall. And now it was the wall's turn to make a move. Two large hands found their way around your waist and your ferocious push was halted when he simply lifted you off your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a low grunt the tauren let himself drop backwards, giving him the added momentum he needed to launch you through the air. You were given a sample of the beast's strength as you soared higher than you thought possible before landing painfully in the warm, dry grass. You were going to feel that free sample of flight in the morning, assuming you'd live long enough to see another morning. As you try to compose yourself the bull-man had gotten up and was slowly walking over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm impressed. Most of you try the knife. Maybe there's some scraps of honor in there after all. Granted, it'll take more than a knife to even the odds, but that clever little grin you humans get when you think you've outsmarted me... Oh, I love wiping that smirk off their faces.\" He grinned broadly and picked up the pace, bursting into a sprint before leaping up and preparing a ferocious elbow drop. You roll out of the way at the last moment, trying not to think about how much that would've hurt. The heavy thump produced by the tauren hitting the ground next to you a stark reminder of the brute's advantage in strength. You had to come up with something or this monster would simply wear you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of getting on his feet, the tauren simply raised an arm and brought it down on your body. The heavy impact in your sides made your whole body twitch, pain radiating throughout. It provided your enemy the time to get back up, looming over you menacingly. You felt a large hand grab your leg and lift you up. Soon you were hoisted high enough to be eye to eye with the tauren's rough leather boxers. The stench was unpleasant, but it was nothing compared to what the beast did next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis free arm wrapped around you, pressing your body tightly against his rock-hard abs. The short, bristly fur covering it providing an extra layer of discomfort. He let go of your leg and held you with both arms, squeezing a little before jumping up. You looked down to see the arid landscape approaching fast before colliding with it in the tauren's merciless piledriver. The blow dazed you, making it hard to keep track of what your tormentor was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tauren looked down, seeing his captive's eyes glazed over. The man was staring at his junk. \"Hmmm, you like what you're seeing?\" He taunted before bringing his thighs together to pin the man's face into his groin. He let the human stew in his powerful musk for a little while before getting back up on his feet. His grip was tight as ever and though this had been fun, it was time to actually do some interrogating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've had a sample of what'll happen if I'm not happy with what I'm hearing. Now's your chance to avoid more of it happening. Talk, puny man. Tell me everything.\"</span></div></div>",

That's what you get for not going to school.<br>\r\nYour boss, Miss Goldbottom, ain't known for thinking high of the working class, treating you like animals, while she walks around in her shiny boots and pretty suit, watching all of you work up from her office window, where she has a total control of the factory and a total freedom to bully all of you by setting the air conditioning off, making the assembly line go at astronomical speed, or whatever she thought of. If there wasn't a button for something there, she had it installed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, yeah. Your boss is a total bitch who doesn't like the stinky workers at the assembling side. That's why you were in disbelief and a little scared when you were ordered to her office by one of her hobgoblin thugs. Nervously you try to wipe the black dirt off your hands as you walk up the stairs leading to her office. The walls are decorated with all sorts of pretty paintings and the doorway is absolutely over-sized. You step in carefully and take a look around. There's the empty red chair in front of you, her desk ( with her collection of buttons ), the window to your working area and there by the window she is standing, her wide behind facing towards you, her short, blonde hair combed back and shining in the light from the excess amount of oil on it and her big feet squeezed into pair of high heels, which look like they're made from freaking rubies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cough softly to signal your presence to her and she quickly turns her head to look at you over her shoulder. You haven't seen her this close before, but she looks just like you imagined her; a big, snobby nose pointing up, large drawn eyebrows, ridiculously thick layer of red lipstick and just generally very, very, very bitchy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you and gets a devilish smirk on her face,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you in trouble? </span></div></div>",

Boss says I gotta feed ya but...\" \"But what!?\" you shout as you jump up, feeling like your starving to death.<br>\r\nIzzisal smirks as she takes a bite of a dry piece of bread, which was clearly suppost to be yours. \"Since you fucked around with me and my husband and ruining our day I'm gonna ruin yours!\", \"By starving me to death you little bitch!?\" you reply, pissed the little Goblin was out of your reach. \"Even worse you pathetic human\" She replies as she turns around and place her hands on her wide hips. \"If you wanna eat you gotta kiss my big green ass!\" Izzisal speaks. Your heart nearly stopped and your anger rose even further. There was NO WAY you were gonna kiss the ass of your enemy and not to mention a Goblin!<br>\r\nSpeechless you just couldn't speak nor think due to the pain of hunger, but as you remained silent Izzisal began to bend over slightly and moved towards you. \"What'll it be?\" She smirks as she pulls down her black leather pants enough to reveal some of her green butt cheeks. As painful as it was, you almost shed a tear for your pride as you finally dropped to your knees and smooched the sweaty green surface of her butt cheeks. Giggling away, Izzisal tosses the dry bread into your cage and leaves, whispering \"I'll be back\" before she left your sight.<br>\r\nYou never felt so humiliated in your life, but it awarded you with some very funny tasting bread, that seemed to make you pass out within minutes of finishing it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unsure what they were, you REALLY wish you didn't as you looked up only to find yourself in the most terrifying situation you've ever been in!<br>\r\nLooking up you realize the fleshing walls are... green toes... and as they surround you, you hurt your sore neck to look up as far as you can to see a COLOSSAL Izzisal looking down at you before her toes and the Goblin male you tried to rob earlier's toes which must be her husband. Looking down again, one toe alone is ALOT bigger than you, making you realize how insignificant you are to them now.<br>\r\n\"Well Well Well look who's awake!\" Boomed the mega sized Izzisal. \"You had alot of nerve trying to take my shit, let's see ya try something now bug!\" Boomed the giant male Goblin. Speechless you didn't know what to do other than stare up at the giants with fear with not a clue what they would do to you. Noticing your fear Izzisal giggled, which echoed all throughout your ears as her giant sized made her quite loud. \"Aww is tiny scared?\" Izzisal teased as she lifted one of her MASSIVE feet in the air and hovered her toes above you. Falling to your knees as you stared into her sole, Izzisal smirked. \"I dunno Jaxold\" Izzisal spoke as she turned to her husband. \"Maybe we could have some fun with him, he DID do me a favor earlier\" \"Is that right?\" Jaxold, her husband replied. \"In that case we won't crush you like the insect you are! But if you don't do as we say your gonna end up like a pancake got it!\" Terrified you nodded, and Izzisal brought her foot back down.<br>\r\n\"You can go back to work hubby he'll be a good boy to me!\" Izzisal says you see Jaxold leave what finally you see as a giant bedroom.<br>\r\nYou were now alone with Izzisal you just showed you mercy and ant sized to the Goblin giantess.<br>\r\nYou may be scared for your life but even as you tremble before Izzisal you also remember your training as a rogue... To be observant... Knowing this Goblin just wants attention and power from her size advantage, sparing you and getting you to kiss her ass you decided to take a risk and approached her GIANT toe in front of you. \"Did I say you could move insect!?\" She booms as before she could act you dropped to your knees and smooched the huge green soft surface, causing Izzisal to go silent. \"Aww so your being nice? Maybe, JUST MAYBE I won't crush you later after all\" she giggles as you can tell she's liking it and as gross as it is, it's saving you so far.<br>\r\nTaking it a step further you gulped as you jumped as high as you could to barely reach her toe nail, and pulled yourself up. \"Ohhh, very nice bug!\" Issizal says admiring your climb. Dropping to your kneels you bow before her on her big toe nail while kissing it's hard green surface.<br>\r\n\"Alright Alright!\" Izzisal exclaims as she crosses her arms while staring down at your tiny body. \"My show's on in a few minutes and since your behaving so well without being asked I guess I'll... let you play * while I kick back\"  </span></div></div>",

Although she is Horde and not to mention a Goblin, it struck you then looking in front of you she did have... quite a nice ass... \"Thanks...\" You finally squeak with barely any sounds at your size but Izzisal heard you. As she flicks on the TV she looks back down to you and smirks, \"Hmm... You are behaving well... I guess I'll reward you for good behavior...\" Izzisal speaks in an interesting tone eyeing your tiny body. \"Wh... What reward?\" You say stunned as Izzisal stands up and turns to face you. Eyeing you Izzisal giggles, turns around and pulls down her black leather pants and stuns you flashing the biggest booty you've ever seen inches from your face!<br>\r\nAlthough your pride feels threatened your jaw instantly drops and unexpectedly you get a boner! \"Alright Bug like before...\" Izzisal starts but gets very surprised to see you instantly smooch her titanic sized butt cheek without her even finishing.

OH SHIT!\" Izzisal suddenly shouts as she jumps up brings and brings her imax face over you. \"What's... uh... wrong?\" You squeak. \"If I'm right then some of the bread and... formula should be in the gas you just breathed in\". Taking a moment you realized then what she was getting at and instantly began to panic.<br>\r\nAs you begun looking white and dropped to your kneels Izzisal couldn't help but giggle. \"You're real lucky your not under my ass right for what's gonna happen, I shouldn't call ya bug anymore should I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling your senses loose control you...</span></div></div>",

Or just ogres in bikinis? Ugh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You didn't have much time to count the women mocking you, when two pairs of green, hairy balls smacked against your chin.<br>\r\n\"Oi, pal! Wakey wakey!\" Jaxold shouted, shaking his ass mockingly at you while squatting over your face, his trousers pulled down.<br>\r\nFor a goblin male, his cheeks were rather meaty...<br>\r\n\"Lissen here and lissen good, nobody steals from Jaxold, got it? You won't steal from me and get away with it.<br>\r\nIzzisal there has her camera ready, so that anyone plannin' some funny business will know what thieves deserve; to kiss my ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes fixed at the looming green rump, you desperately try to pull your hands off the chains, but it's really no use. The smell ain't too bad, just musky and honestly pretty sweaty, but at least a wealthy goblin such as him can afford relatively good hygiene. <br>\r\nFrom time to time his loose balls would swipe against your chin and cheeks, making you crunch your face in disgust... Wait, did he say \"kiss my ass\"? ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext thing you knew, one of the girls, an orc, held your head still with her strong grip that was seriously hurting your head, while another girl, a goblin, crawled over to your face holding a red lipstick, forcefully pushing it against your lips and giving you a sloppy make-up. \"Pucker up, pinkie~!\" she cheerfully ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wouldn't do this... This is ridiculous. Not only does this goblin, an enemy of yours, want you to kiss his ass and who knows what, in front of all these women, but he's planning to show it off to everyone... What if people at home find out? You would be disowned by the Alliance. What do you do?</span></div></div>",

You could see that they were dirty and sweaty, explaining the stench radiating from them. You panic and try to break free of your binds, but it's no use. The goblins notice you struggle and laugh. \"What's the matter?\" asks Izzisal. \"Afraid of a few feet? C'mon, take a good whiff!\" The goblins wiggle their toes, wafting the scent towards your nose and flicking footsweat across your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to tilt your head away from the feet, but no matter how you try, you can't escape them. The big, green feet cover every angle you can tilt your head, and you can't help but to take in lungful after lungful of their footfumes. Jaxold could see your visible disgust. \"Don't like it, huh? That's the smell of hard-workin' feet, pairs that gotta try hard to get what they got. You, meanwhile, ain't gotta work hard at all. Just steal some crap, and that's it.\" You'd protest and tell them about the years of training it took to get you where you are, but... look where you are: under a couple of goblins' horrendous feet. \"Hey, Izzi, how about we show him how him how hard we really work, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzisal laughed. \"Took the words right out of my mouth, hun!\" Slowly, the two goblins lowered their feet down onto your face. You tried to squirm away, but it was useless. Both of their feet rubbed against your face, smearing it with goblin sweat. Izzisal rubbed her toes through your hair, soaking it as well. The goblins both took a foot and pressed them against your nose, cupping it between ten sweaty, smelly green toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time toying with your face and spitting insults at you, the goblins had another idea to humiliate you:</span></div></div>",

You try to listen in on her, but the feet on your face make it hard to concentrate on anything, let alone a whisper. Whatever Jaxold is hearing, he seems to like it, judging by the devilish smirk draped across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jaxold and Izzisal stand up, removing their feet from your face. You took several deep breaths, appreciating the relatively fresh air. \"You sure you don't like our feet?\" asked Jaxold. \"No!\" you spat angrily. \"I hate the both of you and your rancid feet!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the goblins snickered as Jaxold sat down on your chest and Izzisal moved out of your line of sight. \"Me and my girl got just the thing to make you love feet,\" Jaxold said as he raised his feet back up to your face. While Jaxold wasn't exactly heavy, he was big enough to put some compression on your chest, forcing you to breathe harder, all while being poisoned by stinky feet. \"That's right chump, take a big whiff... how's he doin' down there, Izzi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you felt something big, soft, warm, and moist press up against your bulge through your pants. A shiver ran down your body as it slid up and down the length of your shaft, instantly causing it to harden. \"He looks pretty happy to me!\" mocked Izzisal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaxold smirked at you, cupping your nose with his toes. \"You really hate feet, huh? Gettin' hard just by getting your junked touched by a pair while huffing a goblin man's feet?\" The sharp, sour scent of Jaxold's toes completely surrounding your nose made you begin to tear up. Jaxold turned his head behind him and shouted \"Alright, you can start your game now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel your pants and underwear slide down your legs, leaving your erect dick bare. Izzisal wrapped her toes around your shaft, jerking it up and down. You gasped at the sensation... while you would had never wanted a goblin to give you a footjob in a million years, you had to admit that Izzisal's soft, sweaty toes drumming across your cock, sliding up and down easily as the sweat worked as lubrication... felt pretty great. Of course, this meant your breathing became even more labored, forcing you to inhale more of Jaxold's musk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So here's the deal,\" began Izzisal, \"I'm gonna crank you off with my feet. If you can last just five minutes, we'll stop playing with you for a little bit. If you can't, we're gonna make our feet really reek and see how you deal with that. If you can't make it even one minute, you gotta clean your mess off my feet with your tongue and apologize to us for daring to say you didn't love your feet! I gotta say, that'll probably be what happens, my hubby's got the sexual stamina of ten horses but I can still drain his balls in just seven minutes of working his dick over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter just seconds, you could tell Izzisal wasn't lying about her prowess. She held your dick in place with one foot and used the smooth, sweaty sole of the other to stroke it. Already, you felt like you were about to burst... but any more of this torture would break you! These goblins' feet smell rancid, you can't even imagine how they would taste. You try everything you can to keep yourself from cumming...</span></div></div>",
