But Genex wasn't like most other companies.  Fueled by a combination of brilliant scientific minds and cold, calculating business sense, not to mention some very deep pockets on the part of its investors, the biotech company had made quite a name for itself in a matter of years since its inception.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when the initial blueprints for the size-altering device were tossed around the drawing board, the question was not 'if', but 'how'.  The Size Modulator was conceived originally as a way to make long-distance shipping of large objects much easier by reducing the objects in size for travel and then restoring them to normal when they arrived at their destinations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as with many things, there can a large gap between intent and actuality.  With the development of the first prototype of the device, moods were running high.  The energy was palpable.  And someone had managed to get past the hefty security surrounding the device and get their hands on it.  That person was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[NOTE: A brief aside about the \"logistics\" of the Size Modulator.  As the device uses a beam, anything the individual affected is carrying or wearing changes size along with them.  But that doesn't mean they can't take it off later ;)  By similar logic, the device itself will change size as well, so long as the person is holding it themselves.  This doesn't happen, of course, if it's dropped, used by someone else on them, etc. etc.  The more you know!]</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Grimacing, Glenn glanced at his wristwatch for perhaps the hundredth time in the past minute or so.  The meeting was already five minutes overlong, and they had still three items to cover.  He was now starting to figure out why they were called \u2018board\u2019 meetings.  You\u2019d think having the most influential position in the firm would exempt him from having to sit through these drudgeries.  At least that was what Glenn had believed before he\u2019d taken the position.  He very quickly learned that the exact opposite was true.  Youthful na\u00efvet\u00e9.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Glenn had exactly passed his youth.  He could still count the years since his graduation at the top of his class on one hand.  The handsome raccoon had enjoyed a rapid climb up the corporate ladder, winning the (sometimes begrudging) respect of his peers and making a pretty penny in the process.  Several billion pretty pennies.  He\u2019d earned a reputation for always getting what he wanted, even if that meant twisting a few arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when he\u2019d joined on at the top of the hierarchy of Genex Biotechnologies, some of his friends and colleagues had baffled at his decision.  With his connections and business intellect, Glenn could have easily landed a position with any Fortune 500 company without breaking a sweat; why choose a dinky little biotech firm that had barely elevated itself above the status of \u2018startup\u2019?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery once in a while, looking out the windows of his plush office on the topmost floor of a midtown skyscraper, Glenn allowed himself a chuckle at all the doubt.  Sure, it had taken a good deal of effort and more than a couple proverbial throat-slashings to get there, but the raccoon had guided the firm with a steady hand in the direction of success.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, despite its somewhat upstart nature, Glenn noted that there were some definite perks to his involvement with the biotech firm.  Genex always had a lot of plates spinning and, though he wasn\u2019t particularly interested in actually talking with any of the flunkies down in the Research and Development section, the raccoon every now and then encountered something that genuinely piqued his interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Size Modulator was probably topmost amongst these interests.  The lab coat giving the tour and talk had droned on about revolutionizing transportation of large goods or something, but once he'd seen the sleek, silvery gun enlarge a pack of cards to the proportions of a king-size bed, a whole slough of different ideas popped into his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn considered himself a go-getter type, so he set about securing the device for himself.  It had taken some time, but the results were presently practically burning a hole in the inside pocket of his blazer.  The raccoon had smuggled the device out of the high-security storage room earlier that afternoon, and the gun was practically begging for use.  <i>We can push the beta tests forward a few weeks,</i> Glenn thought to himself, a smirk flitting across his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright guys, sounds good,\" Glenn pushed back from the conference table, clapping his hands twice impatiently.  \"Let's pick this up Tuesday afternoon.  We've got a long weekend to enjoy, don't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raccoon was the first through the doors, off to...<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Apparently, he wasn\u2019t the only person whose meetings ran indecently late on Fridays.  And leading up to a long holiday weekend, too.  Not okay.  At the least, it made him feel a little less bad for showing up to the rendezvous point a little bit late.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little shiver of anticipation ran up the raccoon's spine as he waited, unable to deny his sense of gleeful thrill.  Waiting in the semi-dark parking garage, it felt as if he were in some sort of cloak-and-dagger secret mission.  In a way, he supposed, it was.  <i>Well, things wouldn't be secret for long</i>, he snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn heard the clicking of hooves against concrete as Ethan sauntered up, pulling open the car door.  The handsome brown-haired stallion slid into the passenger seat, adjusting it backwards as far as it would go in order to accommodate his nearly-seven-foot frame.  He still had to bend his knees a little, his shins brushing lightly against the glove compartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch your hooves,\u201d Glenn cautioned, adjusting his rearview mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood afternoon to you, too,\u201d Ethan snorted. \"So... is it here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check it out,\" Glenn replied with as much nonchalance as he could muster, jerking his head in the direction of the glove compartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stallion parted his legs a little as he leaned forward, pulling open the glove compartment and slipping in his hand.  He rummaged around a little before pulling out the Size Modulator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit,\" he muttered, hefting the silvery gun-like device in his palm.  \"You weren't bullshitting me.  It does work, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it does,\" the raccoon sniffed dismissively.  \"Would I be sitting in this damned parking garage if it didn't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose not,\" Ethan shrugged, still staring at the device.  \"Well then, what's the plan, boz?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn grinned wickedly.  \"Ever wanted to take over a country?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan's eyes went wide and he ran his fingers through his jet black mane.  \"Er... I can safely say the thought's never crossed my mind,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because you have no ambition,\" Glenn tsked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean... don't you think that's starting a little bit, er, large scale?  Forgive the pun,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we won't be doing anything <i>domestic</i>,\" Glenn shook his head.  \"No.  You ever been to San Lorenzo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan shook his head.  \"Can't say as I have,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great place.  Little island nation.  Slice of paradise.  And with the help of that, <i>our</i> little slice of paradise.  I don't know about you, I've had a bitch of a week and that sounds like one hell of a way to blow off steam.  I've already got my charter jet all set for the trip.

He pulled into the private lot around the back and the pair passed through a pair of security gates and onto the landing strip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn's baby, a black twin-engine, was already waiting for them on the tarmac.  The raccoon paused for a moment to admire the aircraft, his arms folded across his chest and a smile on his lips.  Ethan rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou and your jet,\u201d he snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m allowed to have my toys,\u201d Glenn chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe'll be playing with whole cities soon enough, if your little laser gun works the way you said it does\u201d Ethan shrugged, pushing forward and clambering up the stairs that folded out from the doorway of the plane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan was already settled into one of the plush armchairs in the lounge area of the cabin when Glenn eased into the seat opposite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGave the pilot the plans.  We're taking off in a few minutes.  It'll be a little while.  Plenty of time to catch a few winks and maybe a nod.  Gotta be fresh for my big debut,\u201d the raccoon said, cracking his knuckles.  \u201cWhat\u2019s that you\u2019ve got there?\u201d Glenn asked, jerking his head at the glass resting on the stallion\u2019s armrest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cManhattan.  Double,\u201d Ethan replied, taking a sip.  \u201cWant one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll pass, thanks,\u201d Glenn shook his head.  It just seemed like the whole thing would be a bit less fun when you were numb from the alcohol.  Besides, why run the risk of getting the world\u2019s largest case of whiskey dick when you least wanted it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d Ethan shrugged, taking another swig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGonna be a long flight,\u201d Glenn repeated, reclining further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlenty of time to get my buzz on, then,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn shook his head a little, closing his eyes.  He prided himself on his ability to sleep like a rock on plane flights, and this was no exception.  The raccoon was snoozing soundly in no time.  When he jerked awake...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The cabin was hazy, the air thick with smoke.  Fumbling to his feet, the raccoon felt his way blindly down the aisle, coughing and hacking on the smoke.  Several panic-filled moments later, Glenn found the door, stumbling out into the fresh air of the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrambling down the stairs, Glenn collapsed on the sandy ground.  He was sitting on the sloping beach of what appeared to be a small island.  Well, perhaps calling it an 'island' would be a little bit too kind.  'Mound of sand in the middle of the goddamn ocean' was probably a better title.  About the only things the place had in the way of vegetation were a few sad-looking palm trees that appeared to have been there purely by accident.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the whole scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan stood a few dozen feet away, pacing back and forth periodically, his hand resting on his muzzle.  Behind Glenn was the smoking wreck of the plane.  An entire wing of the craft had been torn off and the tail section had taken some heavy damage.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the hell happened here?\" Glenn gasped, scrambling to his feet and walking towards Ethan.  \"How... how is that even possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" the stallion replied numbly, his eyes wide.  \"We'd been up for a few hours and the captain said to prepare for some turbulence.  Well, it hit, but then... things got a hell of a lot worse,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the captain alright?\" Glenn asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan shook his head slowly.  \"I tried to pull him out of the cockpit, but there was so much fire,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn,\" Glenn said, at a loss for words for once in his life.  A frown furrowed his brow.  \"Wait.  You didn't think to try and pull <i>me</i> out?  Wow, bro.  Not cool,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I was in a panic!\" Ethan retorted, throwing his hands into the air.  \"You're fine.  Don't freak out,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't think of anything to do <i>but</i> freak out,\" the raccoon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should stay calm.  It won't help anything if we freak out,\" Ethan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are we going to get out of here?  They're going to start looking for us when we don't show at the airport, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The authorities think we're going somewhere totally different, remember?  That decoy flight plan you gave won't lead them anywhere near here,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is 'here', anyway?\"  Glenn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan shrugged.  \"Haven't the foggiest,\" he replied.  \"Maybe the GPS on the plane is still okay.  That ought to give us a clue.  But we need to think of a plan of action to get the hell of this damn island,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn frowned in concentration, stroking his chin.  \"Well, far as I see it...</span></div></div>",

It's just excess baggage,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought about that initially,\" Glenn shrugged.  \"But we don't know where we are, much less which way to go.  For all we know, we could be swimming for hours in the wrong direction.  No, we need one of us to stay, er, 'normal'.

I guess the only risks you take are when it's just the pocketbook of one of your investors on the line,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan knew he'd struck a chord as Glenn roughly shifted the car into gear and screeched out of the parking garage.  Fifteen minutes of furious driving later, the pair stood in an old vacated warehouse in the middle of the industrial district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, if you don't want to wait, let's get this show on the road,\" Glenn said, setting the device down on top of a crate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan blinked in confusion as Glenn walked a short distance away and began methodically removing his clothes, folding them in a pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, what are you doing?\" Ethan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't honestly expect me to go on a rampage in my best suit, can you?\" Glenn shook his head, pulling off his boxers.  \"No, this 'coon is stomping it out in his birthday suit.

Unable to tear his eyes from the device, he couldn't help but think of all of the things he could do with it.  Glenn was great and all, but he just got in the way.  No, the stallion wanted this power all to himself.  And he was accustomed to getting his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYawning widely, the stallion stretched as best as the confines of Glenn's car would allow.  \"You know,\" he said, \"that sounds great.  Super fun.  But I've had a crazy day and I'm wiped out.  Rain check?  I'll be much more fun once I've had a little bit of shut-eye,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can sleep on the plane!\" Glenn protested.  \"C'mon, man,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never understood how people can sleep on flights,\" Ethan shook his head, palming the device into his trousers pocket.  \"Tell you what.  Do me a huge favor.  Lemme grab a solid night's sleep at home, then show up tomorrow and we'll head out, okay?  We can get our Godzilla on or shrink down the thing and put it in a bottle, or whatever the hell you have planned.  But I can promise you I won't be any fun running on absolutely no sleep.  I, for one, don't want to be a buzzkill.  Come on, bro, just do me a solid here,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan grinned winningly at his old pal, pantomiming slipping the device back into the glove compartment and shutting it with a click.  The raccoon groaned loudly but nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, fine,\" he growled, turning the keys in the ignition.  \"Be lame like that.  But you better not whine when I show up at your place at oh dark thirty tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not,\" Ethan chuckled.  \"Wouldn't miss this chance for the world,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan sat on the edge of the motel room bed, staring at the device as he shifted it between his hands.  He couldn't believe Glenn had fallen for it hook, line, and sinker.  Nobody could pull a fast one on the raccoon in the boardroom, but apparently all it took to trick him outside work was a little sleight of hand, and fairly poor sleight of hand at that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as soon as Glenn had dropped Ethan off at his apartment did the stallion head out on his own to a small, dingy motel on the outskirts of town.  He figured it would only be a matter of time before Glenn realized his device was missing, and he didn't want to be home when the undoubtedly furious raccoon showed up there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiddling with the device, Ethan wiped the perspiration from his brow.  It had been a hot day, and the motel room was poorly ventilated.  He'd stripped down to his boxer-briefs and wife-beater, but that hadn't done all that much to mitigate the heat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe device slipped in Ethan's sweaty hand and his finger hit the trigger.  He jumped a little as a pale white particle beam shot out, hitting the bedside table.  A fraction of a second later, the piece of furniture was no larger than a matchbox.  The Size Modulator slipped through Ethan's finger's as he crossed towards the minuscule bedside table.  Stooping down, the stallion picked the table up, turning it this way and that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, Glenn was right,\" Ethan said as the tiny alarm clock slipped off the table, plummeting towards the ground.  \"It really does work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan looked back at the device on the floor, his pulse quickening.  Dusting off his hands on his boxer-briefs, the stallion, snatched the Size Modulator off the ground and left the room through the sliding glass door at its rear.  He walked a short distance away from the motel as he fiddled with the dials on the side of the device that he figured were in control of size modulation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart racing, Ethan pointed the ray at himself and pulled the trigger.  He seized up as the beam hit him in the chest.  The device slipped through his fingers as Ethan began to grow to the towering height of...</span></div></div>",

Massive hooves bit into the ground, ploughing aside concrete like soil.  His boxer-briefs and wife-beater still clung to his sweaty body, now providing enough material to outfit an entire army.  A cool breeze whirled gently around Ethan, ruffling his mane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grin spread slowly across the stallion's monumental lips.  His chuckle rumbled like thunder across the neighborhood.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll be damned,\" Ethan murmured to himself.  \"That thing really <i>did</i> work,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExperimentally, Ethan lifted one leg high into the air, bringing it down heavily on the old warehouse on the other side of the parking lot from the motel.  The structure crumbled under his lightest touch, the impact sending out shockwaves and cracking pavement.  Ethan smirked as he heard a few car alarms get tripped.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I enjoy this immensely,\" the towering stallion boomed, resting his hands on his hips and tossing his mane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScanning his newly miniature surroundings, Ethan considered his options.

Concrete and asphault was smashed and ripped apart as if nothing more than brittle dried mud beneath his unfathomable weight. Power lines, lamp posts and stop lights were uprooted and ripped apart against the titan's immense ankles and calfs as he walked. Already the suburbs had gone into a confused panic as what sounded like repetitious explosions and quakes going off nearby woke them from their slumber. It was still barely light outside, that mixed with the sudden awakening left many of them confused and unable to properly focus or comprehend the monstrous beast that was heading in their direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them but one it seemed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn stared out of his living room window with wide eyes and his tail curled reflexively around him in worry, as if the flimsy fuzzy appendage would somehow protect him from his blunder. He knew damn well who this monstrous beast was, even despite him being so big that only part of him could be seen at once. Glenn wasn't stupid, it didn't take much to connect the dots. When he heard a thunderous explosion of sound echo from the beast towering over the neighborhood, it only proved his theory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GLENN\" the giant boomed, voice blasting across the landscape and violently rattling windows in their settings from the sheer bass of it. \"I DECIDED TO TAKE SOME INITIATIVE AND GET STARTED EARLY...\" His voice thundered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he was standing so near Glenn's home, the raccoon couldn't see straight up enough to see the titanic horse's face, the tone in his voice easily betrayed the wide, smug grin across Ethan's muzzle.

Ignoring the chaos of the neighborhood around him, the raccoon craned his neck as far up as he could, even leaning backwards slightly in order to get as good a view of Ethan as he could manage.  The stallion was unimaginably enormous.  Thick, powerfully muscled legs stretched up into the sky, hooves planted on either end of Glenn's block.  Far above, Glenn could glimpse the underside of the stallion's muzzle.  Sure enough, he was smirking.  Glenn chuckled; of course that was Ethan's natural response to the whole situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'm outside!\" Glenn bellowed as loud as he possibly could, cupping his hands around his mouth to provide extra amplification.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, the raccoon doubted that Ethan had heard a word he had said.  But then the equine titan shifted, crouching down low and resting on his haunches.  Ethan's face swam into better view as he leaned down further.  Glenn waved his arms emphatically.  He had never felt smaller.  Ethan's searching gaze landed on Glenn and a grin crossed his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THERE YOU ARE,\" he boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want me to do?\" Glenn shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO NEED TO LOSE YOUR VOICE, DUDE,\" Ethan snorted, tapping the side of his head.  \"HAVING AN EXCELLENT SENSE OF HEARING COMES IN HANDY WHEN YOU'RE AS BIG AS ME,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to know,\" Glenn replied, lowering his voice a little.  \"Though you can probably whisper and I'll be alright, too.

IT'LL BE EASIER TO PICK UP THAN YOU,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearing his eyes away from Ethan's massive mug, Glenn glanced at the sedan parked next to his driveway.  He couldn't help but smirk as he hurried towards it.  His neighbor had always parked way too close to his home for his liking; now Glenn got the last laugh.  He smashed the glass of the driver's side window, ignoring the car alarm as he opened the door and slid in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ALRIGHT, UP WE GO,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn flinched as Ethan's thumb and forefinger gripped the sides of the sedan, lifting it upwards.  His stomach plummeted as the car was lifted into the air as Ethan got to his hooves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip back was easy enough, as Ethan just had to follow his smouldering hoofprints to the origin of his growth.  Setting the car down again, he said \"ALRIGHT, IT SHOULD BE SOMEWHERE AROUND HERE,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEagerly anticipating his own growth, Glenn exited the car and began combing through the rubble of the alleyway for the device.

Vaulting over the living room couch, Glenn shot towards the door, practically kicking it open in his haste.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning out into the warm night air, Glenn crossed his yard as quickly as he possibly could, scrambling over the fence and hitting the pavement hard.  His heart rushing, the raccoon kept running, following the road on the other side of his backyard away from the horse who towered over his house and the rest of the neighborhood.

Not that Ruby minded all that much.  Gods knew she needed a break from starched lab coats and jeans now and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby smiled and waved as she spotted her group.

On her way out of the office that morning, the vixen had... misplaced... her section's latest major project.  While the Size Modulator was supposed to be in a top-security locker, it had found a home in Ruby's fairly substantial cleavage.  As the project had neared completion, Ruby had been ever increasingly intrigued by it.  The company picnic seemed the perfect time for a trial run, so to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of rounds of volleyball, Ruby excused herself, wandering off in the direction of the restrooms, which were located in a small brick building facing the shoreline in the shadow of several large sand dunes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping behind the restrooms, Ruby pulled out the Size Modulator.  She quickly calibrated the device, glancing around furtively to make sure nobody bothered her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand shaking, she pointed the device at herself, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moment of truth,\" she muttered, pulling the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later...</span></div></div>",

Glenn and a few of the company lab scientists shared a moment of horrified recognition, knowing the buzz and bright glimmer all too well. The businessman turned griller's analytic mind tried to consider a plan to take, an order to give, but as he watched the glowing form erupt from behind the restrooms, he drew an utter blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby, meanwhile, opened her eyes to feel a cool breeze against her nose, her bikini still in place, but her the ground beneath her feet feeling oddly textured, less gritty and more uniformly smooth. Creaking open her eyes, the vixen saw the ocean first--ships on the horizon, tiny and blurry with distance, and then tentatively look down past her breasts to see a small red square at her feet. Squinting, she could just make out rectangular patterns of brick-laid masonry--and past that lay a beach covered in umbrellas the size of those found in drinks. Small creatures darted to and fro--furred, scaled, skinned. People. People no taller than her ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked!\" Ruby giggled with childish glee, examining herself. Her bikini remained, good, she wanted to grow but necessary be naked just yet. The boys are gonna really be staring at my figure now, the vixen squeezed her chest experimentally a few times, running a hand down her curves experimentally, and all thanks to the--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused, realizing the size modulator was no longer in hand. Of course not, the lab tech wanted to slap herself, it only grows the target, not itself! For all intents and purposes, Ruby was stuck at somewhere between ten and twenty stories, the average person no bigger than her thumb. Which, the fox thought, long, fluffy tail swishing idly, is not necessarily a bad thing. Fluttering heart settling, the giantess grinned as she spotted the frantic movements of the bathers--some running, others staring--focusing her gaze on the curling smoke of Glenn's grill and the company picnic. Her friends. Her boss. Her coworkers--some of whom she liked, and many she didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, then,\" she took a deliberate stop forward. Then another. And another. \"They're gonna get a party all right.\" Empowered more than she'd ever felt before, the titanic vixen grinned equal parts mischief and lusty hunger as she prepared to:</span></div></div>",

The majority of them stood rooted to the spot, no doubt too shocked to see the enormous vixen standing before them to join in the general exodus that was occurring elsewhere on the beach.  After a few moments, a few of them seemed to regain control of their legs, turning to make a beeline for the parking lot.  Clucking her tongue, Ruby shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" she chided.  \"I thought this was supposed to be a fun day, an office retreat!  I'm not about to let anything get in the way of that,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, that only made her coworkers start to run faster.  The vixen strode casually over towards the group, easily covering the distance thanks to her towering height.  The grin never left her lips; oh, she had <i>plans</i>, alright.  Ruby felt as if she put up with more shit than she needed to, and if she needed to grow to gigantic size to get even, well, so be it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground shook as Ruby dropped heavily to her knees.  Leaning forward, the vixen reached out, snatching up Glenn and Rita in each hand.  She held the pair at chest level, grinning toothily down at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But before we get back to the fun, I have a couple things to take care of,\" Ruby growled.  \"Glenn...  Glenn, Glenn, Glenn.  You really think you're hot shit, don't you?  Well, let's make something clear.  That doesn't mean you get to treat others like garbage.  And you, Rita,\" the vixen's eyes shifted over towards the ferretess in her other hand.  \"Well, you're just a bitch and I don't like you,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn shouted in protest, struggling in the vixen's grip.  Rita just whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now.  What should I do with you two?\" Ruby mused.</span></div></div>",

Or hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that note, the vixen\u2019s hands plunged into the cleavage of her bikini, the former space of occupancy for the size ray, stuffing her squirming captives down between her breasts, whatever enjoyment to be found in this confinement overridden by fear and embarrassment. \u201cYou were always sneaking looks at my chest, Glenn, and Rita, I know you\u2019ve always been jealous, you flat little thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting her newfound playthings settle in, Ruby adjusted her top, squishing and pressing the pair together in the valley of her chest.

Having wanted to draw attention to himself from women thanks to his $50 dollar a week gym membership, the dog now greatly regretted his decision as an eye larger than his head rested on him, a pair of pinching fingers reaching forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm, lots of meat on you,\u201d Ruby grinned, seizing her prize, \u201cYou get to be first.

The husky must have been planning to moonlight as a male stripper, she thought, watching his buff physique wriggle and gyrate: first nervously, then more fluidly as his own ego pushed its way above the fear--mostly, she thought. The wideness of his eyes and tremor to his dance suggested he was far from enjoying it--oh well, she certainly was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad,\" Ruby said after a few minutes, seemingly satisfied with the show. \"To show my appreciate, I'll give you a little kiss.\" She leaned forward, pecking the husky on the chest, pushing him back into her hand. He opened his mouth to thank or beg, but before he could, the fox opened her mouth and ran her tongue down his front, leaving him slick from head to toe, curling between his legs and drawing him closer to her dainty muzzle, as before the horrified onlookers, Ruby slurped the squirming husky into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the fox's mouth, the hapless furson wriggled and squirmed, inadvertently causing her to salivate around him as well as spreading his taste across her smooth tongue. Ruby blinked, surprised at the sensation--unexpected, but quite welcome. She could barely hold the mouthful of husky and saliva, threatening to reflexively swallow both. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eyes were on the fox goddess now, her actions in the next second setting the tone for the \"party\" and their chances of survival.

He'd never been allowed in there before, though he'd had to work on the administrative paperwork for much of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDouble-checking to make sure the hallway was still vacant, Ike slipped into the room, closing the door behind him.

That's me,\" the short badger blinked uncertainly.  \"How can I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The emails we sent?  Is today actually not a good day for you?\" Ava replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes!  That's right.  Sorry.  Busy busy busy,\" the badger laughed nervously.  \"I made sure to clear my schedule this afternoon for the tour,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dovess smiled.  \"Great.  Thanks again for being so open about this,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClark nodded, bustling around his office looking for the keys.  Finding them, he gestured for Ava to follow him out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you left your camera and recording devices with the receptionist, right?\" the badger said as they breezed down the hall towards the research wing.  \"Trade secrets and all that, you know,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got nothing but the ol' melon,\" Ava grinned, tapping her temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then, all systems go,\" Clark smiled, holding open the heavy metal door of the research wing for Ava.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first half hour or so of the tour wasn't nearly as exciting as Ava had been anticipating or hoping.  She'd spent the prior weeks digging into Genex Biotechnologies.  Something about the whole company had struck her as off.  But she needed validation.  She had to go to the source and see if she could find anything below the glossy surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, no luck.  All they had to offer was a series of probably useful, if not slightly dull, gadgets for point of care hospital use.  The company's worst offence seemed to be, if nothing else, the oblivious (albeit very well-meaning) Clark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAva knew she needed to pry deeper.  But, as it became increasingly apparent, Clark wouldn't be of any use in that department.  He was just too dense.  Time to take matters into her own hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, Clark?  If you don't mind, do you have a drinking fountain anywhere?\" the dovess said, touching her throat.  \"I'm parched,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe badger's face brightened.  \"Of course!  Right around the corner here,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ava wet her whistle, Clark tapped his foot nervously.  \"If you don't mind, I think I'm gonna step into the men's really quick,\" he mumbled sheepishly.  \"Gotta... take care of business,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries,\" Ava smiled.  \"I'll just wait right here,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAva did not, in fact, wait right there.  As soon as Clark was through the door, the dovess took off down the hallwaym trying every door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fifth door finally opened, and the reporter slipped through.  On the other side was a large room that almost seemed as if it didn't belong in the building.  The space was spare and industrial, with white-tiled floors and walls.  The center of the room was depressed, with several concentric rings of black tile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaffled, Ava wandered around the space, trying to memorize as much detail as she could.  What on earth was going on here?  The dovess' eyes focused on a low metal partition on the far side of the black-ringed area.  A small hole in its center  emitted a slowly pulsing bluish light.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAva walked towards the hole, stepping into the depressed area.  The pulsing began to increase in frequency, accompnied by a dull whirring sound.  Ava ground to a halt, staring at the hole.  Too late, she realized that this couldn't be anything good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sh--\" Ava said as a particle beam blasted out of the hole, striking her squarely in the chest.  In the matter of moments...</span></div></div>",

But now, as her vision cleared, all be came far too apparent to--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" Ava gaped, frozen in place as she stared at her surroundings.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dovess stood at the site of the Genex Biotechnologies building, or more accurately, where the Genex Biotechnologies building had once been.  The structure was now no more than rubble arrayed around the smart (though now slightly dusty) pumps of the dovess, who now rivalled the old building in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the fuck is happening to me?\" Ava squeaked, her voice raising in panic.  Her heart was starting to race and she looked around for something, anything that could explain what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing down at herself did nothing to calm the newly-minted giantess' nerves.  Her black skirt and navy blue blazer were dotted with more rubble and, to her disbelief, a couple dozen of positively minuscule people clinging to the material.  <i>Well, that settles it,</i> Ava thought feverishly.  <i>I'm having the weirdest dream of all time.  Just need to wake myself up,</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dovess took a deep breath, trying to get her pulse back under control.  <i>Just need to calm down and you'll wake up,</i> Ava convinced herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm, Ava?  Could we have a word?\" came a tinny voice from somewhere on Ava's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Wha</i>?\" Ava blurted.  \"Is--is that <i>you</i>, Clark?\" she asked, craning her neck to look at the tiny figure with a bullhorn standing on the end of her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" the badger replied.  \"Look, would you mind sitting down carefully?  Some of these folks would probably like to get down,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, sure,\" the dovess said, gingerly sitting down cross-legged in the center of the ruined property.  She rested her fingertips on her shoulder, allowing Clark to clamber on.  \"What is happening to me?  Why is everything so small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... it's not everything being small so much as you being really big,\" Clark mumbled, standing on the white-feathered surface of my palm.  \"There was something of a mishap with the device in the room you got into.  It went off when it wasn't supposed to and... well... you see the end result,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you can reverse it, right?\" I asked, my voice hitching with worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I have some bad news,\" Clark replied, barely audible.  \"You see...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ava massaged her temples with her fingertips, her eyes screwed shut.  The blast from the strange beam had knocked the wind out of the dovess and given her one hell of a headache to boot.  It felt as if she'd been wrung out like an old rag.  As the sensations of nausea slowly subsided, Ava opened her eyes, blinking to clear her vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...the hell?\" she blurted aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room had certainly taken a turn for the odd.  She stood presently in the middle of an expansive, blank  space.  Under her feet was a grid of large smooth white squares placed at even intervals, interspersed with the occasional black square made of the same slippery material.  Craning her neck upward, the reporter tried to find a ceiling, but the space just seemed to go up and up, a white space that stretched forever.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoroughly confused, Ava selected a direction at random and began to walk.  <i>The beam must have knocked me out</i>, she though, stuffing her hands in the pockets of her blazer.  <i>Bet they thought it would be hilarious to take me somewhere totally random.  Well, they'll have another thing coming once I find them.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA faint tremor in the ground brought Ava to a startled halt.  She looked around, looking for the source of the shaking.  Then came another tremor, and another.  They increased in intensity and frequency until Ava could barely keep on her feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she saw the source of the tremors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what the holy fucking shit,\" Ava gaped, any remaining color draining from her already white complexion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe source of the shaking was a vixen.  A positively colossal vixen.  She was walking towards Ava, her buxom form dressed in a crisp white lab coat.  Behind her was an equally enormous wolf dressed in similar attire.  Ava probably didn't even reach the tops of their shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell, Bruce?\" the vixen snapped in thundering tones.  \"These tests aren't cheap!  You can't just go blowing your wad with nothing in the testing area,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was an honest mistake, Ruby!\" the wolf protested in response.  \"I had a target set up earlier.  I bet somebody moved it.  Probably Ike.  Fucking inept intern,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be more careful next time, okay?\" Ruby replied.  \"I don't want to have to go explaining myself to Glenn if he starts bitching about energy expenditures and all that shit,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Holy shit.  That beam must have shrunk me</i>, Ava thought, numb with shock.  <i>How in the fuck is that even possible?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Ava realized that had to be the impossible truth.  She was indeed in the same room as before, just magnified to an impossibly huge scale.  She knew she would have to get the attention of one or both of these newcomers if she would ever have a hope of fixing the situation.  The minuscule dovess jumped into action...</span></div></div>",

The chestnut-coated stallion was one of the regulars there and had the muscles to prove it.  He stood in front of the long bank of full-length mirrors  near the free weights rack, staring at his technique (but mostly himself) as he finished a set of bicep curls.  Mopping the sweat from his brow, he set down the dumbbell and wandered over to the bench where he'd set his water bottle.  Tipping it to his lips, he grunted in frustration as he found it more or less empty.  He crossed over to the drinking fountain, refilling the bottle and guzzling the cool water greedily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stallion looked around the largely deserted space, running his fingers through his jet black mane.  Suddenly, something didn't feel quite right.  His stomach felt a bit queasy and his legs shaky.  Bryce grunted as his head bumped into something.  He glanced up, only to bash his muzzle into the ceiling.  Confused, he looked down to see his water bottle, now clutched like a travel-sized shampoo bottle in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell...?\" he muttered to himself.  Was he... growing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe few other gymgoers in the area took notice as the enlarging stallion was forced to his knees by the growth spurt.  A cat on the treadmills pulled out her earbuds, making a dash for the door as Bryce rocked forward onto hands and knees, expanding palms pressing against the floor.  Within moments, the stallion filled the area, forcing aside weights and other exercise equipment.  It soon became apparent: there was nowhere to go but out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA clamor arose in the streets as a colossal stallion dressed in a white wife beater and black spandex shorts burst onto the scene, standing up clear through the roof of the gym.  He stood as tall as the fifteen-story bank building next to the gym, looking around in bewilderment and confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit,\" Bryce muttered to himself, brows high in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe towering stallion, mind still a little muddled, decided to...</span></div></div>",
