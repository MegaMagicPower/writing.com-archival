Their favourite foods were the Double Quarter Pounders, and the Double Big Macs. Michael and Allan ordered Double Quarter Pounder Meals, both supersized. Jeremy and Chris ordered Double Big Mac Meals. The server at the counter hands them their food. The only thing is, they asked for it to eat inside. He handed them bags. That not being such a big deal, they took their bags and went to sit down. They all opened them at the same time, and discovered the food inside was not what they ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael had received a kid\u2019s meal, and toy. Jeremy got small fries. Allan received the right burger, but the wrong drink. He ordered a Coke, and got Coke Zero. What was supposed to be fries in his bag, was a salad. Lastly, Chris looked in his bag, and he got apple slices!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Michael said angrily. \u201cThey always screw up our orders!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess we\u2019ll just have to take it all back,\u201d Allan replied calmly. \u201cIt\u2019d be easier if one of us just took it all back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho goes to take the food back?</span></div></div>",

He was sick and tired of getting the wrong orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d he yelled across the lobby at the guy who took their orders. \u201cYou gave us the wrong food!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, can I see your receipt?\u201d the guy asked smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere!\u201d Michael slammed all the receipts down on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry sir,\u201d the guy says looking at the receipts, and in the bags. \u201cThese orders are correct. That is what you paid for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael explained to the guy what they all wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I must\u2019ve misheard you guys,\u201d he replied. \u201cLet me fix it for you right away. You may keep that food as well for your trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy went into the back, most likely to tell a manager what had happened. What Michael didn\u2019t know was that he was doing something else. The guy had grabbed some strange powder from their storage area, and sprinkled it onto their food as it was being made. The other employees were amused, because they knew exactly what he was doing. Once the orders were completed, he brought it all to Michael on a tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you go sir,\u201d the guy said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael didn\u2019t even say thank you as he took the food to his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I got our order fixed, and he even let me us keep the other food,\u201d Michael said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys were all happy about that as they dug in and ate their greasy food. Once they finished, they were all still hungry, so they each finished all the wrong food they had received. Once they were all finished they felt extremely tired. They decided to head back to someone\u2019s house to sleep for an hour or two. They decide on Allan\u2019s house, since his is the closest, and the biggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the guys were bisexual, but none of them were dating anyone. They preferred to just fool around with each other when they were horny. It just so happened, that they were horny and tired at the same time. So going to Allan\u2019s house seemed like a good idea. They usually fooled around with the same person every time.  Allan and Chris together, and Michael and Jeremy together. Who should we see first?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Allan's house was huge. Big enough that having two guys in each bedroom made it possible for them not to hear the other pair. They went they're seperate ways, Michael and Jeremy went off to the guest room. Then Allan and Chris went on to Allan's room. Allan was very well off, and owned a king size bed all to himself. It was made specifically for his fooling around with Chris. They were both surprised at each other when they had experimented with each other and found out they were quite attracted to each other. Allan, being overweight didn't think a muscled stud like Chris would be attracted to him. Chris, being short, also didn't think that a slightly taller guy like Allan would be attracted to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey could barely keep their hands off of each other as they got into the bedroom and towards the bed. Holding each other and making out as they continued to the bed, eventually falling on it. They continued rolling around in bed for a while with foreplay. Chris was always the one on top during sex. Even though he was the shorter one, he could take charge like no one Allan knew. Chris went inside Allan, and Allan was enjoying himself. This was their best get together yet. They were both panting hard, and changes were beginning. Chris noticed Allan looked thinner somehow. Almost as if he'd been losing weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued to pump into Allan, starting to get close to a climax. Then Allan noticed something strange about Chris. He looked almost younger; younger than usual. He watched as Chris's stubble disappeared into his body, and his face became a lot softer. He looked like a teen now, which must have meant he was in his 20's. He had always looked young for his age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were both shrinking now, but neither could tell yet since it was at the same rate. Chris's muscles shrunk before Allan's eyes! Allan's slight gut also shrunk before Chris's eyes! Chris couldn't stop himself. Seeing the look on Allan's face only brought him closer. Same went for Allan. Suddenly, they climaxed and came at the same time. They cleaned each other up, and looked around the room. It looked different, somehow bigger. Allan was shocked to see his feet only reached down 3/4s of the bed. Normally he just barely fit on it! His feet weere now where Chris's used to be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look younger Chris,\" Allan said. \"It's freaking me out! How did you do that??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't do anything!\" Chris replied. \"You're the one that's looking thinner and scrawny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both knew something was up. They went to get out of the bed to see for themselves in the master bathroom mirror. Allan's feet just barely touched the ground now! He stood up and noticed he was about 5' tall! Same height that Chris was! The only difference was, he looked in the mirror and discovered he was scrawny!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris then got up and tried to get out of the bed. He had to jump off of it now considering his feet only reached just over halfway to the floor! He looked in the mirror and was horrified! He only looked 18 now! That meant he must have been about 21 years old! He lost a lot of height from losing those years! He was now 4'8\"! Almost midget sized! The only thing was, with his softer face, he looked like a kid!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This is a GAY, m/m story. Females are okay, but only the males may shrink. No crushing or vore please. :) Feet are okay. Slow or detailed tf experiences are preferred. This interactive is meant for shrinking, and AR mostly. Though ANY other transformations ARE welcome. There are four main characters, more can be added, but at least one of the main characters must remain through the entire story. Sex is fine. m/m though please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters:<br>\r\nMichael- Age: 25<br>\r\nHe has blonde hair and blue eyes. His face is hard not to stare at, but his personality is opposite of his face. He's extremely rude, when he goes out with friends. Someone gets his order wrong, and he makes them cry for a mistake anyone could have made. Though he's the youngest, he's also the most built out of his friends weighing in at 220 lbs. He's about 6'4\", and seems to scare a lot of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy- Age: 28<br>\r\nHe has black hair and blue eyes. He's a lot more hansdom than Michael, but no one really sees it because he's shorter by a foot, and weighs 100 lbs less. He's the nicest of the four. He doesn't say much if his order is wrong, and often times just takes it anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllan- Age: 34<br>\r\nAllan has dirty blonde hair, and green eyes. He's the oldest of the four. He's also the least attractive. Being 5'11\", and 200 lbs with a bit of a beer gut, didn't help his cause either. Though, he was really good with people, and doesn't freak out when his order is wrong. He calmly asks to have it fixed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris- Age: 30<br>\r\nChris has brown hair and brown eyes. He also looks very young for his age. Which makes him more or less attractive depending on who you talk to. He's almost exactly 5' tall. Which makes his seem even younger. Though he's also hulked out, and weighs about 200 lbs. He may have a bit of a temper when his orders are messed up, but everyone chalks it up to an adorable 20 year old having a tantrum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory Outline<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael goes out to eat with his friends Jeremy, Allan, and Chris. They go to a place of your choice, and either one, or all of them end up with the wrong order/s. Michael freaks out for all of them because he's sick of their orders getting wrong. Their orders are fixed, but their server puts something in the food to change them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun! :D</td>",
