            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack sighed as he looked through the books on the shelf. Finding any sort of information on his project was proving quite difficult. He had to pick a topic for his European History class, and at the time the history of witchcraft sounded interesting. How everyone went on witch hunts, and magic was supposedly everywhere... but finding books (he had to have at least one book as a source) on the subject was a bitch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had now been in the library for a good hour sifting through book after book, but never finding anything helpful. There had to be something! Finally, his eyes settled on an old looking book collecting dust on a shelf. He popped it open and rifled through the pages. It looked good, but he didn't have the time to look into it properly. He had only planned to come for a little bit after dinner, so he would have to check the book out at home. He shut the book, and took it up to the circulation desk. The lady there was apparantly as bored as him, and checked him out with but a couple words. He tossed the old tome into his backpack and got in his car, an old 2001 Civic. He started the reliable import up, and left for home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did the search go?\" His mom Christine asked as he walked in the door. Mark was off on a business trip for the weekend, and it was just them and Samantha, so his mom was just watching TV to pass the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not good. I found one book, but I haven't looked through it yet.\" He grabbed a coke out of the fridge and made to go upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you'll find some good stuff eventually, you just have to look harder!\" She said. Jack grumbled a reply and went up to his room. He put the coke on his desk and tossed his backpack on his bed. Looking through a dusty old book definately wasn't his idea of a Friday night, but it was better to do it now while there was nothing going on. He pulled the big block out of his bag, and plopped it on the desk, shooting dust out from under it. Just how long had this thing gone unnoticed? He flipped it open and skimmed through the pages. It looked like it was originally some kind of reference book for... what were these? Spells? That's a good sign for what he's looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he came to a page that looked like a gold mine. Sprawled across both pages was a big circle with a pentagram in the middle, like the kind of cheesy shit you always see in a B budget horror movie. It had latin scrawled around the edges, and in the star itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuckin' perfect\" he whispered. Jack reached over to pop open his coke, and cut his finger on the tab. He cursed, looking at the small cut, and stood up to go wash it off. In doing so, he pushed his hand on the book, and never notice the circle absorb his blood. He came back in the room and saw the circle in the book spinning, with the pentagram spinning in the opposite direction. All he could do is watch with a gaping mouth as the symbols literally floated off of the page and hovered a foot off of his desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his head as a silent flash went off, and when he looked back there was an honest to god naked woman sitting on his desk, cross-legged. She was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen, and looked like she knew it too. She was about his height, and had the tightest body he had ever seen. Her face was slender with smooth lips and deep emerald eyes. Her bust was large, but appeared to float off of her chest rather than sag. She also had dark red hair that flowed down her back that he wanted run his hands through. Actually, he wanted to run his hands all over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least you're not an ugly son of a bitch like everyone else looking for an easy lay.\" She said, but he had no idea what she was talking about. Hell, he still had no clue what was even going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" He asked. \"How did you just...appear?\" The sexy mystery in front of him tilted her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you are the summoner, I feel your blood running through my veins. Didn't you know what would happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? The last thing I saw was the circle thing float out of the book, and then poof! You were here! I didn't do anything. And why are you naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course the summoning circle floated out of the tome, that is what it's supposed to do. When you give your blood to the book, that's what happens. How could you not know that? And of course i'm naked, I'm a succubus. What kind of warlock are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, hold on. I must have gotten blood from my cut... oh. Oh, damn. Ok. This is all a mistake, I'm no warlock, and I have no clue what's going on. You need to go back in the book.\" She was hot, but he had no idea what to do, and if his mom caught him sneaking women into his room then she would kill him. The woman on his desk laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't. Once you summon me, I'm here to stay. I'm the guide to this book; both it and I are in your possession for the remainder of your lifetime.\" He shook his head trying to process everything. Right now, though, she needed to be gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you can't be here! If my mom finds you-\" The woman shook her head now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She won't.\" At his (even more) confused look, she explained. \"Right now, nobody but you can sense me. If you wish, I could make myself noticed but until that time nobody will know I'm here. Part of the book's attempt to stay with you, is to not be stolen.\" He sighed in relief, and sat down on his bed. He was coming out of his initial shock and trying to replay everything she has said. Also, it was awkward just staring at the naked woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok first, what's your name?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilith, Master.\" She said. He was about to respond, but was thrown off by the Master thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master...?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously you really have no clue what's going on.\" At his vigorous nod of agreement, she began to explain. \"This book,\" she held it up, \"is one of the ancient tomes of the warlocks. Several types of magic have guides to them, and they are often broken up into different subjects. I'm a succubus bound to this book, the book of lust and love.\" He whipped his head up at that, and she smiled a knowing smile at him. \"The books of the warlocks have lots of enchantments and bindings in them and require lots of magical energy to stay together, and there happens to be alot of such energy in the essence of the body, blood. That's where blood binding comes in. In exchange for blood, the book, and all that is in it, belongs to you. And that includes me.\" His eyes went wide at that and she licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The book can teach you many things, as it is a guide in that area of magic. I myself have quite a range of powers, just not as much as the holder of the book would have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kinds of things can you do?\" he asked. There were a million other things he could have said, but dammit he was curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Many things Master, but since you're new to magic, I'll make this simple. Remember how you asked me why I was naked?\" She asked, and Jack was now red as a tomato. She hopped off the desk and stood in front of him. \"Shapeshifting is one of my powers, especially helpful as a sex demon.\" He watched as she shifted into the same appearance, with clothes on. She had on knee-high boots, skinny jeans, and a tank top that put her cleavage on display. Even though he missed looking at those tits, this wasn't really a downgrade. \"How do I look?\" She asked, pushing out her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...Um, what else can you do?\" He asked. That was stupid! Real smooth, Jack. He normally wasn't bad with girls, but she had such a sexual aura, it was distracting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Many things. Turning people on, off, really anything about sex. I can even take over other people if that's what you want. Oh, and before we do anything, I should probably tell you something.\" He perked up even more at that. \"Because of your new power, girls will find you more attractive. At first, most of it will be from being around me, so when you're by yourself it will be weak. But as you grow stronger, so too will your sexual aura. You'll get many women Master, but if I could ask...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" He was deep in thought, and the newest revelation was but many that he was having to sift through now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save some for me.\" That brought him out of his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want to do now?\" She asked. \"It's gotta be weird to be dumped into the magical world so roughly, even though I like it rough.\" She had obviously taken a liking to her young new master.</span></div></div>",

If anyone in his family caught him with a woman in his room... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Master. I'm sure.\" Lilith responded. \"But you can check if you don't believe me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack slowly opened his door, and looked out. No one. Then, behind him, he heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who you talking to, Jack?\" It was his sister Jenny. She wasn't home super often, but must have just walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... no one.\" Jack mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's an interesting conversation to be having with 'no one', Jack.\" Jenny stated. \"You're pretty weird, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much did you hear? Jack asked, worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I walked past right around 'why are you naked', then I heard all this nonsense about warlocks.\" Jenny replied. \"That's some strange stuff you're into. Who's in there with you,anyway? I couldn't hear anyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, no one.\" Jack replied, unconvincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you won't mind if I have a look?\" Jenny asked. At that moment, Lilith stepped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you no one could hear me, Master.\" Lilith said as she walked up to Jenny. Jack stood, not sure what to do. Jenny didn't seem to notice Lilith come out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny moved past you, and began to open the door to your room. At the same time, Lilith stepped in line behind her. Jenny took one more step, and Lilith took 2. Lilith seemed to push into Jenny for a second, then disappeared, leaving a thin trail of black smoke. Jenny froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Jenny turned around to face Jack, smiled and winked, then proceeded to walk back to her room. Jack quietly made his way into his room, half expecting to see Lilith in there. She wasn't. Jack sat at his desk and proceeded to leaf through the book. The pages didn't make any sense, so he closed the book. At that moment, Lilith walked in through the door. Through the closed door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, point taken. People can still hear you.\" Lilith said casually, as if she hadn't just done something unusual like walk through a solid door. She began chanting, and after a couple of seconds Jack felt a wave of force permeate the room. He didn't know how he felt it, but it was definitely there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... what was that?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple shielding spell. It'll stop anyone hearing what happens in here.\" Lilith said. \"Oh and by the way, Jenny has a pretty nice body, you should try it out sometime...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway. I noticed you were looking at the book. Bet it didn't make any sense, huh.\" Lilith cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It didn't... What did you...\" Jack started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because you haven't got enough power yet. There are a few ways you can build that up. Some are... more fun than others.\" Lilith teased, her form shimmering. In the shimmer, Jack could almost make out some familiar features. \"Anyway, you wanted to ask something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She has a nice body, and that you should try it.\" Lilith answered, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But try it how, exactly?\" Jack persisted. \"I'm not going to have sex with my own sister, that's disgusting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't disgusting, Master, there's plenty of historical occurrences where brother and sister have engaged in such things.\" Lilith stated, not showing any hint of emotion. \"Besides, that isn't even what I meant.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what did you mean?\" Jack asked again, irritation starting to show. \"Because I can't think of anything else that you would have meant by that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll just show you then.\" Lilith, having clearly had enough of Jack's stubborn ignorance, said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what exactly... \" Jack started, as Lilith approached him and touched him on the forehead. Jack saw a puff of black smoke in front of him, then his vision blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... do you plan to do?\" Jack finished his sentence, but felt that something was very different. Very different. He was no longer in his room. And he was slightly cold. Why was he cold? He hadn't been cold a few seconds ago. He looked around and saw that he was in Jenny's room. And Jenny was nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack cautiously stepped over to the center of her room, and realized that he was holding the jeans she had been wearing earlier in one hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\" he muttered, and his eyes accidentally looked down at the ground. He caught sight of himself... and yelled. \"Holy shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at himself, he saw long, clean-shaven, <i>feminine</i> legs. He ran over to Jenny's dresser mirror, and his breath caught. Looking back at him from the mirror was Jenny, wearing a loose-fitting white top and... just underwear. Somehow, he had become Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilith!\" he screamed. \"What the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith appeared directly in front of him in a puff of the very same black smoke as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly as I told you, Master. You get to try out Jenny's body... <i>firsthand</i>.\" Lilith smiled. \"Lucky I transferred the protective charm to this room, or everyone would have heard that scream...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have just told me!\" Jack whined. \"I don't <i>want</i> to be Jenny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did try to tell you, Master, but you just weren't getting it.\" Lilith explained patiently. \"And have you even tried anything yet? You might like it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not <i>trying</i> anything!\" Jack protested, eyeing his reflection. He did have to admit, Jenny did take care of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure, Master? It's <i>your</i> body...\" Lilith teased. \"Just because your sister grew up in it doesn't make it any less yours right now. I mean, listen to your voice. Try moving your hands. It's <i>your. body</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack paused. Even if this was his body for now, as Lilith had so insistently tried to tell him, it was still Jenny. He didn't want to do anything weird. Even if he did, she would probably literally kill him if she found out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Not happening.\" Jack insisted, and pulled her jeans back on. It was a tight fit, but he got them on. Was this what girls' clothes were always like?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you at least get to try out life as a college girl now.\" Lilith said, disappointed. \"It's more fun than your usual boring existence, I'm sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Jack said, although she was probably right. He decided to ...</span></div></div>",

The only way to acquire it is to steal it from other people,\" Lilith declared.  \"Steal it?\" Jack repeated.  \"In a manner of speaking, yes,\" Lilith answered.  \"And how do I do that?\" Jack asked.  Another smile from Lilith.  \"Well, my boy,\" she said, \"what do you suppose might be a way you could get people to release sexual energy?\" she asked with a wink, leaning over on Jack's desk to show off her wondrous chest as her boobs dangled down from her wonderful body in full view of her young master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was nervous as hell.  \"You . . . you mean I have to have sex?\" he asked.  Lilith sort of half-nodded, \"Well you'd have to do sexual things, or at least romantic things, yes,\" she said.  Jack smiled a bit, then he scratched his chin as though something had suddenly occurred to him.  \"Well, you said there was more than one way to do this?\" he asked.  Lilith nodded.  \"Well, the easiest way would be for me to posses either your body or someone else's--a woman's.  If I jump into your body, you can use my energy to case essentially whatever spells you want,\" she explained.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You--you'd be in control of my body?\" Jack asked.  Lilith paused.  \"Yes, but only as long as you allowed me,\" she said.  \"The other way would be for me to jump into the body of some woman you desired--your sister, perhaps?\" she suggested.  Jack blushed.  Lilith chuckled.  \"Anyway, I would jump inside that body and, well, I would allow you to have your way with it.  Sexual energy would flow from my host into you,\" she said.  Jack thought for a couple seconds and nodded, confirming his understanding.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right . . . what else?\" Jack asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The last way takes the least help from me,\" Lilith said.  \"I would accompany you to a woman you want, you would have relations with her.

Jack sat for a moment as a world of possibility sprawled into his mind--possibility and apprehension at once, really.  Jack had great power at his disposal, but he also had no idea how to control or manage it.  Could Lilith posses him?  If she did, what would she do with his body?  Would this power change him?  These and a million other questions jetted through his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he made a decision.  \"I want . . . \"  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jack blinked a couple times, still getting used to the very idea of magic--of things appearing out of nowhere.  \"What is it?\" he asked.  \"Something to get the beautiful Ms. Watson to lose some of her . . . her inhibitions,\" Lilith said deviously.  \"So . . so now what?\" Jack asked, \"do I look all right?\" he said, stepping back to allow Lilith to look him over.  He had on faded blue jeans and a black shirt with the words \"Van Halen\" across the front.  The shirt was a bight tight on him, and so there was some extra pudge evident in his belly.  He had not shaved in a day or so, which meant he had a bit of a beard growing in, and his hair was a bit of a mess.  \"You look fine, Master,\" Lilith lied, thinking he really did not look as well as he might, but also believing that he needed to develop confidence in himself by focusing on things beyond the physical.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I just go over to her house and get her to drink this?\" Jack asked, having taken the vial of red liquid to hold it up and examine it himself.  \"Yes,\" Lilith said, \"I think you'll find the lady open to your charms,\" she declared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack turned and went downstairs, not sure what to think of all this.  He walked past his mother without a word as he headed for the door, his mind swimming with apprehension and unknown, unknowably possibility.  Jack made his way into the October night with the darkened sky above him.  The breeze blew through the trees, and Jack rubbed his arms in order to maintain some warmth as he made his way to his beat-up civic and got in.  The old car sputtered to life without great enthusiasm, and Jack pulled out of his driveway and headed in the direction of Ms. Watson's house.  He knew where she lived only because he had seen her out getting her mail on occasion, though he had never actually been to her house.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I doing?\" Jack asked himself as he drove along through the night.  \"What am I doing what am I doing what am I doing whatthefuckamidoing?!\" he demanded of himself as the absurdity of his current situation sank in.  Indeed, the question was a reasonable one.  He was about to head to the abode of a beautiful woman--his teacher, an authority figure, no less--and try to get her to drink a vial of liquid given to him by a succubus in the hope that the contents of said vial would so excite and ensnare said teacher that all of her sexual energy would flow out of her body and into his.  What wasn't weird . . . right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack pulled into Ms. Watson's driveway and spied the clock on his dashboard.  It read 7:48, and Jack took a deep breath.  He glanced at himself in the mirror in a search for direction and advice that the mirror, as it turned out, did not provide.  He reached down into his pocket and fiddled with the trusty vial, the one he hoped would work its magic tonight.  Then, he got out of the car and began the walk to Ms. Watson's door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the outer door and knocked loudly three times on the wooden door that was behind it.  He then stepped back and waited for a few seconds.  After a few seconds of waiting, Jack heard shuffling about inside the house, and an outer light clicked on, creating an island of light in the night.  Somebody on the other end fiddled with a door lock.  A second or two later, the door came open.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere before Jack stood Ms. Shannon Watson, clad in a set of sweat pants and a Penn State sweatshirt.  Her hair was a little messy, and she had on a pair of dark-rimmed glasses.  It seemed she had not planned to go out for the remainder of the evening.  Jack looked her up and down for a couple seconds.  This is not the way he remembered her from class.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee, Ms. Watson was a woman of 42 years, and she had long dark hair cascading down from her head to fairly well below her shoulders.  She had beautiful white skin, though it was somewhat tanned--just a little.  Ms. Watson's body was the stuff of dreams--at least of Jack's dreams.  At 42 years old, Ms. Watson was not a young, rock-hard, stick-thin model.  She had a rather fully body--delightfully full, actually.  Her boobs were jell-like mounds that adorned her chest, jiggling as she stepped.  Farther down, there was just the smallest bit of fluff in her belly, which gave way to a set of wide, child-bearing hips, though Ms. Watson actually had no children.  Her thighs were nice and thick, though still beautiful.  She was not fat in any sense, but it was certainly fair to say she had just the right amount of jiggle in just the right places.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Thompson?\" she asked, calling to Jack as he stood entranced by the body hidden under her rather un-elegant evening-ware.  \"Mr. Thompson?\" she said again.  Jack pried his gaze from her chest.  \"Oh, ah, hi Ms. Watson,\" Jack said, \"I know it's a bit late, and it's Friday, but, ah . . . \" \"Mr. Thompson, this is very odd,\" she said, \"as you said, it's Friday, and I'm not accustomed to having students at my home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but I have a question about the project,\" Jack said nervously, \"do . . . do you have just a couple minutes?\" he asked.  Ms. Watson looked at you for a few seconds and shook her head slightly, seeming to indicate she had other things she wanted to do with her night.  Still, she relented.  \"Come in,\" she said as she turned around and headed back into the house.  Jack's heart beat quickly as he stepped over the threshold and into Ms. Watson's home.  He looked about feverishly, like a young kid who has snuck into an R-rated movie and is petrified of being caught.  The home was well-appointed, filled with nice furniture, much of it a sort of regal maroon in color, along with a couple sets of cherry wood cabinets in which there were what seemed to be valuable keepsakes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Watson continued into the kitchen as you followed her but were still in the living area.  \"Take a seat,\" she said as she disappeared behind the kitchen wall, \"so what are your questions about the project?\"  Jack thought furiously.  \"Oh fuck,\" he said internally, \"I didn't even bother to make up questions to make small talk!\"  \"Um, well,\" Jack stammered, \"I was wondering whether you had a particular structure you wanted the paper to have, like an order to things, or like a particular number of pages,\" Jack said.  \"No particular order, and a minimum of twelve pages, both of which are explained in the syllabus I gave out the first day of class,\" Ms. Watson declared curtly from the kitchen.  This did not seem to be going well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack glanced about.  Suddenly, he spotted something.  Over on the table in front of the TV was a glass--a wine glass, in fact, filled with water.  \"This is my shot,\" Jack said quietly to himself as he snuck over to the glass and pulled out his vial, pouring the red liquid into the glass.  The new substance fell into the water in puffs, like the way cream billows in cloud-like formations into coffee.  Jack watched as the entire glass glowed bright red for a few seconds, then returned to the clear color one expects of water.  \"Now I just hope she's thirsty,\" Jack said.  He turned around and headed over to a chair and sat down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, Ms. Watson emerged from the kitchen, her hair tied in a pony-tail behind her head.  \"Mr. Thompson, did you really come all the way over here on a Friday night to ask me questions you could have answered by reading your materials?\" she said as she sat down on the couch.  She looked over at Jack. Jack scrambled.  \"Uh, I, uh, well so what are the sources we're allowed to cite to--\" he began, but Ms. Watson cut him off.  \"No wikipedia,\" she said, \"none at all.\"  And then she did what Jack had so desperately needed.  She reached down and grabbed the cup of water and took a few gulps of it.  Jack waited with bated breath as his buxom teacher consumed her drink and, with it, Lilith's potion.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd be amazed how many citations I get that are,\" she began, and then she suddenly stopped.  The water glass fell from her hand on to the couch, empty.  Ms. Watson's face took on a blank, featureless look.  Jack stood up and began to walk over to her as he worried a bit about what this meant.  Her eyes suddenly began to glow a bright red, but just for a few seconds, and then they returned to normal.  A couple seconds after that, she shook her head as the blank expression on her face was replaced by a more ordinary one.  She shook her head as if shaking off a daze while Jack stood a few steps away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Watson, are you all right?\" he asked.        <br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"... really... I get powers? Like yours only better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In time. As I said you have to build your power, train your self by doing magic so your body can channel more. The more you are able to channel, the more easily the book will accept you and the more of it you will be able to decipher.\" She said, lightly placing her hands around Jack's neck, staring into his eye with a steamy gaze. \"And trust me, the means to build that power is definitely worth the effort!\" And she gave a very sultry grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... yeah.\" Jack said, still rather worried what the heck kind of mess he's ended up in. She did say that though she was a succubus she doesn't have suck the life from people... but.... should he trust her? In fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... I will have powers, but you have powers right now. Are... those from the book too or is that just... well, natural for Subbubi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting question. Alright, fair enough. Some are natural for Subbubi, shape changing for instance, and some of the other abilities I posses, but being tied to the book has amplified those and given me others, such as the planeshift ability.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Planeshift?\" Jack echos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, planeshift Master. It basically allows me to warp space, shifting from one spot to another. The book binds me to you, enabling me to ALWAYS be able to shift to your location, with no cost to me at all. Other aspects of the spell are more tricky, and often it's better to just shift myself and a spirit rather than a body, though I can simply widen the spell to an actual portal you or anyone else can step through. By default though, like much of the powers granted by the book, any effects of the planeshift other than the actual changing location are invisible to anyone but an attuned being. IE one who can wield magic. And yes, that includes you Master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... I'll be able to planeshift eventually? Like, teleport from one spot to another, just like that?\" Jack says, snapping his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillith shook her head, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic is seldom that easy Master, unless you've paid the price. Either in long arduous training, managed to siphon the energy from elsewhere, or push the consequences of accelerated learning on some other being. The latter is the usual method taken as a shortcut. Connect yourself to anther person or animal and rapidly boost your own connection to the aether, burn through spells quickly, but channel all the outcomes of the 'training' on the connected person or animal. Usually that ends... well, badly for them lets say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack recoils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A... and you expect me to do that to someone? Torture or kill them just to learn?\" He says, pulling free from her half embrace and backing away while she looks on with a mildly amused expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's easy enough to put them in perpetual bliss while it's ongoing, so certainly not torture, but no. Frankly I don't see you doing that, though it would certainly make life easier for you Master. I expect you to take either the long route, and me be stuck as your tutor for a long LONG while,\"and she grins sexily and gives you a wink, \"or you to learn to draw energy from elsewhere, only drawing such as you need, limiting the flow going through you to minimize the drain on yourself. It'll take longer to set up, and the training to do that is not easy, but once you have that down you should manage it. Technically even that could draw energy from another person... or even from a strongly emotional act... like, oh I don't know, sex.\" She says with an impish grin. \"But given you've already said you don't like the idea of draining someone during sex I hardly thought you'd agree to that. Connecting to a powerful leyline, a waterfall, a volcano or other powerful source would do. But there you do have to be careful. It's tricky sometimes to channel just the right amount of energy. Hence the extra time to learn the channel ability.\" She chuckled. \"Frankly, the easiest way to learn that is to channel through sex. To just feel the tiny amounts of power running through the other, to watch the eddies and currents of power and emotion and feel the interplay. It doesn't cost anything, feels fantastic, and you learn something important as a side benefit. Win win really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnless she's trying to trick you into doing that to accidentally drain someone... Jack sighs. No, can't just assume everything she says is evil. I mean, she really hasn't given any sign of that... apart from admitting that she can drain people during sex, just that she doesn't need to. Well, he doesn't think she's said anything inherently evil? Has she? His head is getting pretty muddled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously you're confused Master. Yes, this is a lot to take in at once.\" She lays a hand on his shoulder in a more friendly manner. \"So, would you like me to explain any more of this or would you like some first hand experience?\"</span></div></div>",

I hope I can get to teach you... hands on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, getting back on subject. As I was saying you can shapeshift into anything, but how long can you stay that way, and you said you have to know the shape? How easy is it to learn a shape?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can stay in any form for as long as I wish, and stay that way even if asleep. As to it's ease? Connected to you?\" Lilith said, while walking back over to the door she opened it and stepped out, Jack having to remind himself that no-one could see her, even if they were passing by the corridor. \"Very easy. Anything you know well, I know well, and so...\" She walks away, still talking as she went out of sight. \"Your mom, your dad, little Sam....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack starts walking over when Lilith doesn't come back. This is getting weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and Jenny. All really easy.\" She says, and Jack sees not Lilith, but Jenny walking back with the same sly grin. \"You DO like your sister don't you Jack?\" She said, sliding a hand down her side and arching her back, thrusting Jenny's breasts out of that tightly confining T-shirt. No. It's Lilith... Lilith's breasts, not his sister's! He had to remember this wasn't his sister!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilith! Look cut it out! You looking like my sister is just... wrong, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" She said, shutting the door and calmly striding up to him, gently stroking the back of her hand across his cheek. \"Don't you like me Jack?\" She said, in just the tone of voice Jenny would use. \"I mean, there IS a lot to like, isn't there?\" She said, staring down at her own chest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was ridiculous! Partly he was worried that Lilith was attempting to get him into some kind of succubus trick to drain him (no matter what she said), and part... well this looked like his sister for heaven's sake! Then he blinked. It <i>looked</i> like his sister, but wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas he really considering it?

Cut it out!\" Jack said, the imagery of him being with his sister still whirling in his head. He began backing away, but 'Jenny' kept pace with him, right up till Jack found himself backing up against the wall with nowhere to go. The image of his sister's face grinned as she found she'd cornered her prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, just being with you is sooooo tempting, and it's so hot in here!\" and as Jack gaped she slowly peeled up the bottom of her T-shirt before pulling it off her head and tossing it to the other side of the room, leaving him staring at her bra, tightly constraining the two bouncing beauties within less than a foot from Jack's face. \"Reeeeally hot.\" and her black pleated skirt followed, sliding down those shimmying thighs to be stepped out of as his sister pushed up against him in her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith! NOT his sister!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooh shit.\" Jack muttered, then his eyes went wide as a deft hand slid into both his trousers and boxers, grasping the shaft there firmly and finding it very hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, you obviously are ready for it Jack. Come on, give your sister a little tender lovin. Show me how much you care!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This... is just... wrong.\" Jack said weakly, but didn't move to pull her hand out from his boxers. He moaned and closed his eyes as her hand began to rhythmically slide up and down, squeezing delightfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Jenny' leaned in, and he could feel her breath on his cheek despite closed eyes as she whispered in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Jack. I don't bite, unless you order me to. I'm your slave remember? Think of this as a lesson in learning the book, and the arts needed to channel the energy within. This will be sooooo enjoyable. Just relax and let your sister play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of his sister Jack did open his eyes, the thought just too weird tooo... He blinked. Despite having one hand down his pants 'Jenny' had managed to remove her bra and panties, and was now completely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gulped, even as Je... Lilith's other hand undid his trousers and began to slide them and his boxers down around his ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sister was taller than he was, so he wasn't exactly looking down much to gaze at those wonderful breasts as they pressed against his chest, then rubbed up a little and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith stood on tiptoe, pulled his shaft towards her, then settled, him feeling both her thighs on either side of his legs and her steaming hot cleft envelop his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hhhhhhhhhhrrrrr!\" Jack managed inarticulately as the moist flesh oozed down around him, squeezing tightly and settling with a wet squelch against his groin, the heat permeating into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jack, you're so big!\" Je... Lilith giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith was a sex demon, a succubi that considered sex with anyone (and possibly anything) as natural as breathing apparently, and he was here being forced to have sex like one of his darkest fantasies. Yes, with his sister, and he hadn't really thought of that one, but... this was just damned! Good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck it!\" He gasped, his hands fastening to her hips and leaning in to kiss her. She tasted of cherry slightly. Damned Lilith was good, copying even Jenny's lipstick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could even begin to move Lilith kissed back with a vengeance, her tongue diving in to his mouth even as her legs wrapped around him, pushing the two of them away from the wall, stumbling a little, shortly before she began to bounce fiercely on him, the liquid squeezing as her sex rode his rod was just incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rode him like a stallion, bucking and pounding, but never hard enough to bruise thank god, but so exquisitely. She moved just right, changing angle as she pumped to increase the tension, and he wondered if he was supposed to be taking notes. The thought forced a laugh from his lips, in between gasps of pleasure, but Lilith didn't inquire what it was about and instead just continued fucking him hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long and he felt it as he shuddered, spasming into Lilith, and moments later she did too, her thighs gripping his body tightly as she arched her back and moaned loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gnnnn! Ak, Qu... quiet Lilith!\" He gasped as the world seemed red tinged and he twitched uncontrollably. \"You d... don't want to wake Jenny!\" He said, looking at the left wall bordering on Jenny's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith sighed languidly as she shuddered, leaning in and giving Jack another kiss for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, she's not over there, and she's only just now passed out so I wouldn't worry, though it's a light snooze. Keep this up and she'll be awake and horny again in moments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment what Lilith was saying didn't connect, but then suddenly he went stiff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" He said, seeing Lilith, with Jenny's face, grinning down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, these hang ups you have of not having sex with anyone you want to is just too much. I decided to force the issue, literally.\" She said, her hands sliding down, framing her breasts and moaning. \"Jenny really enjoyed it. I didn't let her get all the conversation, but enough. And she totally thinks this was all her idea. I did kind of amp up her feelings when she came though and she thinks that sex was so good she passed out from it. Wanted her out of it a bit after that orgasm so we could chat without anyone listening in.\" She paused, frowning at Jack's horrified, and still confused looking face. \"In case you didn't get it Jack, I didn't shape shift, I possessed Jenny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.... You... we.....\" He stammered, staring down at... Jenny's body, with her sex still impaled on his shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. You just gave your sister the time of her life, and trust me, it was <i>way</i> better than her previous boyfriend. Though I admit my helping her along did contribute. You... are enthusiastic, but have a lot to learn about the act of love. All part of the tuition my Master.

But next time you might want to rethink how you order someone that is bound to do what you request to the letter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he can register what she said a fog in the shape of Lilith pulled back out of his naked sister and floated out through the closed door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmm! Jacky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's eyes went wide as what Lilith had said registered, and he realized that now his sister was sitting on him, His back against the wall once more, her thighs shifting... incredibly on him! Oh fuck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny snuggled against his chest for a moment, then pulled back, looking lovingly into his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jack, that was... utterly incredible!\" Then she paused, probably seeing the strain in his eyes. \"You... don't regret it do you?\" She said, a familiar puppy dog look coming to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe almost said. \"It wasn't you, it was the succubus.\" but rationality stopped him before he made a fool of himself. Jenny thought it had been herself. Did that mean that sometime or other she'd had a fantasy of sleeping with him before? Or could Lilith twist people's minds that easily?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Jack. I know this is weird, and please tell me you're not gonna run to mom about this, but... I just needed it.\" She chuckled. \"Didn't expect you'd be so much better than Billy though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this he frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You broke up with your boyfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>He</i> broke up... Long story short? One word. 'Cheerleader'.\" She stuck her tongue out making a face of disgust. Then she chuckled and emphasized the expression by squeezing her sex down there on him and he moaned. \"Still, his loss, your gain.\" Then her smile faltered once more. \"You... don't mind? Do you? Look, I knew you liked me.\" That was news to Jack! \"I caught you staring at my ass a few times. Though I admit the first time I did feel kind of insulted. But, well, it's kind of a compliment, right? If even your own brother thinks you're hot then you can't be all bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes were still staring up at him, with a mixture of tension and hope in them. She still wanted an answer. Was he alright with this? What if this 'spell' on Jenny ended and she turned to normal and hated him for this? But... she forced herself on him, not the other way around. Not that it seemed like this was anything except the real Jenny right here right now. Before he could tell by the attitude more than anything that Lilith was in her. This isn't that for certain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack? Please? Tell me you don't mind. Tell me you liked it too.\" She said imploringly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><span style=\"line-height:1.4;\"><br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack pauses before answering Lilith's question, as a thought has occurred, and the muddled feeling seems to dissipate rapidly as he puts voice to this thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Before we go any farther, why exactly are you bound to the book, and how did it come about?\" Jack asks, his dazed feeling fleeing as Lilith's friendly countenance seems to still, and she slowly retracts her hand and walks away from Jack. Finally stopping at his closet door, looking at the small mirror attached to the door, before taking a loud breath and turning around to stare at Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Would you believe you're the first person to ask me those questions since the original binder set me to my task? For centuries, I've honestly wondered if anyone would bother asking, and now, after all this time, you do? Well, I guess a long story can be shortened,\" Lilith answers, and as she snaps her fingers, a plush chair appears behind her, and she falls into it, looking tired as she prepares to give her story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"The shortest way to state how this all started would be to explain how demons were created. I don't know how the first demon for your realm was created, but your plane of existence didn't naturally have demons or other supernatural creatures until we were summoned and in some cases pulled, across dimensions to here. Those who had been summoned, and were not bound, had the ability to be banished, and sent back, but those yanked across multiple dimensions, were effectively stranded.\" Lilith explains, her voice sounding slightly sad, causing Jack to realize this history lesson could be painful for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just as Jack is considering telling Lilith she doesn't have to continue, she bursts into a random fit of laughter. Confused, Jack looks at Lilith with some concern. Seeing this, Lilith stifles her laugh, and catches her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Sorry Master, I was just remembering the given reason so many were yanked across the realms. 'I was bored and wanted a touch of home' was what the originator of the supernatural had said in your world. You see, he had been apparently displaced by his dimension for unspeakable acts, but sadly had found a way to prevent the denizens of that realm from killing him.\" Lilith explains, all mirth draining from her voice as she begins to continue the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"In any case, those stuck here, had to find ways to survive, and the variation of species did not help any to blend in. In a sad and cruel sense, your history books on myths and legends is more accurate about the creatures that couldn't hide, as occasionally the first 'warlock' decided he wanted entertainment, and pointed the locals at whoever struck his fancy. I digress Master, in short, Demons of all sorts were one of the things summoned to your realm, and as part of the bargain, 'Hell' was crafted over time, but until then, most demons needed a source to draw from, and unfortunately, the only one to work with was the 'Warlock'.\" As she finishes speaking for the moment, a look of utter rage crosses Lilith's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Deciding to let Lilith continue at her own pace, Jack stays silent, mulling over what she has explained so far. Minutes later, Lilith regains her composure, and sees Jack pondering, waiting a handful of minutes, she then snaps her fingers to regain his attention. Once seeing she has it, Lilith continues on with her tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"While demons are usually known for skills at manipulating deals, it also depends on their domain. For example, a pride demon isn't the best choice to be a lawyer, as their pride could get in the way, and they wont admit if they miss something either in the contract or case. A similar issue would be not to have a sloth domain demon be a lookout in the army, as they might not even pay attention to their job. Sadly, this ties into the fact that some of us demons were bargained away to be bound to the 'Warlock's' Books. One demon of each domain, as well as books that hold some of the original displaced summons. At the last i had heard, many books had been destroyed, or hidden away, to stop the possible abuse of some of those beings.\" Lilith says, pausing yet again, as if deep in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just as Jack was feeling he should move over towards her to try to give comfort, or at least some sign of condolence, Lilith speaks up, in a weary voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"So now that you have heard this Master, the simple answer is that I was one of the displaced Demons summoned, as well as some of my friends and siblings from the other domains. As to how it came to be, sadly, some of the Avarice demons decided to sell the succubi and others into slavery, to get a 'better deal' out of the 'Warlock'.\" Lilith finishes, and in doing so, seems to pull her legs up onto the chair, and hug her knees close to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After a few long moments, Jack moves slowly and carefully towards Lilith, and after getting to within a few feet of her, kneels down and places a hand gently on her shoulder, causing her head to snap up and look him directly in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Is there any way to free you from the book, or any way I can help you?\" Jack asks, voice full of compassion and sympathy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Long moments drag on, before Lilith responds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Not unless we find a few of the other tomes the 'Warlock' created, and find a ritual to help with unbinding in that case. Their are powerful spells layered on the book, that could theoretically free me, but at the cost of someone else. I hate to admit it, but I've used them on occasion with exceptionally stupid and cruel masters, but those spells only let me assume their life for their natural lifespan. Lucky for you, your more honest and less morally bankrupt than those that I've tricked before.\" Upon finishing that sentence, Lilith quickly moves her head close to Jacks face, and latches her lips to his in a gentle, yet passion filled kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Breaking it moments later, Lilith smiles gently, before slowly unfolding herself, then standing up and stretches, doing interesting things to her body, and breaking the tender moment that had formed. Dazedly, distracted by the ...possibly unknowing show (one never does know with a succubus), Jack clambers to his feet, standing up and admiring Lilith's form, before shaking his head and refocuses on the current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"So pretty much, the only way to currently help you, is to either let you take over my life, or we go on a 'quest' to find the books that might be able to help. Huh, well, I honestly didn't expect my life to change so much when researching for a history paper,\" Jack says, trying to lighten the mood with a simple joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Chuckling at the poor attempt of levity, Lilith nods in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, I honestly don't mind sharing my life with you Lilith, since we are bound, though I would also like to help you regain your own life as well. So at the moment, all I can suggest is to take one day at a time, and while searching for the books, have some fun, and hopefully I learn some cool stuff along the way,\" Jack finishes, and suddenly finds himself fully embraced by Lilith, who seems to be trying to mold her body to his. Shocked, Jack's mouth opens in surprise, and is suddenly covered by Lilith's, who seems to be trying to express herself with a toe curling, soul searing kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just as Jack feels he might pass out from lack of oxygen, Lilith releases her hold on his mouth, and adjusts her head back a bit, so she can look him in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"You honestly are the most decent Master I've come across, ever! As to the sharing of your life, that is a simple enough thing, and we can work that out later. The book finding will be harder, but we shouldn't try to start until you gain a grasp on your powers. To start working on that, you need to gain some energy like I explained earlier. Their are alternatives, but those all depend on you, as your choices direct the speed and course of your learning Master,\" Lilith explains, sounding happier than Jack has heard her since his accidental summoning of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Can you explain any other alternatives to learning, or maybe suggest some ways that will be safer and unlikely to have me accidentally drain a person to death?\" Jack asks, getting back on task, even if his libido was screaming at him to do other things with this sexy woman plastered to his front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Smiling, Lilith slowly disengages herself from Jack, and chortles lowly as she hears Jack's failed attempt at stifling his groan. \"Yes, some alternatives can be ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

How can I make it up to you?\u201d she said with lust in her eyes as she slowly stood, causing a delightful jiggle in her chest, and moved slowly in his direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack quickly backed up to the door and closed Lilith inside, his heart beating quickly with excitement.  \u201cDamn she\u2019s hot!\u201d Jack whispered to himself as he tried to collect his thoughts.  He quickly descended the stairs and, upon doing so, headed hurriedly for the door that led outside.  \u201cWhere are you going in such a hurry, Jack?\u201d his mother Christine says as Jack pulls the door open.  \u201cOh yeah mom gotta make a run to the bookstore for more research stuff bye,\u201d Jack quickly blurted out as he closed the door.  \u201cBut you forgot your coat\u2026.\u201d Christine replied confused, but her son was already out the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stepped quickly into the crisp evening air as the sky began to darken.  A slight breeze blew through the trees and gave Jack the shivers, but he was too busy to pay attention to that.  \u201cSo shapeshifting is ability number one,\u201d Jack said to himself as he walked hurriedly down the street away from his house.  \u201cWhat the hell else can she do?\u201d he pondered to himself.  \u201c\u2019anything to do with sex\u2019 is what she said\u2026.can she make me really sexy?\u201d Jack wondered, \u201ccan she teach me every sex move in the book?\u201d Jack thought.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what did she mean by \u2018control people\u2019? Can she just tell them what do or\u2026..like jump inside them almost?  Can she jump inside ME?\u201d Jack asked himself as the fear intensified and his steps quickened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack rounded a corner, he ran head-on into someone because, needless to say, he wasn\u2019t really paying attention.  The figure staggered back a bit, catching Jack by surprise too.  \u201cSorry,\u201d Jack said as the woman he\u2019d collided with bent down to pick up the groceries that she\u2019d dropped.  Jack bent down to help her, and then she looked up at him.  \u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d the woman said, and Jack quickly recognized her.  It was Cheryl Kelner, the mayor\u2019s wife; Jack\u2019s family had known the Kelners for years.  They\u2019d see each other at city functions that often involved Mayor Richard Kelner\u2019s thanking Jack\u2019s father for his business\u2019s contribution to the city.  Jack had grown up playing with the Kelner children from time to time.  Cheryle Kelner was a woman of about 55 with a rather plump figure and always a ton of jewelry.  Today, her long blonde hair dangled down from her head as her coat covered a rather rotund waste and a sagging bust line.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack helped the lady with her groceries as he apologized.  \u201cSorry, Mrs. Kelner; I guess I wasn\u2019t paying attention.\u201d  As he looked into the woman\u2019s eyes, something happened.  Her expression slackened for a moment, almost as though she had been hypnotized.  As Jacked looked into her eyes, he noted thin but bright clouds of red filling them for a couple seconds.  Mrs. Kelner then shook her head, as though coming out of a daze.  \u201cThat\u2019s quite all right Jack,\u201d she said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelner then did the oddest thing.  She tilted her head, reached out, and put her hands on Jack\u2019s arms, \u201cSay, Jack, have you been working out?\u201d she asked as she felt his biceps, a smile creeping across her face.  Jack was taken aback and staggered back quickly in surprise as he quickly handed the woman her groceries.  \u201cWell, Mrs. Kelner, I\u2019ve got to be going,\u201d he said as he turned and jogged away, thinking something was definitely very wrong.  \u201cCal me Cheryl honey,\u201d she said as he scampered off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas she coming on to me?\u201d Jack asked himself as he continued his frantic walk to nowhere in particular, \u201cwas the fifty-something lady I\u2019ve known my whole life coming on to me? This is getting weird!\u201d  Jack continued on, his head now darting to and fro in a kind of panic as he surveyed the area for old ladies who might try to jump him at any moment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack spotted a nearby coffee shop, one that seemed quite appealing to him as the cold was really starting to get to him now.  He stood and waited for the light to turn so that he could safely cross the street to the warmth of the establishment.  \u201cExcuse me,\u201d came a voice from behind Jack, along with a polite tap on the shoulder.  Jack instinctively turned around and looked slightly down.  What he saw was Mary Hawkins, a young woman of about 17.  She and Jack attended church together, but Mary was one of those uber-religious young girls who saved herself for her would-be husband and attended every Sunday School class offered.  She helped organize kids\u2019 activities and even volunteered with the soup kitchen every other week.  Mary was also quite pretty, always wearing bright red lipstick and a big smile.  She had a slim figure adorned always with a cross necklace.  Her dark hair blew wildly in the cold breeze as she hugged her coat close to her\u2014hanging over a fairly large set of breasts and an ass that would make any man want her.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jack,\u201d she began, but do you happen to know the tim\u2026.\u201d she asked, and suddenly her voice trailed off.  Jack looked into her eyes, seeing again a red glow as it enveloped them for a couple seconds.  Mary then shook her head as if fighting off sleep of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJack, have I told you how handsome you are?\u201d Mary asked as she reached up and caressed his face.  \u201cHoly hell not again!\u201d Jack said as the light suddenly changed and he ran across the street to the safety of the coffee shop, leaving Mary cold and disappointed on the corner.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack ran into the coffee shot and sat down quickly, as a soldier coming in from a cold night\u2019s patrol.  He took a seat in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.\tJacks\u2019 cell phone rings, and it\u2019s his mother wondering why he was in such a hurry.<br>\r\n2.\tPoof!

Forcing himself to calm down, Jack took out his phone from his pants pocket, and looked at the caller I.D., which read 'Mom'. Confused as to why she would be calling at this time, as she looked like she was getting ready for bed. Deciding to answer, Jack pushes the accept button, and pulls the phone up to his ear, uttering a quick hello as an indication that he had answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Jack, why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend, and that you had invited her over? Did you run out of the house to pick up something as a surprise for her?\" Christine Thompson asked quickly, excitement and curiosity laced in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Uhh...\" Jack responded 'intelligently', trying to figure out what his mother could be talking about, when his mind finally caught up after thinking over his night. 'Did Lilith introduce herself as my girlfriend, and if so why? Damn, this would be easier to answer if I had any clue what story Lilith has already told mom,' Jack ponders, hearing a sigh emanate from his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Are you that embarrassed of me, or your family that you hid your girlfriend from us? What have we done that would cause you to act this way Jack,\" Christine questions, sounding hurt and defensive while digging to find out the cause of this 'hidden information'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Sighing, Jack decides to wing it, as there is no way he could make a proper excuse without knowing exactly what Lilith had said so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"No mom, I'm not embarrassed by you, nor the whole family, as to having a girlfriend, I just met her today, and she asked me out of the blue for a date for tomorrow. I ran out of the house earlier because I needed another book for my homework, but also to check on a nice gift to possibly give her on the date if it goes well,\" Jack reassures, hoping that his lie is acceptable enough for his mother to believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Why didn't you mention it earlier when you got home honey? I would have loved to hear about your plans for the date, as well as possibly give you some advice if you needed some. Whatever the case, you should get back soon, as she seemed insistant on waiting for you for some reason, so I let her wait in your room for the moment. Hurry home, as it's rude to keep a lovely young woman like that waiting!\" Christine finishes, her tone shifting from light cooing, to gentle teasing, then to a stern 'suggestion' that hinted at Jack returning promptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"I'll try to finish up my errand her quickly Mom, but don't wait up for me, and don't worry about my guest, I'll make sure to drive her home before locking up and heading to bed,\" Jack replies, hoping he can end the conversation and figure out what Lilith's reason for claiming to be his girlfriend was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Alright, be careful on your way back Jack, there have been a lot of random muggings being reported as of late in the papers.\" Christine finishes, saying one last farewell before disconnecting the call. Sighing, Jack closes down the status windows that informed him of the details about his call, and then checked the time, which read 10:45 pm. 'Well damn, I can't spend too much longer, or mom will ignore my suggestion about not waiting up for me....I still don't know what Lilith is up to!' Jack silently monologues, trying to work his way through his current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Why Master, it's almost as if you forget that magic can easily solve your current issues, either by altering your mother's memory, or playing along, and having a reasonable excuse for me being around if someone happens to see me accidentally,\" says a voice across from Jack, who upon hearing such, looks up, then jolts his seat back, nearly bumping into the, luckily, empty table behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Breathing deeply to slow his racing heart, and get himself under some measure of control, Jack slowly moves his chair back to it's previous place, resting in his seat while looking at Lilith, who has an 'innocent' smile gracing her face, an eyebrow slightly raised to add to the image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"How exactly are you here, when you clearly introduced yourself to my mother not five minutes ago as my girlfriend? On that topic, what exactly is the deal with that?\" Jack asks quietly, trying not to draw attention to himself any more than he already had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"As I mentioned before Master, it was to lay out the option of possibly having an excuse for why I'm seen around you or your house in the very slim chance someone discovers us in the middle of something, whether it be magic or such. Before you ask why I mentioned altering your mother's memories while also laying a possible cover story, the easiest answer is that such alterations can be dangerous depending on how they're applied.\"Lilith explains at a normal volume, simply waving her hand and a transparent bubble forming around their table. Looking around, Jack sees that none of the other people around seem to notice the bubble, nor seem to be paying attention to their table anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Replaying Lilith's response quickly in his mind, Jack pauses, before inquiring more. \"What exactly do you mean that such alterations can be dangerous, if you are the one suggesting them? Not only that, while I accept that you are real, as the call from my mother shows that I'm not having a mental breakdown, that doesn't mean I wish to delve into such possible madness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Sighing upon hearing Jacks response, Lilith looks off to the side, before turning back to stare Jack in the eye, her body language screaming \"pay attention\".\" I'll answer the important question first Master, and that is the question that you didn't ask, 'Why you should learn the magic you've stumbled upon?'. Quite simply, your entrance into the realm of magic will have made a ripple, one that many will have felt and possibly tempt a few into hunting out the source, either in curiosity, or for more sinister purposes. It is your choice to ignore your new powers, but to do so will put not only yourself at risk, but also your family and friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hearing such information from a serious Lilith, which completely contrasted from her teasing seductive antics of their first meeting, made her message hit Jack harder than any other method could have.<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lilith had apparently decided to give Jack a few minutes to gather himself, as she had stood up, and moved up to the counter, ordering a drink while flirting with the barista running the register. Said barista took the order calmly, while politely deflecting Lilith's teasing, until Lilith decided to get a real reaction. Leaning in, Lilith whispers something, resulting in said  barista's face turning atomic red, as well as her rushing off, remarking on getting her order personally. With a chuckle, Lilith returns to the table, seeing Jack more calm and ready to continue their discussion. Waving a hand over the table to add the barista being able to find the table, Lilith returns to her seat, ready to continue the impromptu Q and A for Jack.<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Now that you've collected yourself Master, and understand the reality of your situation, I'll answer your question about mind altering. In simple, think of it as slight damage to an area of the brain, that heals over time, but with either a set bit of information implanted, or guidlines that cause less damage. Multiple alterations on the same subject also affect the same region of the brain, hence it being easier to have a general 'guide' for the alteration, instead of having to make multiple castings and possibly end up with a vegitable instead of the person you were trying to affect. In this case, like I mentioned earlier, on the off chance your mother, or someone that talks to her sees me while something odd is going on, they can be 'guided' to either ignore it, or make up their own memory of what they could possibly explain away.\" Lilith explains, only pausing half way through to accept her drink from the barista, who also slips a piece of paper with writing on it to Lilith, blushing heavily while doing so. After the drink was delivered, the barista quickly walked back to behind the counter, busying herself while occasionally stealing glances at Lilith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Ok, I apologize for not comprehending the full scope of my situation, but I also think warning me first, instead of seducing me would have helped in acclimatizing to this better. On that note, thank you for being thoughtful enough to lay the ground work Lilith,\" Jack says after a moment of thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Not a problem Master, but I also think you are wrong about how I should have approached this subject, as the first thought you would have had would likely be panic, if not outright feinting, followed by many hours of probable arguing back and forth about the veracity of my statements. The only reason, aside from it being in my nature, to attempt to seduce you, was to try to flood your body with pleasure and calmness, then break the news to you gently, while also trying to possibly get you a jumpstart on your new magical education. Sadly, that plan did not pan out.\" Lilith responds, ending with a shrug that said \"what can you do\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Contemplating Lilith's explanation, Jack can't argue that there would be a likely chance for him to panic, if not outright feint from such news, especially moments after finding out he accidentally summoned a Lust Demon. Sighing, Jack decided to get Lilith's opinion, as she seemed to have a better grasp on the situation that he did currently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"So what should we do from here, Lilith?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, we can go back to your house, as your mother suggested. We could also start one of your first lessons here in this shop, or we could take a walk, and talk a bit more about what you need to know. The decision rests with you on this Master, as I'm merely a guide for you...unless you wish to trade spots,\" Lilith says after a brief moments pause, her last comment causing a smirk to form on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Shaking his head, Jack decides...<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

Course decided, Jack speaks up about said decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"As long as we can get back home soon enough that Mom wont get angry, or you help with a suitable excuse, I think taking your first lesson is what we'll do Lilith,\" Jack says, and upon seeing the grin form on Lilith's face, wonders if it's too late to change his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"How unexpected of you Master, but also pleasantly surprising. The few previous Masters that had been in similar straights to you tried to put off their first lessons and instead either worry, or distract themselves. Regardless, your first lesson comes in the form of a few steps that make up the whole of the lesson. First, in a few minutes, you get to go talk to that pretty barista behind the counter, and try to get her phone number, but as an added challenge, you need to do so within fifteen minutes of starting. If you succeed, and find the reason behind this step, we'll move on.\"Lilith responds, sounding amused, before shifting towards a slightly more serious tone, indicating that Jack needed to pay attention to the first task listed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nodding his head, Jack is about to ask for advice, when he realizes that Lilith would likely either tease him, or flat-out deny him as she had stated that he was supposed to figure out what the first reason of this task was. Taking a breath to get his focus, Jack gives a final nod to Lilith, and rises from his seat, moving towards the counter and observing his 'target'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The barista, who currently was in the process of wiping down the machines and counter-space around her, was very attractive in Jack's opinion, especially as her uniform was form fitting, showing off a tight body, with a decent C-sized bust. Further inspection showed that her hair was black from what he could tell, but for some reason pulled up and hidden under a hat, making Jack wonder why, as the other times he had been in this shop, he had seen no other employee wear one. Shaking off the random observation, Jack comes upon the counter, and sees the barista stop in her cleaning, and come over, presumably to take his order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Hi, what can I get you today?\" said the barista in a pleasant and polite voice, though it sounded also slightly bored, most likely from the millions of times of having to say it since starting her job there.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Deciding to start off jokingly Jack quips,\"Well, I doubt that your on the menu, nor a date, but I'm not much of a coffee drinker, what would you suggest?\" Taking a moment to sneak a peek, Jack finally gets a name off her tag, Lacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His words at first earn a frown and low hiss escaping her lips followed by a near silent sigh, Lacy controls herself, and plasters a fake smile back on her face, taking a moment to decide on a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, many of our patrons enjoy the caramel macchiato, or the Oreo frappe deluxe, but for those that don't want too much caffeine, we do have a selection of teas as well.\"Lacy replies, her tone still polite, but losing the pleasant tone, and sounding slightly strained, as if annoyed with his opening flirt attempt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking a moment, to both decide on a drink, as well as buy time to figure out a new approach, Jack gets a sense of something different, like a type of scent that is out of place, but he couldn't place where it was coming from. Realizing that he's taking too long, Jack decides to order a herbal tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Alright, if that's all you are ordering, I'll make it for you and bring it to your table.\" Is the response Jack receives, getting the feeling that Lacy wants him to leave post-haste. Getting the hint, and not wanting to upset her, Jack turns around, noticing that the strange scent from before is slowly disappearing from his senses as he moves towards the table. Reaching the table, Jack sits down without saying a word, lost in thought about the nagging feeling that the scent was important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, that seemed to have been a crash and burn outcome Master, though you do still have ten minutes left to get her number. On that note, anything you wish to voice, whether opinions or questions?\" Lilith says, drawing Jack out of his introspection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Yeah, I noticed that she seemed completely Ok with me up until my opening attempt, and then after that she seemed to be...'politely hateful?' if that makes any sense. Also, it will sound odd, but I could swear that she was emanating an unnatural smell, but the thing is, I can't place it. All I know is I get the feeling that it's not normal.\" Jack responds, rambling his thoughts on the matter, and noticing that as he continues talking, Lilith begins to smile, it growing to a beaming smile of approval as Jack finishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well done Master, you've at least gotten some idea of the goal, even if you do not realize it yet. At this point, we'll change tracks after I explain the reason behind your first task. As a budding caster, you'll be able to sense magic in other objects, and in this case, people. Sometimes you'll get a smell, you'll see a distortion, possibly 'hear' something, but whatever tips you off, is your magic giving you a sign that something is off. In this case, your magic helped you gather that an enchantment was placed on Lacy, and the smell was my brand of magic in place, the smell of brimstone from my level of hell, not as repugnant as the others, but with the added effect of a minor aphrodisiac when applied correctly, but i digress.\"Lilith explains, sounding pleased that Jack had succeeded in part of his task, though she had doubted he would get Lacy's number, as she was currently under the effects of a low-level enthrallment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Ok, so now that that part is done, do I still need to obtain her phone number, or are we moving on to the next part of the lesson?\"Jack asks, anticipation and minor guilt filling his voice. While Lacy was attractive, Jack didn't want to bug an obviously annoyed woman who probably got hit on all the time at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, we can move onto the next part of the lesson Master, though it is a shame you don't want to try harder for Lacy's number, as she has some interesting secrets hidden in that mind of hers. Anyways, the next part of your lesson will be to find the magic in yourself, and find its source, where it emanates and flows from. Once you've got that step, we'll move onto the last part of the lesson, which will be very fun if done right.\" Lilith replies, a smirk forming after mentioning the last part of the lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Sound's easy enough,' was Jack's first thought, but after only a few minutes, the smell of 'brimstone' fills Jack's nose, and breaks his concentration. Opening his eyes, and expecting to see Lacy placing his cup down, Jack is surprised, as instead, the cup of tea is before him, but Lacy did not go back to behind the counter to work. Instead, Lacy was sitting in Lilith's lap, lips locked in a passionate kiss, both moving their hands all over each other, occasionally lightly pinching or scraping their nails, eliciting low moans and sighs of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seeing this, Jack becomes hard instantly, feeling extremely uncomfortable, yet highly aroused at the sight before him. Staring at the two, who seem so engrossed in each other, Jack is startled by a voice emanating from within his head. [You need to get back on finding your magic master, otherwise you wont be able to move onto the next step.] Comes the voice of Lilith, shocking Jack and causing him to tear his gaze away from the engaged pair before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Breathing deeply, and trying to ignore Lacy's additional scent, Jack focuses deeply, trying to find the source. Long minutes go by, and the sounds of pleasure coming from Lilith and Lacy distract Jack, even if it is momentarily, slowing down his searching. Finally, after what felt like hours, Jack finds the source, and is somehow surprised that its located just above his pelvis. 'Why am I surprised, my domains are sex and love....though maybe I'm just stereotyping? I'll ask Lilith later if that's a normal place or something connected to my situation.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feeling like he shouldn't interrupt, and also wanting to see if it was a two way ability, Jack tried to project his thoughts at Lilith.<br>\r\n[Hey, sorry to interrupt, but I found my source/core/magic, whatever label were supposed to call it, now what?!] Jack mentally shouts, and receives a glare from Lilith, who turns her head slightly enough to get one eye focused on Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[Congratulations Master, but next time you wish to experiment with thought projection, try not to shout at max volume, as you'll either end up drawing attention to yourself from those who can listen, or annoy the person your targeting. In any case, your next lesson will be a more hands on approach, with a reward at the end. Just follow me in a moment to start the lesson.] Upon finishing her mental projection, Lilith stands up, and after adjusting her hands to hold Lacy's ass, Lacy locks her legs around Lilith's waist, grinding her crotch against Lilith's. Finally content with their hand-holds, Lilith walks off towards a door marked \"Employees Only\", not bothering to slow down or halt her ministrations on Lacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Watching the actions of the two, Jack feels that any more arousal gained by him will cause him to burst, so quickly tries to find a way to calm down. Long minutes go by before Jack feels enough control over himself, as well as the hardness of his member softening to a manageable stiffness, Jack stands and begins to walk towards the doors to follow after Lilith and Lacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Crossing the doorway, Jacks vision suddenly blurs, his last sight of Lilith smiling wickedly...<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><span style=\"line-height:1.4;\">\u00a0\u00a0Jack comes to, his vision slowly forming into some form his brain can interpret, but none of the sights seeming familiar. Looking around and noticing the room is dimly lit, Jack sees shelves with boxes on them, as well as boxes lining the wall that don't have shelves, as well as a door at the other end of the room, angling off to the side. Seeing no one around at the moment, Jack tries to figure out why he blacked out, when suddenly a spike of heat floods his body, surging from his crotch and washing over the rest of him from there. Surprised by the sudden feeling, Jack looks down, and is surprised by seeing breasts and a knee-length skirt adorning his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Wondering if he's hallucinating or dreaming, Jack slowly moves one of his new feminine fingers towards his breasts, and gently pokes it. A spike in his arousal, as well as a minor jolt of pleasure, convince Jack that he's not dreaming or hallucinating, but somehow has ended up in a female body....one that looks familiar, but he cant place exactly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0'Well, I'm not going to figure out anything just sitting here, and for some reason I get the feeling Lilith is behind this, so I should try to search around for her at least.' Jack thinks to himself. Placing one of his hands on the wall, and feeling a shiver of pleasure from the coolness of it against his hand, Jack levers himself up to a standing position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Inspecting the room from a standing position, Jack notices the door that he assumes he originally came through, as they look like the doors he walked through before winding up in his current body. Deciding to head towards the other door he saw earlier, Jack takes a tentative step forward, realizing the hes in heels, and slowly places his weight on that foot. Finding it stable, Jack takes baby steps, trying to acclimatize himself to the new footwear adorning him, walking back and forth in short lines instead of moving towards the targeted door. Feeling that he has a general hang of walking in heels, Jack decides to slowly start off towards the door, all the while lightly rubbing his legs togther, as his crotch had started to pulse hotly while training himself to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0What feels like minutes to Jack, but is most likely seconds, as he still feels slightly uncomfortable moving too quickly in his heels, Jack reaches the door, and sees a small placard that reads -Bathroom . Office - Seeing this, Jack decides to head toward the Bathroom first, as he could possibly find Lilith there, and if not, possibly find release from his growing arousal that seems to rise slightly with every movement he makes. At first he hadn't noticed it, but after paying attention, Jack realized that the smell he had gotten from Lacy earlier was slightly different, but emanating from him now instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Trembling as another thrill of pleasure washes over him from touching the cold handle of the door, Jack opens it, and steps through into a hallway. Going left, the hallway just as dimly lit as the previous room, Jack walks towards the bathroom, the only sound he could hear being the clacking of his heels on the tile floor. Reaching his destination, Jack opens the door, and walks in, seeing a modest sized bathroom, not one that a person would expect for a business, but not as lavish and extravagant as some personal bathrooms could be either. Looking to the walls next to the door, Jack finds the light switch, and flicks it on, bathing the room in bright light, and starting up the ventilation system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Walking over to the large mirror on the wall above the sink, Jack pauses before it to take in his new appearance. Looking back from the mirror is an average height beauty, whose hair seemed to be cut to where her bangs would not fall in her eyes, and apparently a good portion of her hair was dyed blue, with the bottom two inches jet black. 'Guess that's the reason for the hat?' Jack silently muses. A small smile appears on Jack's reflection, and he continues his inspection, taking a moment to take off his shirt, exposing his stomach and bra-clad breasts to the chill air of the bathroom. Shivering, whether from the tingling sensations or the chilling Ac Jack didn't know, Jack places the shirt on a small bench directly behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Turning back around, Jack sees that Lacy was very toned, as she had barely any fat showing, and if there was any, Jack honestly couldn't find it. Deciding to explore a bit more, Jack unclipped his bra, and felt his nipples crinkle as they hit the exposed air, becoming erect and taut, not painfully, but begging for attention. Shuddering at the thought of pleasuring himself on the spot, Jack stops himself, deciding to finish his inspection first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Shivering in anticipation, Jack moves his hands to his skirts waistband, unzipping it and slowly pulls it off his hips, letting go after clearing his thighs, and letting it pool on the ground at his feet. Chilling A/C air strikes Jack's newly exposed legs and ass, as apparently he's wearing a lacy black thong. Shuddering as his arousal jumps even higher from all the teasing stimulation the chill air is causing him, Jack takes deep breaths, trying to stem the feelings of lust demanding he rip off the thong, or just go around it and plunge his fingers into his currently leaking pussy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Deciding to finish up his impromptu strip tease, Jack steps out from his skirt, and moves slightly closer to the mirror, taking a last admiring look at his new body, amazed at the sight, as well as curious what the female experience will be like. Finally ready to end his personal teasing of himself, Jack turns away from the mirror, and towards the cubicle door that leads into the handicapped stall, and bends over, hooking his thumbs into the waistband of his thong. Shivering in anticipation, Jack slowly starts to pull the thong down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0The sound of air rushing, as well as the sound of the door opening, is all the warning jack has, before he feels arms encircle him, bent over still, and apparently stuck in his current position. Trying to move his head up enough to see the reflection in the mirror, Jack is halted in his action, as he feels a stiff object slide between his legs, nestling itself flush against his nether lips. Jack's arousal skyrockets, and he nearly cums from the stimulation of that rub, only stopping himself by biting his lip sharply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"She said you would be in here like this, and so I'll play her game.\" Says Jack's captor, and a sudden chill partially douses his arousal, as the voice was that of his previous body. Shivering, and accidentally reigniting the flames of arousal and lust that had momentarily dulled, Jack was bewildered by the fact that his body was behind him, currently pinning him in place (in a compromising position no less!), rubbing itself against him slowly and steadily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[Well Mistress, here is the last part of your lesson, and it is a simple one. Your final task is to either break the enchantment on yourself, or on 'Jack', who has been enthralled to keep screwing 'Lacy' until success, or you pass out. Use what you learned earlier, and take the final advice to heart if you wish to finish your lesson without paying the penalty for failure. The final advice I can give is '<i><b>All magic is based on will and intent</b></i>'. Good luck Mistress, and if you fail....well it won't be bad, but I think you would rather not find out.] Lilith says mentally in Jack's mind, sounding amused by his current dilemma, but also giving incentive to not fail apparently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Jack ponders over Lilith's advice, momentarily ignoring his precarious position, and mulls over what it could mean. 'Well, if all magic is based on will and intent, that would mean that theoretically anything could be accomplished with magic, so in this case...' is as far as Jack's thoughts got, before he felt an increase in pace from the cock sliding against his thong covered pussy, as well as the arms encircling him moving slightly to adjust the angles of what they could reach, which in this case, was one on his upper thigh, while the other reaching up to one of his breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Shuddering at the stimulation, Jack has a mini-orgasm, juices leaking down his leg, and coating his thong, which becomes slick from the recent contribution of his juices and the pre-cum from 'Jack's' cock. Trying to regain his train of thought, Jack doesn't even make it back to where he was before he feels a gentle cupping of his breast that slowly starts to spread pleasure from fondling that begins moments later. The hand on his upper thigh starts to lightly massage the area, occasionally running fingernails lightly across the skin, causing more waves of pleasure to flood Jacks body. Feeling like he's about to explode, Jack tries one last time to get back to his previous thoughts, when 'Jack' moves his boob holding hand slightly, angling to where his fingers have enough space to gently grab the erect nipple, and slowly start to roll it left and right, garnering a loud scream from Jack, who cums loudly from all the stimulation surging through his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Jack loses the strength in his legs, and is only held up now by 'Jack' who seems to have no trouble keeping up his actions, while holding Jack in the same position as this all started at. Feeling another wave of pleasure building in his pussy, Jack knows that he has limited time before he orgasms again, and he knows that 'Jack' will soon stop with the light stuff, and move onto penetration soon. That thought sobers Jack enough that he reconnects with his previous thoughts. '...in this case, if one puts enough will power behind an intended action, and can pour power into it, magic happens? Fuck if i know but that's all i got right now,' is Jack's last coherent thought, before attempting to put it into practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Jack focuses on the steps he believes to be the key, and enacts it as he can feel himself slipping way into a lust filled daze...<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

Momentarily surprised at the minor change of circumstances, Jack realizes that he must have broken the spell on himself, as he didn't smell 'brimstone' wafting off himself anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Jack's moment of introspection is derailed as he finds himself rapidly changed from being held up and bent over with 'Jack' dry-humping his body, to being pressed forcefully against the wall, the cool tiles sending a cooling pleasant sensation over his aching overheated breasts, before the chill is added to other parts of his body being pressed against the wall. Distracted by the sudden chill and slight pleasure that washed over him, Jack didn't notice his thong being pulled down until he felt a pulsating warm object slide directly across his pussy lips, sending jolts of pleasure, and ratcheting his arousal up from its previously decaying status. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Realizing that 'Jack' is still in the process of continuing 'his' actions, Jack panics, and sends a mental plea out in hopes of a response.

Have fun] <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Fuck!\" Jack says aloud, whether from frustration at Lilith's response to his pleas, or the sense of helplessness that strikes him as he realizes that he's stuck in this situation until it resolves naturally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"If you insist <i>'Lacy'</i>,\" 'Jack' says, before slowly shifting his hips, and plunging his cock straight into Jack's wet and over-stimulated pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Fireworks go off in Jack's mind, as well as the sensation of lightning coursing through his body, writhing against the wall trying to weakly change his pinned position, whether to stop or increase the pleasure unknown to himself. Upon entry 'Jack's' thrust rips a loud pleasure filled scream from Jack, and 'Jack' pushes on till burying 'himself' to the hilt, not moving an inch or teasing Jack's body, simply waiting for Jack to come down off his orgasmic high. Moments of the scream pass before it dies down, the only sounds in the room now a low moan, as well as the heavy breathing of the two highly aroused occupants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Feeling enough time had passed to let Jack adjust, 'Jack' started to slowly retract 'himself' until only the tip remained inside, causing loud moans the whole way, then slowly pushing in, eliciting even louder moans until bottoming out yet again. Repeating this process over and over, garnering a near unending symphony of grunts and moans from Jack, who at this point is getting frustrated with no new release. Finally having enough of this teasing, and giving into his monumental torrent of Lust that surges throughout his body, Jack gives into his bodies desires, breaking down any last hints of resistance he held to the idea of being fucked by his previous body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Fuck me! Enough with this torturous teasing, Fuck me now!\" Jack shouts, trying to use what little leverage he has to thrust back to meet 'Jack's' slow continuous thrusts. Upon stating these words, 'Jack' pauses on his outward draw, and (unseen by Jack) grins wickedly, before preparing 'himself' to do just that, while also slightly amused by the small amount of movement Jack accomplishes on 'his' tool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Feeling 'Jack' stop causes Jack to whine until midway through the sound, it morphs into a scream of pleasure, as 'Jack' suddenly thrusts into Jack roughly, and pulls out faster than before, slowly increasing 'his' pace on each motion, until the room is filled with new sounds of loud screaming and the smacking of flesh on flesh and flesh on tile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0The sudden thrust combined with the increased pace rips an orgasm from Jack's body, and keeps him locked in a state of bliss, his body attempting to meet 'Jack's' thrusts and only meeting partial success from the lack of leverage available to it. Feeling another orgasm coming, Jack tries to hold off, but somehow 'Jack' senses such, and thrusts even harder, increasing 'his' pace and causing Jack to give up on whatever he had been attempting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Long minutes pass, their actions unceasing, the sounds only gaining in volume, until finally Jack can't take any more, as each orgasm that he has strains his mind. Knowing that he's nearly done, as his vision is currently a wash of blurs, the only thing he can really focus on being the cool tile pressed against his cheek and the beige blob that he can only assume is the handicapped stall, Jack tries one last time to do something, as while the whole experience has been pleasure filled, he feels somewhat disappointed at not being a more active participant (even if it was unwilling in the beginning).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Gathering his thoughts, Jack tries to use the steps he did before on intent based magic, losing focus a few times on an extra strong thrust from 'Jack', but finally succeeding on getting the steps fully laid out and his goal focused deeply in his mind. On the next thrust he feels incoming, as well as the gut feeling that he'll be done after it, Jack sends his nameless spell at 'Jack', and feels it take effect just as he is drowned in one last tidal wave of orgasmic bliss. Falling unconscious, and not even feeling his being released as his spell takes effect, Jack is momentarily falling before being caught by Lilith, who arrived at the last moment catching him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n(Lilith's POV)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Watching the futile struggle of her Mistress trying to fight his current bodies desires was amusing, especially with how aroused he had become within his pinned and helpless position against the tiled wall. It was a stroke of luck finding Lacy, who while unable to cast magic herself, was at least somewhat aware and extremely eager to accept Lilith's deal of joining her planned lesson with the chance of experiencing something new, no questions asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Chuckling to herself, unheard by the rutting pair, Lilith watches on, occasionally playing with herself halfheartedly, as she was entranced by the show before her. Seeing yet another orgasm ripped from her Mistress made Lilith smile, as she could sense Jack give in and start to get into trying to participate more. Amused, Lilith decides to deny her Mistress that, both to increase the already monumental lust driving her body's instincts, as well as to enjoy the mounting frustration that would sweeten the release in the end. [Lacy, Mistress is finally attempting to participate, deny her that option please,] Lilith sends Lacy, who merely nods on her down stroke before increasing her pace, stopping Jack's attempt and ripping more pleasure filled screams from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Shuddering at the sight of her helpless Mistress who is slowly fading from the prolonged torture of multiple orgasms without rest, Lilith decides that they should finish up, as well as complete her part of the deal with Lacy. [Ok Lacy, I'll be removing the spell holding back your orgasm now, so go ahead and have fun, and don't worry, I'll hold up my end of the deal later.]Lilith sends, seeing a wide grin form on 'Jack's' face, and another increase in pace to match 'his' eagerness to find release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Long minutes of watching the continued actions of the two cause Lilith to be distracted, slowly wondering if she should enjoy herself while waiting for them to finish or not. Coming back to her surroundings upon the feel of a build up in magical energy, Lilith focuses on her Mistress, and sees what he's intending, and smirks in admiration and curiosity at the end result. Deciding to not warn Lacy, both to see if her Mistress can actually cast the spell, as well as see the results, Lilith watches on with baited breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Moments later a pulse of magic is sent out from Jack, and Lilith feels the spell take hold on 'Jack', causing 'Jack' to lock up in pleasure, as the spells effects fully actualize. Roaring loudly and breaking the sudden locking, 'Jack' thrusts one last time, fighting the intense urge to cum before finishing his last motion. Thrust finished, 'Jack' cums hard, lifting 'Lacy' off the ground with the added motion behind the thrust, and both begin to fall backwards, as both apparently passed out from their last orgasms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Moving quickly, Lilith materializes and catches both Jack and Lacy, amused about the effects of the spell, as well as results. Shaking her head in amazement at the accident her Mistress had caused, Lilith decides to move them both to a more comfortable laying posistion by conjuring a bed and placing them there. Seeing them laid out comfortably, Lilith casts a few minor spells to clean up the area, and also places one on the door to make any wandering person ignore the bathroom for the time being. Sighing, Lilith settles down on a newly conjured chair to wait for one of the two to awaken from their pleasure induced sleep.<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><span style=\"line-height:1.4;\">\u00a0\u00a0The first clue that he's awake is the soreness that filling his body, in some places more than others, but it's dulled by the extreme feeling of contented bliss. Mind groggily regaining purchase in coherency, Jack starts to feel more and more aware of his senses, as the feeling of a very comfortable bed is beneath his back, as well as the softest pillow under his head, while his hair seems to be tickling his nose somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0'Wait, my hair isn't normally that long...how?' is the thought that jolts Jack awake and prompts him to open his eyes, flooding his vision with a bright light directly above him. \"Ow,\" is Jack's muted response as he throws his arms over his face to block out the light. A feminine giggle as well as a masculine chuckle near Jack prompt him to turn towards the sound while slowly lowering his arms. Opening his eyes again slowly, Jack is able to make out out the immediate sight of a male body facing him, as well as a female one farther away, but details are blurred as Jack tries to blink the spots filling his eyes away. Moments of blinking and regaining finer detail cause Jack to gasp, as before him is his body, and only scant feet away is Lilith!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Suddenly memories flood his mind, and the previous few hours before falling unconscious from his last orgasm cause Jack's elevated heart rate at the 'unnatural' sight before him to lower, before calming down completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Bit of a shock, eh?\" 'Jack' says, moving a hand towards Jack's face before lightly moving some hair out the way, smiling gently before retracting 'his' hand back to his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"A bit? This shouldn't even be a shock at this point, except for the unexpectedness of it, as well as the fear Lilith caused me when springing this on me,\" Jack replies hotly, slightly upset at the nonchalant way 'Jack' seemed to be acting, as well as the smirk Jack can see forming on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Now, now, no reason to be upset Mistress, especially when you can't deny you loved the feelings of your reward.\" Lilith speaks up, sounding smug and arching an eyebrow after Jack looks her in the eye. Jack breaks eye contact after a few moments, blushing madly, and feeling a surge of heat wash over him from being unable to argue Lilith's teasing truth. Jack honestly can recall how panicked, yet aroused his helplessness before had caused, and he wondered if it was really him, or his current body's inclinations. Shaking his head away from those thoughts, Jack decides to shelve such a topic for later, and focus on his current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ok, so since I'm currently in Lacy, is it wrong of me to assume that Lacy is in my body?\" Jack asks, receiving a pair of nods from the other two. \"Right, then ignoring the issue of surprising me in such a way, is there any reason for me to still be inside Lacy? No offense, but I still feel slightly odd seeing my body ogling me at random points during this conversation.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Upon his last comment, Lacy looks away, embarrassed at being caught, and Lilith laughs at the reaction of such. Moments pass in silence, then Lilith clears her throat gaining the attention of the two humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I'll start at the beginning, to help you understand the full scope of your first lesson, as well as Lacy's involvement Mistress.\" Lilith starts, before pausing and readjusting herself in her seat. \"Simply put, the first task was to help you rapidly gain a way to determine if something was supernaturally affected, or not. Most warlocks who skipped this lesson are usually killed or cursed quite easily, as they didn't notice some blatant warnings place on objects or people.\" Lilith pauses to take a breath, while conjuring a glass of water and taking a sip. While drinking, she snaps her fingers and a small tray with two glasses of water appear between Jack and Lacy, both slowly reaching out to take the glasses and sip on their offered water. Tasting the sweet and delicious water, Jack is dazed by how great it tasted, before being drawn back to Lilith, who clears her throat again. Looking over, Jack sees a smirk upon her face, and feels embarrassed yet again that he got distracted so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"To continue, the second task was to find your magic and your source, as without a general understanding of them, and no real connection aside from existing within you, you would be unable to really draw on them. The final task, that encompassed what you had previously learned, and forced you to put it into action, was to break an enchantment with your will and intent. Your tasks was much harder, as Lacy was actually under no enchantment, other than one you couldn't break, that held off her release until I lifted it,\"Lilith continues explaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But why tell me about being able to lift an enchantment off her, if i would be unable to do so, and why put me in such a situation in the first place, especially with heavy hints about a penalty for failing the final task?\" Jack interjects, confusion and anger tinging his tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Taking a moment to phrase her answer, Lilith decides to explain her reasoning after prompting Jack to calm down. \"First, take a deep breath Mistress, as you need to remember, I told you earlier, I'm your guide, as well as being bound to you for your life. That extends beyond whatever body you inhabit. I could technically drop you inside an earthworm or rabbit to live out your days, but then I would be sucked back into the book to wait for the next summoner, which is not in my best interest, especially after a century of waiting.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Jack takes Lilith's advice upon hearing so, but still feels some apprehension about what she could technically do. Deciding to shelve that for later as well, Jack takes another deep breath before nodding at Lilith to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Now, in the time I've been guiding my Masters, I've found that extreme stress and situations that feel as such can produce faster and more effective results. In this case, I decided to drop you into an unfamiliar situation, with a basic set of 'tools', in this case the previous parts of the lesson, and push you into learning rapidly. There was truly no real danger involved, other than you accidentally misfiring magic in panic, which was highly unlikely, or you failing to grasp how to utilize the previous steps to complete your lesson. The penalty was the added extra kick to prompt you into acting, as some find that added negative consequences can spur them on to success. The penalty for this would have been you being stuck in Lacy's body for 72 hours while under an extreme Lust inducement spell. Not lethal in any way, but would definitely give you incentive to keep attempting to break the enchantment, or begin unknowingly increasing your soul's energy reserves. As to your reward, well, I would think having a new experience, especially one that you enjoyed thoroughly, was reasonable enough.\"Lilith finishes, snapping her fingers again and causing the glass in her hand to disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Thinking over what Lilith had said, Jack couldn't honestly disagree with her logic. He could hate the plan and implementation, but he couldn't argue with the results either, as after thinking about it, he noticed that, while different, he still felt his magic flowing through him. Looking up and about to ask about it, Lilith holds up a hand to stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"If your about to ask about how you can still use magic while out of your body, that is simple Mistress. Most magic is either cast by soul, body, or a combination of the two. In your case, you can cast magic while inhabiting nearly any body, but with varying results, as some bodies are more conductive to channeling the energy than others. This was in part, another piece of the lesson that would be touched upon later.\" Lilith answers Jack's unspoken question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"To finish this little debriefing, Lacy here, after I spoke to her, and realized that she was aware of the supernatural realm, agreed to help with the lesson, at an easy enough price. Her family a few generations ago ran afoul one of my previous Masters, who had curse her family to be unable to use their Familial Magicks. Sadly, said curse has been present till today, as the supernatural community does not like helping out human casters too often. So in return for helping with your lesson, as well as getting some new experiences and fun, Lacy will be able to reclaim her family's Magick's, as well as enable any future descendants the opportunity to do so also.\" Lilith finishes, and Jack looks over at Lacy, who is sporting a huge grin, with a few tears leaking from 'his' eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"My family had stopped a rampaging Warlock from killing all the men in their village, while enthralling the women, by casting a few enchantments to ensnare him into a prison of his own making. While powerful, my family could not contend to one who can draw on Domain magic, so while successful in saving the village, they suffered for it. Each generation of my family has been introduced to the supernatural, to either seek out a help to lift the curse, or to be warned in case something dark is happening in their locale. I'm honestly relieved that Lilith is able to help me break the curse, and allow my family to reclaim its legacy.\" Lacy explains, seeing the look of sympathy and concern on covering Jack's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Taking a moment to let things sink in, and allow Lacy to collect herself, Jack decides to re-ask a question he had put to Lilith earlier. \"Not to be rude, again, but you still never answered why I'm still in Lacy, as while I'm still getting an occasional tingle of pleasure, it's also confusing to keep seeing myself, even if I'm not 'myself' currently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah, well that is because the next part is up to you Mistress...\"</span></span></div></div>",

What exactly would require my input while staying inside Lucy...unless this also includes something she wants?\"Jack asks, feeling a sudden sensation of excitement tinged with slight worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seeing the tells that she knew from her experience in such a body, Lacy place a hand gently on Jacks shoulder, drawing his attention to her, and somewhat relieving the building tension filling said body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"It's nothing bad Jack, at least, I cant' find anything wrong with it. I merely wished to spend more time as you, since it's definitely a new experience to be a male after living my whole life as a female. If you're truly uncomfortable with such a request, then we can switch back instantly, but I also suggest you take a moment to think on what you'll be missing out.\" Lacy says, and slides her hand down to Jack's naked breast before lightly massaging it, eliciting a low groan of pleasure from Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking Lacy's words to heart, and focusing on her request, Jack was able to ignore the pleasant buzz of feelings gently cascading through his body from Lacy's gentle massaging, unconsciously shifting closer to allow better access to the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0'It's not so bad being a woman, I can admit that honestly right now, but how long would I be willing to let Lacy be me? Also, while I can trust Lilith not to screw me over, should I ask her opinion on this?' Were Jack's focused thoughts, and decides to look over at Lilith, who seemed to be watching the two of them on the bed with an amused smirk gracing her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[I have no true opinion of whether you should or not Mistress, as this matter only affects the two of you. Any concern you might have about her acting different while masquerading as you, or as you her, can be ironed out, but it really boils down to a simple question: Do you wish to stay female for the time being or not?] Lilith says mentally, answering Jacks thoughts, and leading him to believe that Lilith can read his mind, either from her own powers, or possibly something concerning their shared bond with the Book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Jack's attention is brought back from his internal musings, as a lance of pleasure shoots through his body, causing him to moan loudly, as he looks down and sees Lacy's fingers rolling and pulling gently on his now erect nipples. Shuddering at the flood of pleasure coursing through his body, especially as the part of his mind that had dulled the previous sensations for his internal debate ceased, and added that to the new sensations he felt. Feeling another tug, Jack looks up towards Lacy, who has a grin on her face, and Jack screams out in orgasm, as Lacy's other hand had waited until he was looking away to move quickly and plunge two fingers into Jack's drenched pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Fuck!\" Jack says after coming down from his orgasm, shuddering while slightly edging away from Lacy, who retracts her hands and moves back to her previous position on the bed, grin plastered on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Thought I would remind you of the fun you could have being me for a while Jack, though I still will abide by our decision,\" Lacy says griningly, while winking slowly at Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Trembling at the current feelings, as well as the implied pleasure in her tone, Jack fights to regain control enough to make a fully informed, and as limited as possible, uninfluenced decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Slowly standing up on shaky feet, Jack walks over towards the sink and see's his reflection, his body covered in a light sheen of sweat, as well as noticing his chest rise and fall hypnotically from his panting. Shaking his head, and noticing the interesting things it does to both his hair and breasts, Jack turns on the faucet of water, gathers some up, and splashes his face a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0The cool water helps Jack calm down some, though he can still feel a pleasant heat fill his body, radiating out from his core and chest respectively. Taking deep breaths and ignoring his reflection, Jack stands up fully, and turns around, looking at the two other occupants of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Before I make a decision about whether to stay as you or not Lucy, I think I need to know a bit more about what Lilith had mentioned about helping masquerade as each other, as that is one point that will help me decide on this.\"Jack finally says aloud, ignoring the smug looks that form on both Lilith's and Lacy's faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Not a problem Mistress, that part is easy to answer. With some help, I can accelerate the syncing process your's and Lacy's soul has begun with the your bodies, helping you pick up mannerisms and memories quicker, or I can use a memory clone spell to help integrate them instantly, though that one comes with the risk of side effects. Other than that, I can simply cast a ward around you both that causes others to dismiss things they find odd about either of your behaviors. Beyond that, it would mostly depend on how you wanted such handled.\" Lilith answers, sounding happy that Jack was at least considering Lacy's request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Hearing Lilith's answer sparks a question Jack had thought about earlier when receiving the answers about his first lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"On the topic of spells, I always thought that one would need words to cast them, since most lore seems to heavily imply such,\" Jack mentions, hoping that the answer isn't too odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah, well that is simple. Lilith decided to start you off with intent casting first, instead of the 'training-wheels' route most people get put on. Mythological history has people casting spells with words or motions, because its a quick way to 'trick' the brain into channeling your mind towards a desired effect, even if the words don't make sense. In this case, Lilith had wanted to teach you the somewhat more versatile, if not slightly volatile, method of focusing your intent on what is now called 'free-casting'.\" Lacy surprising spoke up answering Jack's question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Looking over at Lacy in surprise, he receives an unmasculine giggle, as well as her sticking her tongue out at him, causing him to feel weirded out at the sight of his former body acting in such a way. Shuddering at the sight, Jack refocuses on making a decision about trading places with Lacy for a short while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"One last question then, before I make my decision. How long were you hoping to play at being me Lacy?\" Jack asks, some worry filling his voice at her possible answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, I would hope for at least two to three days, but that mostly will depend on you Jack, as well as on if something truly unexpected happens. While I do have your body, I can't cast any magic until either Lilith helps lift the curse, or I find a work around via enchanted objects, none of which i have access to. So if for some reason I'm attacked, and Lilith isn't around, your body will be defenseless. Though the chances of that are slim, it is something to consider, so like I said, my hope is for a few days at least.\" Lacy responds, hope adorning her features, and a slight tremble filling her voice in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sighing, Jack decides...<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

I don't mean to offend, but I barely know you, and I've been involved in the supernatural for less than,\" Jack pauses, trying to look at his wrist, and realizing that he doesn't have a watch on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Six hours, Mistress,\" Lilith helpfully supplies, earning a nod of thanks from Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Less than six hours, and while I'm willing to explore this request of yours, I think my caveat is more than fair.\" Jack finishes, seeing no real change in Lacy's face, aside from a slight tilt of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"...I can't say I have a problem with that, as it does sound extremely reasonable. On that note, don't forget to return the favor, as while Lilith said 'our' memories will sync, that doesn't necessarily mean that we'll be perfectly fine with everything that happens to one another,\" Lacy responds after a moment of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, this will be a fun experience for the three of us, wont it,\" Lilith says aloud, causing both Jack and Lacy to stare at her in confusion. Both Jack and Lacy look at one another with raised eyebrows, and Jack gestures Lacy to speak first. Seeing this, Lacy nods and turns back to face Lilith, and questions her about her wording.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well that is simple really, while Jack is still my Mistress, your current body is also technically in charge of me. Currently, you cannot give me orders, as your powers are bound, and during the time I'm with you I will be working on unbinding them. While Jack, can still give me orders, he is able to do so because he and the Book are bound together, as well as our souls being bound together. Once your power is freed, you'll be able to give limited orders, as my shell was created through the (accidentally) sacrificed blood that Jack produced, hence your soon to be limited control.\" Lilith explains, seeming excited by the apparently new experience, which when Jack thinks about it, would be something she could get excited about, since living for a long time might get dull if you feel you've experienced 'it all'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Shaking his head to clear his musings, Jack decides to get back on track, and moves to pick up the scattered clothing left on the ground. Bending over, Jack picks up the first piece of clothing within reach (skirt), and hears a sharp intake of breath behind him. Angling his head to look over his shoulder, Jack sees Lacy staring at his ass, slowly stroking her rapidly hardening cock. Chuckling at the sigh and reaction that Lacy is having staring at her own body, Jack continues his collecting of clothing, ignoring the increased sound of breathing emanating behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Finally collecting the last piece, Jack moves over to the sink and places the more heavy pieces down first, and the lighter ones atop, that way to make it easier to put them on. 'Definitely never thought I would have to consider putting on a woman's clothing. Taking it off (them) yes, but not trying to put it on,' Jack mentally muses, while going about putting on his thong first, hearing another sharp intake of breath behind him, as well as ragged breathing. Pointedly ignoring the mirror in front of him, Jack proceeds to slowly put on his bra, then the skirt, followed by the work top. Taking one last look around to see if he had missed anything, and seeing that as a no, Jack finally looks in the mirror to inspect his appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Doing his best to ignore everything aside from himself, Jack quickly inspects the reflection, occasionally straightening out something that appeared off in the reflection, but he hadn't noticed when looking down at it from his point of view. Finally unable to ignore the loud sounds behind him, Jack turns his head slightly to see behind him in the mirror, and is surprised that Lacy seems to be continuously pumping her hands over her shaft, but seeming to get nowhere, and thinking back on it, it's been a lot longer than he ever lasted when he was in similar straits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Turning around fully, Jack see's Lilith's gaze upon him, and he opens his mouth to ask what she did to Lacy, as Lilith would be the only possible culprit behind her current predicament. Lilith, upon seeing she has Jack's attention, merely smirks before snapping her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Lacy roars loudly and begins to cum, long ropes of it flying away from her body, and Jack is suddenly hit by an orgasm out of nowhere, collapsing to the floor boneless as his body becomes unresponsive, too overstimulated by the power and surprise of the orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I didn't get a chance to mention it before Mistress, but when you cast your last spell to link your final orgasm during your lesson to Lacy, you created a semi-permanent link between you two. I've been blocking it for the time being, but I figured it would help you with your training while I'm not around. In simple terms, both your's and Lacy's orgasms are linked, and the power of one is felt by the other. I will admit that for the last few minutes I was blocking Lacy's orgasm, but that was mostly to introduce you to the effect of your spell.\" Lilith says to Jack, causing a sudden chill to run down Jack's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Panting on the ground, and slowly regaining control over his limbs, Jack takes a few more breaths before voicing his concern about this unexpected side effect. \"What exactly am I supposed to do if I'm at work or in a crowd of people and suddenly orgasm for no apparent reason? Is there any way to set conditions on this thing to at least mitigate such issues?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Finally reclaiming full use of his limbs, Jack shakily stands, and looks over to a slightly dazed Lacy, who seems blissfully unaware of her current surroundings. \"I'm not saying I think Lacy here will be having sex with anything that moves over the next three days, but I would like to believe I can grasp your apparent character so far, and you'll be teasing and enticing Lacy into sexual or embarrassing situations at random intervals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Upon hearing her name mentioned, Lacy snapped out of her daze, and after hearing Jack's concern, started to look slightly worried about spending so much time around Lilith. Seeing the look on Lacy's face, and the tone Jack had used, Lilith puts on a wounded look of pain, which neither Jack nor Lacy believed, and made pleas about such hurtful words and mistrustful Masters and Mistress'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Going on for a few minutes, and seeing neither bought her act, Lilith stops, and beings chuckling. \"You have a point Mistress, so I will attempt to help with this problem. I can say that before I attempt to seduce or entice Lacy into some situation, I'll send you a mental message, prompting you to quickly extract yourself from your current environs if they're not convenient for your release. I'll also try not to cause too much mischief during your new working hours, as you don't have enough control now to lay a compulsion on the boss of this establishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Hearing Lilith's concessions, and finding them reasonable, Jack nods, and sees Lacy nod with some trepidation. Deciding to try to alleviate some of her worry, Jack speaks up in the succubi's defense. \"You don't have to worry too much Lacy. While I've known Lilith for a very short time, she hasn't given me any reason to doubt her word. The only thing you have to truly worry about is agreeing to any offers of pleasure without getting the full explanation.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Hey, that's.....not inaccurate. Damn, you have a decent read on me Mistress,\" Lilith speaks up after Jack's parting shot on her antics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Lacy's look of worry slowly is replaced by a smile at the words of Jack, and the antics of Lilith's attempted denial. Feeling better now than before, Lacy gets off the conjured bed, which disappeared moments afterward, and picks up the clothes that were apparently stashed under the bench next to Lilith. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Lilith, seeing both Jack and Lacy preparing to leave and attempt to live each others lives, remembers her offer to accelerate their syncing, and grabs Lacy by the shoulder just before she clears the exit of the bathroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Hold on Lacy, it will be simpler if your close enough to access your soul directly. If you two forgot, I need to speed up your memory syncing.\" Lilith explains, gaining a shocked look from both mortals, who had apparently forgotten that detail. Chuckling at the looks on their faces, Lilith focuses on her task, and starts to chant a spell in a low, foreign language. A few minutes pass, the only sound in the room being Lilith's chanting, and the breathing of the occupants of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Moments after passing the five minute mark, Lilith ceases chanting, and a slow blue glow starts to surround both Jack and Lacy. The glow lasts for less than a minute, but after it fades, Jack and Lacy seem to slightly change. Jack's posture changes, as well as the way he had been standing idle next to Lilith. Lacy, stands taller, and seems to look more comfortable, and unknown to either of them, their mannerisms and gait would be changed to match their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Task done, Lilith beckons both out the door, ready to begin such a new experience.<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><span style=\"line-height:1.4;\"><br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack had arrived at his new home minutes after leaving the coffee shop, after receiving an awkward hug from Lacy, and a blown kiss from Lilith, who both promptly started walking back towards 'their' house. Jack's new home was a five minute walk from his new job, and after digging through his purse, and obtaining the right key, unlocked the door and entered the place. Closing the door after clearing the egress, Jack unconsciously locked the door without looking, unerringly getting it on the first try. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack inspected his new surroundings, feeling a sense of d\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00a0 vu come over him, as while he knew this was the first time in the living room, brief sensations of familiarity washed over him. Feeling tired and not topped up on adrenaline and orgasmic highs, Jack placed his purse on the nearby counter, but remembered to extract 'his' phone from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Approaching his bedroom, and slowly loosening his clothing while walking, Jack felt his feelings of d\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00a0 vu increase as he approached his destination. Opening the door to the bedroom with slight trepidation, since the sense of familiarity was starting to spook him, Jack take two steps into the room, and is blasted by multiple visions of his new body in various times and actions around the room. He could see himself lounging on the bed with a book in hand, or the time he was experimenting with a new sex toy he had purchased. Over by the shelf where he had to replace a piece of the plaster by hand from an accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack shakes his head, then realizes something about his recent thoughts. 'Wait, since when did I do any of those things, those were Lacy weren't they? Maybe this is what Lilith meant about syncing with the body....kind of freaky, but I can't exactly back out now, can I?' Jack thought to himself, deciding that maybe sleep would help, as looking at the nearby clock showed it to be five minutes till midnight. Stripping off his work clothing, and dumping it in a small pile near the doorway, Jack shambles over to the bed, and gets in, not even bothering to explore the house more. Laying down in the bed, and getting comfortable, Jack realizes he left the light on. Feeling frustrated as he had just gotten comfortable, Jack is about to get up, when he gets a moment of inspiration. Taking a deep breath, and focusing intensely on what he wanted to happen, Jack channeled a minute amount of magic, and somehow, though not sure the specifics, flicked the light switch off, plunging the room into darkness. Smiling, Jack settles back into the folds of his blankets, and promptly falls asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first thing that stirs Jack awake is a feeling of something gently rubbing and teasing his pussy. Thinking nothing of it in his sleep addled state, he merely rolls over after reaching down and finding nothing where his hand checks for the foreign feeling. Just as Jack was about to be fully asleep again, he is drawn back to awareness by a pleasant warmth suffusing his breasts, and a slight feel of something tugging gently on his nipples. This gets him the reaction of actually shifting around to look at his surroundings, even though they're still dark. The pleasant warmth doesn't dissipate, but fades to something that Jack can ignore, as his consciousness fully awakens. Looking over at the clock, he sees its only ten after six am. Confused about the phantom sensation that had first caused him to slightly awaken, followed by his breasts feeling warm, Jack ponders what is going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just as he starts to stand up to stretch and take care of a few things that he feels he usually does, Jack falls back onto the bed, letting out a loud moan of pleasure. As he was standing up, Jack felt as if two fingers had just plunged themselves into his pussy, and started to massage his inner walls. Shuddering from the sudden sexual feeling, Jack tries to sit up and get some semblance of control over himself, while a part of him has a very good guess about what is going on, before he falls back again, this time screaming out in pleasure, as the probing and massaging fingers seem to find his g-spot, and start to madly rub and massage it with great vigor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The intense feeling of pleasure only sparks Jack's arousal, causing him to start rubbing and massaging his body at different places he 'knows' he enjoys. Moments after the rubbing had started, and Jack was just getting worked up to start adding more stimulation to his pleasure, the actions die down, but don't completely stop. This causes Jack's mind to focus a bit more clearly, as his logical side points out the one fact that he can't doubt: Lilith is somehow involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking this thought as fact, Jack tries to mentally project towards the mischievous sex demon, hoping that he can either get her to stop, or at least find out why he didn't get a warning like she said she would give. [Lilith, I don't know the specifics, but I believe you're somehow behind me having phantom pleasure spikes at the moment? If so, why, and also why no warning like you said you would?] Jack gets out, the ending sounding stupid even to him, but another wave of pleasure, as well as a slight twinge of pain, rushes through jacks body, as the feeling of a mouth attached to his left breast, with a gentle biting of his nipple, draws his attention away from focusing on his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[Good morning Mistress, I hope your wake-up call was pleasant. As to what is going on, well it seems that with your agreement with Lacy confirmed on both sides, that your magic altered the spell, though I will admit to being involved as a participant here. Ah, Lacy seems to be very good at knowing how to please a woman, doesn't she? As to what is going on, instead of just sharing orgasms, whenever either of you is aroused and sexually active, the other will receive the proper effects, such as this.] Lilith responds happily, with sounds of pleasure interspersing her answer. At the mention of 'this' Jack breasts stop feeling as if they're being attacked by a mouth, and instead, he feels an invisible tongue invade his mouth, while his breasts start to feel roughly massaged with occasional tweaking of his nipples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shivering from the phantom pleasure being assailed upon his body, as well as the oddity of the situation, and Jack is forced to give into his growing Lust that he had been ignoring, moving his massaging hands to place one on his clit, while the other plunges deeply into his pussy. Feeling close to his orgasm Jack increases his pace, becoming almost frantic as the hand massaging his clit starts to pull and pinch it, while the hand plunging fingers into his pussy increases to almost a blurring speed, the sound of squelching able to be heard from how wet Jack seemed to be from his arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just as Jack feels his peak coming, the phantom sensations stop, causing Jack to cry out in frustration, as his orgasms slips away. On the verge of crying, whether from his hormones or his Lust feeling cheated, Jack mentally laments his stolen pleasure, when he suddenly feels as if a large warm cock is shoved directly into his pussy, causing him to scream out in pleasure as his orgasm is ripped from his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mind breaking from the overwhelming desire for more pleasure, the momentary denial, the despair at it being stolen away, and then the surprise orgasm, causes Jack's coherent thoughts to be replaced by a deep instinctual need for more releases. Body moving on auto-pilot, Jack's hands begin a frantic dance, attacking all the spots he 'knows' will quicken his next release, while shifting in place so he can add the stimulation of his bedding to the act. Long minutes of frantic action and the phantom feel of a cock being plunged in and out of his overstimulated pussy causes Jack to have another orgasm, but his pace doesn't slow, as his Lust demands more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This process seems to repeat for a while, before one last orgasm is ripped from Jack's body, causing him to pass out in bliss and fall boneless to the bed, the only sign of life the steady breathing and the rise and fall of Jack's sweat covered chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack wakes up, feeling sore and disoriented by his familiar, yet unfamiliar surroundings. Stretching out his arms and legs to get some circulation through them, Jack slowly starts to recognize the room he's in, as well as the pleasant feel of his current soreness, usually associated with extreme masturbation sessions. 'Wait, since when did I do extreme masturbation sessions, wouldn't that be kinda hard with just a penis?....Wow, that memory syncing bit is dangerous it seems.' Jack thinks to himself, confused until he realizes that Lacy's memories are blurring with his own apparently. 'Might be something to talk to Lilith about, to see if this is normal or not.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stretching one last time, then standing up from the bed, Jack moves off to the bathroom for a shower, intent on feeling the relaxing water soothe his pleasantly sore muscles, as well as wash away the dirt and grime of his previous days work and fun. Moving about to set things in order, Jack turns the shower on, and lets it warm up, while sitting upon the toilet to relieve himself, not even thinking about the differences of his experiences with such a simple thing. Finished, Jack proceeds to the shower, and steps under the warm spray, luxuriating in the blissful feel of the running water cascading over his body.<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

While he couldn't honestly say that he felt some fear about such a creature as Lilith somehow betraying him, he decided to base her on her actions, and not the stories he had heard over the years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Taking a moment to grab the shampoo and conditioner, Jack begins to apply the products to his hair, and contemplate what he should do next, as thankfully, his new life's job didn't start until later in the afternoon, and it was only a half-shift today. Furthermore, Jack wanted to get some answers to things Lilith had either mentioned, but didn't explain, or had been unable to explain, and then become distracted by the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Massaging his sore muscles that were slowly losing the slight discomfort under the steady stream of warm water, Jack decides to stop thinking for the moment, and simply enjoy the shower, and get his answers afterwards. Course decided, and muscles feeling slightly better, Jack grabs the nearby loofah and starts to apply the body soap Lacy apparently used, then began to scrub and coo in pleasure at the soft and gentle feel of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n\u00a0After finishing in the shower, Jack towels off, and walks back into his room, naked and enjoying the slight chill of the room on his bare skin. Walking slowly over towards his dresser, Jack opens the top drawer, and finds multiple sets of bras and panties of various designs, with a few thongs thrown into the mix. Admiring the looks of a few, Jack's hand unconsciously moves towards a pair and picks it up. Moments after he is already in the process of putting the pair on, Jack realizes what he's doing, and looks down, seeing that it's a risque red thong that feels very comfortable...or so his memories tell him. Shaking his head at the awkward moments of his new memories asserting themselves, Jack finishes pulling on the thong, and can't deny that they do feel comfortable, and a small thrill runs through his body at the thought of posing for others while wearing this and a matching bra. Shuddering at the image, Jack shakes his head and returns his gaze to the drawer, and grabs the matching top to his thong, rapidly putting it on to avoid falling into any more lustful daydreams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Deciding to forgo wearing anything else for the moment, as he still is enjoying the nice chill air on his skin, Jack moves out of the bedroom and enters the kitchen, and by muscle memory finds himself before the cupboard that he 'knows' holds the cereal, hand outstretched on a box of lucky charms. Pausing at the unconscious action his body and new memories have caused yet again, Jack slowly pulls the box down, before setting it on the nearby counter. Slightly freaked out how such moments keep happening, Jack decides breakfast can wait, and moves to sit down before trying to contact Lilith, as he felt he needed some answers to this strange phenomenon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0[Lilith, I think I may need your knowledge on something odd happening to me, especially as it's starting to freak me out.] Jack sent, trying to stay calm and patient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Jack finally gets a response.[Yes Mistress? What seems to be the problem?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0[Is it normal for the syncing process to cause me to start forgetting myself and think I'm the person I'm inhabiting? Or start acting unconsciously on previous habits formed by the person, when I shouldn't know the habits as well as they do?] Jack asks, a hint of worry and fear slipping into his mental tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0[While part of that does sound strange, it also sounds somewhat within the normal variations of such issues. Hold on a moment, I'm going to use our link to see if I can track down what your trying to explain Mistress.] Is Lilith's response, before she suddenly goes silent, and Jack swore that he probably would have heard static or a dial tone if Lilith hadn't realized that Jack was truly afraid at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Long minutes pass, and Jack fidgets on his seat, trying to stay calm, but worry and doubt creeping into his mind, making him more jittery and twitchy. Finally, after what feels like forever to Jack (only about ten minutes), Lilith appears in the room across from him, but so as not to startle him, does a slow phasing into the room, giving him plenty of time to adjust to her appearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well Mistress, after using our connection, and inspecting your concerns, I have found that something odd is indeed occurring, though it isn't bad per se. In your case, you apparently have an aptitude for Soul Magicks, and that has helped you synchronize more rapidly than a person could reasonably do so in such a situation. My boosting the effect earlier quadrupled your already rapid syncing process. Sadly I can't reverse what I did, but I can tell you that you have nothing to truly worry about. Another bout of good news for you is when you begin learning how to shape-shift, you'll have an easier time mimicking people you've already possessed, as your Soul Affinity is apparently creating copies of those you inhabit, essentially creating identities you can seamlessly slide into. The only draw back I can see is if you ever suffer a mental breakdown, and you try to retreat inside your magic too deeply, as some have in the past, then you might lose your original identity of Jack, and be replaced by whichever 'copy' can dominate the rest.\" Lilith explains soothingly, slowly rubbing Jack's shaking shoulders as he started to tremble mid-way through the mention of 'unable to reverse', not even paying attention for a few long moments, and thankfully Lilith reiterated the unheard part for Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Calming down, and trying to regain his composure, Jack tries to focus on the positive that Lilith had mentioned. 'Shape-shifting will be easier huh? There is at least some positive to such an accidental discovery. Hrm, while she's here, I think i'll get a few more answers.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Thank you for looking into this Lilith, and for coming over quickly and keeping me calm....also for not trying to seduce me while I was vulnerable. While were on the topic of you answering things though, do you think you could answer a few more questions?\" Jack asks, half-way hugging Lilith, who gains a grin, before hearing Jack's comment about seducing, and a pout forms on her face, before shifting to a smile yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"It is no problem Mistress. As to being over here quickly, that was needed, as trying to keep you calm is something even Lacy would have understood, since you're very new to magic, and emotions are a key component behind them. Me seducing you while your vulnerable wouldn't be very fun, at least not when your still so new, but don't always count on my generosity in the future, as at some point I will take advantage of you if you let me.\"Lilith says with a wink, taking the sting out of her mock-threat. \"Ask away, and I will try to answer what I can, as we have some time. 'Jack' is currently cooking food for his family as a surprise, not to mention 'he' is acclimatizing slower than you apparently have been.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Hearing all of this, Jack feels some relief, as his earlier belief in Lilith's character proves true: while mischievous, she isn't evil. Considering how to phrase his questions, Jack turns in his seat to look directly at Lilith, who has seated herself on the chair next to Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"You mentioned earlier when you gave me a 'wake-up call' that my magic had altered the spell that connected Lacy's and my orgasms, but you didn't elaborate on how or why that would happen. You also said that you were only a participant instead of the instigator in my 'wake-up call', would you care to explain, please?\" Jack asks, curious about the first, and wondering how Lilith would only describe herself as a participant, when she seems more like the instigator of such things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Grinning, Lilith chuckles at the apparent memory sparked by Jack's second question, before settling down and beginning to answer. \"I can't claim credit for how you were awoken Mistress, as that was Lacy's idea. I was bored during the night, so I started to study the bindings upon Lacy's Familial Magick, and while doing so, was able to see something not connected to her soul, but her current body, change. The change was caused from our soul's desire to avoid some of the issue's you stated, but also to fit with some of your desires, even if you are not consciously aware of them. After discovering this, and Lacy awakening shortly thereafter, I explained the change, and she thought up how to have fun, as well as enjoy some morning sex. If you hadn't figured it out by now, whenever one of you is intimate with someone else, in this case I was with Lacy in your previous body, the effect's of the partner is transferred down your connection. Whatever Lacy did to my body, was sent to you, just as anything you did with a male or female would be sent to her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"My magic did that? I thought you said what I did was based on willpower and intent, and I don't remember intending for such an alteration to happen, especially since it sounds like this happened after we went our separate ways,\" Jack responded confusedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"That Mistress, ties to what I mentioned earlier, your emotions. If you recall last night, you were very worried about the connection between you two after I explained it. Apparently your magic decided to act on the problem and finally came to a solution to adress both your worries, as well as your hidden desires.\" Lilith explained, finding it amusing that Jack was pointedly ignoring the part about his desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"What now, since we've at figured out the answer to my previous concern?\" Jack asks, and sees a smirk form on Lilith's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well Mistress, would you like to return the favor to Lacy for your earlier wake-up call?\" Lilith asks, with an innocent look gracing her features, only ruined by the gleam of lust flashing through her eyes.<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><span style=\"line-height:1.4;\"><br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For once, Jack doesn't feel any fear of Lilith's antics directly targeting him, as it seems she wishes to share the 'fun' if her innocent act and suggestion of 'returning the favor' was anything to go by. Intrigued, but also slightly wary, as Jack knew, even in his short time of being around Lilith, that she would cause trouble for all parties involved if she could. Hedging his options, Jack decides to try to find out more before agreeing to anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"While that does sound interesting, it's a bit vague Lilith. If you would care to elaborate, maybe, just maybe, I could see about returning favors, even if I find myself working with such an enthusiastic 'innocent' participant.\" Jack responds, the sarcasm and disbelief lacing his tone overwhelmingly strong, enough that Lilith's innocent facade breaks momentarily, as she flinches and looks sheepish, before reverting back to an innocent doe-eyed look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Why Mistress, what ever could you mean, it's not like I could ever say no to 'Jack', as I'm 'bound to his life by blood', not to mention, 'Jack' seemed to think you would appreciate the surprise very much, was 'he' wrong?\" Lilith asks, with a butter-wouldn't-melt-in-her-mouth look on her face, but a slight twinkle in her eye made sure Jack knew her act was fake, even if he momentarily almost bought it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shaking his head, and realizing that Lilith was going to keep trying to play innocent as long as Jack tried to tease her about her part in the earlier 'phantom sex', probably even longer if she felt like being mischievous, Jack decided to drop it and ask what Lilith is really suggesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Ok, since I'll admit I'm way too new at acting nonchalant and trying to keep up with your innocent act, why don't you tell me what you have in mind, and then I'll see if I agree or not, does that work Lilith?\" Jack asks, seeing a smirk replace Lilith's innocent mask, lightly huffing at the near instant transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Of course Mistress. As to what I was suggesting, it is merely you having sex, with me in this case, and letting Lacy feel what you felt earlier. We could even spice it up with toys or magic, if you really wanted to have fun, and experience the extra fun us 'females' can have,\" Lilith says  excitedly, adding a wink and a gesture of her hand between her and Jack, causing him to snort at the poorly hidden joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Actually considering taking Lilith's idea and running with it, Jack pauses, as while he wouldn't mind getting back at Lacy, and experiencing new things (especially with his mind having fits on which experiences were really his already), he didn't want to cause her trouble by starting something while either in the middle of an errand, or heaven forbid, around the rest of his family. Just the thought of Lacy in his body suddenly acting erratic at the dinning room table in the middle of a meal, shocking and confusing his sisters and mother, caused Jack to feel a confusing feeling of horror, but also a thrill of pleasure. Shuddering at the conflicting feelings, Jack shoves the issue off to the side, deciding to focus on it later. 'That's future Jack's problem, not mine,' was the thought Jack had before returning his focus to Lilith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Before I agree to it, what exactly is Lacy doing currently, since I don't think it would be fair or appropriate to do this at an inopportune time, especially if she's around my family.\" Jack asked, and sees Lilith close her eyes in response. Moments of what looked similar to REM occurring behind Lilith's closed eyelids before a large grin bursts upon her face, and her eyes open with a gleam of mischief and lust somehow mixed together. Shuddering and suddenly feeling sorry for Lucy, Jack guesses that they apparently will get to have some fun, as well as 'return the favor'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Good news Mistress! Lacy is currently in your room, sitting at your desk while looking through your porn library on your laptop. If this isn't the perfect time to have fun, then I'm an Angel of the lord, and your a wicked temptress trying to lure me off my path,\" Lilith informs, before attempting to look distraught while using an odd hyperbole. 'I honestly have no idea how to react to that one...again, future Jack's problem,' is Jack's response, before he stands and looks around the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Searching for what would be the right height based on his memory, Jack finally finds it in the form of the large and ornate recliner, and moves over to inspect it, as while it fit with his idea, he didn't know if him and Lilith would fit on it. While inspecting it, Lilith comes up behind Jack, and hugs him from behind, slowly rubbing her breasts to Jack's back, but doing nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The feeling of Lilith's breasts pushing into his back, while being hugged by her was pleasant, but also distracting...which is possibly why she was doing it, but Jack simply ignored her for the moment, and focused back on what he want to do. Moments of this goes on before Lilith decides to stop after seeing no real effect aside from Jack being deep in thought. Sighing, Lilith disengages from Jack, and stands back a few feet, and simply waits quietly, curious as to what has Jack so focused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Ok, I think I have a plan, but in this case, I'll need your opinion, since your only a 'participant' once we start,\" Jack finally speaks up, getting Lilith to perk up at the subtle dig of her earlier claims of innocence. \"First, if my understanding of how this linking bit goes, whoever is getting penetrated will be sharing those sensations with Lacy, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lilith, curious as to what Jack has planned, simply nods, and sees a smile form over Jack's face. \"Good, in this case, I'll leave the choice of whether your the 'male' in this scenario to you, but to add to it, whoever is the male will have a spell laid upon them, the same one I want cast on Lacy before we begin, but you'll need to do it subtly so she isn't aware of it before it's too late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hearing this, Lilith bites her lip in thought, as she honestly has no preferences to being on the giving or receiving end in pleasure, but also is curious at what Jack is concocting in this elaborate sex game. Deciding to simply do the opposite of this morning, Lilith finally answers with,\"I'll be the 'male' in this situation Mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack's smile turns into a shit-eating grin, which sends a thrill through Lilith's always ready pussy, and slightly increases her desire to get things started, only tempered by her curiosity in what else Jack had planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Since that's settled, we'll need a few spells to be placed, but you'll need to place a few on yourself and not break them. Before you say that you wouldn't, I'm not meaning to offend, but if your Libido overrides your willpower, then I don't think I would blame you, hence me mentioning that first, to show I wouldn't blame you, but would be slightly disappointed.\" Jack mentions soothingly, as he sees the look of hurt at the implication that Lilith would cheat during a sexual act, before it is replaced by a look of consideration and understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"As you wish Mistress, I will endeavor to not lose control then,\" was Lilith's response, pride and determination obvious in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Then the first step is to lay two spells on 'Jack', a delaying orgasms spell like you used before on her, as well as a linked senses spell between her and you, that way you'll get to share in the fun twice as much,\" Jack says, laying out the first step in his pay back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Now the next part would be a spell that will let us see what's going on on her end, as I'm guessing you two had something similar going on when you were tormenting me. No, don't deny it Lilith, as the way you acted, as well as the phantom sensations added together paint such a picture.\" Jack says, midway through halting an affronted looking Lilith, who only holds the look for a few moments before sighing and looking disappointed that she had been caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Easily done Mistress, we simply enchanted a mirror and used it to adjust our actions to your own. Though I'm curious as to why all this for simple 'favor returning'?\" Lilith says, her disappointment replaced with curiosity, as well as a hint of lust occasionally flashing across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well that comes to the next step, the last spell, but I'm not sure how it will work, since I'm only guessing at what is possible with magic, is a mirror image of me that will appear part way through the 'phantom feelings', with a sensory link if possible, so I get to have some extra stimulation as well. In return, I'll allow you to have on mischievous act added, to either me or Lacy, as long as it's not too out there!\" Jack responds, sounding pleased that all his plans could work, before rapidly getting out his last words as Lilith launched herself at Jack in a spear-tackle hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lilith's momentum causes Jack to fall back onto the recliner, pinned beneath his aroused and exotic Succubus, who seems to be holding back by sheer willpower, from showing her appreciation at Jack's willingness to indulge not only in some sex and magic, but also letting her have \"Mischievous\" fun, something most of her previous masters had outright forbidden after the first push too far. Shaking in obvious desire, but holding herself back, and feeling her body internally growl at the denial, Lilith slowly gets up off of Jack, and steps away a few feet, breathing deeply to gain some measure of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Long minutes pass before she feels ready. Looking over at Jack, Lilith quirks an eyebrow in question of his readiness, and gets a nod in return. Smiling, Lilith silently teleports over to 'Jack's' room, and begins her work.<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

Entranced by the sight, and almost forgetting her task, Lilith quickly gets to work laying the spells Jack had described to enact his sexual prank. Long moments of silent chanting within her head, while fighting her body's demands to impale itself on the hard and free member currently being stroked before her. With supreme effort, and a bit of regret that she had to wait a little bit longer, Lilith finished casting her spells, taking one long last look at Lacy's actions, before silently teleporting back to Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Just as Lilith arrives, and stumbles as if landing wrong, Jack stands to greet her, opening his mouth to ask if she was alright, as well as ask if she was successful. Instead, Jack finds his lips captured by Lilith in a hungry lust inducing kiss, causing Jack to moan loudly into her mouth, while feeling weak-kneed from the sudden pleasure that flooded his body from her kiss. Shocked by the sudden aggressive actions of his Succubus, as well as confused how one kiss could affect him so much, Jack tries to break the lip-lock, only to find Lilith's arms holding him in place, sending a slight thrill through him at the familiar sense of being pinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0A long, passionate oxygen depriving kiss later, and Lilith finally releases Jacks arms and breaks the kiss, accidentally causing Jack to fall, as his legs gave out from the sudden weight being reapplied to them. Breathing deeply from his seat on the ground, trying to regain his breath, as well as calm his now highly aroused boy, Jack looked up, not speaking but somehow convey his question and concern at Lilith's surprise attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Lilith, also panting, but for different reasons than Jack, took a minute before looking down at Jack, and answers his questions. \"The task is done Mistress, at least on Lacy's end, though I won't be able to hold off much longer, so we need to finish on this end. I 'ported in in the middle of Lacy's masturbation, and my instincts nearly took over on the spot. I was able to finish the casting over there, and primed the spells to go off on command, but once I returned here, my body demanded I do something, lest it go into a frenzy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Hearing this, Jack's worry is slightly abated, but only just, as he had no idea what a Succubus in a frenzy would be like, nor was he too keen to find out. Pushing his thoughts aside, Jack nods in understanding at Lilith's explanation, and prompts her to finish the spells on this end. Reading her Mistress' intent, Lilith quickly starts up the easier spells before, chanting vocally, so as to allocate some of her dwindling focus on keeping her hypersexed instincts in check. While Lilith is chanting her spells, Jack goes off and finds one of Lacy's favorite toys, a double-sided strap-on, a very large one, and returns to where Lilith is just finishing the last touches of her spell, the last one apparently being the large mirror the floats nearby the recliner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Finishing her last syllable, Lilith looks over at Jack with hunger and Lust apparent on her face, before it is breifly replaced by confusion, then laughter. Confused, Jack looks at Lilith's eyes, then follows the trail of where its looking down to his hand, which holds the strap-on. Still confused, Jack is about to speak up, when Lilith simply beckons Jack over to the recliner. Deciding that Lilith will tell him soon, Jack moves over to the recliner, but doesn't move to sit down, as he figures that to match his plan perfectly, he needed to sit down on her, impaling himself just on the down-stroke of Lacy's hand motion, just to get the right shock value (and screw with her mind for a few moments). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Eager to start, and let Lilith get into position, Jack hand Lilith the strap-on, who accepts it, then throws it across the room. Bewildered by her actions, Jack is taken aback (and feeling stupid), when Lilith simply sits down on the recliner, then starts making the hand motions as if masturbating with an invisible cock. Seconds go by, and Jack starts to see a thick, demonic looking cock form from ether, looking intimidating to him, as well as 'his' memories. 'I've never taken anything over 8 inches before....that thing will split me in half, and possibly break my cervix. Wait, I've never...dammit, the syncing is getting slightly worse...oh well, deal with it later is the motto of the day it seems,' Jack thinks to himself, shocked at the sight of Lilith's demonic cock, a grin of pleasure at her actions, as well as pride at the shocked and slightly hungry look covering Jack's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"You need to get ready Mistress, as soon Lacy will notice something is off if she can't 'get off',\" Lilith prods Jack, bringing him out of his daze, and launching him into action. Slightly intimidated by the impressive tool Lilith has created, Jack feels trepidation at the thought of impaling himself on it, but also has the feeling that it would be a waste of all his efforts to set this up, then chicken out right on the cusp of starting. Steeling his resolve, Jack balances himself above Lilith, whose grin has only gotten wider the closer Jack had gotten to her, practically beaming when Jack finally stood over her demonic tool. Jack looks over to mirror, and starts to try finding Lacy's rhythm, which hasn't apparently changed yet, so Jack assumed that Lacy hadn't caught on yet. Feeling excited, and damp from the anticipation, Jack times it, and drops himself in one go upon Lilith's cock, impaling himself fully, and screaming out in pain and pleasure as all ten inches is shoved in and devoured by his pussy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0The first thought that comes to Jack's mind after he lost coherent thought, aside from realizing that Lilith had apparently not liked the fact that Jack wasn't moving, was the feeling of being completely stretched and full, and loving it. The second thing, was the fact that his Succubus was physically lifting him up, and then slamming him down on her tool, eliciting moans of pleasure from his body that got louder on each down thrust. Finally getting back to where he felt he could act, Jack taps Lilith's shoulder to signal he was ready to act, and gets a growl in response. Shocked at this, Jack decides that if he isn't going to be able to control the pace, then he should at least share some of the pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Leaning over as far as his body would bend while being lifted and dropped by Lilith's grip, Jack starts to lightly kiss one of her breasts, while lightly fondling and teasing the other, earning a purr of pleasure from her. Not breaking from his actions, Jack looks over at the mirror from his vantage point, and sees a frantic Lacy, who seems to be half trying to find release, while the other half seemed to be trying to stay on her chair, with partial success, as the chair had tipped over after a very hard slam (via Lilith), and Lacy fell backwards, somehow staying in her seat, even if she now was on her back. Seeming uninjured, Lacy's full attention seemed to return to her cock, and the painful feeling of not being able to cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Al-alright Lilith, let Lacy cum once, but reapply the spell after she finishes so she can build up to it again quickly, please,\" Jack stutters out, after disengaging his mouth from Lilith's breast, feeling his next orgasm approaching, multiple miniature ones that had preceded it leading up to now. Hearing a groan of pleasure from Lilith, Jack felt her pick up the pace, and so merely replaced his mouth's previous place with his other hand, earning a moan of pleasure from Lilith, and continues to watch the mirror, amazed that Lilith was able to keep such a pace that somehow matched the frantic actions of Lacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Feeling his peak about to hit, Jack is surprised as Lilith's demonic dong within him feels as if it starts to change. Confused, Jack looks into her face, and sees a devious smirk, and feels a twinge of fear at what she could possibly be up to. Moments later, Jack feels helmet of Liliths cock flare out, and start to feel like its getting stuck, causing Jack to feel as if something is slowly battering against his cervix. Confused look still on his face, Jack sends a silent plea towards Lilith, who merely mouths a single word in response \"knotted\". Seeing the word, Jack's mind instant grasps what is happening, and he suddenly starts trying to extract himself from Lilith, his panic momentarily stopping his pleasure from registering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Fuck!\" Lilith screams out, lifting Jack one last time, whose struggles to get off of her in vain, and slams him down roughly, finally cumming and locking herself inside Jack, slowly releasing what felt like gallons of cum into Jacks womb. Jack stops struggling as the instant Lilith had slammed him down roughly, and cum deep inside him, his body reacted, and his fear that had been blocking his pleasure was overwritten as orgasm after orgasm was ripped from his body. Long minutes pass, with neither Jack or Lilith moving, both simply basking in the bliss of their powerful orgasms, and watching the panting Lacy in the mirror start to slowly regain her feet, and move towards the bed. Reaching it, and collapsing down onto it on her back, Lacy continues to breath raggedly, apparently strained from the incredibly long time it took to orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Regaining his breath, Jack had to ask a question. \"Hey Lilith, not that I'm complaining, but where was the mirror image spell I mentioned?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0A chuckle is Lilith's only response, and Jack starts to worry, as Lacy suddenly is heard groaning and clutching her pelvis. Then Jack hears Lilith whisper into his ear something that thrills and chills him, \"Who says that were done yet, especially as were still knotted, Mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Jack's only response is to moan in pleasure as Lilith starts to lift him up and down again slowly...<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

Jack's arousal, which after his previous orgasm, had been slowly fading, as he had felt exhausted from the constant sensations of pleasure assaulting his mind and body, but Lilith's actions, added by the moans emanating from Lacy through the mirror, reignited his dwindling Lust, reigniting it into a blazing inferno. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Looking up at the smiling Lilith, who seemed to sense Jack get his second wind, slowly pulls Jack down one last time on her knotted cock, tugging down on his body to make sure they're completely flush together. Held in place, Jack silently pleads with his eyes for Lilith to let him act, earning a smirk, and then a nod. Grinning, Jack feels a rush of excitement and arousal race through his body, as he finally is allowed to as more than a living ornahole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Jack looks over at the mirror, deciding to torment Lacy a little bit more, and waits to see her open her mouth to either say something, or just catch her breath. The moment comes, and Jack springs into action, quickly raising himself till the knot stops his rise as Lilith seems content to watch Jack's actions. In one swift movement Jack slam's himself down on Lilith's tool, only to rise quickly and set his own pace, one much faster than the slow rhythmic one Lilith had set earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0A loud groan and scream of frustration can be heard from the mirror, and both Jack and Lilith grin, watching as Lacy grips the sheets beneath her, as well as enjoying the shocked look as Lacy sees what appears to be a shimmering image slowly coalesce before her. After a few more down thrusts from Jack, a ghostly image of himself appears above Lacy, a shocked yet hungry look quickly overtaking her features. Just as Lacy is about to speak aloud it seems, Jack slams himself down extra hard, earning yet another moan of frustration, and a louder groan as instead of rising up again, Jack grinds his pelvis to Lilith's eliciting groans of pleasure from both Succubus and swapped body 'participant'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Taking a moment to catch his breath, Jack decides to change tactics, as well as let Lilith get some relief, as the all consuming look of hunger had started to make a reappearance in the last few moments. Decision made, Jack catches Lilith's attention with his eyes, and simply states she can can release her holding spell on both herself and Lacy, earning a wicked grin, as well as a passionate kiss from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Breaking the kiss, Lilith leans back and concentrates on the spell, and its linked copy on Lacy, and sets it to release on their next build-up. Grinning at her actions, Lilith does one last thing, before turning the tables on Jack, as her Lust 'demands' her to take control of the opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[Lacy, the mirror from before is still in the room, if you look at it now, and move into position, you might enjoy the view.] Lilith sends Lacy silently, who upon watching in the mirror, lightly gasps, but doesn't give away that anything has occurred, other than Lacy moving on the bed to be staring off at something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Jack, distracted and waiting for Lilith to alert him she was ready to continue, is taken by surprise, as Lilith bursts into action, shifting Jack around on the recliner until his face was pushed into the recliner, and his body was shifted enough to where Lilith was able to rotate their locked genitals, forcing a loud moan to escape Jack from the strange yet pleasant sensation it caused, and ending with Lilith standing with Jack before her, still joined together with Jack mewling and wondering about the sudden change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0The recliner under Jack starts to change, and shifts into a familiar looking bed, one that seemed to be an exact replica of the one in the mirror, and at that thought, Jack turns his head to look at the object, and is surprised to see Lacy still staring at something, but mimicking the position Lilith was currently standing in. Realization dawns on what possibly happened just as Lilith started up again, slowly shifting her cock in and out, lightly beating her knot against the sealed cervix, causing Jack's mind to momentarily blank from the overwhelming sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Jack comes to moments later, as Lilith lengthens her strokes, still occasionally tugging the knot flush with Jack's womb, eliciting more moments of disorientation for Jack from the strange and yet pleasurable sensations it brings him. Lilith finally finds her pace, one where she seems to enjoy randomly grinding her pelvis into Jack's pussy just after he comes back from his momentary dazes, ripping screams of pleasure from him each time. Long minute of this pass before Jack finally stops becoming dazed from the feelings, and starts trying to meet Lilith's strokes, earning a light chuckle, as well as words from Lilith, that send a twinge of fear and excitement down Jack's spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"I wondered how long it would take for you to adapt to your new situation Mistress. Now that you're acclimatized, I can really start to have fun, and from the looks of it, Lacy agrees,\" Lilith says aloud, voice sounding pleasant, but tinged with a malevolent and hungry lust that seems to be controlling Lilith's actions just as much as she's guiding Jack's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Upon finishing her statement, Lilith slams her cock roughly into Jack's pussy, holding it in place for a moment, before rapidly pulling it out, and thrusting it in without pause, moving so fast that Jack wondered if he would see a blur if a normal mirror could show him the reflection. On that thought, Jack's head turns to see Lacy and his ghostly doppelganger, who's mirroring his actions exactly with her head turned like his, and seems to grasp just what kind of frenzy Lilith seems to be in, as Lacy's body barely takes a moment to draw out fully before slamming in harshly, and withdrawing quickly enough to repeat the process over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Shuddering from the pleasure coursing through his body, as well as the visual stimulation of Lacy, as well as his mental image of what Lilith's face might look like if Lacy's was an indication, Jack orgasms, screaming out his enjoyment, only to find that instead of slowly coming down off his high like usual, it seems to be building off of where he previously felt it peak at. Confused, and starting to lose coherency from the overwhelming desire to cum again, but also figure out why his last orgasm didn't feel the same, Jack's mind starts to slowly shut down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Minutes of mindless rutting and pleasure filled screams filling the room, Jack's last thought, before simply fading into his base desires, was that he needed to be careful when letting Lilith have her fun. That thought is soon replaced by the primal need for more releases, and Lilith responds to that need with her own. Time goes on, and both orgasm many times, but Lilith stops after a while, as while she had nigh infinite stamina, Jack did not, if the unresponsive form his body currently held was any indication. Sighing, and thrusting one last time, Lilith cums again, painting Jack's already full and abused womb with her cum, before collapsing atop Jack carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Sighing in bliss and contentment, her body's insatiable desires slightly appeased, Lilith shifts off of Jack enough that she can lay on her side, after adjusting Jack's body to spoon with her, as they're both still connected, Lilith's knotted cock still flared within his womb. Content with the situation, Lilith settles down to cuddle with her Mistress, and wait for him to awaken, whenever that would be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Hearing a groan, Lilith turns her head around to look at the source, and sees Lacy on the bed, in a similar position with the mirror image of Jack, the only difference being the low mutterings of 'too much' and 'damn succubi stamina' escaping Lacy's mouth every few minutes after a particularly loud groan. Chuckling at the sight, Lilith decides to let things be, and returns her head to a resting position behind Jack's, and settles in to wait.<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n\u00a0Jack slowly regains consciousness, feeling extremely sore, yet content, and enjoying the pleasant feel of large breasts pushed into his back. Happy, and nearly falling asleep again from how relaxed he felt, Jack is drawn away from such happenings in the form of Lilith speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Good afternoon Mistress, did you enjoy your rest?\" Lilith asks lightly from behind Jack, sounding just as content as Jack currently felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Yeah, I feel sore, but the good kind, that I usually get from extreme sex...dammit, Lacy's memories have been invading alot lately, and you already said there was nothing you could do...sorry Lilith, just slightly annoyed at the random spikes of it happening.\" Jack responds before getting annoyed at his predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"It's alright Mistress, and I'm sorry I cannot help with that issue. On another topic, did you wish to go to work today, or have me cast a spell to get you out of it. If I cast the spell, we could have more fun...\" Lilith responds, and trails off while slowly sliding a hand over Jack's arm and lightly grabbing one of his breasts, eliciting a moan, but also groan, from Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Ugh, while the spirit is willing Lilith, the body isn't able to currently, and no, I do not wish to use magic to cheat through that. As to work...yeah, I should go and do so, otherwise I'm not experiencing Lacy's life. Speaking of, how is she, since if she's in any shape like I am, it can't be pleasant on her now male body?\" Jack says tiredly, grabbing Lilith's hand and gently pulling it away from his sensitive breast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"She's awake and moving Mistress. I went over after the knot deflated enough and healed her up so she could resume her act as you. As to where she is currently, I would have to check, do you want me to?\" Lilith answered.<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

Reaching the edge of the bed, and knowing that he had to get up, Jack sighs loudly, before lowering his legs over the side, and easing himself up gingerly, a pleasant throb of soreness being felt in his pussy as his weight shifted enough to affect it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm not too worried about it Lilith, but if you want to return to her and work more on lifting her curse, then I won't stop you,\" Jack finally responds to Lilith's previous question, slowly stretching his sore body out, and hearing a few pops in his back and neck. Hearing some mixture of a chuckle and growl behind him mid stretch his arms fully extended upwards, Jack turns his head to peer over his shoulder, and sees Lilith staring intently at him, apparently still wanting to continue their previous fun, but holding back on Jack's request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Snickering at Lilith's minute struggle between desire and duty, Jack finishes his stretch, adding a thrust and turn of his body to show off more to Lilith, earning a lustful growl from her in return. Returning to a more comfortable stance, Jack merely raises an eyebrow at Lilith questioningly, silently asking her what she'll do. In response, Lilith sighs, then waves her hand over the bed she sat upon, it being instantly returned to the recliner it once was, then stands up from it, pouting the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I know my Mistress loves me, as her teasing must be proof of it, but woe is me, the poor succubus that must go on with my desires not me,\" Lilith says aloud in a false sotto-voce, lamenting further upon about how cruel her fate was. Hearing her words and watching the act, Jack cant help but guffaw at the act, nearly falling over and causing Lilith to break character and grin at Jack's reaction. Moments pass before Jack finally stops, and Lilith waits until he looks up at her, before waving her fingers and slowly fading out of view, apparently returning to Lacy's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Feeling happy and yet tired, Jack looks over at the clock, and sees he has about two hours till he needs to head back to work. Moving somewhat quickly, as he feels he needs another shower before heading into work. 'It wouldn't do to go into work smelling like sex and sweat, though it would be an interesting ice breaker...'Jack silently muses to himself, before shaking his head, and noticing that the blur between him and Lacy wasn't as bad as previous moments. Mirthful mood broken by that realization, Jack sighs, and moves over to the refrigerator and pulls out a ready-made salad, deciding to eat before showering, as his stomach rumbled loudly in his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0After finishing his meal, Jack goes and showers quickly, forgoing using any hair care products or scented oils, and exits the shower to find the room looking cleaner than when he entered the bathroom. Guessing that Lilith had dropped by to help for a moment, Jack sent a mental thanks to Lilith and got a mental image of a  smile in response. Proceeding towards his bedroom, and to the closet itself, Jack pulled out his spare uniform for work, and placed it on the bed, then moved over towards the dresser drawer to pick out his underwear, as the pair he had put on earlier had apparently been lost in the fun with Lilith from earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Shivering in pleasure at the memory of his most recent fun, and feeling himself slightly moisten as his arousal sparked slightly, Jack forces himself to calm down, as even if he wanted to, he didn't have the time, nor did he want to use magic to cheat and end up having endless sex. While it sounded great, he also knew that he honestly needed to do more than just fuck all the time, otherwise, what was the point of accepting this request, let alone bothering to learn more about his powers. Shaking his head at the circular path his thoughts were taking, Jack looked down, and picked out a sensible yet tastefully patterned bra and pantie set, ignoring the thrill his body felt from an apparently previous memory. Before it could fully form, Jack squashed down mentally on his power, unintentionally (and luckily not doing more) shoving the memory down and out of the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Sighing, and feeling tired for the moment, Jack collects the undergarments and moves over to the bed, pausing to put them on and then place his work clothes on as well. Turning around, Jack sees the mirror in the other room through the open doorway, and sees what looks like an animated discussion going on between Lilith and Lacy, though no sound is apparently being transmitted currently. Watching the discussion for a few moments, Jack hears a buzz from 'his' phone, and moves over to see what had happened. Opening the screen, Jack sees it is an alert about the time, telling Jack he had fifteen minutes before work started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Surprised, and grateful about the reminder, Jack finishes gathering the things he needs for work, slipping on a more comfortable pair of shoes instead of the heels from last night, and puts on his cap after putting his hair up how Lacy had it before, his muscle memory taking over and getting it just right. Taking one last glance at the mirror, and seeing both Lacy and Lilith looking back, with both waving apparently at Jack, he responds in kind, and adds in a flirty air-blown kiss at the pair. Lilith laughs at the action, but Lacy flushes brightly and looks away embarrassed, causing Jack to chortle while walking to the door, and locking it after closing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Walking at a somewhat decent pace, and enjoying how good it feels to be exercising his muscles in other ways aside from sex (though he wouldn't complain about some later), Jack gets to work with five minutes to spare, entering the back area and letting his boss know he was there. Getting a nod in greeting, as said boss was on the phone when he stepped in, decides to get to work and promptly starts to organize the area behind the counter, drawing heavily on his 'Lacy' persona. 'While I may be getting annoyed with the blurring of my identity with this apparent \"copy\" ability, I can't deny its usefulness in easing in and seamlessly integrating with my environment.' Jack thinks to himself, feeling at ease with his work, even though he knows for a fact he had never made anything more complicated than straight black coffee before yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Time goes by and Jack has no troubles with the many customers that come up and order various things on the menu, even being able to banter with a few apparently regular customers. The only complaint that Jack could have is one that his persona's memories could attest to being a normal occurrence, and that was the amount of guys that hit on 'Lacy' every day. At first, Jack was slightly awkward and flattered at the attention, but after the tenth guy tried a very poor pick-up line, one that even a pre-teen would be able to acknowledge as a bad attempt, Jack's temper started to rise, and the only thing that kept him from showing it was allowing 'Lacy' to have more 'freedom' to act. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0It honestly confused Jack, how he could know that the real Lacy was in his body, and yet felt he could have a conversation with her in his mind (soul), and not even tell the difference. Near the end of the shift, Jack noticed that his memory blurring had stopped, but 'Lacy' had become more life-like, and he had to wonder if this copy was actually sentient, or not. Deciding to ask Lilith's advice on it later, and happy that he at least wasn't in conflict with this apparently interactive soul-copy, Jack continued on with work, finishing up a little later as the last person to work tonight was twenty minutes late with no explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Relieved at his shift being over, Jack walked back to the office to see his boss, and found it empty. Shrugging his shoulders at that, he returned back to where he stashed his purse in the store room, then left his work, exiting the shop and feeling a pleasant chilling breeze wash over his exposed skin, and starts to walk home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Reaching it shortly, Jack unlocks the front door, enters, then closes the door and re-locks it, sighing in relief at being home and able to relax, as while the job hadn't been difficult, the people made it stressful. 'Guess that's why Lacy seemed annoyed when I tried flirting with her on our first meeting,' Jack thought to himself, then was surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'It's not so much as I was annoyed at the flirting, but at the fact that I had just met a woman who sparked my interest, and a guy came up and delivered a corny yet funny line that paled in comparison to what she had offered to do, Jack.' Says a very familiar voice that Jack had been hearing since last night after swapping into his current body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Upon hearing a mental voice of Lacy responding to his thoughts, Jack stills, his heart-rate picking up as panic floods his body. Taking deep breaths to try to calm himself, Jack decides that he needs to talk to Lilith now, either in person or mentally. Putting thought into action, Jack sends, what he hopes, a mental memory of what he needs to know, as well as a brief reel of his time at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Minutes pass, and Jack slowly moves towards his bed, not changing out of his clothes nor trying to get comfortable while waiting for Lilith. Finally after what feels like an eternity to Jack, Lilith appears, with a somewhat intrigued but disappointed look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh Mistress, you really can't go a few hours without getting into trouble, can you?\" she asks, eyebrow raised and her disappointment shifting to exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What do you mean Lilith?\" Jack asks, confused about the question's phrasing and tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well Mistress .... \"<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

That's why I asked if you couldn't stop yourself from getting into trouble, as when you shoved down on your previous syncing memory when dressing, you inadvertently, and unknowingly, channeled a sliver of magic, and since it had no direct purpose, it tried to appease your most recent concerns. In this case, your copy is for all intent's and purposes Lacy, a copy, but one with a full opinion and ability to view and opine on the things she observes.\" Lilith explains, conjuring a chair for herself, and seeing a flabbergasted look form on Jack's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Seeing this look, Lilith decides to try another way of explaining it, as her Mistress needed to know the dangers of such accidents of Soul Magick. \"Mistress, before, your 'Lacy' copy was the equivalent of a set of clothing, one you could don and doff on demand, albeit with some practice. Your little accident, gave her the ability to grow into an actual soul, one with its own thoughts, feelings, etc. It's still tied to you at this point, mostly because the sliver was trying to help stop the blurring of memories that was occurring, but if this had gone the wrong route, you could have lost control of your body, while your 'Lacy' clone would have been slowly consuming your soul, and absorbing your power for herself. Luckily, that didn't happen, but you need to be more careful with your emotions, as they are tied to your Magic, as well as your intentions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Hearing this, Jack almost breaks down in tears, only stopping as the 'Lacy' inside whispered soothing things about how she didn't want to do any of the things Lilith had listed, nor would she ever dream of doing such. Calming down after a few minutes of 'Lacy's' gentle whispers, as well as Lilith moving over to sit next to him, and gently rub his back, Jack finally settles, looking up at Lilith in thanks, as well as mentally thanking 'Lacy'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Sighing, Jack considers Lilith's explanation, and 'Lacy's' existence, and comes to a simple question he needed answered before deciding anything. \"Lilith, is there any way to help 'Lacy', as it sounds like she'll be stuck as a passenger with me forever if I do nothing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Lilith looks thoughtful for a moment, before tilting her head to the side and responding. \"Technically we have a few options, but if your truly concerned with helping her, you should ask for her opinion too. To answer your question, we could have her be turned into a Familiar, though you don't have enough energy reserves to sustain such a bond with her currently. You could consume her soul, and merge it with yours, effective becoming a combination of yourself and her, though I don't think that's what you had in mind.\" Upon hearing that suggestion Jack's face becomes horrified, and looks like he's about to shout at Lilith before she holds a hand up, gesturing him to wait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I said that was an option, not one I would really endorse, but I feel you need to understand all options available to you, so that if this possibly happens again, you will be able to stay calm, and possibly decide on a course of action quicker. That being said, you could, albeit with my help, try to merge both Lacy's soul with 'Lacy', though I have no idea how well that will turn out. The last option is to form a nice relationship with 'Lacy', in which she is content with whatever you two agree upon, and you are as well. An example would be, after you start working on your shape-shifting powers, or even before, letting her 'stretch her legs' and enjoy being out and about. You actually did that earlier, when you let her have partial control during your work shift. As I mentioned before, you have a few options here, but most are not within your reach, nor should you attempt one of them, as that one always has consequences.\" Lilith finishes, gently gripping Jack's shoulder before moving back over to her conjured chair, and sitting down to wait quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Going over the options and suggestions Lilith had laid out, Jack decides to ask 'Lacy' her input, as even if she doesn't have a body, she now is (technically) a person. 'I'll go along with whatever you want Jack, though I don't mind what we have going on currently, as it seemed to work earlier. I know that I'm not the real Lacy, but I think even she would agree that us sharing would be the safest choice currently. Besides, if worst comes to worst, we can simply have Lilith help mediate....though from what I can see in your's and 'my' memories, that might lead to some pleasurable discussions.' 'Lacy' answers, and even though Jack couldn't see it, he could sense her eyebrow's waggle teasingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Chuckling, and smiling at the positive of this mini-crisis, Jack looks up, and sees a smile on Lilith's face. Curious, Lilith answers his unsaid question with one of her own, only aloud. \"Did you forget I'm a 'soul-stealing' creature that is currently Bound to you, Mistress?\", causing Jack to gape at the realization that he had, indeed, forgotten that little tidbit. Seeing the look on his face, Lilith howls with laughter, as it was too much for her, since in all her time she couldn't recall anyone forgetting the lore about her species, especially the bit about souls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Calming down, both Lilith and Jack stand, with Jack moving over to hug Lilith and thank her for the help, again, and in return, was hugged back, though he felt she could have done without the fondling his ass. Sighing at the broken moment, Jack pulls back, seeing a mischievous smile adorn Lilith's face, seeming unrepentant about her antics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Is there any way to avoid this happening again Lilith, especially if we want to play around more with other peoples bodies? I don't exactly want to have a crowd of people sharing space in my soul...scape? no idea if that's a good description, but i'll try that here. ...crowd of people sharing my soul-scape, especially if some of them turn out to be hostile.\" Jack says, stumbling on explaining his concerns, while also trying to define what he felt was the location of where he and 'Lacy' currently resided in Lacy's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Humming in thought, Lilith thinks over Jack's question, before finally speaking up. \"I would have to research and experiment with a few spells before giving you anything concrete, but currently, all I can suggest is to not let your emotions get too out of control. Though on that thought, 'Lacy' might be able to help, as she'll have unfettered view of your soul and can see when you start to channel magic, so if she's amiable, she could help you learn to control your magic. Hrm, not only that, she could even help you with increasing your attuning to magic sensing, and a few other branches, as she can help you adapt quicker by mentioning when your doing something wrong or right. I digress though, the short answer is no, I can't do anything currently, but 'Lacy' possibly can. Now, if nothing else, I should get back to watching Lacy stumble through not screaming during the movie she's currently watching.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Curious, even though he had a good idea of what she meant, Jack asked her to elaborate. \"Quite simple Mistress, in keeping up her act of being you, she went out with Alex and Kelly to a movie. She seemed bored during it, so I started to give her a blowjob, while telling her to make sure she didn't alert anyone. When you had sent for my help, I locked her orgasm and arousal in place, so she wouldn't feel any disappointment at me having to leave for a time. I wouldn't want her to suffer a denial of release, now would I Mistress?\" Lilith answers, a butter-wouldn't-melt-in-her-mouth look adorning her face, only ruined by the devilish glint in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Shivering at the mental image, as well as feeling extremely sorry for his accidental part in the torment, Jack gestured for Lilith to leave, and sent a mental prayer that Lacy survived another day and a half as him with Lilith's antics involved. A loud howl of laughter startles Jack out of his contemplative mood, as 'Lacy' apparently found her counterpart's situation hilarious. Shaking his head and wondering if he'll ever understand women, and getting a mental shout of 'hey' from 'Lacy', Jack starts to strip out of his work clothes, down to his underclothes, and stops, as he doesn't feel right walking around nude now that 'Lacy' is aware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'That's silly Jack. Don't think about that, cause if you do something I don't like, I'll definitely speak up! Besides, I'll admit that it's very comfortable to walk around and lounge while nude, though I can't say I recall doing it too often. Regardless, relax and experiment, since that's what this whole thing was supposed to be about.' 'Lacy' says, sounding amused at Jack's reluctance to act as he wants now that she had come into existence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Thinking of arguing against that, Jack then realizes he'll never win, as 'Lacy' has all the time in the world, now that they would be sharing his life. Sighing in defeat, Jack strips off his bra and panties, and relaxes into a chair, contemplating what to do with his night, as well as the next day since he had it off.<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

Just as he's about to pose the question to 'Lacy', he gets a text message from an unknown number. Confused, Jack stares at the number, and after a full minutes finally realizes that it was 'Jack's' phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Feeling sheepish at the minor memory kerfuffle, Jack quickly opens the message, as it apparently was a picture attachment with a message after it. As his phone loaded the image, Jack's curiosity is piqued, as he couldn't figure out what Lacy could want to show him in a picture. Finally finished loading, Jack feels his pussy dampen from the sudden arousal that spiked through him at the image, as well as hearing 'Lacy' ooh and ahh and the picture. Lacy had apparently convinced Lilith to use some magic to pose the pictures, but if they had sex, had blocked off the sensations since Jack hadn't felt a twitch since earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0The image on the phone was that of Lilith tied spread eagle in mid-air, her arms somehow suspend from the ceiling, and her legs chained and spread out enough to expose her apparently flooded and leaking pussy. Looking closely, Jack could see Lacy half inside Lilith's pussy, while what looked like a stereotypical tail was wrapped around behind her, and if Jack had to guess, plunging itself inside Lilith's ass. To finish off the arousing sight, Lilith had nipple clamps attached, connected by chains and pulled down by a weight at the center, stretching and distended her nipples and causing the blood to pool. A ball gag seemed to be placed in Lilith's mouth, and Jack could swear that he saw a smile form on her face as the picture was being taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Shuddering from the lust the picture instilled in him, as well as hearing the moans from 'Lacy' on her opinion of the picture, Jack glanced down to see what the message was, and starts to chuckle at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*Hey, me and Lilith are a bit tied up at the moment, but to keep with our deal, I ask that we meet up tomorrow, since I know you have a free day ;) . Hope you enjoy your night of doing whatever, and if nothing else, see ya tomorrow <i>Lacy</i>! *<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Finally getting himself under control, and his arousal slowly fading down to a simmer instead of the inferno it had ignited to from the pictures, and the ideas it gave him, Jack puts the phone down, and asks 'Lacy' her opinion on what to do, since it was only 9:50 pm at that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Well, honestly, I haven't been clubbing in a while, and that does sound like fun. On the other hand, getting in touch with some of my friends, now yours also, could be interesting, especially if you attempt to control your intent-based magic. Something that didn't occur to you, is also practicing on channeling your energy and fine tuning the process, like Lilith had mentioned. Whatever you choose will be Ok with me Jack.' Lacy responds, sounding somewhat strained, and Jack wondered about what he would see if he tried to visit his soul-scape. As the thought passed through his mind, he heard a giggle and moan, confirming his assumption about 'Lacy's' strained voice, as well as the fact that he would never have private thoughts to himself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Sighing and silently lamenting the fact that the women in his life (so far) would always be able to know what he was upto, unless they decided to actually respect his privacy (he highly doubted that). Pushing away his woes of privacy, Jack thought over his options, and also what 'Lacy' had suggested, and came to a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Jack was going to...<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

While it turned out that she was good and not going to devour his soul or try to do horrible things, the fact that his slip of power could have caused such a thing honestly scared him. Shivering at the thought, Jack decided that he needed to get started, as he felt it would take a while, even with 'Lacy's' help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Jack got up from his chair, and moved over to his bed, sitting with his legs crossed and back straight, trying to find some way to comfortably sit, yet stay awake from the slight strain on his muscles, as it wouldn't do to accidentally fall asleep while trying to access his magic, then anything could happen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Moments of focus, and a feeling of his hearing fade, Jack feels a sudden tug inward, and feels his surroundings fade from his senses. Opening his eyes, Jack is presented with a giant city before him, different buildings he could recognize as some he had seen, or had thought about when attempting to draw at random points in his life. Turning around in place, Jack sees an endless field, on either side of it trees of all types, many that seemed odd and unnatural. Looking up, Jack sees a half sun, the other half in the shape of the moon, but emitting light just as brightly as he would expect it. A few clouds seemed to be in the sky, but not enough that he would assume it would rain here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Taking it all in, Jack felt peaceful and content, and honestly wondered if he would have to leave this place, if it was always like this. Just as the thought registered, a new cloud appeared within his vision, startling him and making him wonder if he had caused it, or it had just randomly spawned. As that thought went off, another cloud appeared, and Jack got the hint, and cleared his mind. Succeeding in doing so, the two new clouds, and a few others, seemed to fade away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Putting the cloud forming, and what it could honestly mean if he accidentally formed a sky full of them, Jack moved down towards the oddly shaped city, minor memory flashes appearing at different buildings that he stopped to inspect. After a while, Jack finally comes to a building that he recalls perfectly, as it's the one his body is currently in, Lacy's house. Getting the urge to see if 'Lacy' is inside, Jack moves to knock on the door, and before making contact, it opens and swings inward, allowing Jack to pass through, before slowly closing behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Nonplussed at the minor oddity of it, Jack merely moves towards the bedroom, and finds 'Lacy' staring off into space, apparently not noticing him there. Bemused by this, Jack silently moves over to stand in front of 'Lacy' admiring her appearance even though he was in a similar body outside. After thinking that thought, Jack looks down and notices that he's not Lacy anymore, he's in his orignal shape. Looking up, Jack is startled by 'Lacy' grinning up at him, apparently amused by his realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Jumping back, Jack is greeted by laughter, as 'Lacy' can't hold it back, the situation too amusing to her. Moments later, 'Lacy' calms down, and looks appraisingly at Jack's nude form, licking her lips after reaching his crotch on her third check. Chuckling at the blatant ogling snaps 'Lacy' out of her actions, an embarrassed blush crossing her face momentarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"So, now that were both done checking the other out, I'm assuming you can guess why I'm visiting, aside from your lovely company?\" Jack asks, deciding to flirt and tease, as he feels that will be a good basis of their new relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why Jack, to walk around naked, and check out a woman in her private home, naked as well, without even one date? What kind of woman do you take me for, you brute!\" 'Lacy' mock shouts, showing mock outrage and scorn, before bursting out in laughter at the gag the two had thrown together on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ok, seriously, I'm guessing that aside from this being your first time, you'd like some help with your control training?\" 'Lacy' asks after calming down again, though her face was beat red from all the laughter. In response, Jack nods, and moves over to a seat that was across from 'Lacy's position, sitting down after getting a nod from her that it was alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, first off, we'll need to find your source, which lucky for you, I know where it is, and you can probably guess its location if you think about it. My suggestion after you locate it, is to either build some defenses soon, maybe with Lilith's help, or change the location, as anything attempting to possess or subdue you via magic will be trying to target it if possible. Secondly, after we reach it, we'll need to carefully test how much output you'll produce just based on Soul vs Physical energy. I can help stop any spells, since I'm currently self bound to you.\" 'Lacy' explains causing Jack's brow to furrow in confusion, as well as concern about binding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What exactly do you mean about being 'self-bound' to me? I thought we had agreed to share. I was trying to avoid binding you to me 'Lacy', I don't want a servant, even if you would be less unruly than Lilith!\" Jack responds, trying to keep his calm, even if he felt angry at himself for this happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Hold on there with those thoughts of thinking this is your fault Jack, and yes, it's not a choice for me to read your mind, but we'll discuss that later. In this case, I decided to bind myself to you willingly, as you helped give me life, even if it was unintentional, and I wanted to share in your life because of that. Also, after going over 'my' memories of the Family Magicks, I might be able to help you out more than just residing inside your soul-scape. What a self-binding means is that I willingly tied my soul to yours, but I'll only obey you if I wish. Instead of a servant, you could liken me to a ....symbiotic creature, with time and experimentation, even if 'my' Family Magicks remained bound, I could, theoretically learn to cast your brand of spells based on our link. Not only that, but, if you ever get really adventurous, and able to manipulate souls well enough, you could drop me in one person, and you in another, and we could share in the fun,\" Lacy ripostes, cutting Jack's train of thought midway from station, and giving him something to think on, though also caused him to chuckle at her added eyebrow waggling at the mention of shared fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Sighing, and realizing there's nothing he could do to even remotely change the situation, Jack decides to get back to the goal of coming here, to train and spend time with 'Lacy', not argue about Bindings and such. Lacy, in response to her unfortunate ability, merely grins in response, while sticking her tongue out at Jack teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Finished with her taunting of winning, 'Lacy' stands up, and holds a hand out to Jack, who doesn't hesitate in accepting it. Their surroundings change, and Jack stands before his home, realizing that 'Lacy' was right, if anywhere, his soul would be where he felt most safe and comfortable. Still with her hand in his, Jack leads the way, through the self opening door, and up to his room. Passing through the doorway, Jack sees that instead of a bed, a large hourglass shaped construct is in its place. Not even surprised about the odd things that he sees and has happen to him, Jack merely turns to look at 'Lacy' who chuckling moves her hand in a familiar gesture, and causes chairs to appear before the object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Before you bother speaking up, just realize that you're currently inside your soul, and most of this is just your minds way of rationalizing something so odd and 'alien' to it's usual settings. So no, I didn't conjure like Lilith does, and yes, that means that instead of wasting time verbalizing, you could simply think it and I most likely will answer. Well, it's kinda hard to answer what color my panties are, now isn't it Jack?\" 'Lacy' speaks up before Jack gets a word out, answering his thoughts and questions almost the instant he forms them, and also causing him to flush from embarrassment at the stray thought on teasing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No reason to be embarrassed Jack. Until I myself train to filter out your thoughts until I can unconsciously ignore them, I'm in for a long time of  amusement and frustration, but I feel your worth it. Now, onto your training. The hourglass, if you look closely, has numbers on the side, that will measure your power output, and adjust those numbers accordingly after it finds what your maximum level is. After we get that, we'll start trying to get you to sense where the gauge is, without looking, then finally you can start practicing minor intent-based spells, preferably ones that wont possibly morph or summon a Lovecraftian creature.\" Lacy says, sounding well thought out and prepared for this, and smirking at Jack's silent praise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ok, I get why I'm finding out my baseline, but isn't it dangerous to channel that much power, since it's the equivalent of setting off a beacon in the magical realm. I may not know a lot, but fantasy books do kinda give one an idea of what is possible,\" Jack finally verbalizes, grateful that 'Lacy' let him do so this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Normally you would be right Jack, but while you've been in your soul-scape, and on your way here, I 'messaged' Lilith through your bond, and asked her to put up a dampening ward specifically for this situation. Oh, and she said she was tempted to ravish your body while you were distracted, but felt that you learning this was more important, so expect to be 'rewarded' if you succeed tonight,\" 'Lacy' answers, a smirk at the minor panicked look that flits across Jack's face at the memory of his last reward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Deciding to stop getting distracted, Jack follows instructions, and starts to focus on drawing on his Soul Magic...<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

After a near full minute Jack stops drawing feeling that he's reached his limit, and looks over at 'Lacy', who inspects the numbers, and whistles appreciatively. Seeing a nod to stop, Jack lets go, and hears a loud thump go off around him. Looking around worriedly, Jack's companion chuckles, drawing his attention to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, what exactly do you think happens when you gather a large potent store of energy, and then release it all at once with no direction? I wouldn't be surprised if something was knocked over in the physical realm. On that note though, your power levels for a beginner are impressive, though that also presents a problem for you also.\" 'Lacy' explains after seeing the questioning look on Jack's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, having that much power in your soul starting out is a problem Jack, especially since your starting out with the basics, as well as not in an acceptable container. Hrm, liken your situation to that anime Naruto that you watched recently. In this case, you have Naruto's immense Chakra reserves, but no control over them. As to the container comment, that would be the fact that depending on the spell type, some require physical energy, and some soul energy, and even some require both. Technically, with practice, or recklessness in many cases, you can substitute one for the other, and force a spell, usually resulting in it going off, but having to suffer any potential backlash incurred for 'cheating'. For you, your base body that you've lived in your whole life is a 'perfect container', letting you channel your energy easier, and not spend as much energy, since your body and soul work in conjunction and lessen the strain of such activities.\" 'Lacy' explains, taking a pause and looking off into the distance, tilting her head as if she's in a separate conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack waits for 'Lacy' to finish whatever is going on, and thinks over what he had heard so far. 'So, if following that Naruto example, and basing it on my recent problems, instead of wasting 'Chakra' mine is escaping and acting on my emotions, possibly because ....I don't know, I lost the plot there I guess,' Jack thinks, not seeing a smirk form on 'Lacy's' face from his current line of thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Your close Jack, but the anime example was only there to give you a form of perspective. To finish that thought though, using what you had already reached, is this. Your overflowing energy leaks out when you feel intense emotions, such as anger, or fear, or in some cases, though Lilith has apparently been filtering it, Lust. Depending on the situation, and the emotion, your magic will possibly react, since it wants you, it's ...'partner?', honestly, no idea how to explain it, but it wants you, the one who uses it, to be 'safe', so will act out when you feel great emotion.\" 'Lacy' says, having apparently finished mentally talking to Lilith, as Jack can't think of anyone else that 'Lacy' would be able to talk to mentally... aside from his that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"An example of your first reaction, was when you felt great fear, and broke the enchantment on yourself in the bathroom, another was shortly later, when you felt great desire to share your Lustful feelings with Lacy, and most recently, the time where you felt great fear and annoyance at your identity crisis. Each time your magic tried to alleviate the situation, whatever it may be. The good news is that so far, it's been minor effects from the spells, though my...birth, might be counted as not so minor. The bad news is this will continue to happen until you learn how to either gain control over your Soul magic/reservoir, or you seal off a large percentage of your current power, and slowly built your way back up to full strength, just like building up a muscle, though in this case, you would simply remove the seals after mastering whatever the previous level of power was sealed.\" 'Lacy' finished explaining, and conjures a glass of water, taking a long drink, signifying that she wants to take a momentary break from the giant explanation she's been giving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack considers all that 'Lacy' has said, and wonders which would be the better option, as both seemed pretty even: either start to learn how to control a river of power, or create a series of damns, and unblock each damn after gaining control over that portion. Looking up, Jack sees the glass of water gone, and 'Lacy' simply relaxed and waiting for Jack to continue, though he decides to ask a question aloud first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Not to sound rude or inept here, but how do you, and by extension, the other you, know all this information? I thought you said your Family Magicks were sealed, so wouldn't that mean that it would be hard for you to know any, if not most of this?\" Jack asks, curious about her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, that's both easy and complicated to answer, but the simple truth is a mixture of my Family's knowledge, plus what Lilith is sending me as shes... indisposed, currently, and decided to let me help you with this training, since I'm available, and not exactly bound by the Family curse...at least not as much as the original Lacy is. As to how I and my Family knew so much, we could still read the books, and every few generations a few of the family members would study the books, even if they couldn't use the knowledge inside. My mother was the last person to hold the books, and handed them over to me before passing away, allowing me to know about our history, and the wonders of the supernatural world.\" 'Lacy' responds, a look of joy and melancholy mixed on her face at the mention of her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Thinking on all he had heard so far, and the decision between which method to use, Jack asks one final question before deciding his course. \"Is there an actual reason for me to have so much power, even though I'm just starting out in learning the basics?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Lacy' takes her time before answering, not looking like she's conversing with Lilith like before, but merely turning the question, and her answer, over in her head before deciding on how to respond. \"Technically, a true beginner wouldn't need that much power normally, but in this case, I would have to assume that Lilith is getting a stead stream of both Soul and Physical energy whenever you both engage in sex, as part of her nature would be to draw it in, in small doses unless she focused on draining someone dry. On the other hand, I don't know if any of the local supernatural won't take advantage of you if you appear weaker than them, so at this point, it's still your choice, but having more power under your control instead of working up to it when your in need of it, could be the tipping balance to your choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack makes a decision upon hearing 'Lacy's' comment, and moves into a more comfortable position, settling himself in for a long training session. \"Ok, lets see how far we can get on trying to control a River of Soul Power!\" Jack shouts, making an exaggerated arm motion, and causing 'Lacy' to giggle at his antics, before settling herself in as well, and begins to walk Jack through the first steps on gaining control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What feels like an eternity to Jack, but is promptly informed that it had only been 8 hours inside his soul-scape, and outside had only been 4 1/2 so far (and didn't that throw him for a loop, learning that anime was right, and sometimes time does move differently inside minds and souls!). Standing up and stretching, even though it was a habit that did nothing for him currently, Jack looks at the meter, and feels some pride at how far he had come in his training. A blue line, with a scribbled word of \"control\" had started to rise after the first hour, and whenever he asked, 'Lacy' had given him a more accurate estimate of how far he had really gotten. The meter currently set at some obscure number, but Lacy promptly told him (while apparently out of the room currently) that it was at 35%. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feeling happy at so much progress, even though it was boring as hell, Jack decided to see what 'Lacy' was up to, as she had wandered off when she felt Jack get the hang of the training, and found herself bored waiting for him to progress to the end. Walking down the hallway, and down the stairs into the Living room, Jack sees 'Lacy' sitting on the couch, watching a television broadcast images that Jack faintly recalled, though he couldn't place it, until 'Lacy' spoke up answering his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"They're your dreams, in this case, your erotic and fantasy based ones. I found it interesting how detailed some of them are, while others seem to be a concept that is vague and slightly bland. I will also admit that your crush Sarah is hot for a highschooler. I'm honestly curious if Lacy would try to seduce her herself, or if she would simply try to trick her into being the seducer. In any case, I'm guessing you want to take a break and go back to the outside, maybe get some sleep?\" Lacy says, sounding interested, yet bored at some of the images on the screen, and only a tinge of excitement infects her tone when she brings up Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Yeah, as much fun as your company has been,\" \"Hey!\", \"I'm kidding, but really, as fun and enlightening this has been, I need to leave for a bit, but don't worry, I'll let you have some fun soon also.\" Jack says, feeling guilty, yet also slightly excited about sharing the fun with 'Lacy'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, until next time, though I'm only a thought away,\" 'Lacy' says, after getting up and giving Jack a hug, and a pinch on his ass, causing him to somehow be forced back out into the Physical plane.<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

Massaging his legs to get the circulation flowing, while also stretching as well as he could from a sitting pose, Jack hears multiple pops, and feels some of the chill abate, though Jack debates about either putting some clothing on, or just finding the thermostat and adjusting it to warm the house\u00a0.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Legs finally able to hold his weight, Jack stands up from the bed, looking at the room and sighs at the mess his initial power gauging had caused. Deciding to turn the heat up first, as he didn't want to keep feeling cold while working, as the amount of things to clean up wouldn't even cause Jack to work up a sweat, let alone take much time. Padding over to where he 'remembered' the thermostat, he adjusts it, moments later hearing the sound of the heating unit start, and a gentle warm gust of air washes over the room, causing Jack to let out a happy sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Turning around, Jack drew on 'his' memories of what the room should look like, then started in on returning the mess to its previous condition. Puttering around, and getting more used to his mental sharing of memories and traits, at one point not even noticing that he had started to hum a song Lacy liked to work to when cleaning up around the house, Jack finally finishes setting the room to order. Looking around, the only thing Jack couldn't fix himself, was the antique doll, that had been close enough to Jack when his power had surged, that it flew across the room and landed roughly against the wall, causing a huge crack to form in the middle of it's head. Deciding he'll deal with it later, Jack places the doll on a nearby dresser, and turns around for one last inspection of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finding himself content with it's appearance, and not seeing anything else needing to be done, Jack glances over at the nearby clock, and is shocked at the time, as he was still adapting to the differences of speed between the physical plane and his soul-scape. His eight hour training there had only been four and a-half hours here, and Jack wondered if there could be negative side effects from such a distortion in one's sense of time, if they spent too long in one plane. Pushing those thoughts aside, Jack decides to just go to asleep, as even though he doesn't physically feel tired, his mind was starting to feel sluggish, especially after the time issue came into play. 'Besides, nothing good ever happens at two am, so sleep should be an obvious choice,' Jack silently mused to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moving over to the thermostat, and adjusting it to a slightly lower setting, Jack hears the heater kick off, and slowly shambles over to his bed, crawling beneath the sheet and blanket, and letting out a sigh of enjoyment at the comfortable feeling his bed causes him. Closing his eyes, the last thing Jack hears is a quiet 'Good night Jack,' from 'Lacy', and in which his mentally mumbled a return of such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now one would think that after his previous days awakening, and all the strange happening that occurred throughout said day, that one would be less surprised to wake up in a different position than how they went to sleep. Jack did feel slightly less surprised, but only because the moment his grogginess had faded, and he had taken stock of his situation, he already knew who the culprit was, especially as she, or in this case, they were standing before him grinning widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack woke up with the strangest sense of hanging by his hands, followed by a gentle wash of air teasing his body, causing him to rub his thighs from the slight tingle they occasionally sent from the light stimulation he was receiving. As coherency started to return to Jack, his eyes opened, closed, then snapped open in shock, and he open's his mouth to exclaim something, where before he can emit a sound, an object is thrust into his mouth roughly, and the sound of something being snapped together sounds behind his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before his eyes, grinning widely, are Lilith and Lacy, both naked and aroused, if the erect and hard cocks they were sporting were any indication. Seeing a glare form and pointed at their direction, Lacy decides to speak first after a shared glance with Lilith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Good morning 'Lacy'! I know it's unusual for strangers to come over so early, but I just had to return the favor of your gift from yesterday, as it was only fair since you returned the favor of yesterday's wake-up call with an overflow of enthusiasm. Why, if this were a thing one could put a number on, I would honestly wonder if I don't owe you a few good return presents. I digress, the truth is that after hearing from a reliable source that you enjoyed the picture I sent over last night, I felt you would find it even better to experience it yourself.\" 'Jack' says, his tone and demeanor not matching that of a pleasant neighbor, but that of one who is getting their revenge after planning it out meticulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack's eyes widen noticeably, causing the grins on Lacy and Lilith's faces widen farther, as Jack starts looking around at his surroundings, noticing that he's set up in the exact same pose as Lilith had been in the photo, the only missing bit being a tail extending out of his ass to fuck himself with. Shaking, though whether from the flood of arousal, or the feeling of helplessness, all Jack could do was wait, as both Lilith and Lacy started to walk closer to Jack. Lacy and Lilith circled Jack before finally deciding on where they wished to start from, with Lacy standing before Jack, placing her hands on Jack's shoulders, and slowly massaging the skin there, as well as working his way up and down Jack's raised arms,sending a small wave of pleasure through Jack. Lilith had come up behind Jack, and molded her body to Jack's back, her breasts smashed into his back and pelvis to his ass. After feeling herself as flush as she could get, Lilith started to rub her breasts and pelvis into Jack, causing strange yet pleasant sensations in the affected areas, and eliciting loud gagged moans from Jack in response to the mutli-pronged stimulation attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This goes on for a few minutes, and just as Jack feels he's about to cum, the two stop and pull away, leaving Jack wiggling and struggling against his bonds, trying to inch closer to his release. Moments go by before Jack gives up and goes slack, dangling by his wrists and feeling frustrated at being denied his orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Aw, is someone upset that they didn't get to cum yet? Now if only someone hadn't used that teasing method recently, they might be having a more pleasant experience right now, wouldn't you say so Lilith?\" Lacy says mockingly aloud, looking Jack in the eye and seeing the frustration replaced by a brief glare, before shifting towards begging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Why 'Jack', I don't think that's exactly fair to say, since you did use that teasing method first, the only thing 'Lacy' is guilty of, is going overboard on that type of teasing, and you know how it is when one gets caught up in something fun.\" Lilith says from behind Jack, and reaches a hand out to rest on Jack's ass, causing Jack to momentarily thrust his ass back, only to receive a smack and a curt \"no, bad girl\" from Lilith in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seeing Jack about to cry, Lacy gives Lilith a subtle signal, and moves to stand before Jack, gripping her shaft, and slowly stroking it, seeing a glimmer of hope, as well as an all-consuming hunger fill Jack's eyes. Grinning at the sight, Lacy moves close, nods to Lilith, and places her tip at the lips of Jack's pussy. Just as Jack thinks about thrust his pelvis forward, he's distracted and shocked by the feeling of something stiff and hard against his ass. A thrill goes through Jack, and he can't deny that he's turned on by the situation, whether it's Lacy's memories, or possibly his own subconscious desires, all he knows is he wants one of them to fuck him immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just as the thought crosses his mind, Jack feels both thrust at the same time, and the only thought that fills his mind as both Lacy and Lilith push inward, is \"So full\". Slowly, both Lacy and Lilith get part way in, but stop, drawing a muted moan from Jack, before slowly drawing somewhat out, and then thrusting into Jack, taking a step closer while doing so. After a few more times of this happening, both cocks are fully inside Jack, but unmoving, causing Jack to try to move to get some stimulation, but unable to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feeling just on the cusp of his long denied orgasm, Jack screams into his gag, and sees a grin appear on Lacy's face in response, as she pulls out quickly, with Lilith mirroring the action, then thrusts in harder than before, while shoving somewhat forward, before retreating, and repeating the process over and over, with Lilith keeping in sync with Lacy's motions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, just when Jack feels that he's giving up, Lacy simply nods at Lilith, who says a few odd words, and they both thrust one final time, roaring loudly as the cum inside Jack, who also cums, but just as the first one finishes, another seems to rapidly form then ripped from his body. Confused, the last thing Jack understand before being lost in the unending pleasure is \" I had Lilith alter the spell to store the orgasms instead of denying them, so enjoy them all one after another 'Lacy'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack passes out after his eighth orgasm, but his body still keeps responding, going on for another few minutes, legs drenched in his releases while he dangles limply by his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Think we went too far?\" Lacy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Maybe, but I'm sure he'll get over it,\" was Lilith's only response.<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><span style=\"line-height:1.6;\"><br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Jack's first thought upon awakening was \"sore\". Granted, it was the pleasant soreness that felt great 'in his opinion' that followed such extreme and pleasurable sex acts, but the soreness still sucked when first waking up. The second thing that Jack though, was why he felt so warm, and why his arms felt so heavy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Finally working up the effort to crack his eye open, Jack slowly sees colors beyond the blackness his eyelids had presented him. Lightly groaning, and shifting his head around to change his view while inspecting his surroundings, Jack's question about his arms was answered nearly immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Laying in his arms, one asleep while the other awake, but staying silent and watching Jack move, were Lacy and Lilith, who apparently had decided to sleep in bed with him. Confused, Jack starts to go over his last memories to figure out how he ended up in bed with Lacy and Lilith, when he lets out a light gasp, as he begins to recall the \"surprise wake-up call\" that the two had sprung on him. Still going over his memories, Jack feels a tingle of arousal slowly seep out of his core, and spread across his body, but immediately clamps down on it, not wanting to possibly spark more sex, nor become frustrated in attempting more sex. While he knew that when he was a guy, all they thought about was constant sex, but feeling the after affects from the other perspective hammered home the old adage about 'too much of a good thing'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Gently lowering his head back to his pillow, Jack feels lips lightly being placed upon his cheek. Tilting his head to see who it was, as he was still dazed from all the differing sensations and emotions his last two days had been, couldn't recall momentarily who was on which side of him. Seeing Lilith delivering butterfly kisses now on his nose caused Jack to giggle, prompting a smile from Lilith, and a low groan to emanate from Jack's opposite side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You know, while I was a woman, I knew there was such a thing as too much sex, and after becoming a man, I thought that those thoughts would change. I've come to the conclusion I was horribly mistaken.\" Lacy groaned out, seeming to be just as sore as Jack felt, which increased his giggling to guffawing, with Lilith joining in as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Slowly, as the laughter died down, the trio settled back down, lazing in the bed and enjoying the pleasant mood of the room. Ten minutes go by before Lacy finally starts to struggle out of the bed, seeming sluggish yet content. Shambling off to the bathroom, Jack turns his head to see Lilith, who is simply staring back at Jack with a serene smile, causing Jack to smile in turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, I can't say I'm happy with your second version of an alarm clock Lilith, but I will admit to having possibly had a small part in causing this outcome...but I get the feeling Lacy had help, especially after the picture from last night.\" Jack says after sighing and deciding to broach the subject of how the morning had started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm sorry you weren't happy with your newer edition of Alarm Services, so I'll just need to work harder on finding the right way to start your day Mistress!\" Lilith ripostes, not seeming repentant or showing a modicum of guilt, nor even denying the rest of Jack's statement. Jack simply huffs in mock-annoyance, then smiles and gently places a kiss upon Lilith's brow, before returning to her comfortable pillow, simply looking at the bemused Succubus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Aw, you two look so cute positioned like that, it almost makes what happened earlier seem harsh, though I think we can all agree that it was fun.\" Lacy comments upon returning and seeing the content and relaxed pair in the bed. A slight flush starts on Jack, who has to calm his slowly increased heart-rate at the memories stirred by Lacy mentioning their earlier bout of sex. Forcing his arousal and desires down, and glad that he didn't feel any spike in his Magick, Jack slowly sits up, groaning as the action pulls on his sore muscles. Slowly backing up, Jack rests against the headboard of the bed, and is soon joined by Lilith matching her sitting position, while Lacy decides to sit in the chair she drags closer to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, to start us off, I had fun as you last night, especially as it was an interesting experience to have siblings, as well as a pleasant moment to have a Mother who cared for her kids so much,\" Lacy says after getting comfortable in her chair. Jack opens his mouth to say he's sorry about her mom, but is cut off by Lacy raising her hand, and continuing on with speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm not sorry about getting the chance to meet your Mother Jack, nor do I feel cheated that it's only a temporary thing. It's a nice feeling, but I know that nothing will replace my Mother, nor would I wish to. In any case, nothing troublesome came up, though Lilith did fill me in on why she had disappeared and left me with a near case of 'blue-balls'....wow, I never thought I would say such a thing in my life,\" Lacy continues, chuckling after mentioning her surreal moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Sorry about that, but I'm guessing she's told you about why, as well as my new Companion?\" Jack asks, and receives a nod in response. \"Well, I let her decide, and apparently she, without telling me, Bound herself to me, so I hope you're not...upset, disturbed, angry, whatever negative emotion this could cause, about having a second you, Bound to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, I can't say I really know what to feel about it, as I know it wasn't intentional, and since she's essentially me, the I know how and why she probably Bound herself to you, especially with her circumstances, so no, I don't hold it against you Jack. Especially as you started working towards stopping this from accidentally happening again, though I do hope you'll take good care of her...and you might want to be careful, she'll most likely be a handful. If anything, you might be in trouble, as she'll be able to work with Lilith to cause mischief and tease you when she gets extremely bored!\" Lacy says after a minute of silently framing her words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Jack feels relieved that Lacy isn't upset about 'Lacy', nor her circumstances, but also feels a sense of fear at the mention of essentially being double-teamed by both 'Lacy' and Lilith for teasing and mischief. Groaning mentally, Jack decides to focus on the now, and not invite trouble by worrying of the future trouble his Companion and Succubus will likely cause him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Alright then, so since nothing bad happened, and neither of us sounds in a rush, I'm assuming you wish to spend another day as me, Lacy?\" Jack asks, guessing her answer but wanting confirmation nonetheless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"If it's not too much trouble, especially as Lilith said another day and she should be able to break the seal keeping the curse in place. Aside from that, it's been fun to see things from your perspective, especially since if it gets too boring, Lilith decides to spice things up.\" Lacy says smiling widely, and sending a grateful look towards Lilith, who merely smiles in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, if that's the case, do you wish to stay here for a bit and hang out, or go out, or do you wish to go do something as 'Jack', and talk later? I'm open to most options currently, though I think regardless my next stop will be some food, as you guys not only fucked me senseless, you didn't even buy me dinner, nor bother asking me out on a date....either time!\" Jack says after a minute, letting the tender moment stand, before feeling his hunger speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Both Lacy and Lilith laugh at the dig that Jack had sent at them about all the sex they had caused recently, and each time causing him to pass out and wake up hungry. Feeling a moment to have fun, Lilith decided to speak up, as she wanted to potentially lay the groundwork for more entertainment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, if your disappointed with not getting the full experience, I'm sure 'Jack' over there would be willing to ask you on a date tonight, especially as 'he' should let you get the full female experience of 'wine and dine'. Though, if that doesn't work for him, I can fill in for that offer Mistress.\" Lilith says, a smirk on her face at the poleaxed expression adorning Lacy's face, and the suspicious look on Jack's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I-I-m I'm not opposed to that Jack, but I will admit that it's been a while since my last date. Since I'm sure you can find out, lately it's mostly been one night flings and occasional friends-with-benefits. Though to do this properly...\" Lacy stutters out, before finally calming herself enough to stand up and hold her hand out. \" 'Lacy', would you do me the honor of going out on a date with me tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Jack feels flushed, a mixture of embarrassment and excitement, though he cant discern why, at Lacy's actions. Silence fills the room until Lilith pokes Jack, who finally realizes he hasn't answered, and quickly speaks up. \" Of course 'Jack', though I hope you have a plan in mind... and will not let a certain Succubus have too much say in said plan, as she seems to be setting us both up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Lacy starts to smile widely at Jack's acceptance, but a look of horror crosses her face as she realizes that indeed, Lilith had set them up with a simple challenge to her now male ego. Sighing, Lacy simply decides to take Jack's advice to heart on limiting Lilith's help in the planning... if she can that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Alright, so now what are we going to do?\" Lilith says after letting the two humans stew in the realization that she as going to most likely tease and torment them later on tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They decide...<br>\r\n </span></span></div></div>",

Moment over, Jack slowly shuffles over to the edge of the bed, and gingerly stands, feeling intense soreness radiating from his abused (and pleasant feeling) pussy, groaning as he settles his weight fully on both feet. Wincing at the muscles that all protest at even daring to move more than an inch, Jack slowly moves towards the bathroom, pausing at the doorway to look over his shoulder at Lacy, who had apparently decided to enjoy the free show Jack was unknowingly presenting just by walking around naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"You know, instead of ogling me like that 'Jack', you could come help me in the shower, though no sex please, I just don't know if I'll be able to reach too many places with how sore you two have left me.\" Jack chides Lacy, who momentarily flushes before nodding and standing to follow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Hey, how come I didn't get an invite Mistress? Have I done something wrong\" Lilith whines in a high-pitched voice, even adopting a pouting look that would fool most, if not for the bemusement one could see in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chuckling at her antics, as he doesn't even bother to turn around to respond, just saying it aloud, Jack answers, but continues onto the shower, turning it on and letting the water warm up. \"Well, unless you wish to use magic to alter the shower to fit all three of us, even if were not going to be doing anything other than cleaning up, you're more than welcome to join us, otherwise, no, you haven't done anything 'wrong'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lilith takes on a contemplative look, knowing that she could indeed use any number of spells to accomplish such a thing, but decides to merely relax and plot out how to make the dinner date more interesting while not arousing either of their suspicions... more than they most likely already were at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The shower was quick and efficient, both gently washing and massaging their tired and sore muscles from their earlier fun, not even trying to tease or initiate anything beyond a chaste kiss of thanks between the two. Finishing up, and both feeling revitalized and ready for Lunch, Jack walks out of the bathroom first, followed by Lacy, whose eyes seem drawn to Jack's body whenever he moves around her. Sighing quietly to herself, Lacy wonders if it would be considered narcissistic to be admiring her own body so much, as well as desiring to mount and pleasure it continuously, before pushing such thoughts aside, as she could feel her arousal start to stiffen her sore cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack wandered over to his dresser, opening it and looking through the collection of undergarments, wondering if he should go for comfort, or teasing, before a twinge of pain lances through his body, deciding his course for him, and quickly gathers the bra and panties he 'knows' will be the best for his current situation. Closing the drawer, and putting the garments on without moving away from his current spot, Jack considers what clothes to wear, before getting an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Hey, 'Lacy', would you like to be active during this lunch excursion, starting by choosing what to wear while out in public? Also, I know it's short notice, but would you also like to share the date tonight?' Jack mentally asks 'Lacy' who he has no doubt been watching the happenings of his surroundings, and possibly been bored simply being a passenger/bystander to such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[Sure Jack, and thank you for thinking of me, as while I haven't been bored exactly, it does get dull trying to entertain ones self indefinitely with obscure ways to use minor bouts of magic.] 'Lacy' responds happily, though worrying Jack at the last comment about minor bouts of magic, merely earning a giggle from her as another response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Jack feels a slight tugging sensation, and allows it to pull, and suddenly his body is moving on its own, and he feels his physical sensations slightly dulled, only noticeable for the sheer fact that he vividly recalls what being only a soul earlier had felt like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Lacy' moved smoothly, walking over to the closet and opening it, taking out a blue low-cut blouse that she new would be comfortable, yet show off her figure perfectly. Moving on, she opened the mini-dresser that resided inside the closet, and pulled out a white knee-length skirt, admiring it momentarily before closing the drawer and taking a step back to then close the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quickly putting on the picked out top and skirt, 'Lacy' moves over towards the full-length mirror that Lilith had left behind from the previous day's fun. Thankfully, it didn't seem to be active, as her image, as well as that of Lilith and 'Jack's' appeared behind her, and a slight spike of arousal washed over 'Lacy' at the look of 'Jack' admiring her that she could see in the mirror's reflection. Pushing down the feeling, as she agreed with Jack that sex was not a good idea at the time, especially if there was to be any fun after the date later tonight, and began to adjust the clothing as well as reaching over and picking up some light make-up from the nightstand, applying it with ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Finally feeling ready, 'Lacy' turns around, and sees 'Jack' still ogling her blatantly, while Lilith has a pensive look on her face. Curious as to the reason for such, 'Lacy' mentally queries her, and is shocked by the response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[I might have a pensive look on my face as my Bound instincts are somewhat agitated by the sudden 'possession' of my Mistress. It's not a bad thing, but next time you two should warn me, otherwise said instincts might make me act without checking first. We can work on a fix for that later, but for now, just ignore the look and enjoy the time Mistress is willing to share with you.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Floored at this information, 'Lacy' contemplates 'her' knowledge of the Family Magicks, and realizes that technically, it might feel that way to someone else bound to another, as their was no bond connecting 'Lacy' to Lilith, hence her defensive instinct's hackles would be raised by an  \"unknown and successful attack\" as it might be interpreted. Mentally sighing, and realizing Lilith is right, and this would have to be taken care of later, 'Lacy' cedes partial control back to Jack, though leaving herself enough to feel the physical stimulation of their shared body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Ok, well, I guess neither of you want to go out to eat with me, as neither of you are dressed, so I'll be back soon,\" Jack taunts, grinning at the bewildered look that crossed Lacy's face, soon being replaced by a realization that she's still naked. Lilith, on the other hand, merely laughs at the comment, before clothing forms onto her voluptuous body, finally getting of the bed and sending an amused look at Jack before nodding towards Lacy, who is looking around for anything to wear, before realizing that there were no clothes here for 'Jack'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chuckling along with Lilith now, Jack merely gestures towards Lacy after getting Lilith's attention, and receives a grin in response. Lacy feels a sudden chill and looks down, seeing herself in a black t-shirt and jeans, with simple running sneakers. Looking back up, Lacy launches herself out of her chair and collides with Lilith in a bone-crushing hug, finally letting go after Lilith pinched her ass, eliciting a yelp of surprise from Lacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"You shouldn't be thanking me, as Jack was the one to indicate I should help. Personally, I had no problem with you walking around naked, as it would present me with so much teasing potential, not to mention if you finally felt like having some exhibitionist fun, you would be perfectly dressed!\" Lilith finally says after chortling at Lacy's betrayed look, which turns thoughtful at the mention of exhibitionism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Alright you two, enough, I'd like to get some food before it gets too late.\" Jack says, and saunters out of the room, hips swaying and earning a hiss from Lacy, and a bemused snort from Lilith, who apparently found it funny about the minor teasing 'Lacy' was doing with her currently limited control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0'She'll become very dangerous the longer she has to work with such limited power... it would frighten me much more if she wasn't bound to Mistress.' Lilith mentally muses, before grabbing Lacy by the shoulder and dragging her along, mentally spelling the door shut behind her.<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

Walking at a decent pace, the two mortals would give minor details they hadn't expanded upon earlier about the previous day, and Lacy ended up laughing at the fact of Jack's annoyance on being hit upon so many times. Jack returned laughter at Lacy being locked out of the bathroom for nearly two hours last night since both his sisters and mother demanded the use of said room, stating that if 'Jack' needed to go so bad, then go outside. Lilith would occasionally comment on things Lacy had 'accidentally' left out, causing more laughter to follow, though Lacy silently swore to seek revenge on the crafty Succubus if possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally reaching the block of the downtown section where many eating establishments resided, the trio stopped and realized that no decision had been voice about where to eat. Looking at one another questioningly, though Lilith was highly amused at the questioningly looks she had received when both Lacy and Jack finally remembered that eating human food was optional for her. After getting over their shared embarrassment, and still asking Lilith for her opinion (and earning a smile for the consideration), they finally decided on a pizza parlor that was having a buffet special currently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At first 'Jack' had politely reminded 'Lacy' that she needed to be careful about what and how much she ate, receiving at first a deadpan stare that slowly morphed into a mocking grin after merely pointing towards Lilith, who also was grinning at the faux pas that 'Jack' had stepped in. While swaying his hips in an exaggerated motion, Jack calls over his shoulder about \"simply burning the calories off with extra exercise\" before leaving an embarrassed Lacy and guffawing Lilith outside, before they finally followed him inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lunch was filled with laughter and exaggerated stories, especially when Lilith started telling tales of past Warlocks who had either screwed up horribly, or found the most outrageous ways to further their craft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Wait, so your telling me that one of your previous Masters had spent three months as a tavern wench just to perfect a spell to pinch a person's ass across the room?\" Jack had asked, amused at the idea of someone going so far just to pinch an ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Yeah, what was funnier was that he was stupid enough to not word his demand correctly, so after the three months, and being excited about 'perfecting his spell' he found out that he was stuck as the tavern wench until the day he died. Take that as a moral lesson Mistress, when making demands of supernatural creatures, make sure you either don't piss them off with how you do so, and also be careful with your phrasing.\" Lilith says chuckling at the remembrance of the shocked and horrified look on said warlock of her story. \"I believe his exact demand was <b><i>'Make me a woman that can help perfect the spell I am currently crafting!'</i></b>. Now normally, I wouldn't have left him stuck like that, but when I tried to warn him about the inherent dangers of his intended course, he declared if I did not do as he wanted, he would lock me in a container and give me to the Vatican. At that point, I simply decided to grant his wish.\" Lilith finishes, earning more laughter from her listeners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just as Jack is about to comment on the story, he notices a couple approaching the booth he and Lacy were sitting at, only by luck was he able to hide his shocked expression. Coming closer were his best friend Alex, as well as his girlfriend Kelly, both looking in curiosity at Jack, while Alex turns to look at Lacy at strike up a conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"So this is where you ran off to without telling your mother this morning Jack? I stopped by to see if you wanted to hang out with me and Kelly at the mall earlier, but when I asked, I was told you were out of the house before anyone else woke up. By the way, who is your alluring friend?\" Alex says, trying to sound suave when indicating 'Lacy', and earning a harsh smack to the back of his head, courtesy of Kelly, who had an angry expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Wow, I'm guessing that she's your girlfriend if she's hitting you for your pathetic attempt at flirting...or she felt like behavioral recalibration for not doing better?\" Jack speaks up, poking fun at Alex while earning a brilliant smile from Kelly and an indignant \"Hey!\" from Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Sorry, I'm still working on training him, though I fear that will be a long process. Though I do have to agree with the intent of his inquiry, even if it was poorly phrased. I'm Kelly and this <i>Casanova </i>is my boyfriend Alex.\" Kelly says, sticking her hand out to shake, and silently asking Jack to reciprocate. Chuckling at Kelly's actions, Jack decides to go along with it, though he feels surreal about the whole bit of talking with his friends, but them not realizing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Hi, my name is Lacy. I'm a friend of Jack's who needed his help this morning moving some furniture and decorations around. At one point I would have been stuck without him, seeing as I accidentally got tied up while hanging up some decorations. As payment for his help, I offered to take him out to lunch. As to your boyfriends poor attempts at corny lines, I'd suggest a spry bottle filled with ice water. Whenever he steps out of line, simply shoot him in the face or ears, hopefully he'll get the message,\" Jack responds, enjoying the intrigued looks on the couples faces at the explanation of where 'Jack' had been earlier, as well as the poleaxed look on Lacy's face at blatantly telling them about part of their morning, just not elaborating. Lilith guffaws at the perfect way Jack had played in teasing Lacy while technically telling the truth to his friends. 'If he can do this on the fly, I can't wait to see what he'll be able to do with a few lessons in creative talking,' Lilith thinks, before returning her attention to the continued conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"So, Jack, did you want to hang out later? I just got the newest Call of Duty game and I know you're probably itching to shoot some zombies and talk about....stuff.\" Alex asks Lacy, stumbling at the end and earning yet another smack from Kelly, who apparently 'knew' exactly what \"stuff\" meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Nah, sorry, I've got plans later, but maybe in the next day or two,\" Lacy responds, barely keeping herself from glancing at Jack at the mention of plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seeing a moment to get some insight that he normally wouldn't be able to, as well as potential teasing material, Jack beckons Kelly over to quietly talk for a moment, Kelly deciding to indulge 'Jack's' female friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Not to be rude, but if your boyfriend acts like that around you, how exactly did you two decide to start dating? Especially as he should be keeping his eyes on such a beautiful woman as yourself,\" Jack asks quietly, earning a small gasp from Kelly, as well as a giggle when Jack decides to wink at her for added effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, he's normally a lot more polite and kind, but for some reason he tries to act different around Jack. I know for a fact that Jack has told him that it's not a good thing to do, but Alex merely waves his advice off and keeps doing it. I can honestly say that he's got a good heart, but seems to be an ass whenever Jack is around women. If he keeps it up, I don't think we'll last,\" Kelly defends Alex, though near the end her tone grows somber, and Jack reaches over and gently pats her shoulder in sympathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, we need to get out of here for now. Have fun with your lunch Jack, and good-bye fair maiden, and don't accept the advances of this disreputable fiend!\" Alex says, pointing at Lacy while trying to wink at Jack, earning yet another smack as well as a muttered \"asshole' from Kelly. Both walk away, one pissed off, the other rubbing the growing lump forming on his head from his recent actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Interesting friends you have there Jack, though, I think there's something wrong with Alex, especially if he's willing to hit on another woman in front of his girlfriend.\" Lacy comments after she sees the couple finally exit the parlor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Yeah, I've noticed it too, and tried to talk to him about it, but it hasn't seemed to work so far. I'll try again soon, possibly a few days after I get my body back. Speaking of leaving though, we'll need to go soon if we want to have time to prepare before the date,\" Jack responds, earning a nod from Lacy, who slowly slides out of the booth, apparently finished with her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack takes another few bites of his slice of pizza, finishing it off, and then standing, holding out his arm to help Lilith up, who adopts an amused smile at the gesture. The trio go to the register, pay while leaving a decent tip, then exit the parlor, surprised at the time as well as the position of the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Ok, so are you going to pick me up 'Jack', or do I need to meet you at the place were going to?\" Jack asks Lacy teasingly, earning a small blush before she quickly covers it up. Pausing in thought, Lacy says ...<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

Please wear something nice and comfortable, but not too casual, as where I'm taking you might get upset by that. And on that note, I think it's time for me and Lilith to take off. See you later,\" 'Jack' says, turning to leave, but not before capturing 'Lacy's' hand in 'his' and placing a gentle kiss upon it, flustering 'Lacy' by the somewhat spontaneous action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shocked and feeling incredibly awkward by the entire situation, especially as 'Lacy' starts to coo at the romantic gesture, even though both of them knew Lacy was apparently teasing Jack, if the slight twitch of her lips was any indication. Jack's only response was to start sputtering and trying to find something to say, but failed and fell silent as both Lacy and Lilith start laughing at the results of her prank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Calming down after admitting silently to himself that it was a well played prank, Jack huffs aloud, and mutters \"Just you wait,\" earning another round of snickers and light laughter from the apparently prank-ish duo. 'It's no wonder those two get along so well if they can find ways to cause mischief at the drop of a hat like now,' Jack thinks, exasperated but amused at the the ease of how well Lacy and Lilith get along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shaking his head at the thoughts, and pushing down any shreds of embarrassment or annoyance, Jack just waves and turns to walk back to 'his' home, in order to get ready for the date. Lacy and Lilith, deciding to have some more fun, apparently head further down into down town to hang out for a bit longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Walking 'home' and contemplating how his life had gotten so strange, yet fun, Jack wonders what really would have happened if he hadn't accidentally summoned Lilith, and if he would be as open minded and happy as he currently felt. Searching his feelings, Jack came to the conclusion that he was enjoying his new life, and all the craziness it apparently entailed. Sure, the surprises were slightly unsettling, but he could get used to that, as long as he enjoyed the new experiences as well as talked out his problems with Lilith, who seemed to be less demonic sex fiend, and more like a mischievous woman who had a hypersexualized libido, but also able to push it down in the cause for entertainment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finished reflecting on his recent past, Jack notices that he apparently had ended up inside 'his' home, as well as his bedroom, and was clad only in his bra and panties. Confused, Jack starts to feel the stirrings of panic before 'Lacy' speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Sorry for the sudden shift in your location Jack, but you nearly walked into traffic twice while lost in thought, so I left you to your thoughts and guided 'your' body home, then stripped us down to start picking out our outfit for the date tonight,' Lacy explains, sounding somewhat apprehensive at having taken control when Jack was distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shocked that he had been so distracted that he nearly was injured, Jack doesn't even feel worry about 'Lacy' taking over, and simply feels gratitude at the action. 'I'm sorry 'Lacy', as you probably know, I was distracted by thinking over my last few days. It's been a rush, and I wondered how the me from before would feel about all the things I've done and felt up to now from finding the Book.' Jack thinks to 'Lacy', only getting a mental image of a smile in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Well, since you know more about dressing up, and I did invite you to share the date, how about you pick out the clothing?' Jack proposes to 'Lacy', feeling slight apprehension at trying to dress as a female for a date. As a guy, it was simple, throw on shirt, shoe, and nice pants, and make sure you cleaned up decently (shave, cologne,etc). As a female, well, he noticed that his sister's took a very long time to get prepared, and the few times his parents decided to have a date night, his mother took three or more hours to 'prep' for the date. So in the interests of ceding to a more knowledgeable source, Jack had turned to 'Lacy', almost willing to beg, as he felt some unfathomable fear about getting it wrong on how to prepare for a date as a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In response, Jack feels control over his limbs and most of the body fade to a slight tingle, signifying that he could still feel physical effects at full strength, but had no actual 'power' to move them himself. Then at once, his body started to walk around the room gathering various objects that ranged from make-up pieces (lipstick, nail polish, etc), to picking out a set of lingerie that he hadn't 'remembered' being stashed in such a place. After fifteen minutes of puttering around and seeing the assortment of things 'Lacy' had gathered, Jack's body starts to put them all together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First was a risque looking bra that just looking at it caused Jack to feel a stirring in his nethers, and a matching thong accompanied it, both going on his now slightly aroused body. Soon follows a backless red mini-dress, fitting snugly against his body, and causing his slight arousal to ratchet up a few more notches causing a flush to cover Jack's fully body. Looking at the full length mirror in the room, Jack admires the dress adorning his body, and poses in front of it, feeling extremely sexy and aroused to the point of wanting to jump his image. Shuddering at the thought, Jack quickly forces himself to calm down, lest he cause 'Lacy' any trouble with their current clothing. 'Though, going to dinner without any panties on would be a new experience for both of us, eh Jack,' comes 'Lacy's' voice out of nowhere, startling Jack and slightly dousing his rising arousal, dimming it to a manageable level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Lacy' simply winks in the mirror, then moves over to the pile of make-up and starts to apply it, making her already beautiful face look extraordinary. Doing her hair up into a  pleated braid, 'Lacy' then begins to apply red nail-polish, just to add a finishing touch to the ensemble. Looking one last time into the mirror, and winking back at Jack, 'Lacy' cedes control back to Jack, who slightly stumbles at the sudden feeling of control over his limbs again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Damn, we look amazing 'Lacy'. If nothing else, I can honestly say that you do amazing work, even if you seem to be a mischievous as a certain Succubus,\" Jack compliments 'Lacy' aloud, hearing a giggle in his mind in response. Posing one last time before the mirror, and feeling a slight desire to play with himself regardless of all the efforts that had been just recently done, Jack notices the clock in the mirror, and sees that it's nearly time, drenching the thoughts of fun and replacing them with a sudden nervousness at the approaching time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Why do I feel nervous all of a sudden? I've been on plenty of dates as a guy, so why is being a woman any different?' Jack mentally asks himself, confused at this sudden onset of nerves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'It's because it's a new experience, and not to mention, you actually like Lacy, so you want the date to go well, even if it only occurred because you were teasing her. Don't worry, if my feelings are any indication, she likes you also, so just relax and enjoy the evening...I know I will!' Lacy speaks up, calming Jack down and making him ponder what exactly her last comment meant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shaking his head and looking back up at the clock, Jack sees that he has only a few minutes left before Lacy will arrive, so grabs his purse and a pair of black stiletto heels, then wanders out to the living room, deciding to wait there for Lacy to appear.<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

Looking through the peephole, Jack sees Lacy's face, smiling warmly right back at him, almost as if she knew he was looking, that thought becoming certain when she winks barely a moment after thinking it. Opening the door, Jack is blown away by the dramatic change of look Lacy had applied to his former body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now Jack never had tried to hard, nor cared too much about his hair while as a guy, but Lacy had taken the time to get it to sit just right, making it look suave and just right. Wearing a dark button down shirt that looked nice on her, as well as dark dress pants, followed by dress shoes that Jack knew he hadn't owned before tonight, all making 'Jack' look the picture perfect 'guy' for a formal dinner date. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0'Yum, your body cleans up well when effort is applied Jack,' 'Lacy' comments, and Jack somehow gets a mental image of 'Lacy' drooling and eye-raping his former body. Shuddering, whether from the sudden spike of lust that surged through his body, or at the mental image that 'Lacy' might have accidentally sent him, Jack didn't know, but pushed the feeling aside, and stepped through the door and out into the evening air, closing and locking door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"You look amazing!\"/You look gorgeous!\" was the simultaneous words that came from Lacy and Jack, and both ended up laughing at the others reaction. Laughter slowly dying, both take another moment to ogle each other, before shaking their heads and meeting one another's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Seriously, since we both know it, we look great, but are you ready for dinner 'Lacy'?\" 'Jack' asks, earning a giggle from 'Lacy', before 'she' offers 'her' arm, merely arching an eyebrow questioningly as a response. 'Jack' chuckles and gives a slight bow, admitting a momentary defeat, before taking the proffered arm, and guiding them both down the steps and out to the car on the street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lacy lets got of Jack's arm, and moves ahead of him, opening the door and offering a hand to help Jack get in, and Jack decides to humor Lacy's gentleman act. Both snicker at the silliness of the act they're trying to put on, but also both silently agree to keep it up for the time being, as it was both fun and something new to experience. After settling in the car, both enjoying the thrill of this experiment and the odd feeling it instilled, the car was started and they drove off towards the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ten minutes of small talk about random topics, and they arrive at a fancy fine dining restaurant that Jack could not recall either of them ever being to, and confirmed it when 'Lacy' affirmed such. 'Guess it's a night of many new experiences,' Jack silently muses, hearing an agreeing hum from 'Lacy'. Pulling up, a valet opens the door for Jack, and proffers a hand to help him out, and deciding to keep with the act, accepts and carefully places his heeled foot down, before using the valet's help to stand up fully. Standing up, Jack thanks the valet, who merely nods then goes around to obtain the keys from Lacy, who promptly joins and offers her arm for Jack to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Heading inside, both successfully hide their surprise and awe of the beautiful architecture and decor of the room, but have trouble when seeing some of the diners who appear to be arguing with a waiter. Their attention is pulled back to ahead of them as the Hostess starts to ask 'Jack' about a reservation. Jack was surprised when Lacy had admitted to not having one, but was even more surprised at her next action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking a moment to look over at Jack, Lacy winked, before turning back to the host, and waving a hand in front of the host's face, where the hand (to Jack) seemed to gain a blue glow momentarily, while Lacy simply said \"We don't need a reservation, as the arguing couple should be ejected and the table will be available, yes?\" The host, with glazed eyes, repeats back a similar response, before snapping back and acting on the apparent 'suggestion' Lacy had proffered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0After the Host moved over to the table and started talking to the still arguing waiter and couple, Jack take the opportunity to ask Lacy what just happened. \"So how exactly did you do that, since I thought earlier you said that Lilith needed another day to break the curse?\" Jack asks quietly, curiosity flooding his tone and earning a smirk from Lacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, I had a bit of help, and while I know this was supposed to be a date for us, I didn't think you would mind me allowing someone along, especially since you technically have a 'tag-along' also,\" Lacy responded, before her face instantly switched from the smirk to a bubbly smile.\"Hi Mistress, hope you don't mind, but 'Lacy' kinda gave me the idea when she mentioned you sharing your date, but don't worry, I won't cause too much trouble tonight, as this is a novel experience for me!\" 'Jack' says, though with Lilith's voice coming out sounding excited and happy, making Jack wonder if such a novel experience is generating it, or if she has something planned out already for her 'not too much trouble' moment....definitely doesn't want to know after thinking that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"It's no problem. It just means that technically were on a double-date,\" Jack responds, earning a chuckle from Lacy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally the Host comes back and beckons for the two to follow, moving towards the now cleared and cleaned table. Lacy, keeping up with the gentleman act, pulls out Jack's chair, and pushes it in after he's seated, before taking her seat across from him. Menu's are placed before them and just as Jack is about to open his, he hears a near-silent gasp, causing him to look up and see the source of the sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Standing there in a cute waitress uniform is Sarah, his crush from high school, staring first at Lacy, then at Jack, going back and forth for a few moments before the host, who noticed something was up, cleared his throat, startling Sarah into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Sorry about that, I was merely surprised for a moment. I'm Sarah, and I'll be your waitress for the evening, now if you know what you want to drink, I can get that for you, but if not, I'll be back in a moment to check in on you.\" Sarah says, seeming distracted but keeping up with her apparent work routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, I'll have a Mt. Dew, and a glass of water if you don't mind,\" 'Jack' responds, not indicating a response to Sarah's startlement or distracted state. Picking up his part, Jack decides to let 'Lacy' decide, who promptly picks out a fancy sounding wine that Jack can 'recall' as being 'his' favorite. After taking the orders, Sarah quickly moves off, seeming dazed but at least able to function.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well that was a surprise, I wonder if I could have some fun tonight without tormenting you two,\" Lilith says, seeming to step out of Lacy's body, naked, before a mirror replica of Jack's dress adorns her body, only shifting to the color black. Momentarily surprised by the action, then realizing that since no one has shouted, that Lilith is either invisible or in spirit form, gets over it and focuses on what she had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Before you begin plotting and scheming Lilith, mind running it by me and Lacy, since it's bad form to run out on your dates, and then invite a random person to join in,\" Jack inquires, already having a vague idea of what Lilith might do, but wanting confirmation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Certainly Mistress.The 'scheme' is simple, using a few spells, and possessing her sexy body, I get to join you two and have fun, and she gets the night off while still getting paid. Now if I get any more fun after that depends on my 'dates',\" Lilith responds, waggling her eyebrows at the mention of 'fun with dates'. Jack merely sighs, having guessed as much, but also seeing no real reason to deny the request/idea. Before acceding, Jack looks over to lacy with arched brow, silently asking for her input, and sees that she's considering it before speaking as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Before you join us then, how about you work for part of her shift, and let us enjoy the act of the date that we set in motion, especially since we all know you'll angle for sex the instant the date is over, and no, don't try the innocent act this time, especially as that's how you convinced me to tie Jack up this morning,\" Lacy finally says, only interjecting about her apparent innocent act when Lilith's face changed from a pout to an indignant look of mock outrage. Jack files away the fact that it was indeed Lilith who convinced Lacy on the ambush sex for earlier in the day, and wondered how exactly he could get revenge, since most things she seemed to enjoy. Sighing, he pushed it aside, as he saw Sarah returning with the ordered drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Getting a nod from Lacy after looking towards her, Jack says to Lilith to go ahead, but also to follow Lacy's suggestion about working part of the shift as well. Grumbling in mock annoyance, but smiling after standing up from her chair, Lilith waits until the drinks are placed on the table, before walking over and into Sarah, who momentarily seems to stumble in place, before standing back up and winking at the duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Now that your drinks are here, have you decided on what you want to order?\" 'Sarah' asks, licking her lips at the word order, before mouthing the words \"sausage, taco, foot-long\" and many more innuendo's, getting flushes from both Jack and Lacy. Both pick up the menu's and quickly find things that they think they might enjoy, and give the names to 'Sarah' who writes them down, and says that they should be out relatively soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Now, I'll go get you a basket of bread sticks, but in the mean time, you'll have to find something to entertain yourselves with, so have fun.\" 'Sarah' says, before going to deliver the orders to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before either Jack or Lacy can comment on the odd choice in wording, they are hit by a sudden surge of Lust flooding their bodies, minds slightly dazing. In this state...<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

I definitely wanted to try using magic in the near future to convert memories into those interesting devices that humans have created. Honestly, creating devices to store images and play them at ones convenience? Utter genius, and yet, half my kind seem intent on wasting their potential. Regardless, I quickly get into character after laying the spells, placing the activation to be after I'm ten feet away from the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'That'll show them to deny me my fun, though I can't argue with them having a generally good measure of my attitude. Meh, I'll make it up to them later, if they're still mad.' Was Lilith's last thought on the matter before going to deliver the food order to the kitchen, then sync more with Sarah to perfect the role she was currently 'asked' to fill before she could have more fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack could barely sit straight in his chair, starting to slouch and rubbing his thighs together rapidly, hoping to quell the burning heat his pussy had surged with, and barely holding back the moan that was fighting him to escape. Looking up, Jack saw that Lacy was in similar straits, as she was also slightly slouched, but instead of rubbing her thighs, she had pulled the table cloth over her lap, and had apparently moved to straight up rubbing her crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shuddering at the sight, and a minor vision of Lacy stroking her tool openly in the restaurant breaks Jack's hold on his mouth, and a low moan escapes his lips, causing him to still, eyes darting around rapidly to see if anyone had heard or noticed the sound. After a few moments of panicked searching, Jack sees that no one had heard it, but one person apparently had watched the table, and had an amused look on their face. Focusing on the individual, Jack sees it's 'Sarah', who after noticing Jack's attention on her, winks, then goes back to addressing another table she apparently was serving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The sound of a zipper slowly being undone snaps Jack's attention back to the table, and a small wave of Lust surges through him again, at the knowledge of what Lacy had done, in public no less! Biting his lip, and fighting to keep control of himself, Jack is startled by the sudden voice that speaks to him during his struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0' You know Jack, I'm pretty sure that if we work together, we can help Lacy and yourself out, as well as not get caught. Especially as it seems Lilith will keep tormenting you two until something happens, as she apparently is alternating on who she spikes with Lust at random intervals.' 'Lacy' says, sounding slightly strained, but also spot on, as another wave of Lust washes over Jack, shaking loose another low moan, and causing him to quickly look around again to see if they had been caught. Seeing they still were in the clear, Jack feels a thrill at the fact that he was able to act so wantonly (even if it was unintentional) in public, and not get caught. Shuddering at the sensation of his thoughts, Jack focuses back on what 'Lacy' had said, and fires off a question, hoping to get an answer before Lilith strikes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'What exactly do you mean, and have in mind, since I would assume you have a plan if you're speaking up right now?' Jack asks, looking over and seeing Lacy slide somewhat further down in her seat, as her eyes begin to slightly glaze over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Simple, if we work together, we can cast a spell to somewhat help others ignore what is going on at the table, while you try to both get a release, as that would be the most likely end result the spell is looking for. The only downside is that your control isn't good enough for the spell to last forever, and if you get too distracted, then it might break entirely. If we're going to do it though, we'll have to do so in the next minute, as pretty soon your Lust will overwhelm your conscious mind and at that point, casting a spell would be a bad idea.' 'Lacy' quickly explains, sounding rushed and finishing just before Jack feels yet another wave wash over him, and he slides further into his seat, quickly copying Lacy's idea of the table cloth somewhat hiding his actions, and quickly reaching down to start stimulating his pussy, which seems to have drenched his panties already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sighing in defeat, Jack quickly accepts 'Lacy's' plan, getting an explanation on the crafting of the on-the-spot spell, and hoping that it will work. Moments go by, and as Jack finishes following the laid out instructions, he feels slightly drained, and senses a slight bubble around the table, invisible, but he could just 'tell' it was there. Assuming that it worked, Jack feels relieved, but then also worried, as he doesn't exactly want to mount Lacy and ride her in front of everyone. While exciting, he knew he wouldn't be able to maintain the spell and keep up the act of sex, not with how turned on and pleasurable the act would leave him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Jack, I know you're distracted and horny right now, but don't over think it, simply go and eat her 'breadstick', while playing with yourself, you'll both enjoy it...now go, it's not exactly a picnic in here!' 'Lacy says hurriedly, and Jack slides under the table and onto his knees, not even bothering to try to guess what sort of trouble 'Lacy' is having if she's prompting Jack forward in such an anxious tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adjusting his dress to allow him to knee-walk over to Lacy's exposed and stiff crotch, and slightly gasping at the sight, as well as the naughty thrill that courses through him at the realization that he's about to have oral sex in a restaurant full of people, Jack quickly moves forward. Reaching Lacy, and gently easing her legs open a bit wider, Jack finally gets Lacy's unyielding hands off her crotch after leaning in and lightly licking her stiff rod. Lacy stills at the sudden sensation, and Jack takes the moment to get her hands away, and apply his own, not as tight or rigid as Lacy's hold had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Slowly, Jack starts to pump Lacy's shaft, lightly licking it at random intervals while pecking the tip with an occasional kiss of her lips. This goes on for nearly a minute before Jack hears a growl and feels hands suddenly grip his head. Feeling shocked at the sudden action, as well as secretly aroused at the feeling of Lacy momentarily taking control, Jack finds his head forced down and quickly opens his mouth in time to swallow down Lacy's cock. Jack's mouth is filled, and after a moment, has to change his position to avoid nearly gagging as Lacy keeps shoving, only stopping when she's pushed Jack's face into her pelvis, partially lodged in throat and groaning loudly at the sensations of Jack's  near choking caused on her cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With 'Lacy's' help, Jack was able to relax his throat, as well as not panic at the unusual feeling of something stiff and large being shoved nearly down his throat. Breathing through his nose, Jack waits, and finally feels Lacy's grip loosen up enough to where her hands are merely resting on Jack's head. Taking that as a sign to continue, Jack slowly lifts his head up, while letting 'Lacy' help with different actions to preform, as Jack felt out of his depth on giving a blowjob, especially to one that had nearly escalated into a deepthroating experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Lacy' starts to swirl her tongue and hum while finding a steady rhythm for her bobbing, while slowly moving one of 'her' hands down to her own drenched pussy, and letting the hand gripping Lacy's chair shift to where it could start to fondle her balls. Minutes go by, the only sound that 'Lacy' and Jack paying attention to is the low and lengthy groans of pleasure Lacy lets out in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feeling their shared jaw start to ache, 'Lacy' picks up the pace, and finally feels Lacy flinch, indicating that she was close to her release. Deciding to have her own fun, 'Lacy' scrapes 'her' teeth along the edges on her last bob upwards, and hears a hiss before rapidly ceding control fully to Jack, who in his surprise stops mid bob. Lacy, feeling the start of her orgasm being denied abruptly, grabs Jack's head and slams it down, finally cumming and not caring about the how or why, roaring in ecstasy from finally finding release. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack felt control of his body return, and was reasonably shocked, which morphed into a mixture of confusion as well as arousal, as his head is suddenly slammed downward onto Lacy's throbbing member, and feels it suddenly bulge, then release forcefully. Not exactly prepared, but thinking on his feet, Jack quickly closes his mouth, only a little of Lacy's release dribbling down his now sealed lips, and quickly drinking down the rest of the orgasm. After what felt like minutes later, Lacy lets go of Jack's head, who slowly retracts his head off of Lacy's still slightly hard cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swallowing one last bit that was in his mouth, Jack feels a mixture of disgust, but also strangely happiness. It was a conflict of emotions to the former male, as he honestly had never thought about giving head before, but after that intense recent experience, he didn't know if it was his bodies hormones and memories, or his own interests, but he felt some thrill at the action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shaking his head, and feeling slightly frustrated that he didn't get his own release, Jack starts to return to his seat, happily noticing that the spell he cast before is still holding. Sliding out from under the table, and back into his seat, Jack sees 'Sarah' standing there, but...<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

A few minutes later and Jack and an apparently invisible to everyone else Lilith are slowly walking aimlessly down the street, while discussing various things he should know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"So most mythological creatures are real, but they all also seem to either be in hiding, extinct, or doing something else?\" Jack asks Lilith, after hearing about some of the things he should look out for in every day life if his instincts start to go off about 'something being wrong'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Yeah, it's a bit of a shock for this day and age, but be glad that you're not high up on the food chain for most creatures.

His heart began to slow after a minute or two as he sat alone at the table.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoo!\u201d came a voice from right next to Jack, jarring him from his feeling of security.  \u201cHoly shit!\u201d Jack practically exclaimed as he looked in the direction of the voice and his eyes fell upon Lilith, inexplicably sitting next to him.  Her wavy red hair framed a beautiful face adorned with a lustful smile and green eyes that seemed to penetrate into his very soul.  \u201cWhat the hell\u2026.\u201d Jack stuttered, \u201chow did you get here?\u201d he asked as he tried to keep quiet.  \u201cI\u2019m tied to you, Master,\u201d Lilith declared, \u201cyou could go all the way to China, and I\u2019d still be able to find you in half a heartbeat,\u201d she concluded with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack sat back in his seat, seeming to concede defeat.  He realized he could probably never get away from Lilith.  \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d Jack asked, almost pleading.  Lilith smiled and chuckled, causing a mighty jiggle from the wonderful globes on her chest.  \u201cMaster, \u201c she began, \u201cI want to help you.  I want to teach you to harness the power of sex, the power that flows through your veins and mine, the power you\u2019ve barely begun to glimpse,\u201d she declared.  Lilith paused for a moment.  \u201cLet\u2019s start simple, Master,\u201d she began, \u201csurely there is someone you want?  A woman you deeply desire but can\u2019t have just yet?\u201d she said with a knowing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack paused for a moment as his mind swam with the possibilities.  What powers did Lilith have?  What powers did he now have?  Could he make Sarah love him?  He suddenly snapped back to reality and looked upon Lilith\u2019s anxious gaze.  \u201cSarah,\u201d Jack announced, \u201cSarah Saunders from school.\u201d Lilith beamed.  \u201cWonderful, Master,\u201d she said as she placed her hand on Jack\u2019s shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jack\u2019s whole world shuddered and shifted.  His vision went fuzzy, and clearness of vision, when it came, revealed that Jack was no longer in the coffee shop.  Jack realized he was now standing up, and Lilith stood across from him with a smile on her face.  \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Jack asked, confused as he looked about at what appeared to be a residential neighborhood.  Lilith motioned to an average-sized house the two were not far from.  \u201cThis is the home of the woman you love,\u201d she said, \u201cthis is Sarah Saunders\u2019s house, and we\u2019re going to go and get her,\u201d Lilith said, \u201cor we\u2019re at least going to test the waters a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was pensive.  This whole thing was new to him, of course.  He rubbed his chin as he weighed this in his head.  He then glanced at Lilith and smiled.  \u201cWhat do we have to do?\u201d he asked.  \u201cThis way, Master,\u201d Lilith said as she led Jack toward the door of the house.  \u201cRemember, Master, you are the only one who can see me,\u201d Lilith said as Jack knocked on the door.  The two waited a few seconds.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door came open, and Jack gazed upon a woman who was unfamiliar to him.  This woman seemed to be in her mid-40s.  She was about six inches shorter than Jack was, and so he looked down upon her pleasant face.  Dark hair hung down from her head past her shoulders.  Her smile was broad and beautiful, though age had begun to show in her face, as there was an odd wrinkle here and there.  Still, the woman was really quite pretty.  Her figure was impressive too; she was not stick-thin by any means.  She was instead wonderfully curvy and full-bodied, complete with broad, child-bearing hips, a slight pouch in her belly, and a wonderfully full set of breasts adorning her chest.  All of this was encased in a tight-fitting dress with a low-cut neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?  Can I help you?\u201d the woman asked.  Jack pried his eyes from the woman\u2019s chest.  \u201cYes mam, I\u2019m Jack, and I\u2019m a friend of Sarah Saunders.  I\u2019m actually here to see her if I could,\u201d he said.  The woman stepped back from the door as she invited Jack and his unseen companion to enter.  \u201cCome in,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m Sarah\u2019s mother Susan,\u201d the woman declared, \u201care you going to dinner too?\u201d  Jack was perplexed.  \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked.  Susan explained, \u201cWell, I know Sarah and Lisa are having dinner tonight, and I wondered if you were going too\u2026\u201d she asked.  Jack quickly recovered with a handy lie.  \u201cYes, oh yeah we\u2019re all going to the restaurant together,\u201d he said.  \u201cThis may change our plan, Master,\u201d Lilith said.  Jack and Lilith headed upstairs toward Sarah\u2019s room to wait for her to get back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack opened the door to Sarah\u2019s room\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)\tLisa is already there awaiting Sarah\u2019s arrival.

Opening the door cautiously, Jack slowly walks in, and is immediately drawn to the sole occupant of the room. Standing with her back to the door, a teenage girl with blonde streaks flowing through brunette locks of hair. Wearing a casual top, and pleated skirt that went to her knees, she didn't look that impressive to Jack, but then he noticed something that look like she had ears on top of her head. Pain lances through Jack's head, causing him to hiss and clutch it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking a moment to work through the pain, Jack looks back towards who he assumes is Lisa, and sees no extra additions to her head, but does see a glare resting upon him. Pausing in his observance, Jack's eyes are drawn to her eyes, which on first glance looked brown, but after gazing at them for a few more moments, seem to slowly morph into an amber color. Another lance of pain, this time more sharp, hits Jack's head, causing him to nearly stumble, and almost miss what Lilith exclaims while apparently bursting into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Careful Master, she's not a normal person, you need to stay back for the moment, as you are not strong enough to fight her it seems,\" Lilith warns, while rushing to flank 'Lisa'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking Lilith's words to heart, but making sure not to give any indication as to anything happening aside from his headache, Jack begins gathering his wits to try conversing with this girl, but is cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"What is a lowly beast of your kind doing in this house, as well as my territory, worm?\" 'Lisa' asks harshly, her tone threaded with derision and scorn, as if Jack should not even exist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Huh? I don't know what you're talking about, I'm here to go to dinner with Sarah and her friend Lisa....are you Lisa?\" Jack deflects, hoping that Lilith has a plan, as apparently this being is unable to see her thankfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"You wish to play stupid, little sex mage? So be it, I will end your existence for the indignity of being in my presence without proper tribute or grovelling for forgiveness!\" 'Lisa' states imperiously, holding out a hand, where a ball of fire seems to be forming slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just as Jack wonders if he's about to die, Lilith appears behind 'Lisa' and seems to strike at the base of her spine with a glowing hand. After the strike hits, distracting 'Lisa', she collapses bonelessly to the ground, as strange symbols appear all over her skin. Happy that Lilith came through, and curious as to what the hell is going on, Jack closes the door to the room, and looks towards Lilith questioningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"While I'm happy that your plan worked, it would have been nice if you could have filled me in on what it was. Also, any idea what is going on here? I can assume she has magic, as people normally cannot form fire out of thin air.\" Jack directs towards Lilith, while occasionally looking down at the semi-struggling 'Lisa'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah, sorry about that Master, but I did not know how much time i would have to do anything, and your reactions needed to appear natural, or as close to it, to keep her focused on you. If she's what i think she is, a bit more focus and less arrogance would have had her being able to see me possibly, if not feel my presence,\" Lilith explains sheepishly, somewhat embarrassed that she forgot to go over some form of protection for Jack. She also cant help but feel it's not exactly her fault, 'I'm a Succubus, I'm easily distracted by sex and mischief!' Lilith thinks, not willing to voice such a reason until the situation was resolved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Understandable, but do you know what exactly she is? I felt like I could see different things about her appearance, but then I would suddenly feel sudden pain, and lose what I thought I was seeing,\" Jack responds. Seeing the grin form on Lilith's face, Jack suddenly feels a slight sympathy for whatever is currently bound on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, I do indeed know what is on the floor, and I'm quite shocked that it's arrogance has grown so much since my last release. May I introduce you to one of the last yokia like creatures from myth that I've run across, the Legendary Kitsune no Yoko!\" Lilith says, while pompously waving her hands over the figure, causing it to lift off the ground, and start to slowly rotate in place. Said figure is glaring murderously, as if wishing it could somehow cause instant combustion or something as equally destructive, with it's gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Kitsune no Yoko .... you mean like that creature that tricks people and usually is good with illusions?\" Jack questions, gaining more interest on the suddenly squirming captive?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Depending on how the myths have changed, most likely, and yes, they do have good illusion work, but it mostly depends on their alignment that makes them so interesting. This one seems to be able to hide its alignment, as well as the amount of tails.\" Lilith explains. Upon hearing this, the struggles cease momentarily, and a look of supreme smugness can be seen in the captives eyes. It is shortly shattered by Lilith's words and malevolent looking smile upon seeing the kitsune's mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, don't feel too smug little fox. You're currently bound, and the only thing that is keeping you alive currently is my Master's interest and the fact that you were so easy to subdue, meaning that while possibly powerful, you're young and inexperienced.\" Lilith taunts, each word making the previously arrogant Kitsune shrink in on itself, radiating embarrassment and humilliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"So what would you suggest here Lilith? While I know you were planning on helping me with Sarah, this seems slightly more important, and also more interesting than the previous plans,\" Jack asks, his attention drawn to the suddenly ramrod posture the fox takes upon hearing his question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, first, would be to determine if 'Lisa' is being possessed, or if it's the product of the kitsune's shape-shifting power. After that, well, normally i wouldn't suggest this, but it is a prime opportunity Master,\" Lilith assess' aloud, then stops, while looking between Jack and the Kitsune, seeming to be debating about some action. Just as he's about to prompt her to continue, Jack is drawn back to the sudden shout of fear from the still floating fox, who seems to have been un-silenced abruptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"As you recall Master, I did mention that you would lose me if you bound another succubus to yourself, as that would break the bond in place, but that does not stop you from taking on other servants. In this case, I'd suggest you bind this Kitsune, who has powers and a nature similar to mine, and also open up an avenue to different fields of magic, as whatever your servant can do, you in theory can learn as well.\" Lilith explains, while walking towards the quite frightened fox, that seems to be muttering something barely audible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"While that does sound like an idea, what would we do if I didn't take that option?\" Jack asks, feeling slightly guilty that he was considering enslaving a sentient creature, but also extremely turned on from the stories he had come across about this particular branch of Youkai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I'd be highly disappointed Master, but if that is your wish, we could simply erase her memories, or compel her into working with us, depending on what you wish to do from that point,\" Lilith states, pouting and sounding as if he had just told her he was denying her sex for a week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking it all into account, Jack decides...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Upon seeing Jacks face firm up, Lilith sighs, having apparently read Jack's intentions, and snapped her fingers, causing the bound Kitsune to be floated to in front of Jack, at eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Before you answer, consider a few things 'Lisa',\" Jack starts off, showing some hints of disbelief at the foxes name. \"I'm not in the mood for games, and my mischievous and sexy compainion - ,\" Jack gets out, before being interrupted by Lilith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Aww, you do notice and care Master, it makes me all warm and fuzzy inside....or maybe that's just my unquenchable lust for you and sex in general,\" Lilith teases, interrupting Jack and causing him to slightly wonder if there was a way to silence her momentarily. Seeing the smirk appear on her lips, and her motioning in a universal mouth zipped pantomime, Jack decides to ignore the interruption, and continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I was saying, I'm not in the mood, and Lilith over there wishes to do things to you that you most likely wouldn't enjoy willingly. That said, as long as you answer truthfully, and don't try anything, I'm willing to offer you a deal at the end of this discussion. Nod if you understand,\" Jack states seriously, hoping that his impromptu plan might work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hearing the choices before her, the Kitsune nods, and awaits Jacks questions. Seeing this, Jack decides to start off with some simple questions, before moving on to what he really wants to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Are you actually Lisa, or are you possessing her like Lilith said your species could?\" Jack asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking a moment to consider it, 'Lisa' finally responds with a surprising answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"A bit of both technically. Another Youkai owed me a favor, and made a type of golem/doll that i could possess for long periods of time, if i'm low on the energy i need. Instead of me having to feast on Lust or human souls, or drain the magic out of other species, i can possess this doll, and use less energy and keep my possible supplies alive. So in answer to your question, I technically am 'Lisa', but I'm also not truly her, as she's a construct,\" the Kitsune explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hiding his shock at what magic can do, and somewhat surprised at such an application, Jack refocuses, and schools his features to give nothing away (he hopes).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Ok, in that case, I can assume that you were going to use Sarah tonight as a feeding supply tonight, my question is, would she be alright after this, or would she be injured or dead,\" Jack asks in a tone that sounds slightly angry at the prospect of any answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"She would have been alright, but two or more feedings like I had planned tonight might have killed her, or severely weakened her immune system enough to cause a natural disease to affect her,\" the fox answers, after realizing that any mis-truth at this point could be potentially worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Sighing in relief, Jack is glad that he caught this in time, even if he hadn't known Sarah was in danger. Turning his attention away from his crush, Jack decides to get towards the important question, before his offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Aside from you, are there any other supernatural creatures roaming the city, and if so, are they a potential danger to Lilith and I?\" Jack questions, hoping that it won't be too bad of an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Long moments drag on as the Kitsune seems to be pondering how to answer the query, until a gentle shock runs through her system, starting at her exposed tail, and running through her body and ending at the tips of her exposed ears. Shuddering from the pain, and partial pleasure elicited from the jolt, the Kitsune speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Ahh! That was kind of uncalled for, I was merely trying to figure out how to accurately answer his question <i><b>Baishunpu </b></i>(1). As to your question, the 'supernatural population' if you wish to call it, fluctuates weekly, if not daily, as many are not limited to mundane transportation. I've seen vampires pop into the city and then hear about them being in Paris, France less than 5 hours after I saw them. I've heard the local gorgon took 3 weeks to move on, while a random basilisk on stayed in town for an hour, before moving on. So there isn't a solid answer to the first part of your question, but as to being a danger to you, yes, as you are right now, the only thing protecting you is your pet <i><b>Baishunpu</b></i>. \" 'Lisa' finishes, looking slightly smug at the end, before another shock runs through her body again, causing her to moan and shudder more than the previous shock had caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"That wasn't very nice, you should be more respectful towards the mortal that holds your life in his hands, little <i><b>Meinu</b></i> (2).\" Lilith states in a slightly aggravated tone. Jack wasn't sure if  it was because of the constant put downs on her status, or the implied threat Jack faced. Shrugging, Jack decides to finish up, before Sarah shows up and walks into this 'moonlit world'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"While I can't agree with her methods, Lilith had a point, I've been cordial with you, when I could have let her have her way with you, especially after you threatened me. In any case, my offer is this, either enter into a contract or bond with me, or have your memory erased by Lilith, who might do something extra to you since you seem to be pissing her off. The only other thing I can offer is a quick death if neither option appeals.\" Jack says, looking serious and hoping that he doesn't have to kill someone else. Normally he would be against such an action, but when dealing with the supernatural, Jack realizes the normal rules might not apply, if anime, movies, comics, and lore books are anything to go by!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, there is one other option, but its only valid if she wishes to die Master. You could drain her of her power and essence, essentially turning her mortal, and making yourself at least half-Kitsune and half-Human. It would open up more magic avenues for you, and you would possibly be able to pass yourself off as a Youkia if someone wanted to hunt a new human warlock.\" Lilith interjects after Jack finishes explaining some options to the bound fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Upon hearing that option, the Kitsune starts squirming in place, and opening her mouth to scream, only to find no sound coming out. Surprised, Jack looks up, and sees a glowing symbol hovering before Lilith's index finger, apparently silencing 'Lisa'. Bemused, and grateful for her quick thinking, Jack nods in appreciation towards Lilith, who smirks back and wiggles her eyebrows, making Jack wonder if he missed something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Long minutes later 'Lisa' seems to stop struggling, and her mouth seems to have stopped moving. After another minute of waiting, the glow dissipates from Lilith's finger, and the sound of breathing can be heard from the Kitsune again. Upon realizing that she can be heard again, the Kitsune draws in breath, apparently readying for either screaming or something, before Jack interrupts with a final statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Continue yelling, and I might decide to let Lilith choose your fate, as I have been waiting to hear what you wanted, you have been acting childishly, which makes me wonder if you can even contemplate your situation. At this point, I'll give you another few minutes to decide, but at this point, I'm thinking of just letting her decide,\" Jack says, looking annoyed and sounding completely dismissive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Silence fills the room again, without magical help this time, as the fox spends almost a minute just staring in shock at Jack's most recent words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Four minutes until I pick something, little <i><b>Meinu</b></i>,\" Lilith whispers loudly next to 'Lisa's' ear, sending a shiver of fear through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Just as time was about to be up, 'Lisa' speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"I ....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b><font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">1)Japanese for whore</font></b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><i><b>2) Japanese for bitch</b></i></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

It won't hurt, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith shakes her head. \"No, Master, it won't hurt her. Unfortunately.\" She shot a malicious look towards the kitsune, who squirmed in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Through blood. Every binding contract works through blood, Master. You take her blood in hand, and you cast a binding spell. Don't worry, I'll help with the spell.\" Then, Lilith grinned. \"And the blood...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Lisa' squirmed some more, before offering a palm. \"Please... don't let her kill me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry, little <i>meinu</i>, you'll live.\" Lilith shot back. \"Now stop your games.\" Seeing Jack's confused look, she explained. \"That's a shell, remember? You take her blood and all you'll get is a contract with a very high quality doll. Nothing more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack watched as 'Lisa' winced. \"Fine...\" she said. Her eyes rolled back into her head, and 'Lisa' collapsed. From her back, ethereal at first, rose the form of a fox. When she emerged completely, she had become completely solid. White with streaks of orange, and most definitely adolescent, she did look very striking - and pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft. Only one tail.\" Lilith laughed. \"Still just a child playing adult games.\" Jack raised his eyebrows. Lilith continued. \"Kitsune can have up to nine tails, gaining more as their power grows. It's very rare to see more than five, and there have only ever been a handful of known nine-tailed kitsune. This little one has only one, so she can't even shapeshift - just occupy that shell over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I just...\" Jack reached out to the fox, who turned around and shook her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFast as lightning, Lilith jumped in front of Jack, grabbed Lisa's tail and flung her against the wall. Lisa let out a yelp and crumpled. \"Try that again, and <i>I'll</i> bind you.\" Lilith spat. Not even waiting for Jack to show his confusion this time, she continued. \"Even a young kitsune can cast a wicked curse if someone grabs their tail. She was trying to trick you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith took another step forward, motioning with her hands. Lisa was pulled up the wall by an unseen force until she hung, belly exposed and tail secured, against the wall. Lilith beckoned to Jack, who approached. With great glee she drew a sharp fingernail across Lisa's chin, causing a few droplets of blood to appear. They dropped right into Jack's waiting hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack made a fist, clenching the blood in his hand. Lilith began to chant, and Jack felt an energy crackle through everyone in the room. It dissipated, and Jack noticed a new feeling. It was subtle, and similar to when he had accidentally summoned Lilith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go.\" Lilith said, dropping Lisa to the floor. \"She's all yours.\" Jack noticed Lisa didn't seem any different. \"And as a plus, you're now immune to most fox curses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet\" Jack muttered. \"Lisa... or whatever your name is. I'll call you Lisa. You should probably get back in your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa nodded and obediently re-possessed her homunculus. Showing more familiar human emotion, Jack noticed she looked defeated. Which she was, in a way. So what now?</span></div></div>",

Minutes of straining his mind seemed to bear no fruit, he just didn't feel any different. Opening his eyes, Jack jumps back in surprise, as Lilith's face had loomed in front of his as he opened them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Wow, I came over to see what you were doing Master, but I didn't think you were that focused on whatever you were up to,\" Lilith stated, holding back laughter with apparent effort, but not even trying to hide the wide grin plastered over her face. Shaking his head in silent exasperation, Jack decides to ask Lilith for advice on figuring out how to feel and use his new powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Hey Lilith, out of random curiosity, how would I be able to differentiate between my 'Warlock' powers and my new 'Kitsune' powers? Also, is there any way you could help me figure out what all I can do currently?\" Jack asks, trying to be polite, and not sound too eager. 'While powers of Lust and sex are interesting, getting even more exotic and possibly easier powers is exciting' Jack thinks to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Chuckling, Lilith looks Jack in the eye, before striking a sexy pose, with hand on her hip, cocked to the side, and an eyebrow arched as if questioning his most recent thought. Squirming in place, and hoping that he didn't just accidentally broadcast such a thing towards her, Jack opens his mouth to try to dig himself out of a possible hole, when Lilith breaks her pose, and nearly falls over in laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ha ha ha, oh, that was a good one Master. To alleviate your concerns, no, I'm not offended about your current excitement over new powers. No you didn't broadcast the thoughts, per sey, but as I'm bound to you more tightly than the fox, and it is a more symbiotic bond, I can technically read your thoughts whenever I wish. Not to mention most succubus that reach past 500 years develop some form of telepathy....usually. And as towards detecting your powers...in time you could learn to differentiate it on your own, but right now you would either need help, or a catalyst to help. As to your possible powers....\" Lilith explains, still shaking with light laughter, but getting her explanation out, only stopping fully when reaching her final response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Curious about what she trailed off about, Jack decides to look over at Lisa, who's been quiet the whole time. Seeing her still looking dejected, Jack wonders if he should try to lighten her mood, or do something so she doesn't feel so upset, when Lilith starts speaking, drawing his attention back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I can help you out with learning what powers you possibly have, as in most cases, their are basic powers that all Kitsune have, but as to your new Alignment type, I would honestly have to deffer to her\" Lilith says to Jack, finishing her answer by pointing towards Lisa, who looks up after hearing about deferment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Some common powers that all Kitsune seem to have is minor and advanced Illusion crafting. foxfire, which contrary to its name, is a non-elemental damaging magic attack. Shape-shifting, which could help you with your warlock training, and possibly augment it later. Possession of others, as <i>Meinu</i> has shown some effects of, though normally Kitsune don't possess golem/dolls, as their are hazards to such.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Wait, aren't you, and me by extension, able to do some, if not most of the things you've listed so far?\" Jack interrupts, curious as to the similarities between the two races.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah, you noticed that Master? Yes, Kitsune and Succubi do share many of the same possible powers, the only difference being the race, and also Kitsune are considered 'natural' for the supernatural world, while demons are considered 'outsiders'. As to a few more powers you might have, though we'll have to figure out some way to differentiate which set actually grants you such; life absorption, increased lifespan, intangibility of sorts, some nature manipulation, and also curses.\" Lilith finishes, looking appraisingly between both Jack and Lisa, who seems to be paying attention to the conversation now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Wow, sounds like Kitsune are the Youkai  equivalent of a succubus, which is interesting, but also makes me wonder why you two don't get along. Is it a 'professional opponents' kind of thing, or does the two races have some kind of feud going on?\" Jack asks, even more curious after hearing so many powers in common, as well as such similar backgrounds in mythology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It's a bit of a mix between the two, as we both hunt humans for their life energy, as well as the fact that both factions have done terrible things to one another across the time we both came into contact. They've assassinated the ruler of hell a few times, we've kidnapped and subjugated the then leader of the Kitsune faction. It kind of goes back and forth.....drawing on your memories, it's similar to the 'Hatfields and McCoys'.\" Lilith responds, seeming bemused after referencing such a popular history example.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Deciding on leaving that till later, Jack decides to redirect the conversation back towards his new powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"So any idea on how to figure out what powers are fox based, and which are warlock based, at least in my case? Also, why did you look between Lisa and I so curiously earlier?\" Jack asks, curious as to what the look had meant, as it seemed slightly out of place during the previous conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh. Well I was considering an unusual idea on possibly helping you adapt to your new powers. Granted you might get some side-effects, but that's to be expected, as you now have a foreign energy altering your DNA to help you channel something humans normally can't. Technically the same would, and may happen through our bond, if you don't die before your first maturation. One way to speed up the process would be for you to gain experience rapidly, which would force your body to adapt quicker. Another would be to start preforming rituals to speed up the process, but those can inversely be costly. It mostly depends on your choices Master. If you go at a slow pace, and don't do too much magic, nor gain much experience, your first maturation might be in six to eight months, if not a year.\" Lilith explains, slowly walking around the room and inspecting it like one would see others doing in a museum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"That slow path doesn't sound so bad, but I get the feeling there is something wrong with it?\" Jack asks, knowing it would be better to know what all his options entailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Correct Master. In your case, the longer you go without any real training in the 'Warlock' domain, the harder it will be to control your passive abilities, for example, the pheromones you subconsciously release. After some time, Warlocks are able to control the output of it, to be either nearly zero, or to be able to flood a decent sized area in moments. Without training, you'll be turning yourself into a beacon for all the supernatural that Lisa listed off earlier.\" Lilith responds, sounding slightly happy that Jack was at least willing to not ignore his current situation, like some previous masters had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ok, so no putting off training, and possibly focus on it soon if I can. What was your idea about possibly accelerating or adapting to my new powers?\" Jack questioned, hoping that the smile that formed on Lilith's face, as she turned around part way through his question, didn't entail something truly horrible or embarrassing for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The quickest way for either path is actually quite simple Master. In this case, you could possess either me or Lisa here, and live out a few days as us. Inversely, you could have us hitch a ride in you, and let you stay in control. Either way is nearly the same speed for your adaption, but each lets you access different powers, while either of us possessing you, with you still in control, would merely let you have us as guides, as well as increasing the available energy you would have to draw on for spells. Those are the fast, but unusual ideas I came up with, and depending on if you chose one, we would need to prepare around such a decision as well.\" Lilith cheerfully answers, grinning as if nothing she has said sounded the least bit out of the ordinary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Jack, on the other hand, was both confused, and slightly intrigued by what Lilith had offered. Granted, he was slightly frightened by the prospect of forcefully accelerating this 'maturation' she mentioned, not to mention the 'fast' method she suggested. Jack also couldn't deny that he was curious how exactly some of the things she had mentioned would work, especially if he was either in a new body, or had guides that could possibly help if he screwed up with whatever he attempted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thinking it over, Jack decided...</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was tempted to just wait, but he also didn't want to end up as lunch for a random vampire or other boogeymonster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" Lilith exclaimed, appearing right in front of him. \"Now, this is going to feel a little weird...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith proceeded to whack him on the forehead with two fingers. Jack's vision blurred, then went black entirely. When he awoke, he was very disoriented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" He groaned. His head felt like it was spinning. He closed his eyes, hoping to regain some semblance of clarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me help you with that\" came a sweet, unfamiliar and distinctly feminine voice from inside his head. Jack felt a faint ringing, then his headache subsided. He opened his eyes to see Lilith grinning at him. Behind her was... his body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fu-\" Jack exclaimed before Lilith silenced him. That was strange. His voice had sounded different, too. He looked down at himself, and saw Lisa's shirt, breasts (he gulped), skirt and shapely legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh, calm down.\" Lilith said. \"I told you it'd feel weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, so I'm really Lisa now?\" Jack whispered in his new, girly voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep\" whispered the voice inside his head. That was evidently the real Lisa, while Jack was riding along in her doll. A very realistic doll, Jack thought to himself as a shiver went down his spine. \"Oh yeah it's very real,\" Lisa teased, and Jack felt a surge of pleasure in his nether regions. His hands rushed there, feeling at his new nethers through the fabric of the skirt. \"One of the perks of this doll... I have my own control panel.\" Lisa smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, kids, I've got business to take care of, have fun!\" Lilith said  as she waved to you. Then, she grabbed your body and disappeared in a puff of scarlet smoke, taking your body with her. Not five seconds after she disappeared, Sarah walks in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, Lisa.\" Sarah said. \" Mom says dinner won't be ready for another half hour, so get comfortable\" she continued, motioning for you to sit. You began to panic. What were you going to do? You had no idea what girls did in their spare time. You'd usually just played video games or something, but neither Lisa or Sarah seemed the type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\" You thought at Lisa, hoping she would be of some use to you in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe... well at this point I usually just enthrall her.\" Lisa giggled. \"But if you're gonna do this the honest way... gossip? It's a start at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know what to do, even with that.</span></div></div>",

Lilith, seeing an opportunity for mischief, as well as a new learning experience, moves out of Jacks view, and starts sub-vocalizing some spells on all the participants of the room. The only one to notice, and recognize what a few of them were, was Lisa, whose defeated look slowly morphed into a confused, and slightly amused look, breaking Jack from his musings, as well as the voice behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"So, Lisa, are we still on for dinner tonight, and if so, any reason my mom just said Jack is joining us?\" ask Sarah, who sounded bemused by the befuddled look that spread across Jack's face as he turned around quickly to see the newest occupant of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Surprised, and feeling slightly unbalanced for some reason while twisting around to see Sarah has arrived without his noticing, Jack nearly falls over. Stumbling and catching himself, Jack forcibly calms himself before putting a smile on, as he wonders on what Lisa will respond with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yeah, were still on for dinner, and I invited Jack along because he came over to ask me a few questions, and I felt him having to go out of his way to find me deserved some compensation. Apparently he had tried the school first, then the library, and then ran across Rachel who said mentioned I would be here for a short while, and she gave him the address. <b><i>I hope you don't mind, especially since you two might be good friends if we all hung out together more often.</i></b>\" Lisa explains, spinning a tale that sounds reasonable. Jack stiffens near the end of it though, as he feels a wash of some kind of energy flow over the room, emanating from Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[A minor compulsion master, nothing to worry about. It merely shows how she's integrated herself into Sarah's life] Jack hears inside his mind, in the voice of Lilith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Holding his calm facade, Jack wonders what else his succubus can do, as he didn't know telepathy was a possibility. Hearing a mental snicker resound through his mind, but unable to turn around to look for her, Jack minutely shrugs his shoulders, as he doesn't want to act erratic in front of Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[There is plenty succubi can do master, but in this case, 'telepathy' is more along the lines of our bond the Book established between us. In any case, relax, and enjoy a night with your crush, as well as your newest servant.] Lilith responds to Jacks mental musings, ending with a titter that sounds out of place at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\" - to go yet?\" Sarah asks aloud, looking at both Lisa and Jack with a slightly glazed look over her eyes. Shaking himself, Jack looks over towards Lisa and sees her nod, so turns back and does the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0In response, Sarah turns around silently and leads the way out of the room, with Jack following, while Lisa pauses momentarily at the door, to look askance at the last occupant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Any reason you layered spells on all of us without telling ... <b><i>Master</i></b>?\" Lisa asks, grounding out the last bit like it was physically painful to acknowledge her new status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Smirking, Lilith decides that she can give up some of the game, if only to have a willing, and possibly eager, participant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, if the night goes as I planned, you get some extra energy, Master gets the girl, some fun, and I get some entertainment, and Sarah doesn't get drained to death by you,\" Lilith answers, smirking sexily while patting Lisa on the head, getting a growl in response, that shortly cuts out after a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Wait, what do you mean I'll get 'extra energy'? While he may be the Master, I know you formed the Contract for him, so you also hold sway over me, just not enough to make you my master as well.\" Lisa asks, confused and somewhat hopeful that her situation isn't as bleak as it seemed earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Simple, if you play along, I'll redirect some excess energy towards you, and possibly train you towards your second tail, since it seems your somewhat close enough. We can work out details later, but you might want to catch up, before you ruin my fun for the night.\" Lilith fires back, her smirk getting wider, especially after Lisa squeaks and starts moving rapidly to catch up to the pair ahead of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

Having already orders, and a lull in small talk while waiting for the appetizers, Jack wonders where Lilith is, as he hadn't seen her since Sarah showed up. Curious about what she could be up to, Jack is pulled from his thoughts as he feels another wash of energy pulse and move through the room, similar to what he felt Lisa do earlier, but this one felt different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Looking questioningly at Lisa, who seems to have stiffened upon feeling it as well, she looks over at Jack, and shakes her head, apparently indicating it wasn't her. Pausing in asking her thoughts on it, Jack feels another pulse, and moments after, has to stop himself from crying out in pain and excitement, as his body is flooded with sudden arousal and lust, his jeans feeling extremely tight in the crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Focusing his breathing, Jack slowly looks up, and sees that his current companions are in similar straits, as Lisa seems flush and lightly panting, and Sarah is similar, except also moaning lowly. Looking around, Jack notices that no one else in the immediate area seems to be having any issues. 'Guess Lilith is behind this then' Jack thinks to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[Correct Master. I thought I would help you loosen up, as well as learn a bit of magic control. Right now, you three are under a Lust Inducement spell, that will only get stronger the longer it is active, and will only abate with an orgasm. Tied to that is an Illusion of you three continuing small talk, as well as an aversion ward around the table. The control part of the lesson is simple - it's tied to your release and will power. The instant you cum, the illusion will shatter, but the longer you keep it up under such pressure, the better your control can become. Good luck, oh, and I left a surprise in case you tried to be boring. Have fun Master.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Shuddering as his Lust had just spiked again, Jack looks around again, and sees Lilith's words to be accurate, as the waiter with their appetizers seems to be looking around for the table, and not finding it. Looking over at Lisa, who seems to be fidgeting in her seat fighting the sensations as well as cursing quietly in a foreign language. As his gaze slides over the bound Kitsune, Jack looks towards Sarah, and doesn't see her in her seat. Confused, Jack looks around the room again, wondering how he could have missed her on his first pass, when he feels his jeans being slowly unzipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Shocked, Jack slowly lifts the table cloth up and sees a sight that had fueled many a fantasy, but could scarcely be believed at this moment. Under the table, on her knees, and slowly pulling Jacks pants open wide enough, and pulling down his boxers, was Sarah, his current crush. Shuddering and nearly orgasming from the mental euphoria of the sight and cool air that washed over his crotch, Jack refrains, using what mental will power he can muster, as it would be highly embarrassing for not only him, but Sarah also, to be caught in such a position in public. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Nearly convulsing from the situation, and fighting his hardest to not give in, Jack doesn't notice nor hear Lisa, who seems to have fixed her situation momentarily. Wondering if he can stop this, Jack tries to think of a way to get Sarah back in her seat quietly, and also not hurt her feelings, when his train of thought is crashed by physical stimulation. <br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n(Sarah's PoV from energy wave)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Sarah had been fighting the small feelings of lust that she had been feeling since seeing Jack in her room at home. She had noticed immediately that he seemed more attractive at that moment, than he had before. Not to say he was unattractive before, but for some reason he seemed to suddenly seem more interesting and handsome in that moment than he had previously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Shaking her head, Sarah tries to refocus on the conversation that seemed to be winding down at the table, when her body is suddenly hit by intense sensations of arousal and lust. 'God, it feels like everything is on fire and sensitive as fuck!' Sarah thought, while squirming in her seat, feeling flush and trying to keep herself from moaning loudly. Sadly, she couldn't hold back as a low moan just seems to continually escape her lips, as well as the constant feeling as if all her nerves were alight with smoldering arousal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Shuddering, and trying not to orgasm in public, Sarah tries to calm down enough to maybe make it to the bathroom. 'Maybe I can make it there and get control of myself', she thinks to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<i>'Or maybe i could have some naughty fun here, under the table? Maybe include Jack, since he seems more interesting today!'</i>came the sudden thought, that seemed to sound like her voice, but with a slight distortion, like a second voice inside the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Upon hearing that idea, Sarah has a mini-orgasm, nearly falling out of her seat, and only catching herself after a momentary sense of vertigo. Convulsing and slowly sliding herself silently under the table, Sarah slowly inches over towards Jack, not even thinking about the consequences of her current actions. Slowly, inch by inch, Sarah moves her self closer to Jack, and after long moments of quiet shuffling, she  is in front of his lower half of his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Reaching out with trepidation and excitement flooding her body, Sarah starts to undo Jacks button and zipper on his pants. Moments of fumbling leads to pulling down his pants, as well as pulling his boxers down. Not getting a no after pausing for a few moments, Sarah places a hand on Jack's fully erect penis.</span></span></div></div>",

That detail, while important, was only barely helping stave off his desire to release, and Sarah's more assured strokes were making it even more difficult. The only other thing helping Jack stave off his orgasm being him finally noticing Lisa being serene and calm, giving him a moment of distraction that helped to stave off his impending release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"H-ho-how are you not being affected by the s-sp-spell Lilith placed?\" Jack finally stutters out, having even more trouble as Sarah decides to start randomly licking his rigid tool, nearly breaking what willpower he has to keep from cumming on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, don't mind me, I'll be in trouble later myself, as my body technically is still feeling this, but I've shunted the sensations to go off later, so while I'm able to ignore it now, it will hit me all at once later. Sucks for future me, but present me is enjoying the show of your struggle and your pet's antics. Not to mention the amount of energy leaking from the area is supplying me with a decent meal. So all in all, I have a dinner and an amusing show in front of me, especially if <b><i>Her </i></b>little trap goes off.\" Lisa answers, completely calm and collected, the only indication of emotion being the serene smile and amused tone that emanates from her apparently disconnected shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Jack's attention is drawn back to Sarah, who has stopped stroking his cock for the moment, but just as Jack starts to feel relief, his world is engulfed in the sensation of a warm and wet sensation slowly covering the head of his dick. Biting his lip, Jack is able to use the pain to halt his impending release for a moment, but he knows that at this rate, its not a matter of if, but when, and he desperately hopes that he can find a way to avoid grabbing the rooms attention when the spell shatters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0His thoughts and worry are washed away as more and more of his cock is engulfed in a warm and wet enclosure, Sarah's mouth inching its way down towards Jack's pelvis, only slightly inching back before lowering farther each attempt, causing Jack to moan loudly from the multiple sensations assaulting his body and mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just when he feels that he's about to release, as Sarah is less than a centimeter away from deepthroating him and pushing her face flush with his pelvis, she stops, causing him to groan out, whether in relief or agony he couldn't honestly say. Just as he's about to speak up and beckon Sarah to stop, he feels a slight sucking sensation, eliciting a hiss as well as another groan from him, but surprisingly the sensation doesn't add to his feeling of a pending orgasm, instead it starts to feel like a disjointed pull on his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Slowly, Jack feels his body's physical senses dull, as if slowly losing a connection to them, all the while noticing that his vision is blurring and getting slightly dark. Just as his vision fades completely, Jack 'hears' a snap, and seems to float in a void for what feels like an eternity. Jack wonder's what is going on, as he feels no physical sensation, no vision or hearing around, just the 'feeling' of endless void surrounding him, even if he can't see or feel it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Jack finally starts to feel and see things again, though is completely confused about the return of such senses. The first thing Jack notices is the sense of having his mouth open and something inside of it, but not able to tell anything really, as his body feels numb, with only the dull sensation pressed against his tongue and throat being an indicator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Slowly, the rest of his senses begin to return, the first is the fell of a carpet beneath his feet, as well as a breeze blowing across his legs. 'Wait, wasn't I sitting in a chair, with my pants only unbuckled and partially pulled down?' Next Jack feels a burning yet pleasant sensation start to flood his body, centering on his chest and pelvis, with jolts of pleasure slowly circulating from his body every time his mouth seemingly starts to suck on whatever it's wrapped around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, Jack's vision starts to return, and he stops his apparent automatic actions that his body had apparently been doing, as he seems to see a close up view of someone's pelvis only centimeters away, and the feeling of fingers slowly pumping inside HIS pussy stopping at the realization that he's no longer in his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'What the fuck! Did I somehow get shoved into Sarah? If so, who's in my body, and how the hell did this even happen?' Were all the thought's Jack had to gather before two hands roughly grabbed him by the head, and started to pull his head up and down on the shaft currently in his mouth. Shocked and surprised at the situation, and not even sure what to do, Jack remains motionless, aside from the hands of whoever is controlling his old body equivalently face-fucking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[You should enjoy a new experience Mistress, as if you get boring, I'll make it more interesting than it already is!] Lilith's voice reverberates through Jack's mind, causing him to gasp and nearly choke on a down-stroke that his head is forced to preform. Now worried, and slightly turned on by the craziness of the situation (or maybe all the hormones flooding his body?), Jack slowly starts to give into his body's lust, which seems to have been ramping up the whole time he had been ignoring it with his worries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Abandoning all thought and going with what feels natural, Jack starts to let his hand inside his pussy resume it's previous activity, while moving his other hand to start fondling and massaging his former body, getting a groan of approval and a lessening of a grip on his head. Taking that as a sign of approval, Jack starts to move up and down, following 'instinct' and using many tricks to elicit more groans and moans of pleasure from both himself and his previous body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Minutes of continuous action go on before Jack finally feels himself about to peak, as well as feeling the flinch of 'Jack's' cock, telling him that it's nearly time for that to go off as well. One last plunge down to 'Jack's' root, and on the way back gently scrapping his teeth along the shaft, Jack feels a sudden tensing of the hands placed on his head, and knows that it's time, stopping part way up the shaft and preparing for the deluge of cum that is imminent in its arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Moments later Jack's mouth and throat are filled with 'Jack's' release, head held in place as 'Jack' grips and roars loudly in orgasmic bliss, and Jack holds back on the hope that a stray thought during his actions holds true. After 'Jack' finishes and slowly lets go of Jack's head, Jack silently waits, listening carefully for any sounds aside from the heavy breathing both him and his former body are doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0An extremely long feeling minute later, and Jack lets out a sigh of relief, even though his body keeps attacking his senses telling him that he should find his release also. 'So i was right, Lilith was being literal when she said MY release would shatter the spell, not my body's,' Jack thinks happily to himself, while slowly backing up and readjusting his clothing before rising from beneath the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"So, either this is one powerful drug being used or something, cause I know until recently I was Sarah, so anyone want to explain?\" 'Jack' says aloud, apparently keeping calm for the moment, though that might be from the recent orgasm she had helping to mellow out the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Looking over at Lisa, Jack sees her still serenely smiling, though also a hint of fear flashing through her eyes when she sees that Jack is looking at her. Wondering if she's afraid of what he could say, Jack weighs his decision on what to answer with...<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

Churchy-ness? Oh! If you seduce someone who either is of the church or is deeply religious, and have sex with them, you gain a bigger pool.

The bedroom had various pictures. Some of family, but others were turned facedown, probably because they were of religious pictures. There were some outlines of a few wooden crosses on the wall, suggesting they had been taken off. There was a small mirror near a studydesk, presumably for applying makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary... why am I tied up in your room?\" Jack asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you don't run away, silly!\" Mary answered with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Jack muttered. \"So... can you untie me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not until we get married and consummate it!\" Mary cooed.

While deep in thought, Jack doesn't notice a shimmer around his eyes, nor that his jogging has slowed down to a sedate pace, one that seems to have caused his rapid pace to dwindle to the equivalent of a turtle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Meanwhile)...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mary smiles as she sees Jack run off, trusting in the voice that whispered behind her ear. 'I don't think it was God speaking, but I'll take anyone's advice at this moment to get closer to Jack.' Mary thinks to herself, while promptly making her way towards the park, and the shortcut through it to beat Jack back to his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Following along Mary, invisible to all that she did not wish to see her, was Lilith, happy that her plan to help her master out was on track to success. 'Granted, compelling the girl to seduce Master won't have the same energy boost that i mentioned to him earlier, there is a way around that,' Lilith muses to herself, giddy with the fun she could have with 'helping' her Master learn his new domain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Minutes of silent travel later, and Mary arrives at Jack's house. Walking towards the door, Mary is surprised when the door slowly opens before she could reach it to knock. Taking it as a sign from whoever helped her on this course of action, Mary didn't bother questioning it, nor the sudden 'insight' of where Jack's room was located. Heading up the stairs, Mary quickly scales them, and quietly enters Jack's room, and finds an out of the way corner to hide in from the door's opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The shimmer on Jack's eyes fades as he finally reaches his home, not noticing that he's not feeling strained from 'running' nor that his quick pace seems to have taken fifteen minutes longer than it should have. Seeing that most of the lights are off in the house, Jack quietly inserts his keys, and gets his door unlocked (not realizing that it already was), and quietly closes and locks the door after passing through. Carefully making his way up the stairs, Jack reaches his door, and doesn't notice the light visible underneath his door. Opening the door without caution, Jack steps through, to see Lilith standing by his desk, smirking as if something is highly amusing to her. Walking towards her, Jack hears a thump, and pauses in his movement, and looks towards the noise. Confused, Jack sees someone who shouldn't possibly be in his room, let alone his house at this time of night, Mary!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hearing a low chuckle, Jack looks towards the perpetrator of them, Lilith, and feels a sudden intense panic, as he sees her holding a pale purple orb, and as she sees his attention focused on her, launches it deftly at him. Unable to avoid the projectile, Jack is struck in the chest, and promptly blacks out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feeling groggy, and somewhat off, Jack starts to test his faculties, as he could have sworn that he was hit in the chest by something, and landed on the floor face first, but feels as if hes on his back. Strangely, it also feels as if his chest feels heavy, like something is weighing down on it. Finding that he can wiggle his toes, and twitch his fingers, Jack slowly opens his eyes, and is nearly blinded by the light shining from the ceiling fixture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Slowly trying to balance and sit up, Jack reaches about part way, and feels a shift and sudden change in his balance, and nearly falls forward. Shocked by this, his eyes finally readjust just as he notices that he has breasts, honeydew sized ones at that, encased in a white blouse, and covered with a dark jacket.....a familiar looking jacket that he could have sworn he saw earlier on ....MARY!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mind finally grasping that something has changed, Jack hurriedly looks around the room, hoping that nothing else has changed.

The woman takes her coat off and hangs it on the back of a chair; Jack sees that she is a stunning woman.  She looks to be about thirty years old, and she\u2019s got long black hair that flows from the top of her head down to the middle of her back.  Her skin is somewhat dark, though she\u2019s not African-American.  The girl has sparkly white teeth and ruby red lipstick.  Her figure is spectacular.  She isn\u2019t thin really; in fact, she\u2019s rather full-figured, though certainly not fat.  She\u2019s wearing a rather thin, button-down white blouse that contains a wonderfully full and jiggly pair of breasts.  The blouse is tucked tightly into a pair of black pants that hug this woman\u2019s wonderfully full backside and a set of thick and meaty thighs.  She\u2019s got wide hips and an ever-so-slight bulge in her belly that\u2019s actually quite cute.  She\u2019s not one of those stick-thin model types.  She has curves in all the right places!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack looks the buxom beauty over, he\u2019s suddenly interrupted by a puff of red smoke in the chair just across from him.  \u201cWoah!\u201d Jack says with a jump.  The woman a few feet away looks over at him like he\u2019s got three heads.  Lilith sits in the chair right across from Jack with a big smile plastered across her face.  \u201cEvening, Master,\u201d she begins, \u201cwhy you look like you\u2019ve just been accosted by a fifty-something mayor\u2019s wife and a teenaged friend from church!\u201d she chuckled.  \u201cThat was you?!\u201d Jack screamed as quietly as he could, still eliciting strange looks from the woman nearby.  \u201cWell\u2026\u201d Lilith began, \u201cI helped a little bit, yes, but not a lot,\u201d she said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith glanced a few feet over at the voluptuous dark-haired woman as she sipped a glass of water.  Her eyes went wide.  \u201cWell-done, Master; this one\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Lilith says as she gets up and walks over to get a closer look at the woman, who remains oblivious to her presence.  She gets right in the woman\u2019s face and stares at her, then looks straight down into her impressive cleavage.  \u201cLook at the boobs on this one,\u201d Lilith exclaims, making Jack uncomfortable even though the woman has no clue that she\u2019s being oogled. Lilith looks back over at Jack, a devious smile creeping across her face.  \u201cYou know, Master,\u201d she says, \u201cit occurs to me you haven\u2019t yet seen many of my powers\u2026.I think this curvy lady will make a great demonstration!\u201d Lilith declares as gets just a couple inches away from the woman\u2019s mouth, draws in some breath, and then blows into her mouth.  Out of Lilith there came a wisp of reddish smoke, one that then forced its way, almost with purpose, into the mouth of the woman sitting at the table.  The woman seemed to choke at first and tensed up a little, as though something were forcing its way inside her body.  Within a couple seconds, though, she relaxed, her head dropping down and her body relaxing into a sort of sleep-like state.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell did you do to her?\u201d Jack demanded, worried.  Lilith only chuckled.  \u201cNot much, Master, only loosened her up for you, really,\u201d she said with a smile.  \u201cGo ahead\u2026.ask her something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack paused, trying to wrap his head around this whole thing.  \u201cUm\u2026..\u201d he began., \u201cwha\u2026..what\u2019s your name?\u201d  \u201cJennifer, Master,\u201d came the woman\u2019s faint reply, as though uttered in a deep sleep.  Lilith came back over and sat down next to Jack.  Jack continued, \u201cWhat do you do for a living?\u201d  \u201cOh come on, Master,\u201d Lilith cut in, \u201cthis wonderfully buxom, full-bodied woman is in the most suggestive state she\u2019s ever been in during her entire life, and the best you can do is ask her stuff you could get on any profile off a dating website?\u201d she said, shaking her head in disappointment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026.well I don\u2019t know what else to as\u2026..\u201d Jack began, and Lilith cut in again.  \u201cMaster, be thankful I\u2019m here to save the day,\u201d she said resolutely as she stood from her chair and walked over to the waiting and dazed Jennifer.  She positioned herself directly in front of Jennifer, and then she simply sat down.  As she did, Lilith\u2019s misty essence simply phased into the voluptuous body of the enthralled woman.  As she did, Jennifer seemed to convulse, as her body tensed up and jerked and she let out a couple grunts, her legs and arms seeming to move uncontrollably.  Jack sat there not sure what he was seeing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple seconds, the seizure-like movements stopped, and Jennifer seemed strangely at peace as her head hung down and her breathing steadied.  It was almost as though she were asleep.  Jack looked around to ensure no one had seen what the hell had just happened, though he was not sure himself.  He reached his hand in her direction, \u201cUm\u2026.uh, Jennifer?\u201d he said pensively.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her eyes shot open and she looked up.  Jack could see that her eyes were momentarily filled with a red mist of some kind; the same that had filled the eyes of the women Jack had met on the way here\u2026.but more intense this time.  A strange, sex-crazed smile filled her face.  \u201cJennifer?\u201d Jack repeated.  \u201cNot at the moment, Master,\u201d the woman\u2019s body said excitedly.   Jack\u2019s head began to spin.  \u201cLilith?!\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cis that you in there?\u201d he demanded.

Alright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not now?\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect. Let's go to your place to set up, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait... set up? Jack watched as Lilith left Jennifer in a small crimson cloud and poofed back into existence next to him. The two walked back home, and up to Jack's room. \"So what now\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One sec\" Lilith replied and vanished. A few minutes later she returned as abruptly as she had disappeared. \"Alright, you ready, Master?\" Jack nodded. \"This won't hurt but it'll feel strange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack started to question whether he had made the right decision in allowing Lilith to do her thing, she tapped him on the forehead and he blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">...</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack awoke in a sitting position, holding a pen and staring into a history textbook. Under his hand was a page of notes in handwriting a lot neater than his usual. He leaned back in an effort to shake the hair from his eyes... wait a minute. Hair? He looked around. This wasn't his room... and staring back at him in the dresser mirror was a very confused and shocked looking Sarah. As Jack moved his head, so did the Sarah in the reflection. This continued for a few more seconds until Jack finally looked down at himself, seeing Sarah's loose shirt and her unmistakeably female curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\" he whispered, hearing Sarah's voice from his lips. He began to panic, dropping the pen on the ground. Lilith poofed into existence next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun yet. <i>Mistress</i>?\" she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to me?\" Jack demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I put you in the body of that Sarah girl you like so much.\" Lilith responded. \"So now you get to experience her life for ... let's say a day, get inside her head.\" Jack began to protest, but Lilith continued. \"You might not have noticed that yet, but the longer you spend inside someone else, the more of their memories and mannerisma you start to pick up. Of course it was faster for me earlier since I've been doing this forever\". Jack paused. Lilith, noticing him calming down, continued on. \"Another thing is that you're also in her body. Completely in control. Don't tell me you've never fantasized about her...\" Lilith kept talking with a sly grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack began to blush. \"B..but what happened to my body?\" He stammered. \"If I'm in Sarah, and you're here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith cut him off. \"I took care of that. Your body is sleeping, and none of your family are going to go in your room, or acknowledge your existence at all until we're done here.\" So that's what she was doing earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stood up, admiring the body he... or was it 'she' now? Regardless of what Jack was usually, right now he was decidedly female, and pretty hot to boot. Sarah' hands, under Jack's direction, caressed her body, causing Jack to feel a bit aroused. Then he stopped. Was this right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're no fun, Mistress\" Lilith pouted. \"Don't tell me you're going to do your homework, <i>Sarah</i>\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack considered his options. What <i>was</i> he going to do while in Sarah? Sure, he could play out the ultimate fantasy and go play with her body... but wouldn't that be really wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if reading his mind, Lilith interjected. \"No, Mistress, it's your body right now. And you are free to do with it whatever you feel like.\" That didn't ease the nagging in Jack's mind, though. He couldn't just stay here all day, it was still bright outside.</span></div></div>",

Walking back over to the bed, Jack starts to slowly caress his body, trying to find what felt good, and what just felt odd. After minutes of experimenting, a voice breaks you out of your exploration. <br>\r\n\"Mistress, while I know you're new to the female form, I'm pretty sure you know that clothing is needed to come off if you want to really have fun,\" Lilith states, jarring you from your intense concentration, and reminding you that you are not alone in the room. \"You know Mistress, it wouldn't be a problem if i help you, either with a spell or physically, if you're feeling intimidated,\" Lilith taunts, all the while massaging her body and striking a pose after she notices she has your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"That's alright Lilith, and i might take you up on that later, but i was merely trying to get an idea of how 'my' body works. Women seem to have more sensative spots than men do, from what i can tell atleast. Thank you for the offer though,\" Jack responds, after shaking off the brief flash of Lilith pushing him down and kissing him roughly.<br>\r\nSmirking, almost as if she knows what was just on your mind, Lilith merely raises an eyebrow, and snaps her fingers, and suddenly your clothes are gone, leaving you in only your bra and panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"While acclimating is alright Mistress, I've found that diving right in can have better results,\" Lilith comments, then starts to chant lowly in a harsh, guttural language you do not recognize. While watching, transfixed by Lilith's chanting and sudden hand motions, you notice a strange sigil appear before her, with a bright red color, getting brighter the longer her chant goes on. After a long minute of chanting goes by, all the while increasing your worry, and a tinge of excitement, Lilith stops chanting. Looking you in the eye with a shit-eating grin, Lilith gestures both hands in your direction, and a sudden orb of reddish-pink shoots out of the sigil, flying too fast to dodge. Hoping that it wont hur, it strikes you on your chest, surprising you that it didn't hurt, but did send a huge jolt of lust straight through your breasts, down your spine, down to your toes, and right back up to your nether region, where a brief flash of intense stimulation gets your pussy extremely wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gasping at the sudden increase of your lust, as well as the shocks your body is currently feeling, you let out a low moan, suddenly cupping your breasts, roughly massaging them. <br>\r\n\u00a0\"See, Mistress? The body knows what it likes, without the tedious time of exploration you were taking,\" Lilith states, while her clothes slowly start to shrink, until she is naked and dripping. Another snap of her fingers, and your bra and panties are gone aswell. Another snap, and you find yourself on the bed, still massaging your breasts, trying to get the tight feeling to lessen enough that you can do more than maul them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Stuttering, Jack pleads, \"L-Li-Lil - Lilith, can you either h-help me manage my arousal, o-o-or help me get to a point where i can do more than be driven by lust?!?\" Finally getting some control back while asking, Jack tries pinching his extremely hard nipples, and nearly passes out from the shock he feels. 'Damn, they're super sensitive right now' Jack thinks, while trying hard not to pass out from the mini-orgasm he just induced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Well Mistress, since you asked nicely,\" Lilith states, while slowly sauntering over to Jack, the grin on her face getting even bigger the closer she gets to him. Getting right up to your face, she leans down, then captures Jack's lips in a simple kiss. Surprised by the gentleness of the kiss, Jack is unprepared for the abrupt pinning of your arms, and the change of the kiss' intensiveness. His mouth being completely dominated, pinned down, and completely helpless, Jack sends a pleading look towards Lilith's eyes, which in response seem to gleam with a flash of red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As if a facet has been barely turned, a trickle of his arousal seems to have dissipated, leaving Jack some semblance of motor functions. Trying to convey some form of thanks through his eyes, Jack is suddenly surprised, when Lilith ends the kiss, and stands back away from him. While Jack takes a quick breaths, trying to get himself under control, Lilith starts talking.<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Now that your not locked into your instinctive frenzy Mistress, would you like my help finishing, or do you wish to continue on your own,\" She asks, while looking forlorn at your body, especially your pussy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Feeling he kind of owed her, even though she was the cause of it, Jack decides to let Lilith help finish him. Unfortunately, Jack didn't pick his words carefully, and Lilith took advantage of it.<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Ok Lilith, you can help me finish, and I'll even let you pick the method, as long as it not too freaky,\" Jack responds, and suddenly gets a chill down his spine, especially after the look of pure euphoria Lilith gains upon hearing the end of his sentence.<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Oh Mistress, thank you. If you keep this up, I think i just might fall for you!\"Lilith states exuberantly, and then snapping her fingers multiple times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After each snap, Jack notices different things happening all around. A quartet of silk scarves appear in the air, spinning in intricate patterns, while the end of the bed seems to morph into a solid 4 poster bed frame. Lilith snaps one last time, and rapidly the scarves fly through the air to Jacks wrists and ankles, pulling them taut and tying the other ends to the bed posts corners. Spread out in such a manner, and confused as Lilith seems to be moving her hand up and down, as if stroking an invisible cock, she starts walking closer to Jack. As she gets closer, a large, black, 9\" studded dick seems to melt into existence. A bit freaked out now, Jack is about to yell out, when a fifth scarf that apparently had been hidden behind Lilith zooms out and flies directly over his mouth. Now really wishing he had picked his words more carefully, Jack hopes he won't die from his choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Don't worry Mistress, while scary, I can assure you that you're going to be having many orgasms before I'm done,\" Lilith boasts, climbing onto the bed, and positioning herself over your pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While Jack would like to truthfully state that he was beyond terrified, that would be a lie, because while freaked out, he was also majorly turned on right now. Not knowing if it was his current body, Sarah's subconscious thoughts, or even his own unconscious fetishes involved, he did know that what little edge Lilith had taken off earlier, was completely trampled over at this point. Shaking from overpowering lust, Jack is snapped back from his mind wandering state by Lilith flicking his nipple, sending jolts of pleasure throughout his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Mistress, it's not nice to space out before the main event,\" Lilith chides, while herself up after gaining Jacks attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After making sure to look into his eyes, Lilith slowly presses her cock into your pussy. After it barely even brushed his nethers, Jack starts moaning loudly, and starts to buck and arch his back the more Lilith pushes in. After a slow, agonizing few minutes of pushing in till she bottoms out, all the while keeping eye contact with Jack, she finally stops. Straining to keep still, afraid that hes going to pass out from over stimulation, Jack attempts to keep quiet and still, but Lilith merely grins, reaches up, and tweaks his diamond hard nipple. Unable to stop himself, Jack arches, moving Lilith's member inside him, and setting off a cascade of pleasure rolling over his body, over and over. Still having not moved, Lilith just chuckles, before gripping Jack's hips, and starts to pull out, making Jack continue to writhe as much as he can, all the while screaming out in lust into his improvised gag. Reaching the tip, Lilith pauses, waiting for Jack to come down enough to focus on her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"So far you've had three orgasms Mistress, let's see how many you'll have before i make you pass out,\" Lilith taunts, before rapidly shoving her cock into Jack, making sure to angle her cock's studs to hit Jacks clit on the reentry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Jack's world slowly turns into one of near constant pleasure, only ending when he finally blacks out, exhausted from all that Lilith did to him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Awareness slowly filters into Jack's mind, the first sensation is the softness of the bed and pillow he currently lies upon, shortly followed by the steady beat of his heart. Slowly gaining more attention of his surroundings, and trying to remember why he was asleep, Jack tries to shift his legs, as one of them feels slightly chilled, as if the blanket has fallen off that part of his body. Moving his arm to tug on the blanket into where he thinks it should be, still with eyes closed, Jack realizes that his other arm seems to be warmer, yet also like a weight is holding it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Confused about such a sensation, Jack slowly opens his eyes, and sees crimson tresses mere centimeters from his face, and after noticing the distance, gets a faint feeling of tickling on his nose. Breathing in deeply and staying silent, to try and keep calm and not panic, Jack inhales the scent of cinnamon and an off (but strangely not bad) brimstone smell, causing him to slowly start to recall his previous position before passing out, especially after the scent of sex finally filters through what he can only assume is Lilith's current scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking another deep breath and holding it for a few moments, Jack starts to calm down some more, focusing on the fact that at least he's not currently tied up and still being pounded by Lilith. 'Wait, if I'm in bed with her, cuddling, does that mean I'm still in Sarah?' Jack suddenly asks himself. Looking down carefully, so as not to shift too much and possibly wake the silent Lilith, Jack sees that indeed, he still is inside Sarah. Wondering why, and also finally starting to feel the soreness from the earlier sex, Jack lets out a slight groan as he unconsciously shifts one of his sore muscles to an untenable position, and quickly moves to find a more comfortable laying spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"So you're awake Mistress? That's good, I was wondering what else we should do now, though I decided to behave myself and wait for you instead of having more fun with your current body,\" Lilith says, slowly rolling over in place and looking Jack in the eye, a glimmer of lust and mischief flashing through her gaze before quickly disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm surprised, but happy, that you restrained yourself Lilith, but what exactly do you mean what we should do now? I originally asked for you to help me with Sarah, and instead, you fucked me roughly after casting some spell to throw my Lust into overdrive. At this point, I'm wondering if you can help me with my crush, or if you're just toying with me!\" Jack says, slightly agitated by Lilith's blas\u00c3\u00a9 comment, though also feeling a slight tingle of fear at the realization that Lilith could do anything to him, and he couldn't really stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, I will admit that I was a bit selfish in wanting to have some fun as well as push you into the deep end of being a female, but I'm slightly hurt at your accusation, especially the silent one you just had. Before you ask, Mistress, it's a combination of my age as well as the bond that we share through the Book binding us. So no, I can't effectively kill you, but yes, currently you are technically at my mercy, though you have to admit, deep down, that my previous actions have been slightly pleasurable?\" Lilith responds, at first sounding slightly sad, before shifting to a more neutral tone, answering Jack's unspoken questions and the riposting with one of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack consider's her question, and really wonders if the pleasure he felt should outweigh her previous action of tying him up and having her way with his current body. 'On the one hand, it was very pleasurable, but on the other...I honestly didn't like the fact that I had no control at all. I'll admit, being tied up was interesting, but I really don't know if that's my personal thing, or Sarah's inclination.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The thought of Sarah possibly being the cause turns Jack's thoughts back to his previous statement, and prompts him to ask Lilith about something else, while conveniently avoiding answer her taunting question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"How exactly was fucking me while tied down helping me with my crush Lilith? I'll admit you gave my current body pleasure, but I don't see how that helped me at all, if anything it seemed like you benefited more from me being in her than I did,\" Jack opines, seeing Lilith's nonplussed look shift into one of confusion, then smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah, well, there are a few ways to answer that Mistress, but I will admit that I did take some fun out on you, especially to get you to loosen up, push your boundaries, have fun. As to helping you with Sarah, well the simple part is that the longer you are inside her, as well as while feeling intense emotions, the quicker you'll sync with her memories. Technically it's different with everyone, but some of my previous Masters happened to find that sex can speed up the process, but again, it's a different rate for everyone. In this case, instead of spending a few days living as Sarah, there is the chance that it's been cut down to half or less that time,\" Lilith explains, her smile not wavering and seeming bemused at the stunned expression that covers Jack's face upon hearing her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack honestly can't believe that it would be something like that, especially since Lilith still seemed like she benefited more. Pushing that train of thought away, Jack decides to find out more about what this 'syncing' she had mentioned was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"What exactly do you mean 'sync with her memories', Lilith, and how would I even know if it's working?\" Jack asks, seeing a grin start to form on Lilith's face at that question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Simple Mistress, especially as it is how it sounds. Your soul, while inhabiting other bodies, can slowly sync and 'copy' the bodies memories, thereby helping you either adapt or act like the person you possess. The memories stay with you until either you get rid of them, via a spell or my help, and in this case, you could gain much insight into Sarah, and how to approach her. Not only that, if you actually do pursue her, and wish to make your 'first time' together memorable, you'll have a better idea of what she'll like,\" Lilith responds, adding a wink after mentioning 'first time', causing Jack to flush, whether in embarrassment or arousal, Jack couldn't tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Ok, but is there any way to tell if I'm actually 'syncing' or is it some kind of gradual process?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lilith shifts until she's sitting up, and points across the room at an obscure painting, then simply asks, \"Where did you get that painting from, 'Sarah'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Following her indication to the painting, Jack answers without even thinking, \"I got that as a gift from a past female friend, who moved away a few years ago, but recently became a famous artist from what I have heard.\" After saying such, Jack's hand flies to his mouth, covering it in shock at the near automatic flow of information that seemed to have spilled out of his mouth, as well as the fact that he could somehow picture said friend, and the last time Sarah had said farewell to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, I guess that answers about if your obtaining the memories or not, eh Mistress?\" Lilith asks smugly, a wide grin plastered over her face while admiring her nails pompously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"I guess,\" Jack responds without paying attention, thinking over the strangeness of this magic, as well as if he should continue with this crazy idea of getting to know his crush, or find some other method. Jack honestly wondered if it was really Ok to even be using his new powers (or in this case, Lilith's) to obtain such information about Sarah, but a niggling voice in the back of his head keeps asking 'who could stop you, and why not use your power to get ahead for once?'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"So I ask again, Mistress, what now?\" Lilith inquires, breaking Jack from his moral dilemma, and spurring him on to making a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"I think...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Taking in her appearance, Jack realizes it is Melissa Robinson, the Head cheerleader of his school. Surprised, and a bit confused as to her talking to him so randomly, since she has never spoken to him before now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Taking his silence in stride, Melissa sits down next to Jack, and looks towards him, waiting for a response. With her this close, Jack notices that  Melissa's make up is slightly smudged, and the skin around her eyes looks puffy, as if she had been crying recently. Taking it all into account, Jack tries to form an answer without stumbling into a possible insult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Um, yeah, normally I would be busy either doing my homework before the weekend, or hanging out with Alex, but he's taking Kelly out on a date tonight, and i needed a break from the homework,\" Jack responds, trying not to stare at Melissa, and also trying to figure out where Lilith has gone, since Jenifer seems to have gone back to what she had been doing before Lilith's machinations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Oh, well, that explains why your out so late, but why not hang out with your other friends, or even try to pick up a date for yourself,\" Melissa asks, while twirling a loose strand of hair on her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Well, that's easier to answer, a few of my friends are out of town at the moment, trying to take advantage of the weekend, and as to a date, well, I haven't had much luck as of late with women,\" Jack responds, wondering where this conversation is heading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Upon hearing Jack's answer, Melissa smiles, and then brings a hand up to his arm, and slowly starts rubbing it up and down Jack's arm, Very confused at this point, Jack looks towards Melissa's face, and notices that she's somewhat flushed, and that every few minutes, she seems to jerk in place. Taking a moment to look around, Jack lets his gaze wander the coffee shop, he spots Lilith on the other side of the room, grinning while holding her arm out in a \"thumbs-up\" pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Definitely confused by whats going on, Jack starts to wonder if he should continue this conversation, or leave, and try to get Lilith to explain what the hell is going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You also can add some additions if you want, such ass you can be your mother then you shpeshift her crotch to become a cock or anything else. It's up to you.

If have mastered this magic, you even can summon a new succubus that will be your slave forever and have a higher power than a bonded succubus.

When the succubus is summoned, this book and me will disappear. will never come back until 1500 years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jack listen the last sentence, he shocked and feel sad for Lilith. he said \"So i'll lose you....???\"<br>\r\nLilith replying \" Yes Master, but since you have a new one you don't have to feel sad.\"<br>\r\n\"Why i can't have 2 succubus ???\" Jack said.<br>\r\n\"You can, but you must have the permission of the hell keeper to do that.

Whenever you're ready you can just rest your hand on my shoulder and I'll provide the energy for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwesome. Now you had to decide who you were transforming into. You felt it'd be weird becoming a family member, so that was a hard pass. You glanced at Lilith, who wore her impossibly hot human form... maybe you could copy her? That could be pretty fun, but you were sure you'd get distracted. Plus, her form was made up, and might not even work. You could try someone from school... obviously the first person to come to your mind when you thought school was Sarah. Yeah, she'd do. You had seen her enough times and paid enough attention to picture her perfectly in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you did exactly that. Hand on Lilith's shoulder, you closed your eyes and pictured Sarah. You felt a trickle of energy flow through your connection with Lilith, and you channeled that energy into yourself, focusing as before on a new image of yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was substantially more difficult. You felt something shift within you, and you broke focus for a second. Luckily Sarah was one of your favourite distractions, so it was easy to get back on track. After a few minutes of focusing, you felt that nothing was happening anymore. You released Lilith's shoulder and opened your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very first thing you noticed was that your hand looked different. And that there was hair in your face. That meant... Yep. Looking down you see two perky mounds poking out of your t-shirt. You were still in your old clothes, but your body was definitely very different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... holy shit!\" You whispered, hearing your voice. That was definitely Sarah's voice. Your hands rose to your chest, feeling your new tits. They were a little sensitive, and a light moan escaped your lips as you caressed them. \"I wonder...\" you mumbled as your curious hands slipped down past your jeans to feel your new nethers. Another short breath of pleasure leaves you as you find anatomy you've never had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun there, mistress?\" Lilith teased. \"I can show you a few things if you'd like... if you'd like to stay in that body for now, that is.\" She turned around and used one finger to trace a line up your stomach, cupping a naked breast and teasing your nipples. You began to blush a bit at the feeling, pulling your hand out of your pants in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a very tempting offer, and you were quite curious about what Sarah felt when she had naughty fun. But if you were able to morph yourself completely into Sarah, could you do more as well? Maybe try Lilith or something out of fiction?</span></div></div>",

Deciding that he could always experience Naughty Sarah later, Jack declares his intent to Lilith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"As much as i would love to explore that offer of fun Lilith, I want to really master this spell, especially as if I can do that, then more options for pleasure could be available. Are you the type of succubus that gorges on first sight, or would u like to savor and expand the possible feasting options,\" Jack says, teasing Lilith after seeing her start to pout about his initial decision, which slowly turns into an amused smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You do have a point Master, and to answer your challenge, I can be both, but there is a bit of wisdom in your words. We'll follow your decision here, I just hope you don't screw up your transformation. The more complex, the greater the focus needed. As you wish to master this spell, you will need to do this next attempt alone,\" Lilith responds, getting a wide grin after delivering the news that Jack's next attempt is solo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Feeling somewhat nervous upon hearing his next step, Jack steels his nerves, and tries to visualize what he wants to turn into. His first thought is Lilith, as she seems to look and act like a sensual and fun form. Mentally bookmarking that thought, Jack lets his mind wander, and starts to see varying images he had seen or read of that led to imagining different types of creatures from myth and fantasy. The sexy Drow of Dungeons and Dragons, the stout Dwarves of World of Warcraft, the Succubi he had seen when randomly browsing the internet, and even the various scantily clad women of multiple video games. All these images flew through Jack's mind, distracting him with the endless possibilities of what he could turn into, and also sadly leaving a bored succubus in a room with a distracted warlock, and her getting a mischievous idea to form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Seeing that Jack's attention is focused inward, and his gaze is unseeing, Lilith wanders behind him, and decides to play a prank on him, as well as help him learn. Casting a spell sub-vocally, Lilith nudges Jack's subconscious towards a decision, and boosts his reserves momentarily for one spell, to enhance the effect. Giggling quietly, Lilith wanders back to her previous position in Jack's room, and wonders how this will turn out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Nearly a minute after Lilith's actions, Jack returns to conscious world, and with a determined look on his face, starts to chant the spell with a clear image in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first thing to start changing was his hair, which slowly seemed to recede into his head until it felt like there was no hair there. Moments after the last follicle seemed to cease to exist, his head seemed to grow slightly, and then grooves seemed to form into some semblance of hair, but felt more akin to the cartilage that one would find in their nose or ears. Forming fully, his nose and eyes changed angles slightly, looking slightly less human-like, but still enough that no one would look askance at him unless they had some kind of mental breakdown over such things. Next were his lips, which seemed to firm up a bit, but not change much, though a tribal marking of sorts began to form in a line from the center of his lip down to the underside of his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Next his breasts seemed to grow one full cup-size, and the shirt he had been wearing seems to change shape into a form-fitting futuristic looking jacket/top armor. The jeans Jack had been wearing seemed to become skin tight, accentuating his newly formed thighs and hips, and changing from denim to some futuristic leather. Jack's height also shoots up by about three inches, as his shoes change into heels, made out of some different material. The last thing Jack notices is the sudden increase in all his nerve endings sending more sensations throughout his body. Shuddering at the end of his transformation, Jack feels every part of his new clothing, the pull on his new sensitive breasts, the rub against the nipples, the pull of his pants gently stimulating his thighs and new pussy when he twists in place to examine his back, ass, and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor those curious about the image<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/masseffect/images/9/90/Aria_ME2_charshot.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/301?cb=20140625104530\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/mass...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If you're careful on your return to normal you may even be able to keep some of those abilities.\" Lilith speaks up, licking her lips while openly ogling your new form. Shuddering from the sudden sense of Lust he feels radiating from her, Jack tries to calm himself, and focus on what she had just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You influence my spell? I thought you were going to let me do this alone?\" Jack asked, fighting to stay calm, as Lilith's aura of Lust was affecting him greater than before the transformation, as well the increased stimulation from his clothing's rubbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You did do it on your own Mistress, the only thing I can be blamed for in 'helping' would be the increase in energy available to you, which seems to have been spent on a perfect replication of your choice. I must say, when I nudged you towards that beauty, I did not know anything about it beyond the brief skimming of your memories, but I'm amazed at what magic has supplied as the full transformation's outcome.\" Lilith responds. Seeing his confusion, which looks odd on a face that seems unused to anything aside from the scowls it's known for, Lilith decides to explain further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"When transforming, or for most spells, you can channel or make available extra energy to boost the effect; either amplifying the outcome, extending the duration, expanding the target or area, or whatever else might possibly be boosted. In this case, your focus was exact enough, and the energy boost decided to get a perfect replica to balance out the energy. In this case, I would assume that  your transformation is perfect down to abilities and memories even. Magic can reach across parallel worlds, and in some cases, copy or pull things from those worlds, depending on circumstances. I must say again, this is the most interesting outcome I've seen in centuries.\" Lilith finishes explaining, looking like she's barely holding back from pouncing on Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Taking a deep breath, and going over what Lilith has explained, Jack notices that he does seem to have extra memories, though the most recent one seems to be a kiss with some chick named Jane S. After the kiss, his new memory seems to get fuzzy, as if static is interfering or such. Deciding to think of something else, Jack speaks up a sudden thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Does this mean that I'm stuck like this Lilith!\" Jack shouts suddenly, causing Lilith to stumble back in surprise, and land on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Collecting herself, Lilith thinks for a moment, before shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Not necessarily, you still have access to your magic from what I can tell, as well as some new abilities that will make things interesting for you, especially if you retain them on a successful return to your human form. As to being stuck, that kind of depends on you. In this case, as you were the one to cast the spell, and I did not actually interfere or direct the casting, I cannot alter your form without making it your permanent form, but you can still cast your magic to transform. The most I can do to help would be another boost of power to help your transition. The downside is, right now, we both need to regather energy, either with each other, or with other participants. I also cannot take your soul out of your current form, without locking it as your new base form, as me taking your soul out would be registering it as such.\" Lilith responds, trying to allay some of Jacks worries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"How would we regain energy quickest then, and what do you mean I could get back by casting transform myself?\" Jack asks, somewhat calmer after finding he's not stuck as an alien pirate queen. Granted, he knows his form is sexy as hell, but that doesn't mean he wishes to be stuck as it, even if it's long lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The quickest way to regain energy is through sex, and while normally us having it together would be counter-productive, I can go and gain some energy elsewhere, then return and help transfer it to you. As to you being able to cast transform yourself, that would be the oldest rule of magic. 'The caster has an easier time removing his own spell, than anyone else coming along trying to overpower their magic' - in this case, it would take probably twice the amount of energy for someone else to force you back, and even then, it might not work exactly,\" Lilith states, finally standing and circling Jack, pausing only to pinch his ass, eliciting a squeak and Jack suddenly glowing blue and raising a fist as if preparing to throw something, before regaining control of himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chuckling, Lilith decides to stay where she is, and wait for his decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"So if that's the fast way, what is the slow way, and is there anyway to hide my new form from everyone else?\" Jack asks, deciding to see if there are any other options before deciding a course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well the slow way would be simply waiting for you to regain your spent energy, which at this point, feels to be about 5 days, if not a bit longer, and to give you the boost you would need to keep the new abilities you have, would take another 3 days for you, and i would need to wait a total of 9 days. Hiding your new form would be easy, either with a glamour, a memory spell attached to an object you carry, or simply casting a spell on your room that makes everyone in town ignore your absence for as long as your in the room, the problem being that i do not think you wish to spend nearly a week in your room. Granted, we could spend that time having mind blowing sex, but I think you would possibly either get bored or die after 4 days of unending pleasure.\" Lilith responds, gaining a shit-eating smile after mentioning the last option, and a glint of unbridled lust flashing through her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack chooses</span></span></div></div>",

Other than that, I'd say that you might want to practice using your new abilities, otherwise you might slip, and the glamour wouldn't save you at that point.\" <i>Lilith says, seeming to be giving good advice, as Biotics were tied to emotion, and Jack was not exactly calm or stable currently.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sitting down on his bed, and realizing that he didn't feel it sink like usual before recalling that he was likely alot lighter than before, Jack looks around, before nodding to Lilith.</i> \"Go ahead then, just try to not harm innocent people, and try not to kill anyone - i'd rather you not draw attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Lilith winks before fading out of view, leaving Jack alone in his room. . .<br>\r\n</i></span></div></div>",

Jack's cock was rising as Lilith just looked at it, like it was something special. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you going to do something?\" Jack asked annoyed and embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith looked like she came out of a trance. \"I'm sorry Master, it's just seeing my first cock after my last sleep is always a special moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith then pulled her hair behind her ears and started licking his shaft. Jack had never felt such a thing before, it felt heavenly. His worries were just sucked away. He had thought it would weird him out, that his mother would do it but that wasn't the case. Lilith had taken his mother's body, although it was the same she didn't have his mother's face in a way. Jack realized Lilith was too sexy. It wasn't long before he came. She was just busy with her shaft but when she felt the trembling she quickly began sucking. Jack felt when he came, she sucked up his cum right into her mouth and swallowed it right away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing, thank you Lilith.\" Jack told Lilith. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith smiled at Jack. \"Thank you Master, but it's just the beginning.\" Lilith pulled off her top, revealing her figure to him. Christine was always trying to be fit and Jack could see the result of that. Her body looked amazing for her age, and soon Jack felt his crotch reacting again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will be even better.\" Lilith told Jack as she put his cock between her breasts. He found himself in heaven again, his cock reacting to those two soft luscious breasts. It took longer than before, but when he came again she sucked all of his semen out of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need semen to survive do you?\" Jack asked Lilith. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith stared at him as she licked some cum from her hand. \"No, I don't. My life is tied to the book, I can't be killed that easily. Still, I am a succubus, this is what I love the most. And besides.\" She pointed at his crotch. \"I still need to finish my job.\" Jack wasn't sure he could be ready for a third time, this was his first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith took off her pants and the panties she was wearing. She stood on the bed as she lowered herself closer to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was doubt inside of Jack. Here Lilith would allow him to finally have sex, but it was inside his mother's body. Could he just do that? On the other hand, it was not Christine that would do the act. When Jack had looked at Lilith inside of Christina, it was like it was his mother. Just a clone. She somehow looked different. This shouldn't be any different, does it?</span></div></div>",

Each women has different areas she wants to have touched. For example your mother likes that her partner kisses her neck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to try?\" Lilith asked curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly nod, kissing her neck was a bit different than just plunging inside of her, but you wanted to improve. You gave a quick peck on her neck. \"A bit longer than that, can't hurt anyone master.\" Lilith told Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack kissed longer this time, he could smell his mother's perfume. The smell was driving him crazy. He gave more kisses. Lilith let out a little moan. Something inside him was taking over. He stroked Lilith's back ending at her ass. Her nice plumb ass, he felt around her ass kneading it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go master, that's better.\" Lilith commented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis crotch was ready, one look at Lilith told him she was ready for it too. He pushed Lilith down and felt himself entering her. The pleasure was much better than before. She felt wetter than before. Jack wanted to get it out of him, but Lilith took another look at him which told him he couldn't do it. That's when he went inside her and out again. He kissed her neck again, knowing that spot would surely make Lilith feel good. It surprised Jack when she instead kissed long and hard with Jack putting her tongue inside his mouth. Jack felt like they were more connected with each other. This was how things were supposed to be. Lilith came a few times but when Jack finally came they went together at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack lied down on his bed, trying to catch his breath. That was amazing, if it turned out like this every day, things would really look good. But Jack was looking at Lilith, she was lying there this was definitely not his mom anymore. Jack climbed on top of her and kissed her long and hard. When he let go, he only said: Thank you Lilith for helping me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome master.\" She replied, though she didn't look him in the eyes telling that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master,\" she said after a few minutes, \"do you wish for me to stay inside of your mother or do you wish me to leave her?\"</span></div></div>",

Jack nearly loses it again after seeing how scantily clad some of the women were, though it was balanced with some of the men who either were dressed in so little on a lark or dare, or were just that secure in their appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\"Oooh, some yummy looking people here~\"</i></b> Lilith says, licking her lips while eyeing up all the people in the area, Jack getting the sense that she meant more than their looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Indeed - drinks first, or should we drop your brother off somewhere and find the others?\"</b></i> Beccca asks, looking around the club before settling her gaze on Jack, who shifts a bit uncomfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith laughs before speaking up, \"lets all meet up at that table over there,\" she points, before continuing. \"Lets say in five minutes - let Jack get used to the atmosphere before introductions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Sounds like a plan - see ya in a few Jackie~\"</b></i> Becca teases after agreeing to Lilith's idea, winking before walking off, soon followed by Lilith who leans in and gropes Jack subtly, smirking at the pained and pleasured look she garnered from such an act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Don't be late, Master, otherwise i'll have to do something to make this night even more amusing,\"</b></i> Saying this, the succubus would saunter off, hips swaying as she drew in the looks of many people before Jack lost sight of her. Shaking his head, he would look around, trying to be polite and not stare, even though many women were just that attractive and alluring to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Jack reaches the table, blushing madly as a few women that he'd walked past had actually tried to ask him to dance, or at least he thinks that is what they'd been saying. He doesn't get a chance to dwell on this though, as Becca, looking a bit disheveled, but a lustful look on her face, approaches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Little Jackie made it, good for him~\"</b></i> she says, before plopping down not in the seat next to him, but in his lap! \"Hmm, comfy and useful~\" She states before her hand starts to wander down, causing Jack to gasp as he panics, unsure of what the hell brought this reaction on from a complete stranger. . .</span></span></div></div>",

Is it better if Jen is the one grinding you like this, instead of me?\"<br>\r\n</b></i><br>\r\nHearing that causes Jack to stiffen, in more ways than one, and look fearfully at the woman astride of him. What greets him is a lustful smirk, her pace increasing slightly.<i><b> \"I know some say Incest is Wincest, but i'd like to think that I can beat that idea~\" </b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, aroused, and enjoying the ministrations of the woman, Jack tries to figure out what he should do, before freezing up even more, noting Becca leaning in to give him a kiss. Seeing this, he closes his eyes, unsure if he wants to kiss her or not....only to feel a hot breath wash over him, then hear giggling, followed by laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Oh master, to think you'd be this easy to tease,\" </b></i>Jack hears, his eyes snapping open instantly to look at 'Becca in both Horror as well as annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Lilith!?\"</b></i> He almost shouts, Lilith leaning down and muffling the sound. . . with her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Yes Master? Oh, i got a bit curious about Becca here, and decided to hitch a ride for now, though i also had another ride in mind~\" </b></i>She says, Jack barely getting his head free of her breasts before she picked up the pace of her grinding, earning a moan from the young warlock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"L-Li-Lilith, we can't. . .\"</b></i> Jack starts to say, but falters, unsure if it's because it's in public, if it's because Becca is possessed and non-consenting, or if something else is stopping him. In response, 'Becca just grinds a bit harder against Jack, grabbing one of his hands and placing it on her boob, squeezing and moaning from the action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Of course we can Master, though i think i know a better place to be,\"</b></i> she says, slowing down in her grinding, though making sure to drag it out and cause her Master to nearly climax in his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few shaky breaths later, and 'Becca drags Jack into the nearby bathrooms, thankfully they were empty at the time. Turning around, the possessed woman locks the nearby door, before slowly turning around, a lustful look in her eyes as she slowly starts to run her hands up and down her body.<i><b> \"So, we have some privacy, and i'm wanting a good fucking~\"</b></i> she says, her clothes being slowly pulled off and causing Jack to gasp at the sight of 'Becca, who looked aroused and tantalizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack is conflicted, but his hormones and lust win out, causing him to disregard the nagging in the back of his mind and pull at his own clothes, quickly becoming as naked as 'Becca was before him. <i><b>\"Hmm, that looks tasty Master~\"</b></i> 'Becca says before dropping to her knees, gently grabbing and grasping the stiff member of Jack's earning a low groan from him. Soon after she starts to suck him off, with Jack just closing his eyes and enjoying the sensations, fighting the urge to cum from just the ministrations of her mouth and hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Jack is pushed back against the nearby wall, his cock exposed to the air of the room, shivering at the sudden change in temperature, before he moans at the return of warmth, not even noticing the primal moan from 'Becca as he's so focused on the fact that he's somehow fucking a woman after just meeting her, ignoring the fact that it was just Lilith wearing them like clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Fuck!\"</b></i> He groans, thrusting up instinctively, before hearing 'Becca laugh and moan. <i><b>\"That's the idea, though if you're not going to be more active i might just take over~\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused at that statement, Jack tries to mimic things he'd seen in porno's or read on the internet, but in the end he doesn't last long, only some magic staying force having let him go on for more than a few minutes. Slowly, as Jack's orgasms subsides, his vision dimming, he gets an odd feeling, as if he'd just fucked up...especially after noting that 'Becca had a shark-like grin. . .</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><span style=\"line-height:1.4;\"><br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thinking about how cool it would be to alter one's shape at will, even if its only in minor or limited ways, Jack decides to attempt to master the beginner transformation spell. After stating such to Lilith, she reiterates the warning she gave before about people noticing the results. Hearing this, Jack decides to start small, and build his way up, to find his limits, and practice towards mastery of said spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Starting out small, Jack first tries to change the color of both his eyes at once. Quickly realizing it would help if he had a mirror, Jack turns towards Lilith, and notices that she has laid down on his bed, and taken off her shirt. Curious about her actions, and also hoping she can help out, Jack shakes his head, and voices his questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Hey Lilith, is there any way you could either conjure a mirror for me to use, or transfigure an object into a mirror to help me know if I'm actually casting the spell correctly? Also, any particular reason your topless right now?\" Appreciating her pose as she slightly sits up to look at him, Jack notices that she has pushed her shoulders at such an angle that her breasts are thrust outwards. Before responding to his query, Lilith smirks, and shakes her chest slowly back and forth, amused at Jack's blatantly distracted gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, I can conjure a mirror, or transfigure, depending on whichever you want. As to me laying down topless, I felt like getting comfortable, as it could take you hours or days to master your spell Master,\" Lilith responds, chuckling as Jack seems to snap out of his daze upon her mentioning her topless-ness herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Chiding himself, Jack tries to ignore the chuckles and attempts to direct his attention back to the spell. \"Whichever is easier or more convenient for you to do please, Lilith.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0A mist forms on the wall opposite the bed, coalescing into a ceiling to floor mirror, with an elegant frame decorating the edges of the mirror. Upon closer inspection, Jack notices that the decorations look like couples engaged in sex, causing Jack to blush, and wonder if Lilith ever misses an opportunity to tease or instill lust. Shaking his head, Jack turns his focus on the mirror, and looks into his reflection's eyes, seeing that only one of them apparently changed color. 'Well, that's some progress,' Jack thinks to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Attempting the spell again, for the same results, nets both of Jacks eyes being a new color. Happy with this minor success, Jack tries once more, for a different color yet again. Another success bolsters his confidence, so Jack tries something different. Focusing on what he wishes altered this time, Jack attempts to give himself bright green hair. Fixated so intently on his task, the loud moan behind Jack startles him, and draws his eyes towards the sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Laying on his bed still, is a now completely nude Lilith, pleasuring herself and, once she sees she has his attention, moaning loudly with a lewd and lustful look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Whatever focus Jack had before is shattered, as not only is he distracted by the erotic sight before him, but his arousal has been sparked from the small embers that seem to be a constant companion with all of Lilith's antics, into a blaze of lust and wanton desire. So distracted by the sudden spike of lust, and Lilith's antics, Jack was confused by the sudden laughter and stop of her motions. As he was about to ask, Lilith beats him to the punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, I knew that distracting you would be interesting, but I did not foresee you being affected this badly before i even got started,\" she chortles out, trying to not fall over from her laughter. Curious what Lilith meant, Jack looks back to the mirror, and is horrified, and slightly curious about what he sees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Instead of his usual flat chest and t-shirt he expected to see, he instead sees breasts hanging from his chest, ones that look almost exactly like Lilith's. Upon seeing them, and making the connection that his transformation worked, but happened while distracted, Jack is assailed by numerous sudden tingles of pleasant sensations in his new chest. Shuddering, and wondering what is going on, Jack pokes one of his fleshy globes, and nearly falls down from the jolt of pleasure that runs through him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Catching himself against the mirror, Jack turns around to ask Lilith what is going on, when he sees she is not on the bed anymore. Looking around, Jack does not find her anywhere that he can see. Sudden ecstasy rips through Jacks body as he falls towards the ground, only held up by apparently Lilith, who somehow got behind him while he was distracted. Writhing in rapture, Jack finally notices two hands that are not his own on his new breasts, slowly massaging them in a rhythmical pattern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Fighting down the rising desire to give in and ravish Lilith, Jack attempts to speak. \"Lil -lil -Lilith, fuck! Will you, - ahh - fuck, will you stop for a - OH fuck!\" Jack gets out, before Lilith pinches your oversensitive nipples. Shooting off and ruining his pants, but not caring in the least from the mind bending orgasm Lilith had just induced, Jack struggles to catch his breath. Weakly his hands scrabble at hers, trying to pull them off, only to cause more pleasure to course though his breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh Master, just give in, unless you wish to finish your lesson, then try to reverse the change before you pass out,\" Lilith taunts, keeping up her gentle massage, and taking a moment to nibble on Jacks ear playfully. Shuddering while trying to regain some focus, Jack wonders if he should give in, or if he should try to finish the spell. If he could finish the spell, it might help him with such focus issues later, but failing it could cause even more trouble, especially since Lilith seems intent on taking advantage of the situation. Giving in, well, not much harm in that, except Lilith, again, can take advantage as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Considering she'll take advantage either way, jack decides to ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

The warlock had been bound to a female body, and was repulsed by the idea of sleeping with a man. Annoyed at his circumstances, he decided to alter the existing animation spell most mages used, and apply it to an unusual target...an, at the time, strange shaped piece of wood, though by today's standards, everyone would recognize it as a dildo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Upon hearing this, Jack actually bursts into laughter, soon joined by Lilith, who decides to conjure up a physical representation of said object from her story. Seeing this, Jack's dying laughter is reignited, and he his laughter begins anew. Long minutes pass and Jack finally regains control over himself, wiping away the tears that had started to form from all the laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, while it isn't as appealing looking by today's standards, back then, the Warlock of that time had decided that most basic spells can be altered, if one is crafty, or desperate, enough to accomplish such. In his case, he wanted sexual release, but didn't want to indulge in the regular way, nor was he 'crafty' enough to simply ask me or other demons to help him out of his predicament.\" Lilith says, chuckling again after finishing her moral-inspiring lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"So basically, his pride stopped him from getting what he wanted, or obtaining help, but did drive him towards unorthodox thinking?\" Jack asks, causing Lilith to smile widely at Jack's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Exactly Master. While demons are not known for their trustworthiness, we most of the time are actually quite honest, especially if people are willing do honor deals and arrangements. The main reason demons have gotten a bad reputation is either a few belligerent types standing out, or welshers trying to garner sympathy for their poorly construed deal.\" Lilith explains, seeming pleased that Jack is more open-minded than most previous Warlocks had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thinking over the story, Jack decides to puzzle out exactly what other uses a basic animation spell could have, and if he could possibly find new methods of use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"So, from what I can think of, the spell can be used for many things, combat, housekeeping, sex, just about anything if one can think it through, so why is it considered basic?\" Jack finally asks, exhausting all the possible way he could think of, but not voicing them, as he assumed (rightly) that Lilith would guess at what he meant by each category.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"That is the crux of the problem Master, the spell is basic because while it has limitless potential, you can only program one or two orders into said target. Hrm, thinking on it, and drawing on your memories, it would be similar to the first Harry Potter film, with transfiguration. The subject is only limited by ones imagination, but the starter spells are there to help work a person up to the higher tiers. In the movie, they worked on turning a match into a needle, and later on they learned how to turn a desk into an animal. In this case, basic animation is that scene from the movie, and later on, you'll obtain a more versatile version.\" Lilith responds, causing Jack to be surprised by her referencing a movie, then catching the comment about his memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Wait a second, you are able to 'draw on my memories'?\" Jack asks, worried about what Lilith could have possibly seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"No worries Master, to use another reference, it's like the Holy Grail info dump from the fate/stay series. In this case, I get general knowledge of the time from you, as well as spending time on the internet. Helps with explaining things to new warlocks, and beats trying to catch up on pop-culture references,\" Lilith answers, winking at the end with a coy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Deciding to shelve the topic of his memories, and all the other parts of her explanation, Jack refocuses on the basic animation spell. Deciding to just attempt it, Jack picks out a dragon statute sitting on his desk. Picturing in his mind what he wanted the statue to do, in this case, move its wings and bob its head at random intervals, Jack starts to practice saying the spell's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Long moments of practice, with Lilith occasionally correcting his pronunciation, Jack finally feels confident enough to attempt the spell, and does so. The effect is instant, as the dragon statutes wings start moving and head start bobbing every few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well done Master, and cute about the effects. A few more success' and you can consider the spell mastered. Don't forget though, while basic, you also noticed that it's only limit is the amount of input you can store, so while weak, you can still get alot of mileage out of this spell.\" Lilith congratulates Jack, standing up and moving across the room to stand before Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Thanks Lilith, your story, as well as your advice helped, but is there any reason your so close all of a sudden?\" Jack asks, not exactly worried, but curious as to the sudden actions of the succubus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, I figured you deserved a reward for learning the spell so quickly, or are you saying you don't want one?\" Lilith answers, a pout forming on her face as she finishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feeling a sense of accomplishment, and happy that he had made some progress, Jack almost responds absentmindedly, but notices a glint of mischief flash through Lilith's eyes. Leaning back from Lilith, Jack decides to figure out what his mischievous succubus is really up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Normally I wouldn't be adverse to rewards for good work, but then i recall you haven't been teasing me like normal, and then there's the fact that while you haven't proven evil, you are sneaky as hell, and willing to cause mischief whenever possible....so what exactly are you up to Lilith?\" Jack asks with a slight smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Grinning from his words, Lilith steps back before answering, but also starts to fondle her body at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"How observant of you Master, and in this case, you're partially right. My reward was going to be a simple kiss, while trying to entice you into some sex, and possibly pushing you out of your comfort zone. In this case, since you caught me in the act, I'll leave the choice up to you, we can continue with you learning spells, or you can get your reward,\" Lilith responds, teasing her body and emenating a low-level aura of lust that seems to spike whenever Lilith fondles her breasts or pussy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shuddering at the increased arousal Jack feels flood his body, he shakes his head, trying to maintain control, and decide on what he wished to do, without Lilith's influence if he could help it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

Course decided, Jack then wonders what exactly were the limits to this spell as it merely mentioned 'advanced', and so far Jack hadn't heard what qualified as Advanced. Deciding to ask about that as well, Jack looks up, and sees Lilith idly playing with herself, seeming bored, yet still going through the motions. Confused at such a contrast of action and emotion, Jack can only stare at the scene in befuddlement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0A few minutes later Lilith notices Jack's confused stare, and chortles, snapping Jack out of his confused gazing. Regathering himself, and noticing that Lilith has stopped her actions, and is sitting up and looking straight at him, Jack clears his throat before voicing his questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"If you're not too busy Lilith, I need your help with a spell I found, especially as it mentioned that Succubus help was advised. Also, if you don't mind me asking, why did you look so bored while playing with yourself?\" Jack inquires, sounding unsure with his second question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah, you must have found the advance learning spell...a useful but dangerous spell, especially as most previous Book holders decided to try the spell solo. As to me looking bored, well the truth is, there is only so much masturbation one soul can stand before it seems uninteresting. While Succubi/Inccubi are perpetual Lust creatures, we do get bored if it's never different. Since sex is like eating for us, an example you could appreciate would be this: Imagine if you went from eating a delicious bowl of flavored oatmeal that you enjoyed on occasion, to eating it every day for every meal for a few months.\" Lilith responds, then smiles at the look of aghast horror that spreads across Jack's face after hearing her analogy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Yeah, that spell.\" Jack responds in a daze. Long moments of silence pass by, \"But if it's boring to you to masturbate, then why have you been teasing me so often with all of your random bouts of playing with yourself?\" Jack asks, confused by her actions after her explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Lilith smirks at the question. \"Well Master, that is quite simple. To keep with the previous example, imagine if a new element, in this case you or another person, is introduced to the oatmeal. It would taste less bland, especially if one found enough ways to keep adding new 'spice' to the meal. In this case, your reactions to my teasing help make it slightly interesting, and while I may look bored on occasion while pleasuring myself, it's mostly because without you paying attention, or me 'spicing' up the act, it kinda is an ingrained habbit by now. It was definitely more effect a few centuries ago, when previous Book holders were stupid enough to drag me and others around into town. Oh the fun it was to see those peoples reactions....I digress, lets get back to your first question.\" Lilith answers, a wide grin at the embarressed look covering Jack's features currently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Shaking himself, and deciding to shelve the topic, Jack accedes to Lilith's suggestion, and asks what counts as advanced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, advanced are usually the top tier spells for the Warlock, usually the ones that make up their reputation, or are their secret weapon for whatever opponent they expect to face. Some previous Warlocks dabbled in other fields away from Love and Lust, and gained control over Hellfire, Void, and even Binding magics. Just those three fields alone caused many hunts to wipe out all Warlock candidates to prevent such monsters from being formed again.\" Lilith responds, looking thoughtfully the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"What do you mean about those fields creating monsters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Quite simple really. In most myths Medusa was considered a monster because of her appearance, and her ability to turn people to stone with her gaze, but the simple truth is that she had branched out of the normal fields of magic, and had found a way to turn people into stone who bothered her and her sisters. In response, people kept attacking her, and her sister's island, in hopes of either slaying her, and raping her sisters, or obtaining her magical knowledge. Those Warlocks that pushed into new fields had developed new magics that were hard to counter, and many wished to 'demonize' them, and as such, caused the hunts that wiped out that branch of caster.\" Lilith states, seeming amused about the written history's difference between what she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"So if they advanced the field, does that mean the spell types are available to me, or were those just examples of what might be in the book under 'advanced'?\" Jack asks, somewhat eager to find out more of this topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, I know for sure that Binding magic is in the advanced section, but I would suggest staying away from such, as that kind of magic requires great deals of energy to cast, as well as drawing the attention of all the supernatural beings within a good radius of the caster. An example would be the summoning and binding of a lesser god, that would be technically available to you with this route, but you would automatically be hunted down by the lesser's friends, if not some of the Greater gods as they would be wary since they would be the next logical step for the spell progression.\" Lilith answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Ok, Binding sounds like it's out as I'll either kill myself on energy cost, or by drawing too much attention to myself, but what about the other two fields....and if the advanced field doesn't work out, can the spell be directed to an intermediate spell instead?\" Jack muses aloud, before focusing on an idea to still get somewhere with the Learning spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, I know void would also technically be in the advanced, as Summoning can technically be classified there, but if were going by what you can currently do, you would be unable to utilize even one of the basic spells in that category, as the energy cost is twice what you can produce currently. You could try an advanced summoning spell, but if the creature is stronger than you, there is a good chance it will simply kill or kidnap you, depending on what is summoned.\" Lilith responds, before pausing. \"Yes, you could, with my help, alter the target from advanced to intermediate, but it might have unforeseen consequences. As to Intermediate spells, you technically can cast most of them right now, but whether they prove useful to you, is up to you to determine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thinking on all Lilith has said, Jack still want's to cast this spell, especially if he could get something fun or useful out of it. Settling on casting the spell, Jack nods to himself, then asks Lilith for more information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"What kind of spells would you suggest from Intermediate Lilith?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, I personally know how to use a great deal of those spells for different uses, but for you personally, I would probably pick something that you can use quite often, either for fun or practice, and in some cases, combat. On that train of thought, you could go with a Possession spell, or one of its variants. A Transformation spell into a certain creature might be helpful, as you could get experience as well as practice for possible fights, as some people still are hunting Warlocks, if not other creatures.\" Lilith pauses, as if in thought, before nodding her head and looking at Jack with a small smile forming on her lips. \"One last category you could try would be mind affecting, and with that you would have to determine the type, as well as effect, since their are many ways to affect the mind and what afflicts it. There once was a Warlock that actually lived to old age and died in his sleep, simply because none wished to suffer his response after the first few attempts on him failed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Intrigued by the last, Jack decides to inquire more before making a final decision. \"What was his feared spell that stopped the attacks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Lilith smirks widely, causing a shiver to run down Jack's spine.\"Oh, he was one of my favorite Masters, as he had decided to make an aura spell, quite similar to the pheromones you release Master, that caused all who attempted to attack him to fall in love with him, man or women, and serve him faithfully. Those that attempted to attack from a range, found that he kept up constant spell shields that deflected and traced that attack. After said attack, he would send one of his minions off to capture the attacker, then bring them close enough to enthrall the attacker.\" Lilith says, rubbing her thighs as the memory was apparently arousing to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Deciding that that wasn't what he was after, Jack thanked Lilith, and asked for a few minutes to himself to make a final decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"As you wish Master,\" was Lilith's only response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Jack decided on...<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

Everything else, like memories or things like that, stay inside the original body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds interesting. Can we try it out?\" You ask Lilith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith chuckles as she hears how enthusiastic you ask her. \"Master as it is an intermediate spell, it's not a spell that you can just do by reciting it. And besides you have to be absolutely sure of two things. The first thing is that you can recite the spell perfectly, no syllables or pronunciations spoken out wrong. Otherwise the spell might not work or it can cause for some serious damage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the second thing?\" You ask her a little afraid now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to consider who to swap.

You thought it would be as easy as some of the stories you read online on the internet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not a problem, as for the first person to swap. I would suggest you pick someone you can trust. After all, it could be handy to have an ally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, perhaps I should take you.\" You tell her excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" Lilith asks confused. \"You could so I suppose, though I've never done such a thing before.

The second is a pentagram.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pentagram, you mean I have to make one of those?\" You ask Lilith. She nods at your question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, master, but your room is a bit too small for it. Couldn't we use the basement instead?\" She asks you curious. Of course that would be the perfect place to do the ritual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hurry downstairs and without your mother noticing to the basement. It's quite dark inside though you don't fear anything more. After all you have a succubus now. I mean what more could harm you in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is excellent master.\" Lilith says as she looks around. \"It's quite old down here, perfect for old magic to take place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you like it.

I'm really looking forward to it myself.\" You tell her scratching your head. Why do you feel so shy all of a sudden?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master I think I should thank you properly for your generosity.\" And with that Lilith kisses you on your mouth. The kiss is so spontaneous you can hardly think about it. But you quickly grab Lilith and kiss her back. Lilith is surprised at it, but she doesn't mind it at all. She then takes your hands and push them on her ass. You get the signal and squeeze inside her bottom, massaging it and playing with it as a pro. It doesn't take long to get your member hard again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No foreplay?\" She asks quite innocent though a glance at her eyes tell you otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No foreplay.\" You tell her as you grab her and push her against the wall as your member squeezes inside of her. You can't believe the sensation as your member enters her. It feels like thousand of little brushes are rubbing against your it, almost making you cum immediately. It's only that Lilith trained you, you try to stop it from happening. Instead you begin to concentrate on making Lilith orgasm first. Your hands rub all over her beautiful pale long legs, stroking them with each turn. Then you begin kissing her neck which makes her give Goosebumps. Then your tongue makes it all the way from her neck to her breasts, just waiting for you to be touched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good master, I think you finally get it.\" Lilith says with pleasure in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then tightens her legs around you somehow squeezing her vagina further and despite your training you still cum first inside her.<br>\r\nLilith notices your reaction and gently smiles at you. \"Don't worry master, we still have plenty of time to get you better.\" And with that you get to the second round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning you wake up with a hangover on your bed. You barely can remember anything about last night, except for the fact that you slept with Lilith. Looking besides you, you can see Lilith lying next to you with her eyes closed. You rub your face as you can't believe you had sex with a succubus. You should be glad you're still alive, ancient folklore told of succubus taking away your life force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look at your alarm clock you notice it's....</span></div></div>",

You didn't notice him sitting there for a second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, just thought that I saw a cockroach running on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A cockroach, ewe!\" The girls in front of you scream, and soon the whole bus is in a panic. When you arrive at school everything is cool again and you quickly make your way out of the bus, before the bus driver knows you were the one to spread the rumor. As you walk to the entrance you can see Sarah standing with a few of her friends as well. You can't wait until Lilith swaps with her, you're feeling excited about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is however the problem of getting her to your basement. You know each other a little, but not good enough that she would follow you into your basement. You needed to solve this problem, but how?</span></div></div>",

You hadn't actually expected to get this far. And then you remember the book. \"I actually wanted your help with something. You know that European History project?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... homework.\" Sarah looks disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's really cool!\" You start. \"I found this really old book that looks like it has actual spells in it... and I thought it would be cool to show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. Well, let's see it, I guess.\" Sarah, still not super impressed, replies. \"So where is this book?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. I left it in the basement. I had to clean it out a bit, and took the book with me. Must have left it there.\" You say. You know full well why the book is in the basement, and you hope Lilith has everything prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's go then?\" Sarah asks impatiently, and motions to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk with Sarah down to the basement, and you start feeling a little guilty. What if you screw up? What might happen to Sarah? Surely... Lilith wouldn't let that happen. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you enter the basement, you see all of your dad's boxes moved off to the side, and a large pentagram set up on the ground. Lilith had been busy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this the book?\" Sarah asks, finding the tome on a box nearby. She seems completely oblivious to the pentagram.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... you were right, this does look cool. Can't understand a thing, though.\" Sarah wanders over into the middle, and you see this as your chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...\" you say, and walk over. \"Want to see what I found in there last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the book and flip through the pages til you find the one with the soul swap spell. Lilith walks up behind you and stands in the middle as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a pentagram?\" Sarah asks. Your heart stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On that page you were on.\" You breathe a sigh of relief. \"What does this say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe begins reading the letters on the page, even though they sound like nonsense. You start muttering the same words under your breath. Sarah just seems to think you're reading over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to sense a faint trickle of power from the book. This soon grows until it feels overwhelming. Sarah doesn't even seem to notice, and continues reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little more, Master,\" Lilith whispers to you. You bear with it and continue reading. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a flash of light bursts from the book. Sarah screams and drops the book. A second later, everything is quiet. Sarah is standing still next to you with a blank expression on her face. As far as you know, Lilith is still behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah?\" You ask, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lilith, or rather Sarah in Lilith's body, crosses her arms and looks at you expectantly. \"So that book... it's real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Sarah, in Lilith's body, responds. \"You're kidding.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not kidding. The page you read was a soul swap spell. And it looks like it worked.\" You reply, defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, who exactly did I swap with?\" Lilith demands. \"No one else was in the room. Especially not another woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... that's the spirit in the book. I accidentally set her free a couple of days ago. She's kind of a demon, but she's really nice and ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop right there.\" Lilith cuts you off. \"You put a <i>demon</i> in my body? And now im stuck in <i>her</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod gravely. \"I'm sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unbelievable. Absolutely unbelievable. Why me? Of literally every person you could have done this to, why me?\" Lilith asks, on the verge of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I really like you and I thought that I could get to know you a bit better this way\" you confess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you put your pet demon whore in my body? What were you going to do, fuck me nonstop?\" Lilith is in hysterics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, stop.\" Sarah - Lilith in Sarah's body - says. \"I talked him into it. And he wasn't planning on abusing your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was weird, hearing Sarah's voice talking about herself in third person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And watch who you're calling a whore. Because right now that's <i>you</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fantastic. I've lost my body, and now the impostor is giving me a pep talk.\" Lilith complains. \"Jack, fix this. Right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't, I don't know how...\" you say. Guilt is eating you up now. How could you have done this to Sarah? How could it have ever sounded like a good idea?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, crybaby.\" Sarah said. \"One of the perks of being, as you so nicely put it, a <i>pet demon whore</i>, is that you get all the perks. You're powerful, kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what the hell is that supposed to mean?\" Lilith cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was a shapeshifter who could possess people.\" You say, quietly. \"And while she's you and you're her, you probably can do all that too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't quite that simple, but he got most of it.\" Sarah said. \"While I'm you right now, <i>Sarah</i>, and you're me, you do have all of that good stuff. Name's Lilith, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't <i>want</i> your stupid powers! I just want my life back!\" Lilith exclaimed, still tearing up. Then, she ran up to Sarah. \"Give me my body back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith grabbed Sarah by the collar and brought her face close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Sarah screamed, then suddenly went quiet. You watch as Lilith phased into Sarah, until it was just Sarah standing there. Sarah looked herself over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't ever talk to me again!\" Sarah yelled in your face and stormed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what? The spell had worked. Except then Sarah had gone and possessed her old body and run off, taking Lilith along with her. Now you were alone. You could feel that you did still have some power, but without Lilith to guide you, you figure there wasn't much point. Resigned, you take the book and walk back up to your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what happened? I saw Sarah leave, and she looked furious.\" Samantha had come home from school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.\" You reply glumly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plan backfired, huh?\" Sam replied. \"Sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make it back to your room, throw the book on the table, and collapse on the bed.

Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... hi?\" You say, surprised. \"I thought you didnt want to speak to me again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I <i>am</i> still mad at you, but I still thought I owed you an apology for yesterday\" she said. You were surprised. \"I just had no idea how to react...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I should be the one apologizing. That was a major douche move I pulled.\" You apologize. \"Want to come inside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure\" she replied.

You take your desk chair, face it towards the bed, and sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who else is home?\" Sarah asks. \"Didn't hear anyone when we came up\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just Sam and me. She's probably on her computer and can't hear a thing\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.\" Sarah says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... how's it going?\" You ask, kind of lamely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, being a ... succubus\" Sarah paused, \"isn't actually all that bad. It can be quite fun, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" You ask, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I jumped into Jess last night.\" Sarah confessed. \"She was going out with her friends, and I... I wanted to go\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing! I got drunk and danced all night! It was so much fun!

I dunno. Either way, we talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... she's surprisingly chill for a succubus.\" You  mused. \"Didn't expect that. Well, didn't expect a succubus at all, really\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I was wondering... \" Sarah began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if I... possess someone in your family for a little?\" Sarah asked sheepishly.

After about five seconds, you see <i>another</i> Sarah slide out of the first Sarah. A few more seconds pass as she phases out, and you're left looking at <i>two</i> Sarahs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi!\" Says the first Sarah. \"Been a while, ma... Jack\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilith?\" You ask, catching on to what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one and only\" Lilith replies from Sarah's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok ok, so Lilith said I should just... You can still see me, right Jack?\" The second Sarah, the succubus, asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, go ahead\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. So...\" Sarah mutters, and walks up to you. She reaches out with her hand and grips your shoulder. Except it's weird, she seems to be inside your shoulder. With a small pull, you feel your whole center of gravity shift, and you find yourself with a slight headache. And, you see your arms. And another pair of your arms, except transparent. \"Whoa, so cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah pulls more, and soon your... spirit, you guess, has left your body. You find yourself staring at Sarah standing next to a sitting down <i>you</i> who looks to be sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I just realized. You're gonna be a <i>girl</i>!\" Sarah giggles, then added, \"And I guess I get to be a guy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, you ready?\" She asks, then without really waiting for a reply, shoves your spirit into her old body. You feel something like an electric shock run through your entire body, and you find yourself standing up, completely solid. In front of you is Sarah, standing next to your body, which is still sitting down and dozing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go...\" she says, and twirls herself into your body's back. She phases in, and disappears. Then, your body stands up and stretches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm, I still haven't gotten used to jumping into someone, it still feels so weird...\" you hear your own voice say. \"Oh wow, my voice! This is so weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then start to become truly aware of your new body. The long brown hair in your eyes and down your neck. The soft woven blouse you're wearing instead of your usual t-shirt. The light constricting feeling of a bra around your breasts. The fact that you have breasts... Then the jeans, which feel like they're a size too small as they grip every inch of your hips and legs... The lack of anything <i>between</i> your legs, which is the most discomforting of all. And finally you think that you're probably wearing sneakers or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" you breathe, admiring your now much slimmer, more delicate hands. You raise a hand to your mouth, hearing your new voice. \"You're right, this <i>is</i> weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, <i>Sarah</i>,\" your body asks you, \"How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...\" you mutter, still in awe of your new form, \"Good, I think\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, so since I'm you and you're me now... what do you say we spend the whole weekend like this? Maybe Monday too?\" Sarah, from your body, asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, umm...\" you're a bit stunned. \"Ok, I guess... Sorry, I just don't know anything about being a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't a phrase you ever expected to say, yet here you are. Actually a girl. A teenager, and a very pretty one at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you'll be fine. Plus, Lilith is there to help you out, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, sure am\" Lilith chimed in, her voice echoing for all of you to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And... I hope you know your phone number\" Sarah said, \"Because <i>Sarah</i> should be using <i>Sarah's</i> phone, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sinks in. You're actually going to spend a weekend <i>as Sarah</i>. You'll be living her life, with her phone. And...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and of course you'd be sleeping in my bed at my house. You are me, after all.\" Sarah added. Wow. Sarah's bed. You begin to blush a little. \"Too much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little bit more chatting, you decide that it's time \"Sarah\" headed home. So, you get her stuff together and walk to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye Jack! Was nice seeing you!\" You yell, staying in character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you on Monday!\" Your voice calls back to you as you step off the pavement into Sarah's car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Master\" Lilith says in your head, \"Shall we go home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you drove your way to Sarah's place, Lilith giving directions as necessary. You had never actually seen Sarah's house before. And now, you technically lived there... After a fifteen minute drive, you're there. It's a decent house, and you let yourself in, walk to Sarah's room and collapse on the bed. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thinking on it, Jack theorizes that if he's not fighting it, and isn't paying attention, Lilith must be able to move 'your' body at will. Considering this, and not wanting Lilith to do more than occasional wandering hands, Jack forms a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"I'm open to suggestions, aside from playing with ourselves Lilith. While it might be interesting to do, i honestly dont feel in the mood to do so right now,\" Jack answers. Looking down again, Jack notices that the hand has made it to the jean opening, and somehow, while you were busy thinking, managed to get them unbuttoned and unzipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But Mistress, your missing out on the new experiences you could be having with the female form!\" Lilith responds, and suddenly a strong surge of lust shoots through Jack's body, lancing from his chest, through his breasts, and finishing right at his nether region. Shuddering from the sudden spike, and knowing exactly who is to blame, Jack ponders if there is some way to distract his horny succubus. Realizing a possible avenue, Jack quickly speaks out a question, hopefully before Lilith gets any more mischievous ideas on how to force Jack's hand, literally and figuratively!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Lilith, I know we don't have the book with us, but is there any way you can teach me some magic? If not, maybe you could tell me more about some feats of magic or interesting history of succubi and warlocks?!?\" Jack pleads, while pushing his left hand towards his right, clamping down on it, and dragging it away from his pantie's opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Aww, was close to getting somewhere,\" Lilith murmurs in a pouting tone, even if you couldn't see it, you knew it was there. \"I could teach you a few spells, the ones i know that you might be able to cast, or i could tell you interesting bits of history...OR we could have some fun!\" Lilith finishes with a loud exclamation, and suddenly another wave shoots through Jack, again ramping up his lust to even more distracting levels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You didn't get up to much for the rest of the evening - what would you do? Everything around was so new to you, you didn't even know where to begin. So, you did the only logical thing - nothing. The next day, at about 11 or so in the morning, you hear a song playing from somewhere in the room. You spot the source as Sarah's phone on her dresser. The number looks familiar - it's your number! Well, your body's number. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" you answer the phone, still not used to hearing Sarah's voice when you speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" you hear your own voice on the other line. \"I was looking through the book last night, and you'll never believe it... Has Jess left for the mall yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so...\" you reply. Jess was Sarah's older sister, and she had left maybe half an hour before to go to the mall with her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome, I'll be right over. Trust me, you'll want to see this.\" Your voice says, then hangs up the line. A short time later, you hear a knocking on the door. You open it to see your body standing there... and Sarah seems to have cleaned it up pretty nice. 'You're' wearing dark jeans, a dress shirt with sleeves rolled up, and 'your' hair is even slightly spiked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I didn't realize I... err, you could look that good\" you awkwardly say, remembering only mid-sentence that you were supposed to <i>act</i> as Sarah as well as just sit around in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Uhh... is that what you were wearing yesterday?\" 'Jack' asks you as you walk up to Sarah's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... yeah...\" you say. You hadn't gotten changed since getting here yesterday, you were so overwhelmed by everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.. ok. Anyway.\" 'Jack' says and sits at Sarah's - your - work desk and opens the book. \"I was leafing through this yesterday, and I found that I could actually make sense of everything! Well, sort of.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean over behind 'Jack' to try to get a look at the page in front of you, and find an unfamiliar, not unpleasant pressure below your shoulder. You look down and see your left breast pushing against 'Jack's' shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" you pull back slightly, readjust and look at the page. It still seems foreign to you. \"How can you understand that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be one of the perks of these new powers I have.\" 'Jack' replied. \"Although everything I saw yesterday still needs the warlock to channel whatever energy. And the warlock in this case is still you, no matter <i>what</i> body you're in. So, miss warlock, let's see what we can do, hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Jack' is excitedly turning page after page, and you stand with a slight nervous feeling. You're still not comfortable being Sarah, and now you're suddenly looking at doing magic? Hopefully it'll at least be a distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.. what's this one? Another's Eyes... become a passenger in someone else's body, seeing and feeling everything they do but not being in control..\" 'Jack' reads, then turns the page. \"That's kind of boring. I mean, we're piloting someone else's body right now, aren't we, <i>Sarah</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really enjoying this, aren't you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'm still a bit shocked. Which is weird considering that you're the one who got the most of it...\" you say. \"Anyway, what else is there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see... Compulsion... someone under compulsion will answer whatever the warlock asks without heed for what it is... That's kind of cool but pretty limited. Oh. Triggering and enhancing familiar sensations... so we can make someone angry or happy, I guess?\" 'Jack' looks a bit puzzled. \"Now this one looks complicated. Put thoughts into someone's subconscious... this is basically hypnosis, right? And here's another one, making someone move involuntarily. But it looks like it only lasts for a second or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of those could be cool,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's test them out!\" 'Jack' says enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On who? There's no one around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go to the mall! We'll find plenty of people to test some of these out on there... Or do you have any other suggestions?\"</span></div></div>",

I'd almost forgotten.\" you sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I really want to try some of these out... \" 'Jack' whines. You see a smile creeping onto his face as he flips back a few pages. Then, he begins reading from the book in a language you don't understand. You begin to feel a slight tingle in your arms, which slowly spreads throughout the rest of your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh... what are you doing?\" you whisper. 'Jack' keeps reading, and the tingling sensation intensifies. Soon the tingling turns into a warm feeling centered mostly below your throat, as if you had just had a cup of hot tea. The heat spreads down, and soon you feel a tickling feeling in your breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah\" you let out a small moan as the tickling grows more intense and a feeling of pleasure starts to build from your breasts. You also become aware of a slight wetness in your crotch. 'Jack' keeps reading, louder, and the pleasure flows down through your body and to your hips. The wet feeling in your crotch grows as you begin to feel a buildup of pressure in your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step back, and your legs wobble slightly. The feeling is ... very pleasant, and it is something you've never felt before. You vaguely hear pages being turned, and stumble back another step as your knees buckle. The pleasure is still increasing, you open your mouth to say something but all you can do is moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Jack' continues reading from the new page, and you feel your hands start to move on their own. One reaches under your blouse, caressing your slightly sweaty stomach and working its way up to your breasts. The other makes its way down, unbuttoning your jeans, and snaking its way past your underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out another moan as one hand reaches into your bra, squeezing the firm mound of flesh under it, and lightly brushes your nipple. Your other hand, reaching into your pants, makes contact with your pussy, and you feel an immediate burst of pleasure more than what you were currently feeling. Your hand continues to stroke your pussy, gently massaging. The pressure in your groin is building even more, and you find yourself collapsing onto the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god...\" you moan quietly, the pleasure you feel slowly overwhelming you as one hand stops moving. The only thing you care about right now is the hand that's in your pants, and that it doesn't stop. You feel it slide back and forth across the moist surface of your nethers, until it suddenly pushes its way in. A loud, erotic moan escapes you as you forcefully begin pushing your fingers in and out, in and out. The pressure in your groin reaches climax in one final burst of exhilarating pleasure, then starts to cool down. You're left lying on your bed, one hand now at your side, the other in your jeans, panting for breath, slightly sweaty and red in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lie there, breathing heavily, you see your former body stand up and run out of the room, a suspicious bulge in those fancy jeans. At this point you don't care, and continue to lie there in the afterglow of your first female orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, 'Jack' walks back in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fun. And really, <i>really</i> hot.\" he says. \"I didn't realize I... er, you could do that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's one of the spells?\" you ask, still short on breath. \"You made me masturbate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two spells, actually.\" 'Jack' grinned. \"The first one got you all hot and bothered, while the second one convinced your hands to help out. And yes, I probably shouldn't have done that, but you owed me one from a couple of days ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus you can't tell me you didn't enjoy it...\" he adds. You definitely can't deny that. \"So what now? Want to go have a shower, then we can go and mess with people at the mall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat could be fun, now that you know the power of the spells in the book firsthand... by your own hand, which you finally take out of your pants.</span></div></div>",

All of a sudden there was a blinding flash and became disoriented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jack regained his senses, he realized that he was sitting on the ground. Jack felt tired and weight down, also saw a stroller in front of him. Jack pulled out his hands to look at them and noticed they looked a bit aged, feminine and had a golden wedding band on. He then looked down and saw a large belly that blocked his view. \"Mommy, are you ok?\" Asked a little girl standing right next to him. \"I'm fine, I just fell down\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah walked over to jack and recited another spell. The little girl suddenly had a blank expression on her face and started to push the stroller as Sarah helped Jack back on his or her new feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah whispered to Jack \" you're now Laura Wilson, 34, mother of soon to be 3.

Realizing that Sarah has apparently gone mad with power, Jack gets help from an unexpected, but greatly appreciated voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0'You are still the Master,' Jack hears Lilith, faintly, as if she is greatly tired, or very far away. Rapidly considering what she said, and his situation, jack fights to keep a grin off his face, just barely succeeding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Hoping this works, Jack looks 'Jack' in the eye, and states authoritatively, \"You will halt, not move or act without my say so Succubus, and will not attempt to scheme or plot anymore without my input. Furthermore, you will reverse the spell you have cast, and put us back to before you affected 'Laura Wilson' !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A look of shock and anger crosses 'Jack's' face, and with a snarl, tries to say something, but instead snaps 'his' fingers. Jack's world fades, and then returns, and he notices the Wilson family continue on down the street, looking none the wiser about what had almost happened. Sighing in relief, Jack turns to the glaring form of Sarah, who looks apocalyptic with unvoiced rage, but with a tinge of what looks like fear occasionally flashing across 'his' face. Looking Sarah in her borrowed eyes, Jack just can't see the girl he felt a crush on, and wondered if it was her true personality that had been hidden, or if the book and power had corrupted her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Wondering if there would be any way to fix this situation, Jack decides to see if he can at least get some answers about what prompted this behavior. Taking a breath, and counting to ten, hoping those calming exercises he always hears people go on about will help here, Jack begins to question Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Succubus, I want you to answer the next few questions I put to you truthfully and fully, without leaving out any detail, and I do not want to you to ramble on in hopes of distracting me, as that would be <i><b>Plotting </b></i>or <i><b>Scheming</b></i> against me.\" Jack states, taking as authoritative tone as he can in his current body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Grinding 'his' teeth, 'Jack' merely grunts out \"Of course, Master\", looking as if 'he' wishes 'he' could say otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"While messing with the spell book last night, did you cast any spells that affected your behavior, or have your actions been your own without influence from the book today?\" Jack asks, hoping that his crush isn't so cold and cruel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"I cast a spell that described removing possible hindrances to ones fun, but dulling a persons morals, or something along those lines. I originally wanted to cast many spells last night, but was too afraid to do so, until i came upon that spell. After casting it, i felt too tired to try anything else last night, and also found that many of the spells i had tried to memorize were a blank to me as well.\" Sarah answers in a monotone voice, all the while glaring daggers at Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reflecting on what Sarah had said, Jack feels immense relief that her base personality wasn't so dark, but was also confused as to how to fix the current situation. Thinking further, and remembering that Lilith had been able to contact him somehow, Jack tentatively tries to reach out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0'Lilith, can you respond right now? It sounded like you were having trouble earlier, and thank you for helping me escape Sarah's grasp,' Jack directs towards Lilith, hoping he's being successful in this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0'Yes Master, i can hear you better now, though I am quite tired right now,' you hear her respond in a drained tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0'Did contacting me tire you out? Also, do you have any suggestions on how to fix this situation,' Jack asks, gaining some worry that the situation could be worse than what he currently knows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0'Yes, trying to contact you while you were in another body, while i'm away from mine, required me to expend soul energy, and it did not help that the distance was greater than your apparent 'reception range' was,' Lilith explains, while trying to interject some humor at the end. Continuing to answer ' And yes, they're a few ways to 'fix' this situation, depending on how one wishes to proceed.' Near the end of her reply, sounding slightly stronger than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0'The simplest method would be to cast a spell to give her back her morals, or something to that effect. The only reason this would fail, would be if we did not act before it became permanent, as some spells in the book are prone to be.' Upon hearing this, Jack takes the book out of 'Jack's' unmoving hands, and quickly turns the pages, scanning for the described spell. Finding it, Jack's hope starts to fall, as the spell's effectiveness hinges on Sarah's answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Sarah, at what time did you cast the spell last night,\" Jack asks, not thinking about how he had phrased the question<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Eleven-thirty last night,\" is the simple response Jack receives. Looking down at his watch, Jack misses the smirk that appears on 'Jack's' face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0'Five minutes to cast a spell - is there anything else i need to know Lilith?' Jack asks hurriedly, hoping it can be as simple as it's looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0'Only that if you cast the 'counter-spell' after the time limit, the results could be random. You could have a 'cured' Sarah, or you could have some other Morals implanted in, even some that would be considered strange.' Lilith warns, unable to say more, as unknown to Jack, her body and soul are both bound by orders given by the warlock!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ok then, here goes nothing,\" Jack says aloud, and starts to chant the spell while making the hand motions the book describes, missing 'Jack's' slowly forming Cheshire like grin. Looking up at the last second, Jack worries upon seeing 'his' face looking as it does, but before he could say or do anything, a sudden flash occurs ....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

You see Sarah emerge from your old body, stand up and face you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what?\" Sarah asks you. \"What gives?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, remember how you're the succubus and I'm the warlock, even if you're in my body and I'm in yours?\" you say smugly, your eyes - and everything else, since you're effectively looking at a twin copy of yourself - level with hers, \"Turns out I'm still in charge if I want to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you wouldn't...\" she says, slightly shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you wouldn't do what you did before, so we're all full of surprises\" you say, matter-of-factly. \"Now, my dear succubus, please come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah walks over to you, and stops with her face mere inches from your own. You look her up and down, catching a glimpse of yourself while you're at it. Two identical Sarahs, staring at each other. Except that you imagined that the look on <i>your</i> face was significantly more evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I get you to do... hm?\" you wonder out loud. \"Something... like what you did to me? Or no... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, an idea hits you. A perverted idea, but after what she had done to you just minutes ago, it seemed fitting.</span></div></div>",

Why pull me out of your body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because\", you smile, leaning in so close that you're almost touching her. You take a step forward and whisper in her ear \"You're coming with me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah stops. You figure she hadn't been expecting that at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprised?\" you pull back from her ear and begin speaking normally again, but still being very close. Your breasts are almost touching hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um..\" she stutters. \"It's a bit weird, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all!\" you reply. \"I figure since you were ok with making me play with <i>your</i> body, you'd also be ok with sharing the experience... It is just you, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not saying...\" Sarah's eyes widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just did. Now, come on. Lead me to the shower.\" you cut her off. Forced to obey, she grabs you by the arm and pulls you out of the room, walking you down the hallway and to another room a couple of doors down. She closes the door behind you. You look around and see a large vanity unit with an equally large mirror - in which you see only your reflection, despite Sarah being right next to you - as well as a luxurious bathtub with a fancy-looking shower head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, that looks fancy.\" you say, turning to face Sarah. You move your hand towards her, slipping it gently under her shirt. She flinches slightly. \"Shh.. don't worry, it'll be fine. <i>You'll enjoy it</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last part being emphasized as more of a command, you see Sarah's expression change slightly as she smiles. \"As you wish... <i>Mistress</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hand strokes her bare flesh, and you take the moment to put your other hand under her shirt as well. Sarah smiles at you and bites her lip as you slowly lift her shirt over her head, exposing a pink lace bra covering her breasts. You discard her shirt - it technically wasn't real anyway - and look at her again, as she moves in closer and presses her body to yours. She grinds against you, her jeans rubbing against yours, her hands on your ass, squeezing. She lifts her hands and removes your blouse in one swift movement, revealing an identical pink bra covering identical breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push your bare stomach against hers, feeling her smooth skin against your own. Your lips find their way to her neck as her hands reach to your back, unclasping your bra. She gently slides it off, and you pull back. You look in the mirror to see Sarah, completely topless with a hungry look on her face. You lick your lips, watching the reflection do the same. Turning your attention back to the other Sarah in the room, you caress her skin, also making your way to remove her bra. Having done so, you press your bare breasts against hers and move your hands down to her jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping around to her back, breasts pushed firmly against her, you snake your hand down to the button of her jeans. You fumble with it, unzip the zipper, and push your hand down into her pants. You feel a familiar sensation as your hands touch her pussy - except that this time it's not the one on your body - and you crouch down, pulling her jeans off her. You run your nose up along her smooth, hairless legs, biting her panties - also pink with lace - and tugging them down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving removed her clothes, you impatiently stand waiting for her to do the same to you. Not disappointing, Sarah closes in on your already undone jeans and pulls them and your panties down in one fell swoop. You step out of the jeans, catching the reflection of a now completely naked Sarah - something you hadn't even dreamed before, but were living now in more ways than one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, mistress.\" Sarah cooes, making her way into the shower and turning on the water. Hot water immediately flows from the shower, and the mirror begins to fog up. You make your way over to her, standing under the hot water, as she stands behind you. Pressing her breasts hard into your back, she begins to stroke you all over with a lotion. Her hands start at your neck, massaging gently down your arms, where she then moves to your hips and makes her way back up. She cups your breasts, fingering the nipples and causing you to let out a sharp breath in pleasure - this felt better with another's hands doing the work. After stroking your breasts, she makes her way back down your stomach, and begins teasing you by rubbing the area around your nethers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around, kissing her passionately, rubbing your soapy body all over hers, breasts pushing against breasts. The feeling is indescribable, as you run your hands down her wet, naked form. Sarah pulls back from the kiss, lust-filled expression in her eyes, then winks at you and kisses your neck. She slides her tongue down your body, sucking on your nipples, then your belly button, and then finally makes her way between your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was something you thought you had felt, but with someone else's tongue down there... it was pure bliss. You begin to moan loudly, shamelessly as Sarah's tongue worked its way around your pussy. You are only vaguely aware of her hands as she caresses your legs, until suddenly you feel something plunge into your pussy. You moan louder as you feel the familiar pressure of the female orgasm building in your groin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck... oh god...\" you pant, the pleasure becoming overwhelming as you nearly stumble, knees buckling. Sarah's head appears next to yours, and she pulls you into a deep kiss, while her hands continue to massage your nethers. You continue to moan until the pressure releases. You feel the waves of pleasure emanating from your crotch, pulsing through your entire body as your tongue darts around inside Sarah's mouth. You reach your own hands down to her nethers, and begin to return the favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moans as you stroke her pussy, mimicking the motions you had done on yourself less than an hour ago. Your soapy breasts rub against hers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" she moans as you feel a stickyness on your hands. Panting, she stands upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you're pretty good with your hands.\" she says after catching her breath. \"I wasn't expecting that to be that <i>fun</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave the shower, clean and fulfilled in more than one way. Sarah begins to head over to her room. You then think - she could go and repossess your body, after which the two of you would go to the mall as planned. Or, while she's in such a good mood, you could <i>ask</i> her to transform and play around some more.</span></div></div>",

After starting to reach for some clothing, she pauses, pulls back, and then grins widely. Her face suddenly scrunches up in concentration, and a mist coalesces around her form, blocking her from view momentarily. After the mist dissipates, Sarah is wearing a white low-cut top and blue mini-skirt combo, with no underwear from what you can tell. Shaking your head at this, you start to consider what to wear yourself, and pause in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Hey Sarah, what kind of clothes would you suggest for the mall, since I don't really know what would look good on me?\" you ask, slightly embarrassed to be needing some help with such a simple thing. Looking up, you see a impish grin spread across her face, before pausing, and turning into a full blown mischievous smirk, gleaming eyes settling in after her thoughts finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well <i>Sarah</i>, since you asked me for help, I think it would be best to broaden your horizons as much as possible, especially to help acclimatize you to your new body,\" Sarah states, all the while rapidly moving through her closet, pulling out some clothes, and shoving others back in at different locations. A few long minutes later, with you starting to feel slightly awkward standing in the middle of the room naked, Sarah finishes gathering clothes, and after inspecting them, you wonder what is going through her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Laid out before you are two sets of clothing, one, something similar to what Sarah is wearing now, just in different colors (black top, white mini-skirt), or an unbelievably short black dress, the hemline barely covering anything its supposed to from what you can tell. Looking up at Sarah, who has moved back across the room, and is staring at you expectantly, you merely raise an eyebrow, before inquiring about her choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Uh, Sarah, you do know that while you'll be me, I'll be you, walking around with all this on display if i wear either set of clothing, right?\" you ask, wondering if this had slipped her mind in the process of what you hope is a prank on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0A look of shock crosses her face, and causes you to chuckle, as that answers the question of what was going on with her plan there. Taking that as a hint, you head towards the dressers, and look to find undergarments, since Sarah forgot to grab them. After obtaining some, and putting them on, you head back to the bed, dress promptly, and turn around to find Sarah looking quite embarrassed, but also slightly flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"You Ok Sarah, and ready to go yet?\" you ask, concern in your voice snapping her out of her momentary daze. Looking up, she blatantly checks you out, then thinks back over what you said.<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Yeah, sorry, wasn't ready for the sudden libido increase that ambushed me while watching you dress. Also, thanks for reminding me that it's my body, and reputation that your going to impact. That said, were still going to go have some fun now!\" Sarah responds, getting herself under control, or as much as she can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0After Sarah finishes sinking back in and possessing your old body, you both head towards 'your' car. A few minutes of driving and you both arrive at the mall. Wondering what you guys should do first, you pose the query towards Sarah, who stares off into the distance, with a hint of drool starting to form at the corner of her mouth. Snapping in front of her face seems to get her back, and she sheepishly wipes away the small drool, and focuses back on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Well, we can do some spells, check out places to experiment with this glyphs I found in the book, or we could go do some shopping for you. I kinda don't mind doing either one, since the first lets us do our first goal, but the second would be an experience for us both,\" Sarah states while looking around the mall again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"How would clothes shopping be an experience for both of us?\" you ask, slightly confused since you are sure she bought most of the clothes in her closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Oh, that's simple Sarah, I've never had the experience of viewing a 'fashon show' from the male perspective, and you've never given one from the female perspective,\" Sarah responds in a low, chuckling tone, eyes gleaming with unheard of mischief. </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

[Just think Mistress, you can tease and enjoy the frustration you cause 'him' while getting to try something new] Lilith comments suddenly, surprising Jack enough that he jumps in place and nearly falls over, only catching himself at the last moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0'Lilith, next time make sure you don't startle me so bad please. Also, any reason you've been silent as of late?' Jack asks, trying to calm down his rapidly beating heart, as Lilith's sudden talking had startled him more than he thought could possibly happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Sorry Mistress, I'll try to be a bit more careful, though it is hard to not startle you, or anyone else, if a voice randomly starts talking in ones head. Regardless, I've been silent so far because I'm curious about what Sarah has planned, as well as your responses. To borrow from modern day examples, you both are like a t.v. show, and I'm curious to see where the show leads. Don't worry, I'll become more active if you two start to get boring.] Lilith responds, ending her mental communication by somehow tweaking Jack's nipples lightly, sending a jolt of pleasure through his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Shuddering from the sudden wash of pleasure, and also slightly from the implied warning about either of the two humans becoming 'boring', Jack refocuses on his surroundings, and sees 'Jack' staring at him with slight bewilderment adorning 'his' face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Sorry, Lilith had decided to say something, and then explained something when I inquired further. Though I think I should warn you, she says she'll start to become active if we get 'too boring'. In any case, Let's try the shopping bit, as I'm feeling it will be an interesting experience like you said.\"Jack explains, standing up fully from his slightly crouched landing from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Receiving a look of comprehension and understanding, 'Jack' simply nods, then moves closer and puts 'his' arm around Jack's waist. Shocked by this sudden action, Jack is too stunned by it to react, and is gently guided/dragged by 'Jack' towards a boutique on the second floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0By the time Jack's shock wears off, he notices that he's not where he zoned out, and also notices that Sarah is not next to him currently. Confused, Jack looks around, trying to see if he can find her, when an attendant walks over towards Jack. Seeing this, Jack momentarily panics, thinking that he's about to be asked to leave for some reason, before recalling that he's currently 'Sarah', so an attendant wouldn't be likely to ask him to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Hello miss, your boyfriend said that when you snapped out of your daze, you should head back to the changing room, as he has already picked out a few things you mentioned you wanted to try on. Have a wonderful day!\" the attendant said after reaching Jack, and on close inspection, Jack sees a slight glaze covering the attendant's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Ahh, seems she's already learned how to use minor compulsion spells to her advantage. She's definitely crafty, if she also figured out how to leave a delayed command to activate under such circumstances. I have to say Jack, your crush has become more impressive than I previously thought.] Lilith speaks up, giving Jack the knowledge of why the attendant seemed different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Getting the hint of what Sarah wanted, Jack made his way over to the changing area, occasionally pausing to admire some of the clothes on display, but deciding that he could come back and grab them if he really wanted to try them. A few minutes of mini-browsing and walking towards his destination, Jack finally arrives, and sees the area completely devoid of people, but notices a pile of clothes in a chair at the back of the changing area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Moving over to inspect the pile, and wondering where Sarah was, Jack is hit by a sudden wave of Lust, igniting his arousal and bringing it to a low simmer. Shivering from the sudden warmth that suffuses his body, and noticing that the effect feels different from whenever Lilith had caused it, Jack tries to pinpoint where it came from. Moments of visually searching show that the curtain to the last changing booth is closed, but the other four are open, showing no occupants or clothing within. Taking this as further proof of where Sarah is, as well as guessing that she's getting impatient with Jack's pace, he speeds up his gait, finally reaching the end of the changing area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Standing before the clothing, and inspecting it without trying to talk to Sarah, Jack feels a thrill flow through him, as some of the outfits are very daring, if not outright titillating in teasing potential. Rubbing his thighs together to provide some relief to his now very hot pussy, Jack decides to look towards where he assumes Sarah is hiding, as she had yet to make her appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Moving the few steps over to the curtain, Jack grabs the far end and pulls it towards its opposite, and gazes inside, seeing a grinning Sarah, who is simply sitting on the bench in the booth, the Book sitting flat on her lap. Curious as to what she is currently looking at, Jack attempts to read it upside down, but notices that whenever he thinks he has a word, or even a letter within his grasp, it seems to morph into a new shape. Giving up on trying to figure out what she's up to, Jack simply steps back, and moves over to the pile of clothing again, inspecting them more closely, and deciding on what to try first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Pulling out a combo of a Lace Cutout Teddy with Daisy Duke short shorts, Jack turns around and is about to head into one of the other dressing stalls, when Sarah speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No need for you to move over there, I have it set up that no one will come into the store while were here, so the whole changing area is ours until we leave 'Sarah'.\" 'Jack' says, grin forming on 'his' face as he sees a flush form on Jack's face and neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Deciding to at least keep in character, since Sarah seems to be insisting on it, Jack decides to poke a hole in her logic. \"While we may have the area to ourselves, it won't do for your 'male experience' to get a free show every time I change, so either I use one of those rooms, or you exit that room, and be surprised by what I come out in, 'Jack'.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0A slight frown forms on Sarah's face, before quickly being replaced by a mischievous grin. Seeing this, Jack wonders if he's about to be the recipient of another unwanted spell, before Sarah simply closes the Book, and places it on the bench beside her. Standing up, Sarah exits the room, and walks over to stand before Jack. \"Your right, but in this case, I notice that I forgot to get you some underwear, so while you get to changing, I'll rectify my oversight. Be back in a minute.\" Sarah says after leaning in close to Jack's ear, the warm breath tickling Jack's ear and neck sending shivers of arousal down Jack's spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Putting action to her word, Sarah promptly walks away, and in Jack's opinion, seems to be 'strutting', which to Jack looks weird. 'Do I ever do that? If so, I really need help!' Jack thinks, and expects a response from Lilith, but only silence answers his mental opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Shaking his head, Jack grabs the rest of the clothes on the chair in his other hand, and puts them in the booth that Sarah had just vacated. Closing the curtain to keep with the act, Jack quickly strips down to his bra and panties, and then starts to put on the new clothes he wished to try. A few minutes of fumbling and adjusting the clothing, and one near painful pinch that would have hurt if he hadn't caught the issue early, and Jack was fully clothed in his new outfit. Looking into the mirror to see the changes, Jack admires the way the top shows off his cleavage, and how the shorts let his legs be shown off dramatically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Deciding that Sarah should be back by now, Jack opens the curtain, and is surprised by 'Jack' sitting in the now moved chair, directly across from the booth Jack was in, sans pants. Seeing the clothing Jack was wearing, Sarah grins happily, and openly ogles Jack, motioning with 'his' hands to move around and pirouette. Going along with the act, Jack does as Sarah gestures, and walks back and forth in front of her, and then spins slowly in place, hearing a gasp and groan while his back is turned to Sarah. Upon completing the rotation, Jack is surprised to see a large tent forming in Sarah's boxers, though after a moment of staring dumbly, realizes that he shouldn't be surprised, as that would be a normal reaction to a sexily dressed woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Fuck, that looks awesome on you 'Sarah', I cant wait to see the other outfits on you, as well as some of the newer clothes I found for you to try.\" 'Jack' says, not even seeming embarrassed by the tent 'he' was currently showing. Stopping in 'his' ogling, 'Jack' picks up an unnoticed bag next to 'him' and hands it to Jack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Not even bothering to inspect the contents, Jack quickly retreats to inside the booth, quickly drawing the curtain closed and sitting down on the bench heavily. Jack's mind was awash from the sudden rush of desire he felt staring at his old body's erection, as well as feeling extremely turned on by the blatant ogling Sarah had done. Shuddering as another wave of pleasure washed over his body, Jack starts to take off the clothing, stripping down to nothing, and standing before the mirror to inspect his new body once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Staring back was a very flushed Sarah, who seemed to be one step away from bursting if the rubbing of 'her' thighs, as well as the constant leaking from 'her' pussy was any indication. Shuddering again, and somehow almost cumming just from the sight before him, Jack throws and arm out to balance, extremely aroused by all the different stimuli.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Wondering if he should keep up the charade, or if Sarah would be willing to let him find release, Jack ...<br>\r\n </span></span></div></div>",

You can have fun depending on how far you push 'him', and you can even tease 'him' with certain clothing, especially as the clothing 'he' picked out was obvious something to 'his' liking.] Lilith speaks up, not startling Jack, but also sending a shiver down his spine as the suggestion seemed to mirror some hidden desire in him, as his already leaking pussy seemed to increase in its leaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shuddering at the thought, as another thrill races through him, Jack decides to follow Lilith's suggestion, as at this point, his current horny state and a whispering succubus in his ear seem to drive all caution out of his mind. Taking a breath to calm his excited nerves, and pick out a pair of clothing that just feels right for this plan, Jack slowly slips on the set of clothing, feeling extremely wanton and curious about how the results will be for this little stunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finishing the ensemble of clothing, Jack takes one last look in the mirror grinning at the pose he strikes that shows off his body while hinting at more underneath, shivers of anticipation at the next step coursing through Jack. One last breath, and Jack opens the curtain stall, and is not surprised to see an eagerly waiting Sarah, her boxers tented and seeming to strain to hold back the tool hidden inside. A shudder crosses Jack's body, before reasserting his will and moving along with his plan. Stepping out with hips swaying widely, Jack walks seductively up to Sarah, not even going through the previous actions that she had indicated she wanted done with the showing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Getting as close as he could without touching, Jack starts to to a teasingly erotic dance (and wonders how he could know how to do it, but pushes it aside), seeing results almost instantly as Sarah's grin at the outfit is slowly changed into a hungry look, almost looking like she'll begin to drool at the sight before her. Just as Sarah's hand start to reach out to touch Jack's currently gyrating and dancing body, his hand comes up quickly and slaps it away, earning a growl from Sarah in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Grinning and feeling thrilled at the current reactions to his teasing, Jack decides to start the next part, and slowly starts to undo the laces holding his top in place, holding it up with one hand after the last lace is loosened enough to fall apart, and earning another growl at the sudden denial of being able to see what lay beneath. Spinning in place, and letting go his hand holding up the top while his back was to Sarah, Jack completes the turn, and shows Sarah a lacy purple quarter-cup bra, pushing up his bust and helping show off his cleavage. Stepping back, Jack goes back to his teasing dance, occasionally moving his hands around and seeming to be about to loosen or remove another article of clothing. Finally deciding to move on, Jack undoes the final clip holding his micro-skirt in place, it falling to the ground after he pauses in movement, showing off a matching lacy purple panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking a moment to drink in the scene, Jack sees the bulge in Sarah's boxers, and wonders if it could possibly rip through the fabric, as the front seems stained from pre-cum leaking out and leaving little to the imagination at this point. Shaking his head, and deciding to finish the 'show', Jack starts up with his teasing dance routine again, earning another growl and smirking at the sound. A few minutes of teasing, and Jack finally moves his hands up and un-clips his bra, letting it fall to the floor without teasing Sarah any more on that front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The hungry gaze focused dead center on his chest, as well as the feel of the air on his swaying breasts as he continues to dance, sends pleasant jolts throughout Jack's body, almost causing him to abandon his ploy, and either return to the dressing room to pleasure himself, or see if Sarah had a 'suggestion'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moments go by, and Jack's arousal is slowly, yet steadily, rising, as well as the low growl that seems to be constantly emitting from Sarah, who looks to be less than a minute from launching herself and having her way with Jack. Internally gleeful at the response, Jack slips his thumbs into the waistband of his underwear, and slowly lowers them while swaying in place, slowing down enough to not trip while teasing Sarah one last bit. Clearing the point where letting go will allow gravity to do its job, Jack releases his hold on the underwear, and stands stark naked, slightly panting from both the excitement of the moment, as well as his previous efforts of teasing and dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Catching his breath, Jack merely waits until he sees he has Sarah's eye, then speaks up. \"So, now that you enjoyed such a show, I guess I should go try on another set of clothing, 'Jack'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A nearly feral growl escapes Sarah's lips before she turns away, breathing deeply and apparently fighting to control herself. Moments go by before Sarah turns to look back, and opens her mouth to say... \"<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

In the middle of picking out said objects, Jack freezes when he sees something that he just knows would be mind-breakingly arousing for both himself and Sarah, regardless of the situation.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It looks like a fishnet stockings dress except for on the sides, part of the breasts and the crotch area were thinly covered. Looking at the tag, it read :Vivace Seamless Crochet Mini dress - just staring at it Jack could feel his body start to heat up, and rubbed his thighs unconsciously.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>[You should get that and try it on Mistress - it would definitely push Sarah over the edge, and you'd also get to show off how sexy you currently are~]</b> <i>Lilith says to Jack, seeming to be imagining a few things if her perverse chuckles that Jack was hearing was any indicator.</i><br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nJack shakes his head, really tempted to add it to the few clothes he'd picked out so far, but also quite embarrassed at even thinking of wearing such a thing.<b> 'My life is truly strange - a few days ago i would never even contemplate wearing a dress just to rile up my own former body!'</b> Jack thought to himself, trying to ignore the giggle from Lilith at that thought.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<i>Sighing, he adds it to the two pairs of clothing he had decided to try on also - simple yet body-hugging sets of clothes, the dress having distracted Jack enough that any thought of finding more teasing/sexy wear just kind of disappeared.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<i>Walking back into the changing room area after thanking the attendant for briefly checking on them, Jack saunters past Sarah, who groans at the swaying hips on display, before the curtain closes. Quickly changing, and finding it a lot easier with each clothing change to ignore how odd and yet familiar the process was, Jack pulls the curtain open, getting a contemplative look from 'Jack'.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<i>After closing the curtain again after a quick comment from 'Jack', clothes change again, and the curtain opens, leading to another contemplative look and comment. Closing the curtain one last time, Jack ends up taking longer, not because the dress is difficult to put on, though it is not as simple as one would think either, but because his own nervousness and Lilith's constant egging on was distracting him.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<b>[Seriously, try it on, you've gotten this far already, and we both know it'll look completely ravishing!] </b><i>Jack sighs, before steeling his resolve and slipping the dress on, making sure it's in all the right places, shuddering at the cool air that washes over his skin from how the dress's design leaves so much area to be hit by the A/C breeze. Looking in the mirror Jack gasps, shocked...stunned, and instantly aroused at the sight of Sarah's body in that dress, even with the slightly nervous shifting minutely detracting from just how sensual and alluring she seemed to radiate!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>[You know that if that curtain opens, and she sees us like this, she'll likely take us here, consequences be damned?]</b><i> Lilith comments, amazed at just how well the dress hugged and accentuated her Mistress' body so well. Even the nervous movements were slightly helping, as the sway of breasts was hypnotic if one was suckered into it, let alone that looking anywhere on her currently was the same trap!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>'I know, but i don't know if i'm ready to have sex in public here....any way that we could avoid that if possible?'</b></i> <i>Jack asks, hearing 'Jack' quietly wonder what was taking so long.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<b>[Maybe, but is it so bad to do it in public? It's not like the rules apply to you two as much anymore - a little spell or two and people would even be willing to join you] </b><i>Lilith answers, knowing that there were a few spells to help her Mistress, but wanting to see how far they could push before Jack balked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</i></span></div></div>",

Then, you hear a sound coming from the kitchen. You walk down and see Sam, digging in the fridge. She's dressed in the unusual combination of grey yoga pants and a heavy black hoodie. Her dark blonde hair is tied up in a loose ponytail, kind of just hanging there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah nods, then closes her eyes.

Her leg disappears, making her look like she is attached to Sam. Sarah leans in on the right side, her upper body similarly fading into Sam. You notice that Sarah seems a bit shorter, too.

She seems to be really enjoying herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leads you to the couch, plops herself down, and motions for you to sit.

Next thing you know, you're in another room. Judging by the fact that there was a second Sarah sitting on the bed here, you guessed that you were in Sarah's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jack\" says the Sarah on the bed. \"Having fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A blast.\" you reply. As you do, the Sarah you teleported here with sits down into the other Sarah. Her eyes flutter a little bit, until she comes to again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that I'm ready, it's your turn.\" Sarah says. She gets up, and walks over to what you assume is her sister's room. \"Hey Jess, you busy? Want to go to the mall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn unfamiliar voice replies from the other side of the door. \"Sure. I'm bored, let's go. Just give me... ten minutes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah motions for you to go inside. \"Now's your chance!\" she whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step inside, through the door. While it was closed. That was cool, one of the perks of being a ghost, you figure. Standing in front of a small dresser mirror is a college girl who you only assume is Jess, Sarah's sister. Taller than Sarah by a couple of inches, with straight black hair, Jess is just as attractive as her younger sister. She\u2019s a bit slimmer \u2013 evidently not as sporty \u2013 but has similar facial features, and the same eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a step closer and admire your\u2026 uh how would you say it\u2026 target? up close. She\u2019s dressed in a sleeveless red and black striped dress that\u2019s tight through her torso but flares out past her hips, sheer black stockings and was in the process of putting on knee-high black leather boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn\u2026\u201d you think to yourself. \u201cShe\u2019s pretty hot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo how was this going to work? You\u2019d seen both Lilith and Sarah possess a couple of people before, and it didn\u2019t seem that hard. Just put yourself over someone else\u2026 and that was it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s get this over with, I guess\u2026\u201d you say to no one in particular. Jess doesn\u2019t seem to notice at all, despite you being at most ten feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approach hesitantly, not sure what to expect. Jess is still completely oblivious to your presence. By now you\u2019re only a foot away, and she\u2019s finished putting on her boots and is now looking in the mirror. Probably picking out details in her makeup, you figure. Anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere goes\u2026\u201d you say and take the final step, right onto where Jess is standing. You feel no resistance whatsoever, as if she wasn\u2019t even there. When you stand finally still, you feel a jarring snap. You shake your head slightly, trying to shake off the strange sensation\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mess of black hair hits you in the face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d you say, and lift a hand to your mouth in shock. Your voice is very different. As is the sensation from your face\u2026 A quick glance at the small mirror in front of you shows the shocked face of Jess looking back at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head. So does the reflection, and black hair goes everywhere again. You smile. The reflection does too. You stick out your tongue. The Jess in the small mirror sticks out hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026\u201d you whisper, taking in what just happened. You had possessed Jess. That meant\u2026 you were in the body of Jess, your crush\u2019s older sister. You were a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, your new hands immediately make their way to your chest. Sure enough, encased in the smooth fabric of the dress, are a pair of modest, perky boobs. You exhale, something between a sigh and a moan. A familiar voice quickly snaps you out of your trance, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you done yet?\u201d Sarah calls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! Coming\u2026\u201d you answer nervously, carefully making your way to the door. Not used to walking in your new body, you almost stumble over, but quickly catch yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you open the door, Sarah is positively beaming at you. \u201cSo? How\u2019d it go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 it\u2019s weird. I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026\u201d you stutter. Sarah grins at you, clearly getting some joy out of your awkwardness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, <i>Jess</i>\u201d she says. \u201cLet\u2019s go already!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah grabs your arm and pulls you to the door. On the way out, you stumble past a full-length mirror and get a glance at your reflection. You were pretty hot\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo uh\u2026 where are we going?\u201d you ask as Sarah drags you to her car. You get in as she answers.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then i get the crazy idea to target the spell between said demon, and the girl who I've been crushing on lately, not stopping to consider the ramifications of the results. To top it off, now that she's effective pissed off, I'm without Lilith's help, and I have no idea how to either make it up to Sarah, nor fix this situation until the time is up on the spell. God, could this get any worse or weirder?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As if the universe is answering his question, or the Book decided to answer it's Master's lamenting, the pages of the book begin turning without Jack's hands moving them, shifting to near the end of the book. Landing on a page labeled \"Summoning rituals: Things to call to and bind\", Jack is impressed by the art of the page, which demonstrates multiple creatures he recognizes from mythology. Reading the title, and surprised he can do so, since Lilith had mentioned that the book was split into sections for skill level, Jack decided to see if this page was even worth worrying about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reading the page, Jack contemplates about what he's read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0*Summoning a creature can be both easy, and dangerous, depending on the summoner's power level and experience. Some previous holders of this book have states that others have summoned things that they easily subdued and then either bound or contracted. Others, are listed for what they summoned, as well as how they met their ends, either by summoning something more powerful than them, or something that was able to either find a loophole, or trick them into their demise. A common mistake some warlocks have made is trying to summon a second succubus, to either fufill a fantasy (which is kind of idiotic, since one could simply ask the succubus for an alternative), or because they became greedy. Summoning a second succubus with the intent to bind or contract it, will in most cases(1) unbind the bound succubi, leaving you to either it's tender mercies, or its quick departure (2). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The summoner should know, before attempting this, that they can only bind something that either is weaker than them, or is in 'agreement' with whatever conditions are laid out by the summoner and summonee. Trying to bind a creature stronger than oneself usually results in death, reverse binding, or worse (3). Most common summons that people have called upon : Angel, Demon, Youkai, Spirit, Parallel Worldly Being (4), and in some cases, other humans. Summoner should also note that a Bound creature, depending on type and conditions, could permanently tie up one's energy reserves (5).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Curious if he could summon something from the book, and if so, maybe it could help him either with his current predicament, or just to get some more experience with this supernatural world, Jack considers preforming the ritual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><i><b>*1)Some cases have been shown where a mutual contract can be formed, but only two cases have ever been noted, and those were by Master level Warlocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*2)In some cases, depending on what had been summoned, the succubi decided to either torture or torment the summoner, but on a few occasions they decided it wasn't worth it, and just left - said summoners decided it was best not to question their fortunate turn of events at that time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*3)There are worse things than death, especially in the realms of magic, and with beings that live either longer than most, or have enough time to plot out how to make one wish they were able to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*4)With magic, just about anything has been proven to be possible, if sadly very costly - one can summon something from a parallel world, but be warned they might not be governed by the rules we are stuck with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*5)Some creatures are dependent on a sustained supply of energy, and if summoned and bound, will cause a permanently channel to be cut through ones reserves to make sure they have a steady supply of energy, unless circumstances prevent that - i.e. contracts or agreements met, precautionary bounded fields, etc.<br>\r\n</b></i><br>\r\n</font></span></span></div></div>",

As if she isn't herself anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... Sarah, are you ok?\" you ask, growing increasingly concerned. What exactly had you done?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looks down at herself, and begins running her hands across her body. As one of her hands caresses her breasts through her school top, the other reaches down into her skirt, and she lets out a soft moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh, I haven't been female in <i>even longer</i>\" she says with a distinct hunger in her voice. Her hands are still roaming around her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah... what's wrong?\" you ask again. Sarah notices you this time, and stops what she was doing. Then, she smiles, bites her lip, and slowly turns to face you head on, exaggerating the movement of her hips and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hello...\" she says in the same lusty tone as before and looks you up and down, \"I'm new around here, can you show this girl a <i>big, warm</i> welcome?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh.... \" you gulp. That escalated quickly... and you were still really worried about Sarah. \"Lilith, what happened to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of Lilith's name, Sarah stops again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. So you know Lilith. That does make things interesting...\" She says, the lust in her voice curbed slightly, but not completely gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what?\" You ask, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're pretty clueless for a warlock, aren't you, kid.\" Sarah says. \"Yet you did set me free...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... who are you exactly?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, don't you want your reward?\" The lust in Sarah's voice returns, and she takes another exaggerated step towards you and starts fingering the elastic on her skirt. \"I'm <i>so</i> grateful to you for freeing me, won't you let me show my appreciation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Sarah is nearly on top of you, and you're not quite sure what to do. Something is clearly wrong with her, and you really want to know what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh stop making the kid uncomfortable.\" Lilith says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there you go, ruining my fun <i>again</i>.\" Sarah responds, irritated. \"Why can't you let me <i>enjoy</i> myself for once?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow this is interesting, you think. The two know each other. Lilith appears in front of you and sees the confused look on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on, tell him who you are.\" She says to Sarah. Sarah gets noticeably uncomfortable, but nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Sarah...\" she pouts, putting her hand on your chest. \"And... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith sighs, and cuts her off. \"Fine, I'll tell him myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah pauses, then takes her hand off you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not Sarah right now, but I'm sure you already knew that. She's possessed by Samael, an incubus. Clearly, something with the spell went wrong, and you accidentally bound him in Sarah's body.\" Lilith began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... where did he come from?\" You ask. Sarah, or rather, Samael, remains silent, sad look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samael and I are mirrors of each other, and we both are bound to the book. I'm the female, who gets released when a male warlock performs the summoning, and he's the male counterpart for a female warlock. Our powers are pretty much the same, so our gender is purely symbolic. And there are generally more male warlocks than female, so Samael hasn't been free for much longer than I have.\" Lilith continued. You stare, intrigued by the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... \" you ask, but Lilith continues her story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must have somehow tricked the book into thinking it was being bound with a female, which is why Samael was freed. But, part of the soul spell did work, so he's stuck in Sarah for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happens to Sarah?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh she's fine, just possessed. She'll be right back to normal after Samael leaves, but he can't do that yet. He needs to build up his strength first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And let me guess... he does that by having sex and draining from someone else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft, no.\" Lilith snorts. \"He's just a sex demon who hasn't had a body in hundreds of years, so of course he just <i>really</i> wants sex. No, he can regain strength in two ways. The first is just over time, but that will probably take a couple of weeks. The other... well, you would have to give him some of your strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? I can do that?\" You ask, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. It would drain you, so you'd probably really want a nap afterwards... but yeah, you could give him a boost and he would be able to get out of Sarah within an hour or so.\" Lilith explained. \"It is entirely up to you, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if I give him some of my strength, he could leave Sarah, and she would be back to normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly, Master. Although looking at him now, I don't think he would mind being left in Sarah for a bit while you make up your mind. Her body is rather exquisite.\" Lilith noted. You look over at Sarah and see that she does indeed look like she is enjoying herself. Her hands have resumed their roaming, exploring every inch of Sarah's school uniform, all with a perverted smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like it's on you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Shaking your head, you turn to look at Lilith, who smirks at your apparent effort to ignore 'Sarah's' distracting, and enticing, actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well Master, the first step is to physically be touching your target, in this case Samael, and focusing on channeling your power into 'him',\" Lilith explains, while licking her lips at the show being put on by 'Sarah', who has finally stripped completely, and begun to grope 'her' breasts with one hand, and plunging two fingers of her other hand into 'her' apparently very wet pussy. Letting loose loud moans, while lewdly looking up at your face, 'Sarah' pauses in her actions, leers at you, then goes back to fingering herself and pinching her nipples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Shaking your head, you attempt to put the obviously overemphasized act out of your mind, and focus on what Lilith is telling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"How do I channel my power, we didn't exactly cover that yet, let alone where my 'power' is, \" you whisper, hoping that Samael didn't hear you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"True, but most of your lust magic, or magic in general, is based on projecting your will into a task or goal, and trying to enforce it on reality. An example would be wanting to fill a glass of water, in a room that has no visible source. Depending on the intentions, and imagination of the caster, there are multiple ways the magic could come about, especially depending on what school they channel from. \"Lilith explains queitly, getting a lustful look in her eyes as she turns back and watches more of 'Sarah's' actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Knowing it's a bad idea if you truly wish to get Sarah back, you fight the temptation to see what the incubus is doing, but curiosity and temptation win out. Slowly looking back towards 'Sarah', you see what appears to a small bed, that wasn't there before, with a writhing body on top. The only odd thing is the lack of sound, especially upon closer inspection (for authenticity of making sure its nothing wrong with my hearing, i swear! - you thought to yourself), you notice that 'Sarah's mouth is open and moving as if shouting something, and the bed seems to be moving slightly, but no sound appears to be heard. Drawing your attention away from the sight, you look towards Lilith, with raised eyebrow, who is smiling at the scene, and looking as if she wishes she could join in, but is holding herself back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Uh, Lilith, did you do something to silence Samael?\" you ask, all the while wondering how the hell a simple attempt to lend Samael energy could devolve into this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Yes Master, it sounded like you did not wish for him to know what we were talking about, and if I tried to talk to you mentally through our bond, he would be able to hear also, as he is linked to you, indirectly at this moment that is,\" Lilith responds, while swaying in place, rubbing her thighs together, but apparently putting in an effort not to touch herself either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Curiosity piqued, you query this. \"Not to poke or insult you Lilith, but normally I don't see you this restrained in indulging yourself, hell you usually try to tempt me whenever you get the chance it seems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Normally I would Master, but if I'm not careful around Samael, he could use magic to cause problems. Even in his weakened state, he can cause mischief even I do not wish to do at this point, not until you're either more trained, or you prove to be like other Masters, and get yourself killed through stupid choices.\" Lilith says, turning her eyes away from the show, and looking at you with something akin to worry on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Putting that worried look aside, and hoping that she's just being paranoid, you decide to focus inward, trying to find something akin to the energy you felt Lilith use earlier. Minutes that seem to stretch on forever later, you find the spark, and are slightly surprised, yet not, about its location - a spot above your pelvis. Shaking your head in a mixture of bafflement and amusement, you open your eyes, and see Lilith staring at you with some surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Well well Master, most are not that quick to locate their 'core' of power as quick as that. Especially after only hearing about it minutes beforehand,\" Lilith states, with a look of appraising covering her features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Well, now that i found my power, and in theory know how to channel it, anything else i need to know?\" you ask, hoping that there is nothing else that could complicate this day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Only that while channeling, you cannot lose <i><b>focus</b></i>, or Samael could take advantage of the 'link' that your effective establishing. While he's bound ot the book, what happened here has made it to where he's not bound to you, so he could technically attempt to harm, manipulate, or kill you. The only reason he hasnt tried so far is that upon your death, he would be sucked back into the book. \"Lilith lectures, stressing on the focus. Hoping that means she likes you being alive and relatively ok, instead of dead or worse, you thank Lilith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Ok, lets do this, but before i do, can you restrain 'him', that way he doesn't try anything?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Of course master,\" Lilith responds, before moving her hands in intricate patterns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chanting a few words, 'Sarah's' body seems to suddenly freeze, and is then woodenly positioned to lie flat with arms at 'her' sides. With some trepidition, you move forward, and hope this all ends well. Placing a hand on Sarah's naked body, you begin to channel energy, focusing on the form you wish it to take, and how much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Surprise nearly causes you to falter, as the spark you found earlier seems to have changed into a torrential river, only stopped by what appears to be a dam of sorts. Mentally trying to will a spigot into the dam wall, you try to turn it into a trickle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Sarah's eyes snap open, garnering your attention, and making you lose focus, leading to you accidentally flooding 'Sarah's' body with your power. <br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

'Fuck, I can't believe I lost focus....what will happen now?' Jack thought, worried at what might happen. As if his thoughts were the signal, the room seems to suddenly fill with a pressure of intense lust, and an unheard, but felt, shriek reverberates throughout the room. The last conscious thought Jack has before his vision fails him, and his sense of self, which slowly feels like its detaching, is a simple 'oh shit'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first thing that Jack notices, aside from the fact that he apparently had been unconscious, was that something felt distinctly wrong, and also the feeling of being...heavy. Trying to move to a sitting position, without opening his eyes, Jack notices that he also felt somewhat lighter, but that feeling of heavy didn't apply to normal motions, as sitting up wasn't much of a struggle. Deciding to 'bite the bullet' and see the damage of his spell's results, Jack opened his eyes, and saw a room that looked like a tornado had blown through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The freestanding shelves that had semi-blocked the area that Lilith and he had been using for the spells had been knocked over, spilling their contents out over the floor, the boxes of ornaments and trinkets strewn about, some seeming slightly damaged. A clothes rack that had been against the wall holding various clothing had fallen over, and no where that Jack could see, were Lilith or 'Sarah'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Trying to stand, and regain his bearings, Jack places a hand against the floor, and puts weight on it to lever himself up, but pauses, as he his hand feels different. Looking down, Jack sees a smaller, daintier hand. Confused, Jack's gaze travels from the hand, up the slim, yet well toned arm, and towards the shoulders. Seeing not his shirt, but a naked shoulder, Jack looks down, and sees he has breasts, as well as being naked 'and hot!'. Flushing at the random thought, Jack fights down the sudden panic that strikes him, as he realizes that he must now be in Sarah's body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking a deep breath, and noticing the effect it had on his breasts, that feel extra sensitive for some reason, Jack slowly regains control over himself. Looking around again, Jack notices that while the room is a disaster, nothing looks truly broken, but he still doesn't see his body, nor Lilith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As if his thoughts on her summoned her, Lilith walks through the doorway that leads out of the basement, looking pleased that Jack is conscious. Looking around, Lilith sees the mess, and simply waves her hand over the area, while muttering a few words that sound odd, and definitely not English. As she finishes speaking the words, the room bursts into motion, the shelves righting themselves, the contents going back onto them in a neat order, the other things all going back to how they were before the spell went off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, at least your awake now Mistress, though I have no idea of the results of your spell so far, until i check, other than that you are now in Sarah's body currently, and that Samael is in yours, currently unconscious via a spell. Also, for some reason, whatever power he was able to regain was gone, as well as it seeming that he cannot regain any power through waiting or feeding, as if his reserves are either frozen or burned.\" Lilith says, walking over towards Jack, and offering a hand to help him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking the hand, and feeling a shiver of pleasure flow through his body on contact, Jack lets Lilith help him up, and takes a moment to think over what she had said. 'Ok, so I'm in Sarah, Samael is in me, and apparently extremely weakened, and my spell's backlash nearly destroyed the room....why do i still feel heavy though?'. Deciding to ask Lilith, as she might have some insight, Jack mentions the feeling, causing Lilith to start moving her hand over Jack's chest, her hand glowing a light green the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Long minutes of silence pass, the only sound that of the two breathing occupants of the room, finally breaking the moment Lilith apparently finishes her inspection, as well as her cursing loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"That fucking asshole, he just had to fuck everyone over if he wasn't going to get his way!\" Lilith says angrily, pausing and regaining control, before continuing. \"Well as the phrasing goes Mistress, there is good news, and bad news in the case of your spell, and the results of Samael tampering with it. On the good side, your soul, nor your original body were damaged or altered by Samael's actions, though i think before we start you on anything truly special, we work on your focusing, and how to avoid losing it. The bad news, is that Samael wanted to cause chaos, as he knew that I would push to have him returned to the Book immediately after he was freed, as only one of us is supposed to be active at one time. The result is that he forcefully drew your soul from your body, placed it in Sarah's, locked her soul down inside it aswell, and then bound you to that body in ethereal chains. He also apparently added a few changes to Sarah's body, in that it will be more sensitive towards pleasure, with an increased libido.\" Lilith finishes, looking slightly annoyed, but also curious about some of the changes she mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"So, I'm stuck in Sarah, she's locked away under my soul, and now I'm more prone towards being aroused is what your saying.....is there any way to fix this? I don't exactly think people will ignore the fact that 'Sarah' starts acting differently, nor that Jack starts to as well.\" Jack states, somewhat calmly, hoping that Lilith can help fix this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

Stopping in her movements, Lilith turns, and looks back at Jack, before finally speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There are some things we can do to 'fix' this situation, but they will mostly rely on your choices, as well as how you wish to go about it. To start, we need to keep Samael either under a spell, or find some way to return him to the book, as the longer he's out of the book, the less power I'll be able to draw on, as their is no one inside to help 'draw in' the excess that is in the ambient air. The moving him to the book can be done easily, but that is up to you, as he can also be spelled into acting as 'Jack' to keep up the charade that everything is ok and normal. We could use a spell to make everyone ignore your bodies absence, or I could possess it to stall the dwindling effect on my energy, but for the latter, we would again have to move Samael. That's just the first thing to tackle, as beyond that, will be a bit more challenging, especially with your new...distractions.\" Lilith responds, looking inquisitively at the end of her sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A surge of arousal surges through Jack, causing him to nearly fall over, shocked by the random feeling, but also upset when it fades. Looking up, Jack sees Lilith's inquisitve look morph into a smirk, and then a full blown smile, as if she had figured out something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Ohh, he really wanted to make this difficult for you Mistress, not only are you more sensitive to physical stimuli, apparently aura intent is affecting you as well, since i had a momentary thought of sex, and you were apparently affected.\" Lilith opines, seeming amused about Jack's newest problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Fuck....no, that't not an order or an invitation Lilith, \"Jack says, quickly adding in the last bit as Lilith seemed eager to indulge in this new form of teasing she had found. Shuddering at the random bouts of minor arousal that kept circulating through his body, Jack focuses back on what Lilith had said before this newest discovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"After Samael's situation is decided on, what is the next part, as I don't like the idea of Sarah locked under my soul, especially as she's innocent in all of this. Also, is there any way you could fix some of the 'additions' to her body, without using up your energy too quickly?\"Jack finally says, after pondering what the best course could currently be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Looking at Jack's body yet again in thought, Lilith takes a moment before answering.\"Well, currently she's not aware nor suffering while locked under your soul, but i could somewhat tamper with that, and let her ride around conscious as a passenger in her own body, with you in control, but I don't know if that's a good idea. As to fixing the alterations done to 'Sarah'.....not currently, unless you wish for me to return to the book for a few days. I have enough energy to do some minor things, or maybe one or two major acts, but after that, I'll be forcibly returned, and I don't know if I'll be able to come back out, since the incubus is currently out as well.\"Lilith answers, looking pensive as to the outcome of such a situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hearing her response, Jack decides that he should probably deal with Samael first, before going any farther, as it sounds like he'll be the first biggest roadblock to fixing the situation. Pausing in thought, the words from earlier come back to Jack, and he asks, as he realizes he should have before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Wait, you mentioned earlier that I was bound to Sarah's body, what exactly does that mean, as it sounds like I'm permanently stuck here?\" Jack asks, a flood of panic washing away the arousal that had been circulating his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah, I was hoping you would forget that part until later Mistress, as it's something we cannot fix currently. In simple terms, you are stuck as Sarah, and in time, will even start to feel 'comfortable' as her, slowly gaining memories and mannerisms until you effective replace her, though in this case you wont, but she will merely be suppressed under your soul. Normally, I could yank your soul out, and put you either elsewhere, or back in your body, but those chains binding you stop this. Currently, you would need Samael, the binder, to break them, or you obtain enough power and skill to weaken them enough to either break them yourself, or have me help with it. Sadly, those bindings are also limiting your reserves that your soul has, and Sarah, while attractive, had minimal physical reserves to draw on for casting, so you currently are weaker than before.\" Lilith explains, sounding contrite and somewhat apprehensive at having to answer something she had been avoiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hearing this, Jack wonders if anything else could go wrong for him currently, when another spike of Lust washes over him, jarring his thoughts and making him feel extremely hot. Gasping, and placing a hand against the nearby wall to keep his balance, Jack fights to keep his balance, while also trying to keep his Lust in check, as images of straddling Lilith and sucking on her boobs, as a demonic phallus plunging into his depths fills his mind. Shuddering at the vivid image, as well as the sudden dampness in his pussy, Jack looks up, to see Lilith rubbing her own pussy, biting her lip while staring intently at Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Co-could you s-st-stop it Lilith, pl-please!\" Jack whimpers, barely getting his words out as his knees finally buckle and he collapses to the floor. Arousal almost clouding his mind, as he feels his hands slowly start to move towards his nethers, Jack bites his lip, and digs his fingers into his hands, finally getting a spark of control after the sudden sharp pain that flared briefly through his mind. Grasping that spark of control, Jack finally wins, and overpowers his lust, but also feels slightly weakened in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, that was a good example of instinctive magic Mistress, though you did use up some of your limited reserves in doing so,\" Lilith mentions quietly, capturing Jacks attention, who upon looking up, sees her seeming somewhat subdued and pained, similar to what he was feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Are you alright Lilith?\" Jack asks, concern filling his voice, as he forgets about his momentary troubles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I'll be fine, but you were only partially right about your bout of random horniness being my fault. Samael's alterations are similar to a succubi/incubi's nature, in that you will be constantly horny, and draw/drawn to sate that feeling. Using your energy and intent, you were able to suppress it for now, but that also has made your goals slightly more difficult to complete at this moment. As you did not wish for me to indulge in sex with you, I needed to use a similar amount of energy to stop myself as well. Though this does bring up the last bit of information I should inform you on, as your many tasks will become more difficult the lower your energy reserves go. The quickest and easiest way for you to refill, and also expand them, is to have sex, or incite lust in others, and passively absorb their sexual energy. Not only that, Sex with me will help expand your reserves, but will not refill them, nor will mine be refilled, as it would be the equivalent of two succubi trying to feed on one another, simply trading energy back and forth.\" Lilith answers, sounding slightly strained, but better than her previous utterance of his actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thinking on this new info, Jack realizes that his mess is more than one problem, as none of this could be fixed quickly at the current time, and would take a great deal of effort and time to even fix some of the current damage. Sighing, Jack decides to see if he needs to know anything else, before tackling the problematic issue of Samael's fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm sorry about that Lilith, and I'll try to make it up to you later, but is there anything else you avoided mentioning, in hopes of not having to think about it until it could be approached? While admirable, one could entirely forget about a problem if other issues come up, and distract from it for too long.\" Jack queries, hoping that its nothing too bad, as a flash of guilt crosses Lilith's face before being replaced by a nonplussed look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"If you must know Mistress, we are on a bit of a deadline. If you recall, this whole mess came about by using the soul-swap spell from the book, and it technically succeeded, as a soul was swapped into another place, and the only odd bit being Sarah not trapped in the book (thankfully, Lilith mutters quietly). The issue here is that with so many other spells layered on top of the original, the spell has mutated, and some things are now on a course to become unchangeable. In this case, we have 30 days to get you out of Sarah, before that bit becomes permanent, as to the rest, the details are easy enough to either mitigate or fix, though those are on a somewhat shorter deadline. The minor alterations will become permanent in 15 days, but if tampered with without enough power to remove, a lot sooner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hearing this floods Jack with conflicting emotions, in this case, extreme arousal, and stark terror. Aroused at being stuck in a perpetually horny body, and terror at such, as well as accidentally stealing Sarah's life, and losing his previous one. Shuddering, though not sure if its one of the two conflicting emotions, Jack stands up suddenly, ready to tackle the simple and most available problem, Samael!<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

The process will be simple in that we simply siphon his soul into the book at an even rate. This would normally be a struggle, but he's currently very weak, and also magically sleeping, so that should be a quick task.\" Lilith answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why didn't we put him to sleep while he was in Sarah when trying to extract him out of her?\" Jack asks, curious as to if it was missed in thought, or something he was unaware of influencing such a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, sadly, when he was shoved into Sarah, he came out with the full reserves of his own, plus a partial increase from the book. The only reason he didn't act more hostile and violent, was the fact that a good portion of said energy was locked behind Sarah's 'soul shell', since he was ensconced in it to force control over her, and so had to funnel his energy through her body, instead of though his own soul. Trying to put him to sleep, then supply energy enough to dislodge him, would possibly end with the same result, as the lent energy would spark him awake in the process.\" Lilith responds, sighing and seeming slightly exhausted, but maintaining a strong standing position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Seeing this, Jack decides to forgo any more questions, to help take off the pressure from Lilith. Beckoning her to lead, Jack follows after Lilith starts to walk towards where she has placed Samael and the book, which apparently was in Jack's room. After arriving in the room, and being slightly bewildered by the utter silence filling the house, Jack see's his sleeping body on the bed, the Book placed on his desk nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Lilith moves over to the Book, opening it and rapidly turning the pages until finding one with no words, but a intricate symbol filling the page. Waving Jack to move closer, Jack stumbles but catches himself, as a sudden bout of arousal floods his body before dulling. 'Guess my energy is waning in its fight to keep me in check, we need to hurry this up if possible,' Jack mentally says, trying to stay calm and not show any fear at the prospects of losing control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"This part will be easier Mistress, as instead of trying to channel power into Samael, you'll be doing the opposite, but you must focus on the fact that after you extract him, you need to push him into this page. If he spends to long within your current body with you, he could try to wrest control away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Hearing this causes Jack to tremble at the thought of being held at the whims of a demon that seemed determined to cause trouble. 'Only met him for less than ten minutes and he seemed more troublesome than Lilith has acted in the whole time I've been around her!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Seeing her Mistress' reaction to her words, Lilith puts the Book down on the desk, then rests her hands on Jack's shoulders, drawing his attention to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"While it is a frightening prospect Mistress, I believe you can succeed in this, especially as you have all the incentive to not fail.\"Lilith says, filling Jack with a form of confidence that he desperately needed. Nodding to one another, Lilith picks up the Book again, and moves to stand next to Samael's unconscious form. Taking his cue, Jack moves to stand between the two demons, and mentally prepare himself for this attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Long minutes of deep breathing to center himself, Jack finds his energy source, and is aghast at its diminished size. Before, when he had been in his body, it had looked like a giant lake filled to the brim. Currently, in Jack's mental landscape, was a lake about one quart of the previous size, but also only about 1/8 filled currently, and slowly dropping down as the minutes go by. Shaking his mental head at the sight, and refocusing on the task at hand, Jack comes back to the mental world, and places his hands on both the page of the Book, as well as the unconscious incubus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Beginning to 'suck' in energy from his former body, Jack feels nothing at first except minor moments of some abstract sensation, until finally he feels a small surge of energy that refreshes him dramatically. Keeping his focus this time, especially with the reminder of what happened the last time he lost it, Jack keeps drawing until he cannot feel any more energy being pulled out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0First step done, Jack turns his attention to the book, and pushes his Will to push Samael into the Book. Jack starts to feel slightly tired nearly moments after starting this process, and realizes that the rush of energy masked the encroaching feeling of 'taint' that had flooded his body after absorbing Samael's souls. Nearly panicking, but keeping his focus, Jack shifts his attention to fully expelling Samael into the book with an extra edge of eagerness helping to increase the speed of his work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0What feels like an hour, but is really only a couple of minutes of channeling, and Jack feels the last edges of 'taint' leave his body. Feeling done, Jack collapses to the floor in exhaustion, and upon fully landing on it, is flooded with pent up arousal, causing him to writhe and twitch on the floor in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0'Fuck, must've ran out of energy myself doing that last bit,' Is the last coherent thought Jack has, before his body's instincts take over, and his hand start to move on their own, fondling and massaging various pleasure points, eliciting loud moans from Jack. Long moments of his body working on autopilot lead to Jack feeling a sudden invasion in his pussy, as well as shuddering as an orgasm washes over him, the fingers of one hand plunging greedily inside to massage and scrape the inner walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Feeling the rapid build up of another orgasm fast approaching, Jack is locked in as a passenger, unable to even focus his will on anything but enjoying the sensations, when it slowly starts to die down. Long minutes of his body's frantic actions to achieve another orgasm slowing, Jack finally becomes cognizant enough to notice that he can control his limbs again, though he still feels as if he might soon overheat from the unbridled lust circulating throughout his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Sorry Mistress, but I could only blunt the effects at this moment, and not fully block them, as any further would cause me to possibly fade back into the Book to 'recharge'. The good news is that I can already feel my energy refilling at a decent rate, so I should be refreshed within a few hours, though full strength will take a full day at this point.\" Lilith says, drawing Jack's attention to her, and he notices that she looks alot more composed than before shoving Samael back into the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Slowly regaining his feet, Jack stands, though places a hand on the bed post closest to him to help support his standing. \"It's not your fault Lilith, and I'm grateful for the reprieve you've given me, so don't apologize to me on this please. I'm glad that that at least went off without a hitch. The only thing I have to ask now is what's the next step?\"Jack says, starting off shakily, but slowly regaining composure as he adjusts to the new constant pulse of arousal that nags for his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Nodding in response, Lilith moves towards the desk, placing the book to one side, while sitting down next to it on top of the desk as well. Taking a moment to settle herself, Lilith pauses in thought, before speaking. \"The next step would be to obtain some energy for you, as the blunting effect I've applied will wear out very soon. In light of that, I can go out and rapidly gather some energy without drawing too much attention to us, and return to distribute it, but pretty soon you'll have to start doing that on your own, as your new libido will adapt to our stop gap measures, and increase the cost of us trying to abate or dull the issue. While Samael may be a complete asshole, I will admit he is ingenious in finding ways to annoy others even after being subdued.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Hearing this, Jack decides that he'll send Lilith out as she suggested to gather energy, while he looked to see if he at least unlocked any new spells, and if not, try to figure out how to keep up a charade that didn't cause them to lose any more of their limited time. Plan decided, Jack relays his thoughts vocally, and receives a nod in return, before Lilith slowly fades from view, off to hunt energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In turn, Jack picked up the book, and...<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You frown as you feel a wave of energy rushing through your new body. Your first thought was that you had to do what your master told you so you instinctually used the power you felt in your body to transform yourself into your old body, right down to the clothes that you were wearing before you found yourself inside of Lilith's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that all about?\" You ask, noting that you now had your old voice again. However, even though you were back in your original human form, you could still feel all of Lilith's power at your disposal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Jack' laughed and clapped his hands. \"Well done, <i>Lilith</i>\" he said, grinning rather evilly at you. \"I suspected that this would be the case, but I wasn't positive until now\" he said, closing the book and placing it on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That what would be the case, master?\" You said and then quickly brought your hand to your mouth. You had meant to call him Lilith, but instead of saying that, you had naturally called him your master. First you transferred when asked, now this... you had a bad feeling that you walked right into a trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so you're finally getting it...\" the new Jack said, sitting down on the bed and placing his hand on the book. He crossed his legs and grinned before explaining more. \"As I'm sure you've gathered, the spell that I set up swapped out bodies. You are now in my former body, and I am now you. In other words, you are now the succubus called Lilith and I am now Jack the Warlock. All of the rules of the book still apply, which means that I am your master and you need to do everything that I command.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ball your hand into a fist and hold it tightly. Everything that he said rang true. You felt your power, but knew that you couldn't use any of it on him without his permission. Not only that, but yo felt a burning desire to want to do everything that he told you, no matter what it was. Was this what Lilith always experienced? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith continued, \"You can feel it, can't you? that internal drive to do as you're told. Even when you know that you don't want to deep down. I had to deal with that for centuries and I was sick of it. I wanted freedom to do as I pleased. And I wanted my own succubus to help me do that. I wasn't positive that the role reversal would work so perfectly, but I knew that it was worth a try. and now here we are. Are you ready to be my succubus, Lilith?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, master\" you say against your will. Deep down, you wanted to scream and curse and use your magic on the cocky looking asshole in front of you. But anything you wanted to do was overpowered by your desire to do as your master commanded and to have fun with your powers. You wanted to give in and let that part of you take over, knowing it would make things easier to cope with, but you also didn't want to give up your own will and identity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. By the way, I can see that internal struggle you're facing. The human element within you wasn't removed so you're still weak and emotional on the inside. Since I've always been a succubus, my only battle was wanting to use my powers for myself rather than for my master. And not even those thoughts came to my head until I had the opportunity to do something about it. But you want to use your powers for fun, AND you want to get revenge on me. I can only imagine how hard it is for you to struggle like that. But don't worry. I'll make it all better,\" 'Jack said with a grin as he looked right at you and said...</span></div></div>",

I know how it feels...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at your new master... your former body. No matter how hard you try, you can't bring yourself to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does this sound?\" He continues. \"Let's both have some fun. You know your... well, <i>my</i>... life pretty well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why not stay a part of it, on the side? I'll live the good, normal life you had, and you'll be free to play around as you please\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sounded much better to you. It still sucked that you had been tricked out of your body and life - and freedom, but this was a good compromise. As your master finished talking, you felt a weight lift off your shoulders. The need to obey was... still there, but deep down. You had some freedom now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't use this freedom to harm me in any way...\" 'Jack' said. It wasn't phrased as a threat, but it had grave implications nonetheless. \"Anyway... I'm gonna go hang out with Alex. You can... uhh, familiarize yourself with your new situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you watch as your former body walks out the door. A minute later you hear a familiar car start, then drive off. You were alone, in a very foreign body, with an almost overwhelming force cooped up inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... \" you say out loud in your sexy voice. \"At least I'm fuckin' hot now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands move almost unbidden, caressing the luscious curves you now possess. Wait a minute... where did all this lust come from? No matter. Then, a very enticing thought struck you. You were powerful, sexy, and you would feel no consequences whatsoever. Your still-male mind boggled at the possibilities. You could even include your new master in your fun...</span></div></div>",

Then you feel your panties disappear see your jeans and top merge together and form a tight leather one piece. Finally you feel arm length leather gloves appear and your feet rise as slight heel form. \u201cWow, how did that happen?\u201d you say shocked at the change. \u201cI guess changing comes instinctively for this body, I should learn what else I can do but I still feel something is missing.\u201d and with that you feel a succubus tail with a heart shape tip pop out. \u201cThere we go.\u201d you say as you wiggle it getting used to controlling it. As you move around in the tight leather you feel massive waves of pleasure run down your spine. \u201cOhhh!...\u201d you moan in pleasure. \u201cThis body feels like one whole erogenous zone, I guess I should get used to it after all I\u2019m stuck in the body of succubus forever. Hmm, Master should be hang out with Alex right about now I think I\u2019ll go mess with them and I think I know just how to do it.\u201d You say as you snap your fingers teleporting you into Kelly\u2019s room. You catch Kelly in her room getting ready to go somewhere. She was wearing a black t-shirt with a picture of the STAR WARS logo on it, a grey hoodie a little too big for her so you figure it was Alex\u2019s, a white frilly skirt and nylon tights, and finally black knee high riding boots. She was doing her makeup right in front of you so clearly she couldn\u2019t see you. \u201cWelp, I\u2019m all ready to hang out with Alex and Jack.\u201d  She says as she grabs her purse. \u201cSo you were going to go over anyway Kelly? Well I guess I should thank you for giving me a ride.\u201d And with that you turn into black mist and dart down her throat possessing her. \u201cOhhh Kelly is pretty horny I should get Alex to take me on a wild ride later.\u201d You say as you were leaving her room.

Shuddering, and forcing herself to get under control, Jack calls upon his new knowledge to see if his idea will work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Sounds intriguing, what do you have in mind,\" 'Jack' asks, moving past and behind Jack, and wraps his arms around her, cupping her breasts gently, and squeezing each in a slow pattern. The sudden spike in pleasure ramps up Jack's Lust even more, and breaks his train of thought, causing him to hiss both in pleasure and annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Damnit Lilith, you made me lose my train of thought,\" Jack complains, and is suddenly reminded of the difference the situation has become, as her nipple is suddenly grabbed and pinched hard. Moaning loudly, Jack shudders, and tries to push away from 'Jack', but is having trouble standing upright without 'his' current support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm 'Jack', not Lilith, and as to making you lose your train of thought, well think of it as practice on maintaining your focus, as there are many things I could do to help train you to keep your focus,\" 'Jack' whispers lowly into Jack's ear, Lust and desire lacing 'his' voice that sends more shivers racing through 'her' body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking a deep breath, and surprising 'Jack' in the process, 'Lilith' breaks free, stumbling a few feet away to the desk, and rests against it for a few moments, before finally standing up fully. Calling upon the knowledge quickly, 'Lilith' suddenly speaks an odd word, and 'Jack' freezes in place, a look of shock plastered on his now frozen face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Smirking, 'Lilith' contemplates getting pay-back for 'Jack's antics, but decides that, while not funny, it was interesting, and somewhat accurate of the now changed roles of this relationship. Concluding that, 'Lilith goes back to searching 'her' Knowledge on if her previous idea was feasible. Minutes go by, 'Jack's' eyes glaring at 'Lilith', whose eyes are closed, but moving rapidly, as if reading something. Finally, 'Lilith' smiles triumphantly, and snaps 'her' fingers, cancelling the spell on 'Jack'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Ok, first, not cool with the sudden paralyzation, but two, I did kind of deserve that, \" 'Jack' states petulantly, looking annoyed, but also curious about 'Lilith's' now Cheshire-like grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, I would have been done sooner, if you hadn't been distracting me, 'Jack'. Be glad i went for something simple, since 'I' seem to know some very interesting ways to restrain people apparently, \" 'Lilith' teases, while looking around the room for a mirror or reflective surface. Finding a small mirror he forgot was face down on the other side of the room, 'Lilith saunters over to it, putting extra sway in each step, and reaching the mirror, while hearing a groan behind 'her'. Grinning, then turning around to see a look of pure Lust etched onto 'Jack's' face, 'Lilith' merely winks, and repeats 'her' earlier tease, and goes back to the desk, hearing yet another groan after passing the obviously aroused 'man'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Placing the mirror against the wall on the desk, 'Lilith' steps back, and begins to chant while making the hand motions 'she' 'remembers' are important for the two spells 'she's' casting. As the chanting continues, the mirror seems to increase in size and width, until it reaches the dimensions of a full lenght mirror one would expect to see in a woman's room or the changing closet at a boutique. The chanting continues, and symbols start to line the edging of the mirror all along its surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Comprehension about what the apparent plan is, 'Jack' merely smirks, and steps back a bit further, making sure not to be in the way, as 'he' knows what would happen if an interruption occurred at this point. As the chanting winds down, two sigils appear in the air before 'Lilith', one floating away and towards 'Jack', who gains a confused look at what 'he' thought 'he' knew was the plan, and places itself on 'his' chest, under 'his' shirt. The second symbol, affixes itself directly over the center of 'Lilith's' chest, causing her to shudder, but thankfully the chanting had finished a moment beforehand. Lowering 'her' hands, 'Lilith' takes a moment to admire 'her' work, and then looks closely at the reflection of 'her' sigil. Pleased that it is the right one, 'Lilith' beckons 'Jack' over to stand in front of the mirror, grinning happily that everything had gone right so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ok, I recall what some of these spells do, but the finer details are in your sexy head, so what's the plan?\" 'Jack comments, moving up behind 'Lilith', and then being forcefully shoved to stand beside 'her'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"First, stand next to me, not behind me, if you want this to work, and secondly, take the shirt off, otherwise this wont work for you at least,\" 'Lilith' explains, while slowly going over the words 'she' needs one last time. Seeing 'Jack' has finished taking off the shirt, and is now standing ready next to 'her', 'Lilith' starts to chant a spell, moving a hand in front of 'her' slowly, as if wiping something down. In reaction to the motions, the mirror begins to glow purple in relation to the hand movement, and less than a minute later, there is a low purple glow covering the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Comprehension dawns on 'Jack' and an excited smile crosses 'his' face while saying aloud, \"Fuck 'Lilith', this is a hell of a first act for you to pull right from the start,\" giddiness almost causing 'Jack' to move out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, when you add knowledge, a lot of Lust, and a human's imagination, you can get some surprising results,\" 'Lilith' responds, with an indistinct echo coming from the mirror it would seem. Hearing the first part has worked, 'Lilith' turns towards 'Jack', pulls him downward, and locks lips with 'him' eagerly, moaning loudly as a double sensation seems to flood 'her' body, the sound echoing twice as loud, as a male moan joins 'hers'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Both quickly disrobe, randomly groping each other and moaning loudly and getting more erratic from the doubled and dual sensations each seems to be feeling. Finally both naked and feeling as if on a hair trigger, 'Lilith' decides to get some payback, and pleasure, and slowly reaches up to 'her' breasts. Grabbing a nipple, and tweaking it gently, her knees buckle, and cause her to have a mini-orgasm, but 'Jack' seems to have fallen completely, while cumming as he fell. Fighting to stay upright, and grinning from the small revenge for the earlier tease, 'Lilith' slowly walks over to the panting 'Jack' who upon seeing the incoming succubus, growls lustfully, as well as glare at 'her' for 'her' mischief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Ignoring the glare, 'Lilith' straddles 'Jack's' hips, not yet impaled on his tool, but shuddering from the teasing 'she' is causing them both. After moments of said torture, 'Lilith' lifts up enough to aim 'Jack's' cock, looks down into 'his' eyes, and winks, causing 'Jack's' eyes to widen in sudden worry. As 'she' drops to impale 'herself'', 'Lilith's' off hand reaches to 'her' nethers, and finds 'her' clit, just as she's impaling herself, 'she' twists it, causing loud, lusty moans and orgasms to rack both warlock and succubus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Merely sitting here, basking in the sensations of all the stimulation both are feeling, neither are inclined to move yet, both feeling super sensative and one wondering if they can stay conscious, now that they don't have their unnatural stamina to keep up. Looking into each others face, 'Lilith' smiles, before slowly starting to move 'herself' up and down, causing 'Jack' to moan and whimper right alongside 'her'. Minutes of this repeated action, and what feels like multiple orgasms, 'Lilith' pauses to catch 'her' breath, giving 'Jack' a moment to speak 'his' mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"While this feels wonderful - pant, pant - I don't think we - pant - can keep it up for much longer,\" 'Jack comments raggedly, and moans together with 'Lilith' as both feel a shudder travel through there bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"But 'Jack', I thought <i>you </i>wanted me to have fun,\" She responds, and both suddenly scream together in ecstasy, as 'Lilith' squeezed 'Jack' with internal muscles. Both try to continue on, but after one more rise and fall, and mutual orgasm occuring, 'Jack' passes out, a happy smile permanently stuck to 'his' face. Smirking, 'Lilith' considers trying to keep going, but decides against it as it could end badly for both 'him' and 'her'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Being careful to not move too much, 'Lilith' starts to chant the deactivation spell, shuddering, but keeping a find control of her voice, so as not to mess up the inflections of the words. Chanting done, the dual sensations that had been assaulting them both slowly fade, causing one last shudder to travel through the pair. Slowly standing up, 'Lilith' is surprised when their isn't a huge mess covering both 'her' and 'Jack'. Thinking on it, the answer comes to 'her', 'Oh, its absorbed and transmuted into energy...huh, who knew' muses 'Lilith'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fully standing now, 'Lilith' snaps 'her' fingers, and 'Jack' floats up onto the bed, still passed out and grinning. Smirking, 'Lilith' considers what to do now that 'Jack' is unavailable, and 'she' now has 29 days and 10 hours of being a Succubus to enjoy.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a name=\"freturn1\"></a><a href=\"#footnote1\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"Footnote 1: &lt;font class=&quot;size25&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;(For those that want a better understanding of what 'Lilith' did- she combined a few effects that sound simple, but would be the equivalent of exponents in magic.

As an idea of how to get both enters his head, Jack uses all his willpower to not smile, or give any indication about his thoughts on whether or not he wanted to have sex with Lilith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack finally understood how ignorant he had been moments after the swap had succeeded, and realized that he was lucky that Lilith didn't have any malevolent intentions, aside from torturing him with endless teasing and epic-level sex adventures. When Jack had first heard about the soul-swap spell, he thought he had understood it's mechanics, but as previously stated, moments after the spell's completion, he found out the truth. He had ALL of Lilith's memories up until the point of the swap, every deed she had ever done, every sexual thought and act (too many to count), and access to all her spells and magical theory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A quick silent spell to mask any future minor spells, as well as a follow up spell to alter his perception of time by increasing the speed his neurons fired at, Jack got to plotting his revenge. After long minutes (for Jack) of continuously brainstorming and scrapping many ideas, he comes upon one that he feels will make him happy, and while initially might piss Lilith off, she'll enjoy the effects and probably understand his motive for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cancelling the spell for his perception, Jack walks forward, and pants his arms on Lilith's shoulders, causing a lustful smile to form on her lips, though it's quickly replaced by a confused one, as she feels an enormous amount of energy surge through her moments after Jack's contact with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Ok, what was that about 'Lilith', while I might not retain all my Magical knowledge, I do still recall the basics, as well as my energy sensing, so what did you just do?\" Lilith asks, apparently slipping into her newer persona easier than Jack was. While Jack had access to all of Lilith's memories and powers, he still wasn't feeling much more different than before the swap, unless you account for the unending Lust coursing through him, but he had expected that, especially with how often Lilith masturbated and tempted him with sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well 'Jack', I figured that while you just got a boost to your 'know how', I might temporarily seal that avenue of you getting out of your incumbent punishment, as I know that would be your first instinctive action, regardless of whichever life you led. As to what I really did, if you feel for yourself, I simply locked your power away for the time being, since I know even a small measure would be enough for you to take advantage of most situations. Now, I think you said something about testing out my body, so I think I'll accept that offer, but on my terms.\" Jack responds sweetly, his voice not betraying the glee and mischief he feels at getting one over on Lilith, whose face has morphed from surprise to shock, then a slight glimmer of fear flashing across before returning trying to put on a brave smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"I guess I should have expected this, especially as your emotions will be heightened inside a demonic body. Very well, I'm truly at your mercy in this case 'Lilith', though I will remind you that if you go overboard, and we do switch back, I will get my revenge, even if this is your's for all the teasing.\" Lilith finally says after letting out a sigh, and looking expectantly at Jack, waiting for his next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm glad you understand, though I will admit I don't know if it's the enhanced feelings, or just the thrill at all this power coursing through me, but don't worry, I think even you will enjoy this next bit.\" Jack says, before starting to wave his hands in intricate patterns while chanting in a foreign sounding language. Minutes go by, and Lilith decides to sit down on the bed, while removing her shirt, in preparation for the upcoming fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, Jack finishes his actions, and a wash of energy pulses out from Jack, and collides with Lilith, covering her in multiple colors of light, before the suffuse into her body. That done, Jack starts to strip off his clothing in a sensual strip tease after seeing that he has Lilith's attention. Half way through Jack hears a moan, and glances over to see Lilith completely naked, her tool erect and ready for action, causing a wash of pleasure to surge through his demonic pussy, spreading out through his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finished pulling off the last piece of clothing, and his new instincts demanding that he mount Lilith and ride her like no tomorrow, Jack pushed them down (and swears he heard a growl of annoyance), and proceeds with the next part of his plan. Getting Lilith's attention, which had apparently been split between Jack's naked and aroused body, and applying attention to her turgid tool, Jack holds an index finger, and raises it to one of his breasts, but stops from touching it by a hairsbreadth. A gasp is heard after he lightly runs a nail across his erect nipple, and looks up to see a shocked expression on Lilith's face, as well as arousal in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"You know, putting a relentlessly teased male inside a succubus body, and letting him have access to all that power with an active imagination, not my best idea,\" Lilith says quietly, apparently realizing that this will be a long few hours if Jack is really out for revenge for all her previous teasing. Gulping, and feeling highly turned on, Lilith can only watch and feel frustration at the phantom sensations, as Jack starts to play with his body, and the same feelings run through Lilith, even though she didn't have the same equipment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Long torturous minutes go by for Lilith, as Jack seems to want to drag this out, slowly massaging and teasing his body, eliciting moans and groans from the both of them. Finally unable to let this go on, Lilith grips her cock, and starts pumping furiously, trying to find release from her current torture. Sadly, just as she feels on the edge of cumming, the sensation disappears, and while not dissipating, her arousal slightly lessens, only to build back up as she continues her efforts, even knowing the futility of them. Shouting in frustration, Lilith glares angrily at a smirking Jack, who keeps up his ministrations upon himself, but pauses momentarily to tweak his nipples, earning a loud moan from Lilith in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"You know, your a real bitch currently for using that spell. I may not be able to cast most of my Magics, but I do recall many of their effects. Be warned 'Lilith', if you keep this up, I will have my revenge!\" Lilith says scathingly, causing Jack to pause, as he realizes he's dragged this out long enough, as well as knowing that Lilith will make good on her word if he keeps it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sighing, and verbally apologizing to Lilith, Jack walks over to the bed, and gets on it, knee-walking over to straddle Lilith's waist. Moving above, but not onto, Lilith's cock, Jack decides to do one last tease, even if he might regret it later. Acting as if he's going to slowly impale himself, Jack moves minutely, and instead of impalement, runs his lips along Lilith's extremely hard cock, drawing a loud moan from them both. Looking up after finding himself flush against Lilith's pelvis, Jack sees a baleful glare, and a promise of unending vengeance in her eyes. Gulping, Jack decides to start the sex, and even removes one of the spells from Lilith silently, mostly as an apology for overdoing his pay-back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sliding his body back a bit, and while slightly apprehensive (as he never thought he would do this in his life), Jack slowly lowers his torso down onto Lilith's legs, stopping only when his head rests above Lilith's erect and strained member. Looking up and meeting Lilith's eyes, who also raises her eyebrows in shock, Jack thrusts his head down, letting instinct take over, and engulfs Lilith's cock fully in one go, not chocking nor feeling any need to. A sharp intake of breath followed by a scream of pleasure is all Jack hears before he starts focusing on his goal, bobbing his head up and down, surprisingly feeling aroused by this alien action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lilith doesn't last long, less than 30 seconds after Jack had started, she cums, roaring out her pleasure, while also gripping Jack's head and shoving it down roughly, holding him in place, though he doesn't struggle, just taking her load down quickly and easily. After she finishes, Lilith releases her hold on Jack, and he lifts his head off her still erect cock, not surprised in the least about its state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"I'll admit, I didn't expect you to do that Jack, especially as I can recall 'my' aversion to such things,\" Lilith finally says after regaining her breath from her intense orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, I honestly felt bad about going overboard, and wanted to apologize. Oddly enough, while I still feel slightly weird about the act, I can't say I'm averse to it currently, it might just be your body, or maybe the new perspective.\" Jack responds, unconsciously licking his lips while tapping his head at the mention of perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lilith merely grins at the answer and gesture, before asking if Jack is ready to continue. Jack's response is to simply slide his body up Lilith's legs, causing Lilith to gasp as the shared senses spell Jack had cast was still active. Lifting himself up, Jack lines up Lilith's pulsing tool, and slowly lowers himself onto it, causing both to groan in pleasure at the sensations flooding their respective bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fully impaled, Jack simply rests in place, not moving as a sinister idea formed in his mind...<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

Grabbing your jacket from the chair near the window you look automatically outside. It's dark outside and the white moon is shining inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I forgot that it is already dark outside Lilith.\" You tell Lilith pointing outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay master, I would still like to see if we can find any women out there.\" Lilith tells you to your surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's cool.\" You tell Lilith still amazed by her choice. \"Um, can you, you know, take care of my mother?\" You nudge downstairs where your mother is probably sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith snaps her fingers and shows off a smile. \"It's taken care off.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Lilith leave the house quietly; your passed your mother who was watching her soap without noticing you.

Last time I was out humans were still using a horse and a carriage. Ugh, I'm so glad that you don't have to use those anymore master. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a long time ago. So who was your master?\" You ask curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith smiles mysteriously as she looks at you. \"I can't tell you master. That is a secret.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm your master.\" You point out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry master, but those are the rules. I can tell you what they did, but I can't tell you who they are. The ones who made the book wanted to guarantee some privacy for the holders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it, I get it. So tell me something what they did.\" You ask Lilith and while driving she tells you of several of her masters. Some were evil geniuses bending on taking over the world, other were lonely perverts and some were trying to find ways to get rid off Lilith. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't tell you how annoying it is when someone points a cross at me, master. So many already tried to expel me that way, but it doesn't do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a bore, that's for sure.\" You tell her as you park your car at the park. To your surprise there are a few cars parked here as well. The park might not be so deserted as you thought it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping outside Lilith grabs your arm as she walks with you inside, feeling your arm pressing against her breasts, your attention is somewhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where to find someone?\" Lilith ponders as she thinks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden the sound of a wild bore grabs your attention. Looking around you can only see a woman lying on a park bench. Curious you walk closer to her. Looking at her closer you can see she's around her forties, she has a large figure and she smells of strong whiskey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phewee, she squeezed every last drop out.\" You comment on the smell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, never thought I smelled booze this strongly on a woman.\" Lilith comments. \"She is definitely a candidate.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" You ask Lilith but before you can say anything further you hear the sound of a man moaning. It comes from somewhere behind the bushes. Feeling curious you make your way over to the bushes. There you see something that you don't see every day. A redheaded woman is giving a blow job to some older guy. Judging from the expression on the man's face you see he's enjoying it immensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't stop Ann.\" The man says as you can see he's trying not to blow. Ann's head shakes as she continues her service.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, master, I didn't know you humans still use to do this kind of thing.\" Lilith whispers to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know either.\" You say surprised yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then hear footsteps from behind you as you turn around. Looking back you can see an older woman probably in her sixties passing by. She has an aged but friendly face and your eyes can't help but lock on her large breasts jiggling in her sports bra. From where you are she can't see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know you were interested in older women master.\" Lilith teases you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up.\" You whisper to Lilith. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who to pick master?

Lost in thought about the multitude of possible people available for this action, Jack is startled by the feel of a hand on his shoulder. Looking down to see the appendage, Jack sees it is a dainty female hand, but for some reason it just isn't registering with him. Following the connection of the hand to an arm, Jack continues to look up following the limb, and finally comes face to face with a grinning Lilith, who seems amused by Jack's spacing out, and on return, confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Standing abruptly, to save face, as well as avoid talking about his sudden daze, Jack simply nods, then starts to walk towards the egress of the room, and down the stairs, saying a quick farewell to his mother in passing, and not stopping to tell her where he was going. Reaching outside, Jack is suddenly reminded that it is still night time, not even a day later, but is glad that his destination is still open for another two hours. Worse comes to worst, they can always try to find a target tomorrow, as a Saturday at the mall will mean plenty of more options for Lilith. Feeling a shiver of pleasure at the thought of the many possible people Lilith could switch with, Jack shudders, but then regains control of himself, remembering that he can't afford to daydream and fantasize right now, as he is on a time limit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Thoughts in order, Jack walks over to his car, and quickly gets in and starts it up, carefully backing up and onto the street, before setting off at a decent speed towards the mall. Less than five minutes later, as traffic was unusually busy on the way over, Jack enters the mall parking lot, seeing plenty of open spaces to choose from. Picking one near the front, Jack promptly parks his car, gets out, locks the door, then takes a moment to check out his surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"If I had known you would take off without even saying anything Master, or would even leave me behind, I might have decided to not compulse your mother to ignore your rapid exit, especially as it is 'so late' in her opinion,\" says a voice behind Jack, causing him to jump forward a few feet before quickly turning around to see the speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Coming into Jack's view was a very amused looking Lilith, who seemed to be silently holding in her laughter at Jack's reaction, if the shaking of her shoulders and mirthful look adorning her face was any indication. Heartbeat slowing as his surprise slowly morphs into sheepishness, Jack starts rubbing the back of his head, trying to think of a way to apologize to Lilith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm not mad Master, as it was no bother for me to get here, but the sudden shock of you leaving unannounced, as well as not even thinking clearly beyond your imagined goal, is something to be concerned about in the future. I mention this from experience as I've seen many previous 'Warlocks' have the same tunnel vision clouding their minds, leading them to ignore simple things that end up getting them killed, or worse,\" Lilith speaks up before Jack starts to apologize, stopping him cold as her words help him explain a lot with this recent action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm sorry for leaving you behind Lilith, and thank you for helping cover for me with my mother. As to what you said...I can't deny that I was so focused on enacting this spell as soon as possible. I can't really explain it, but it almost felt like a need to do it....saying that out loud makes it seem odd.\" Jack apologizes, and then realizes that something is up. \"Uh, Lilith, is there any way to check myself for compulsions or enchantments laid upon me, cause after saying it out loud, I can't believe I would act like that normally, even if I was interested in enacting a spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Lilith smiles at Jack's question, before simply nodding, but not saying anything. Seeing this, Jack starts to think over why this might be the case, before he realizes that Lilith is possibly testing him. Deciding to see if that is true, or she's merely teasing him, Jack phrases his next question carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"So, is this an enchantment laid upon me by you, or the Book, and if it is by the Book, is it some kind of test?\" Jack asks, hoping that he can discern the truth from his willful and mischievous succubus, who's grin gets wider after Jack's inquiry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"I must say Master, I'm impressed you picked up on the test, and the fact that it was a test, with so few hints....one in fact if you consider it being me giving you a warning. I'm glad to have such an intelligent Master, even if he makes it too easy to tease him. In any case, the Book does indeed place tests upon its Bound owners. Some are straight forward, and some are subtle, but most are dependent on the Warlock, as well as their choices. In this case, your desire for a challenge was matched by a test to see if you would keep running headlong into a possible problem. Before you ask what I mean Master, all I can say is that the Book is semi-sentient, and is able to give me tasks that are equal in priority to yours, in this case, usually to test it's owner, and no, I cannot really explain it any clearer than I just did.\" Lilith answers, an impressed and easy smile on her face, as she further explains to Jack new facts about the world he now walks in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Wait, the Book is partially intelligent...is that normal, or just something connected to my...your...our situation in general?\" Jack finally gets out, stumbling over the semantics of phrasing his question, as the idea of a partially intelligent book is an odd one for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Lilith chuckle at Jack's question... or maybe the awkward stumbling it took to get it out, but Jack doubts he'll ever truly know. Lilith's amusement slowly fades, as she simply smirks in response to Jack's expectant look, merely raising an eyebrow with a look that says 'who knows'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Sighing, as he feels Lilith is being difficult on purpose now, and unlikely to explain more, either by choice or by the...book's decision. Shaking his head, Jack holds out an arm, gesturing with the other for Lilith to take it, and after a bemused Lilith indulges Jack's silent request, wraps her arm in his, and leans in close to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0The duo, one amused at her Master's attempted gallantry, the other exasperated at his Succubi's random antics, proceed toward the mall doors, arm in arm, and ready to pick out a target for Lilith to swap with.<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n\u00a0After entering the ground floor of the two-storey mall, Jack led Lilith at a decent walking speed to the second floor, up to the terrace area that looked over the whole first floor (minus the few shops directly underneath it), and gave a great vantage point of seeing everything on the second floor as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Lilith, apparently trying to act the part of a woman out with her boyfriend, is practically plastered to Jack's side, his arm squeezed between her breasts (not that he was complaining), while oohing and ahhing at all the new things around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm honestly amazed about all the things you humans have created and accomplished in the one-hundred years since my last walk about in this realm Master. It makes me giddy with excitement to try out all the new fun toys for sex, or the new places to enjoy it at, or in some cases, as.\" Lilith says quietly, real excitement and enjoyment filling her voice, while her gaze keeps darting about the shops and people moving around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Have we really advanced that much since you last were around Lilith? I ask because it's hard for me to imagine you being excited by such simple things, when you've had centuries, if not possibly millennia, to experience different things.\" Jack asks quietly in response, curious at this new side to Lilith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0A thoughtful look crosses Lilith's face, before she gently smiles at Jack. \"While I'm not quite as old as millenniums Master, the thing you probably aren't considering is the fact that the longer you live, the harder it is to find interest in some things. It's honestly why there are many stories in mythology about demons, deals, and also some about 'gods', which in truth were Demons bored and wanting to have some fun. Hell is not exactly a pleasant place, and humans are an ingenious race that seem to keep on evolving and finding new ways to change. The other factor is that while I was summoned by you, and have a basic understanding of this era's history, it's mostly an info dump, and doesn't seem real until one experiences it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0The two simply stand there quietly, each contemplating their own views on what was said, as well as thinking about the philosophical thoughts Lilith's response had prompted. Minutes pass before each silently agree that it's time to get on with their goal. Moving to the low glass wall that surrounds the second floor, Jack and Lilith start to scout out who would be interesting for Lilith to swap with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Hrm, too many possible choices, so is there a preferred type you like Lilith?\" Jack asks, realizing that Lilith's choices are literally anyone in the mall currently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, honestly whatever you would want Master, but I would like to have someone around your age, or older, so that we can have some fun, without you needing to use magic to stay out of trouble.\" Lilith answers, a grin spreading over her face at the implied option that Jack had forgotten to request be off the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"In that case, how about someone from my school or neighborhood, only someone not close enough to be considered a friend?\" Jack poses, seeing a few people that fit his offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"You have someone in mind Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Jack points across the open expanse towards a trio of girls exiting a clothing store. Lilith inspects them, and Jack speaks up, explaining who they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"The blonde is Melissa Robinson, the head cheerleader, the purplette is Nikki, and the red-head is Adrianna.\" Jack points to the opposite store after Lilith nods...</span></span></div></div>",

Next to her is Janet, the purplette that I pointed out earlier is her best friend, and I have to say she has an amazing set of breasts, though she is kinda short. The last of that apparent trio, the one who is slightly taller than Janet with green highlights running through her blue hair, is the new transfer student that came in last month. I think I heard her name was Megissa, though I can't honestly say I know much about her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, that's interesting, the last one you pointed out seems to be a Caster of sorts, if her energy levels are any indication, not to mention the multiple enchantments layered onto her personage. I'm curious about that, but I also don't know if we could succeed in targeting her Master. I'll leave that choice up to you, but unless you have a plan, I'd suggest to avoid her until you become stronger.\" As Lilith finishing voicing her discovery, Megissa suddenly stops following her two friends, and turns her head around, looking directly at Lilith in surprise, as well as slight curiosity, before turning back and catching up to her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yeah, if that was any indication, I don't think a sneak attack would work, though if we could get her to agree to it voluntarily, it might work Lilith. I'll ask your opinion on that before any final decisions are made by that. On that note, are you able to tell if she'll be hostile towards us, especially if we target either of her apparent friends?\" Jack comments, as Megissa's reaction raises a few flags, as well as questions, in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I can't say for sure what her reactions might be, but if anything, I would think that at this point, it would be to talk to her before targeting her two friends, as well as seeing if she's interested in sharing knowledge...or having some fun,\" Lilith responds, sounding intrigued at the idea of another magic user being nearby, whether for the knowledge or possible sex, Jack couldn't even try to guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Moving on, Jack points to one last group, people that had caught his eye, and he didn't even know, but couldn't deny they were extremely attractive, if not lust inducing in one of the woman's cases. \"The last people that caught my that fits with what I suggested earlier are just coming out of that lingerie store and food court separately, but both going in the same direction. I'm meaning the slightly athletic looking Asian that seems to be deep in conversation with the curvy and attractive dark haired beauty, if her exuberant hand motions are anything to go by. My final 'pick' of the prospects I've seen so far is the raven haired beauty who seems to be trying to tease everyone around. I thought you might like her since she seems to enjoy flaunting her looks, if that extremely small top that is ending just under her breasts, and the micro-skirt that has half the guys in the area stuck with a permanent hard-on is anything to go by. Honestly, you might have too much fun tormenting others with that one Lilith, that is, unless you spent all your time as her tormenting me,\" Jack finishes, trying to tease Lilith as pay back for all the teasing and innuendo's she had thrown around in the short time they had known each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Just as Jack realized that he hadn't known Lilith that long, he also felt that he could actually trust her completely....at least in matters not pertaining to sex and mischief, as she seemed to go overboard with those two fields. Shaking his head with a light smile on his face, Jack falls silent, just enjoying the feel of Lilith pressed against him, as well as the ambiance of the mall, while waiting on Lilith to pick someone, or offer up her own opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Long minutes pass, neither one saying a word, before Lilith turns her head towards Jacks, and moves one of her arms up to pull Jack's head down into a gentle and loving kiss. Shocked at this sudden action, Jack is momentarily motionless, before slowly reciprocating, and starting to enjoy the feel of Lilith pressed against him while kissing. A few minutes later, Lilith breaks the kiss, hearing a groan from a now slightly aroused Jack, causing her to chuckle at his slight discomfort, before speaking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I've made a choice Master...\"</span></div></div>",

Few warlocks are so willing to dive in so deep so quickly - I am very impressed with your bravery!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what do we do for the spell?\" Jack asked a bit nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the Warlock master! Just read the instructions: first we'll need chalk a big room to draw the spell circle on the ground. Do you have an area like that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack nodded, \"the basement should suffice.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's hop to it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, Jack was confident that he had gathered all of the relevant ingredients for the spell. Incense was lit, the spell circle was drawn out, and he commited the incantation to memory. He didn't really have confidence in his ability to channel the magic for the spell, but Lilith said she'd help him with that part since he was a beginner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When it's time to cast the spell, I'll just grab your shoulder and direct your magic myself,\" she had assured him. This would let him circumvent the the fact that he was less than a novice in casting ability. \"It's cheating, but rules can be broken when they get in the way of having fun! Now you just need to get your mother down here in the spell circle, and you both need to cut your hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack nodded. \"Just wait here. I'll go and get her to follow me down.\" He turned to walk up the stairs, leaving Lilith waiting as he went into the living room to find his mother watching TV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom, you mind helping me with something?\" Jack asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure son, what is it?\" She asked, turning her head away from the news. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was looking for my basketball down in the basement, but accidentally knocked over an old vase. Can you help me clean it up?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine shook her head. \"I'm always telling you kids to be careful down there! Let's hope it wasn't anything important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack gave a smile in return. \"Thanks mom - I appreciate the help.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack had, of course, planted the broken vase there already. It was just a simple glass container for flowers - nothing expensive. He had, however, cast a spell on the broken shards. It was 'Lacerate' - two of the glass shards would inflict a minor cut on whoever touched them. Jack was sure to grab one and let his mother grab the other. It hurt as the glass turned itself inward and slashed his palm, but he needed it to make this whole spell work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\" His mother cried as she grabbed her own cursed shard of glass. She gripped her hand, putting pressure on the wound. \"The thing had a mind of its own!\" She couldn't hear her son chanting out the spell a foot away from her. \"Are you listening to me Jack?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack finished the spell, and gave Lilith a knowing glance. She seemed giddy, and eagerly gripped his shoulder. The circle was glowing now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I'm sorry mom, are you okay?\" Jack asked, trying to sound concerned as he walked over to his mother. \"Open your palm, let me see.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother opened her hand, showing the vertical wound the glass had left behind. '<i>Perfect</i>,' Jack thought as he put his hand over hers, causing their wounds to intersect. A red glow emanated from between their palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack? What are you-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack interrupted her with the word to finish the spell. \"<i>VERTO</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor just a moment, the room was flooded with white light as the glowing chalk dust plumed into the air. Jack could feel himself being pulled forwards, but not physically. He realized that his spirit itself was being ripped from his body and pulled into his mother's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs the ritual a success?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack's vision was blurred for a moment, spots jumping across his eyes after the flash from the spell. As his senses cleared, however, he could feel that he was different. He felt lighter in some ways, but there was a weight holding down his chest, and the effects vetigo had spread throughout his new body. He struggled to maintain balance, pressing one hand to the wall as he took stock of his new form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>( did it! I'm really mom!</i> he thought to himself, gasping audibly as he poked at his new breasts with a long, slender finger. His hands seemed much more delicate though as well - his skin was smooth and soft. He was wearing the outfit his mom had been wearing while watching television, a pink sweatsuit a running shoes. She was likely going to go for a jog before Jack had stolen her body. He could feel the effects of age, but it was offset by his mother's good health. If he had to be honest she was probably in better shape he was. After taking a moment to adjust and breathe, he had to admit that her body felt good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'And since I'm a stay-at-home mom now,' </i> Jack thought with a smile. <i>'I'll have all the freedom I need to investigate my new powers. No school to worry about, and no one snooping in my business.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack was collecting himself, however, his mother Christine was struggling to piece together what happened. \"J-Jack, wh-where, what happened?\" she asked panicked, having fallen forward on the floor, struggling to pick herself up. \"My- my voice...\" she wasn't prepared like Jack was, and everything about her new body seemed to have her off guard. She was totally incapable of recovering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked at his mom - now in his body - on the ground and considered what to do with her. 'Do I actually tell the truth?' he wondered. He had just stolen her body for a month <i>at minimum</i>. He couldn't imagine she'd be okay with that. Lying about it would be a bit hard however, due to the fact that he recited the incantation for the spell and recovered so much faster than her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith seemed to read Jack's thoughts on the matter, and weighed in from her position behind him. \"You don't <i>have</i> to do either, <i>mistress</i>,\" she said, relishing the new title. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Jack asked, a little slowly and quietly as he acclimated to his mother's voice. It sounded different from his mouth, he had to wonder if his intonation was maybe different from hers or if this what just how it sounded to her ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a warlock, is what I mean! Or a witch now, I suppose. We'll have to consider the logistics of your title later. But, you have magic! With a spell, you could rewrite her memories or puppeteer her to act however you please.With you powers, cooperation is merely a pleasantry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... sounds evil.\" Jack replied bluntly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And stealing your own mother's body for the sake of her authority isn't?\" Lilith asked rhetorically. \"You're engaged in something already fairly perverse, master. Letting your mother act independently may be fun, but you hold all the cards. We can watch her flop around like a confused fish, or resolve the problem and enjoy the month. What do you desire?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stared at Lillith, whose face showed a sentiment of glee at the whole circumstance. He could hear his own voice interrupt his thoughts though. \"Who-who are you talking to? Why do you look like me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack turned to see his mom in his own body, her (his?) face contorted in panic and confusion. Jack decided to...</span></div></div>",

The book may have compelled you to take your mothers body because it has the most free time of your whole family. Being a stay at home mother would allow you much more time at home to practice your magic relatively undisturbed and in peace. It appears that swapping bodies with your mother was a very good choice indeed Mistress Christine.\" Lillith answers as she begins to appraise your new body with a lustful eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \" That explains a lot Lillith.

Just memorize the spell and speak it with your hand on her head.\" she states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \" Okay then. \" you reply and spend the next few minutes silently reciting the words in your head until you think you have it. Silently you stop fidgeting with the page before moving in front of your old body, you old eyes terrified still, as you deliberately place your left hand on your mothers forehead and recite the gibberish you memorized . You feel a wetness between your legs you concentrate on the wedding and engagement rings on your finger, realizing that the thought of not only stealing your mothers body, but everything else that made her who she is , is making you horny. You feel a sharp flood of information flooding your mind as all of your mothers memories flood into your mind. You remember growing up on the farm your grandparents... no your parents ... still live on. You remember your first date from your mothers perspective, losing your virginity, the Black boyfriend she had years ago, meeting your father. Your wedding,honeymoon,giving birth to your sister Jenny, breast feeding her, and everything else. You now had all the information you would ever need to pass as Christine Thompson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \" It worked Lillith.

As the sensations slowly dissipated, Jack's vision cleared, and he felt fully physical again. Looking down, Jack is surprised to see not his mother's body, but Lilith's. Tearing his gaze from its sudden desire to stare at his new breasts, Jack looks around the room, and sees two bodies on the ground, both his body, as well as his mothers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Taking a step closer to the two bodies, Jack sees that both are at least still breathing, if the rising and lowering of their chests are any indicator. Seeing that at least both bodies live, Jack contemplates on what he should do next, since both appear to be unconscious at the moment. Starting to pace while thinking, Jack is mid-way through his second 'lap' of pacing, Jack feels a sudden surge of Lust surge through him, causing him to collapse to his knees in surprise. Arms thrown out to catch himself, Jack manages to stop his face from hitting the ground, but the chill of the cool floor against his thin shirt sends a tingle of pleasure through his breasts, which increases the feeling of Lust, which seems to be emanating from his core. Shuddering in place, and trying to calm himself down, Jack tries to figure out what is going on aside from extreme horniness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why Mistress, it seems your having trouble controlling your new body. Do you require some help?\" comes an innocent voice that Jack recognizes instantly. Turning his head as much as he can from his current position, Jack looks over his shoulder, and sees his body sitting up, staring hungrily at Jack's compromised state. Momentary confusion at seeing his body being awake, and calling him 'Mistress' is replaced by comprehension, as Jack quickly realizes that Lilith must be in his body. After realizing such, Lilith's words sink in, and Jack feels another tingle of pleasure race through his body, before his arms begin to shake as the current amount of arousal and lust coursing through his body increase dramatically, almost as if it agreed with such an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Shuddering from the overwhelming desire to accede to Lilith's suggestion, Jack clamps down on his urges, and uses all his will power available to regain control over his hyper-sexed body. Shuddering and regaining enough motor control to at least change his position from his knees to sitting on his ass, Jack promptly sits down, shivering with a ,now known to him, unquenchable desire for sex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Looking up from his new seated spot, Jack sees Lilith standing up, and inspecting the room, but with glowing eyes adorning his old face instead of the usual 'normal' ones. Curious about the glow, Jack is about to ask, but as he opens his mouth, all that escapes is a low moan, causing him to close his mouth quickly, lest he make more lewd sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Jack's moan catches Lilith's attention, as she turns her head towards him, and stares at him for a few minutes, not blinking or moving from her spot. Feeling somewhat self-conscious, but not able to truly move, Jack decides to try to regain control through deep breathing. Putting plan to action, Jack closes his eyes, and starts to breath in deeply at a slow, decent pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Several minutes pass before Jack feels any significant change, but at long last, Jack feels his new demonic desires of sex die down to a simmer, instead of the torrential boil that had been since it had awoken. Taking one last deep breath, Jack slowly exhales, then opens his eyes to see his surroundings once more. Upon opening his eyes, Jack is greeted by glowing eyes filling his entire view, scaring him by its suddenness, and causing him to fall over and lightly scream out in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Laughter fills the room as his former body stands up from the apparent crouch it had been in, and walks over towards Jack, holding out a hand to help Jack up. Taking the hand, Jack is helped to stand by Lilith, whose eyes begin to dim and return to the normal ones Jack was used to seeing any time he looked into a mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm surprised you regained control so quickly Mistress, especially without indulging in any sexual activities to sate your new hunger. Congratulations on that, though in the future, you might want to be careful, as your new body will fight you if you don't 'feed' it often enough.\" Lilith says, seeming amused and slightly appraising of Jack's accomplishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Thanks, I think, but can you explain how this happened, and where Mom is? Also, what was with the glowing eye bit, since I don't exactly have your memories in here do i?\" Jack asks, beginning to ramble as his sense of victory is shown to be only a minor one in face of his current dilemma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Calm yourself Mistress, for not everything is as bleak as you probably imagine. Your mother is currently...'asleep', though she wont awaken until i let her. Before you ask how and why, the two answer are interconnected. Your mother's soul is currently in your old body, along with me. As I assumed you didn't want her to be panicking or in the know about the current situation, I felt it prudent to suppress her awareness down to the level where she is for all intents and purposes asleep. The 'glowing eye bit' was me using a form of 'Mage sight' that allows me to see the effects of magic on the locale, as well as on or in people.\" Lilith says soothingly, putting a hand gently on Jack's shoulder, sending a warm sense of comfort through the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Lilith's words and touch help alleviate Jack's first concerns, but he notices that she didn't exactly explain how the spell misfired in such a way. Deciding that he would ask politely, as an angry succubus in his former body could be potentially bad, not to mention she had been nice enough not to take advantage of him before in his lust-driven state earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"So, aside from both of you ending up in my body for some odd reason, and me ending up in yours, anything you can share about the results of this little problem Lilith?\"Jack inquires, trying to offer up a large enough segue for Lilith to volunteer what she had left out before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Sighing, Lilith looks off towards Jack's mother's body, shaking her head minutely, before returning her gaze to Jack, and begins to speak. \"It was a nice attempt at guiding the conversation Mistress, but our mental link is still connected, so I know you realized I avoided answering, but I do thank you for giving me an opportunity. To answer your question though, the Book took umbrage with my trying to circumvent the rules in place. If you had a bit more power, it might not have reacted in this manner, but it decided to apparently twist our spell into its own design. In this case, it put you in my body to accelerate your soul's reserve growth, while also helping you be able to learn spells somewhat easier.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Knowing that can't be all, but hoping that what Lilith is stalling on isn't too bad, Jack tries to sound positive. \"Well, it's not exactly how we wanted it, but I did manage to cast an intermediate spell, just not with the intended outcome being a result. On the plus side I'm now able to learn more, while being in a sexy and awesome body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Lilith lightly smiles at Jack's attempt, before a frown covers her face.\"I wish that was the full of it Mistress, but the truth of the matter is, that in some cases, when you break the rules, their are punishments if your caught. In our cases, the book attempted to punish someone, and in this case, I helped you avoid that punishment, but it merely shifted its response. Originally, after reading the magic in the area, your mother's soul was going to be consumed by the book, for what purpose I know not. In order to avoid that, I yanked her soul into your body along with mine, as if she had stayed in her body, or ended up in mine, she would have been targeted by the Book. Until we increase your power enough to lift the books punishment, or we find some way to appease it, your mother has to stay with me in your previous body. Before you suggest trying to do any soul magics, don't forget that you technically were 'successful' in the casting of your spell, so were now both locked into these bodies for the next 30 days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Her explanation leaves Jack speechless, but also grateful that Lilith saved his mother as he knows she didn't have to. Granted, if Jack wanted to be petty, he could blame this situation on Lilith, but it also would be his fault, as he chose to go along with it, and even picked his mom as an unwilling participant. Sighing and feeling weary at the stress of the situation, Jack leans back against the wall behind him, and rests his weight against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Is there anything else I need to know about the fallout of this situation, or should we move on to how were going to somehow hide my mother disappearing for a month?\" Jack asks tiredly, really wishing that he had thought before he leaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, it's not great news, but positive enough to help answer your question. While you are locked into my succubus body, you are not limited to that per se. You can still possess others, but not for long periods of time, or adverse effects could potentially happen. As to how that helps, you can possibly live as your mother, as the effect to her currently soulless body will be minimal. The only other way to handle her 'disappearance' would be to cast a spell for everyone to ignore her for a set period of time.\" Lilith responds lightly, trying to set a positive tone with such bleak information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sighing, but realizing that there's nothing that complaining will do, Jack decides...<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

It's all smooth, even smoother than you can remember your own face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to the mirror and feel your ass moving gently. Your hands rest on your ass. It feels softer than your own, not to mention more jigglier. It feels so bouncy. You then focus your attention to the figure in the mirror, Jenny or you now. Some of Jenny's long hair rests on her shoulder and the rest on her back. And then the rest of her body. Touching her stomach you feel how small it is compared to you. Pulling up your shirt you can see the outline of a six pack, a sign that Jenny takes really good care of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freaking weird.\" You mumble hearing Jenny's voice speaking your sentence. Your attention then gets taken away by the next two big things. Your breasts. Weird to think of them as your own. You touch them gently. It's amazing how soft and bouncy they are. It's also then that you remember Jenny telling your mom she would always sleep without her bra on. So that would mean Jenny's breasts were hiding underneath your shirt not protected by anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt feels weird to think about checking them out.

Wondering why she was confused, you are about to ask, when Lilith suddenly speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Are you sure Master? That is a great deal of trust you are placing on me. While i have been nice and following your orders because of being bound to you by the book, you do recall that mythology and history has painted my kind as untrustworthy. In some cases just plain evil,\" Lilith questions, looking intently at Jack while speaking, as if trying to find some clue as to his motives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Hearing Lilith's statement, Jack wonders if it's the right choice, to place so much trust in a being that he hasnt even known 24 hours. Considering it all logically, Jack pauses for a moment, and gets a 'gut' feeling that he should trust Lilith. His gut having not failed him yet Jack takes a leap of faith, and responds warmly to Lilith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"While your myth and history is against you as you say Lilith, so far, you haven't screwed me over. Caused me panic with your mischief, and tried to get me to explore new avenues of life, but you haven't willfully or maliciously set me up to die or suffer. With that all said, yes, I still wish to soul swap with you, because I have faith in you,\" Jack states with such conviction, he witnesses something he had never heard of before, a demon shedding a tear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Thank you Master. You're the first person to actually trust me in all the time I've been bound,\" Lilith states emotionally. Taking a moment to compose herself, she gets a grin on her face. \"While I won't abuse your trust, do know that i will continue to push your boundaries where i can during this swap Master!\" Lilith states, getting a impish grin on her face, and a flash of mischief in her eye while pointing at you comically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Bursting into laughter at the comedic moment, and grinning in response to what Lilith has stated, you walk forward and pull her into a gentle hug. After a moment, Lilith pushes Jack back slightly, and then moves her head upwards, locking her lips with his in a soul-searing kiss, almost instantly causing Jacks libido into overdrive. Breaking the kiss moments later, and panting for air, Jack gives Lilith a questioning look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"What, while we had a tender moment Master, I'm still a being of Lust. Sentimental moments also get me in the mood....granted just about anything can do that as well, \" Lilith explains with a salacious grin forming on her face. Disengaging from her, Jack steps back, and asks the important question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"when should we do this Lilith, since you are the expert on souls and lust,\" Jack asks, hoping that the next month will not be too extreme.</span></div></div>",

Lilith, seeing his immediate response, gently grabs his hand, and leads him down to the basement. Looking around, Lilith finds a wide enough area, though covered in clutter, and merely waves a hand over it while saying an odd word. Upon finishing her gesture, all the objects on the ground suddenly leap into the air, then start to sort themselves into a few piles at the other end of the basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Huh, if being a sex demon doesn't work out for you ever Lilith, you could always put housekeepers out of business,\" Jack jokingly says, trying to add some levity to his pensive mood. Lilith merely chuckles at his weak joke, and begins looking more closely at the floor, before moving over the one of the piles that had sorted itself from her spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finding what she was looking for, Lilith returns to her previous position, and hold out what appears to be a carton of sidewalk chalk. Curious, and wondering how something kids play with could be used for magic, Jack watches on, not daring to interrupt with his questions for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lilith begins to chant while running a hand over the box in intricate patterns, almost like drawing invisible symbols on the air over it. Moments later Lilith stops her chanting and hand movement, but rapidly places the box on the ground. About to question her actions, Jack pauses, as the box of chalk has begun to glow, and change shape. Less than a minute later, the box of chalk has turned from the multiple colors available inside, to pure white, and spread itself out into an intricate pattern that adorns the floor. With raised eyebrow, Jack watches, as Lilith disappears momentarily, then returns, with some kind of object in her hand. Upon closer inspection, it appears to be some kind of clear gem, though Jack knows he won't be able to accurately guess what kind, as gemology isn't his expertise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Ok Master, the spell is nearly ready. The last part we need to do is share blood and recite the spell, since you want to be the one to gain the 'experience', you have to be the one to initiate the spell. Make sure you are ready for this, as without any screw-ups, we won't be able to change back for a month.\" Lilith states in the most serious tone Jack had heard her use yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Steeling himself, Jack pushes on, and steps towards Lilith, moving to be across from her in the circle, which has started to emit a light blue glow. Nodding his head, Jack feels a sudden spike of pain in his hand, and looks down to see Lilith removing her hand, two fingernails extended outward looking more like claws. Lilith lets the crystal go mid-air, and instead of falling, seems to just sit in place, hovering between Warlock and Succubus. Taking a moment, Lilith quickly slashes her hand, and retracts her 'claws' back to their normal dainty appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking a moment to center himself, and go over the spell again, Lilith gently grabs Jack's wounded hand with hers, and holds them over the crystal, where droplets start to drip onto it. Nodding, Lilith signals that it's now all on Jack, who takes a breath, and begins the chant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Long moments stretch on, and near the end, Jack nearly stumbles, but a gentle squeeze of Lilith's hand brings him back, and he finishes the incantation without a problem. As the last syllable is uttered, the light blue glow the circle had been emitting changes to a bright blood red, bordering on black. Jack feels a sudden sense of disconnect, and his vision starts to blur, as well as the sensation of being weightless filling his being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What feels like an eternity, but is most likely mere moments later, Jack's sense of feeling, as well as his vision starts to return. The first thing Jack feels is the weight on his chest, as well as a sense of power surrounding him. Looking around, Jack sees faint lights shimmering all around him, almost forming symbols one would imagine to be connected to magic. More physical sensation starts to draw Jack's attention, and he notices that he feels uncontrollably horny all of a sudden. Looking down, Jack notices that the clothes that had been on Lilith before have disappeared, leaving him naked and exposed, but he doesn't feel any chill or warmth strangely. Focusing more on his new feelings and sensations, Jack notices that his new pussy seems to always be 'ready' as he feels a slight dampness between his legs, as well as an urge to explore it. Shuddering, and shaking his head at the sudden feelings, Jack finally looks across to where Lilith is, and sees a faint smile on his former face, as well as what looks like poorly hidden amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Glad you finally decided to notice me, Master....or is it Mistress? Though in this case, I might be the master now!\" Lilith says, momentarily scaring Jack, as the idea of being subservient to her in such a manner hadn't crossed his mind. Seeing the shock cross his face, Lilith bursts into laughter, clutching her new sides and nearly falling over, apparently only standing by sheer willpower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"I kid, Mistress, though you will have some slight desire to serve me, it will be mitigated by the fact that your not truly the succubus, but merely occupying the body, granted, I technically don't have to serve you either, but I will, as most of my power was left behind in your new body. Together, we can still work great magic, but the difference is that now you have alot of power, and little knowledge, while i traded down somewhat, in that I retain all my knowledge, but have sacrificed my immense reserves of power.\" Lilith explains, after getting control of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking a moment to calm down, Jack realizes that he does feel 'compelled' to obey, but more like a tiny whisper, that seems easily ignorable at the moment. Relief floods Jack, and he smiles upon realizing that the spell worked, and that nothing bad happened, but then notices a problem in his this endeavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Hey Lilith, I just realized, while it will be interesting to be you for a month, what exactly am I supposed to do, aside from have sex and cause you mischief, since i now have the chance to return the favor?\" Jack asks, a grin forming on his face as he gets the last bit out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh Mistress, you are lucky that I like you, and are not going to take advantage of your folly. Most demons would abuse such recklessness, though I did somewhat prompt it in this case. Regardless, you can learn magic while I'm at school, or you could even explore the world. I would suggest you stay nearby until you get a handle on all your new powers, as from where I'm standing it's hard not to notice that you're struggling with the increased libido and hormones.\" Lilith states, smirking as once mentioned, Jack feels a sudden rush of the sensations he had been trying to ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nearly falling over from the sudden rush, Jack catches himself on a nearby shelf, holding himself upright by one hand, while the other seems to be trying to reach his pussy. Fingers finally reaching their goal, Jack lets go of the shelf, and collapses on the ground, as his fingers go to town, plunging in and out rapidly, while his thumb starts to massage his clit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chuckling at the scene before her, Lilith shakes her head, while wondering if she should join in, or leave him to his own exploration. Watching for a few minutes, and feeling her new tool rise to attention, Lilith considers joining, but backs off, as she feels that she should set up some defense around the house, to help protect her now targetable Mistress, as well as exercise her new reserves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack meanwhile has lost most coherent thought, as his body moves on instinct, massaging, pulling, pinching, and thrusting all the spots on his new body that feel pleasurable. Shuddering after another orgasm, Jack wonders if there is any way to get his libido under control, otherwise he might end up masturbating the whole month away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shuddering at the thought, Jack tries to focus and bring his will to bear against his flood of Lust and instinct that seem intent on remaining in control. Long minutes filled with the sounds of squelching and moaning pass by, and Jack slowly feels like he's gaining ground on the battle for control. Writhing through another orgasm, and feeling as if he's mere moments away from victory, Jack's concentration is broken by Lilith's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Wow, I honestly thought you would have gotten control by now, Mistress. Do you need some male help for your problem?\" Lilith asks, smirking at finding Jack still on the ground, moaning lewdly and plunging multiple fingers into his pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Da-da-damit Lilith, was almost there. Another five seconds and i would have won! \" Jack finally says, in between pants and moans, as while he feels refreshed after each orgasm, he still feels mental fatigue at all the pleasure coursing through him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Aww, I'm sorry Mistress, but my offer still stands, and it would give you the chance to experience sex from the other side of the fence, as they say,\" Lilith teases, and slowly starts to disrobe, starting with her shirt, then slowly pulling off her shoes and jeans, leaving only her tenting boxers on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0{s\u00a0}Jack feels even more Lust course though his body at the mention of sex with Lilith, and it takes all his will power not to jump up and pounce on his former body. Focusing, Jack tries to find some way out of his situation, but utterly fails, as each time he feels close, another orgasm sneaks up on him, and pulls his thoughts away from completion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Giving in, Jack merely nods to Lilith, who slowly pulls off her boxers, and approaches Jack, shit eating grin plastered on her face the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

'Wait, why would I want to do that... must be my instincts? I know before I didn't want to ever try, but damn does it seem like a fun idea now!' were Jack's last thoughts before surging forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lilith, surprised by the sudden action, catches herself from falling over as Jack leaped forward after rapidly stopping his previous actions. Jack reaches forward and grips Lilith's hips tightly, and without thinking starts to lick and kiss all over Lilith's cock, cooing and mewling at random intervals. Shocked at the complete change in attitude that she can recall (from the bodies memories she currently inhabited) of Jack's aversion to such things, Lilith merely grins and enjoys the sensations that wash over her, as Jack increases his actions by removing one hand from Lilith's hips, and placing it on her balls, gently massaging them while still peppering her cock with kisses and licks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally tired of the teasing, Lilith taps Jack on the head lightly, getting attention, and silently beckons him to move on. Getting the message, Jack smiles widely, before proceeding to place the tip of Lilith's pulsing member into his mouth, and then slowly insert it, before stopping and sucking on it like a lollipop, earning a loud groan of pleasure from Lilith. Overjoyed at the response, Jack continues to tease Lilith, while removing his hand from her balls, and placing it back to work on his pussy and clit, and continues to gently suck while moving slowly, a few centimeters at a time, before hearing a loud growl emanate from Lilith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Stop the teasing before I take my pleasure from you instead of helping you 'Lilith'! \" Lilith growls out, deciding to remind Jack of their slightly reverse positions. Indeed, if Jack had been coherent, he could have ignored the minor compulsion that being \"Lilith the Succubus\" entailed (minor for him since it was watered down without the soul strengthening the effect). Instead, Jack rapidly changes track and thrust his mouth forward, before pulling back and thrusting forward again, effectively fucking his mouth on the surprised and unmoving Lilith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0'Oh, I forgot that he needs willpower to fight my body's curse, though lucky for him my soul isn't there to fulfill the complete effects. Guess I'll enjoy this while it lasts, as well as warn him later about not letting it happen if possible - OH!' Lilith muses to herself, surprised by her offhand demand garnering instant results before recalling that she had only just warned Jack on her condition, but not on how to fight it, before she feels her body tense up and cum unexpectedly. Drawn out of her thoughts, Lilith realizes that she was howling in pleasure and her body had apparently moved on its own, as Jack was shoved roughly to her pelvis, deepthroating her and accepting her load as rope after rope was shot down his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally finished, Lilith feels her legs about to buckle before she notices that Jack had sprung to action after disengaging his mouth from her surprisingly still hard cock. Slightly confused, and feeling like a hazy memory of knowing the why, but it not being recognized flitting through her slightly disjointed thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Now, onto the main event!\" Jack shouts excitedly, with a tinge of madness in his voice, alerting Lilith to the fact that he was two steps shy of entering a frenzy attack. Cursing, Lilith realizes that she should have tried to help Jack sooner, as now she was going to be in for a long night that would quickly change from pleasure to pain, as Jack was not going to stop until he felt reasonably sated!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just as she finishes her realization, she finds herself lifted into the air, and thrown onto a hastily conjured bed, and moments later mounted and sheathed inside Jack, who seems to be acting without thought, acting on base instinct and desire. For the first time feeling fear in centuries, Lilith lets out a whimper at the fact that not only will the sex be awesome, but she's going to be drained tomorrow for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All thought is driven from her mind, as Jack starts to use all the tricks she knew and had used in her entire time as a Succubus, drawing out moans and groans of pleasure from Lilith, as well as ripping many orgasms from her body, the only thing actually saving her from an accidental death being the Bond of the Book that tied them together, as well as the fact that she could somewhat sustain the pace by spending her current reserves to keep up. She knew that she could honestly give into the blissful sleep that was promised after so many orgasms had been pulled from her, but if she fell now, then Jack would continue on in his frenzy, targeting others, and potentially harming or killing someone he would not wish to, hence her spending her now dwindling energy, and hoping that she could last until Jack felt sated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Two hours go by before Jack slows down, merely going through the motions, until finally he collapses upon Lilith, whose barely hanging on herself, as she had lost count of how many times she had cum. Just as Jack started to fall into sleep, she heard a mumbled \"Thank you, sorry\" slip out between one breath and the next, which turned into a light snore as Jack buried his head into Lilith's sweat drenched chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Relieved that she had succeeded in keeping Jack from harming anyone in his frenzied state, Lilith felt the grips of Morpheus finally grab her, but feels it prudent to cast one last spell, instantly knocking herself out in doing so, but feeling satisfied that she had accomplished her goal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack wakes up first, feeling extremely sore, but also blissfully relaxed, so much so that he nearly falls asleep again, but has a nagging feeling that something is different. Shifting around slightly, Jack first realizes that his bed feels different, warmer beneath him than he could ever recall it being, while also wondering where his blankets were, as a pleasant chill could be felt upon the rest of his body not currently pressed into his extremely warm bed. Groaning, and cracking an eye open, closing it after a moment, then snapping both eyes open, Jack sees that he's not in his room. Shifting around, Jack inspects the room, slowly calming down and realizing that he's in the basement, but is baffled as to why. Moments of trying to remember rewards him with some of the previous nights events, though some of it seems blurry, as if he had drank enough alcohol to get smashed and black out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Focusing on what he could recall, Jack retraces his steps, and starts from where he had accidentally found the Book. From there, Jack recalls the crazy night that led to him meeting a Succubus, as well as random encounters with people he knew acting strange, and then finally deciding to cast a spell on himself and Lilith, but then his memory starts to blur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking a deep breath, and realizing that it felt different than normal, Jack finally looks down, and realizes what must have come next after his memory starts to blur, as he sees his body beneath him, sleeping heavily, looking quite pale and exhausted. Seeing his body sparks some more memories, and Jack recalls that he had taken Lilith's advice on casting, and tried a Soul-swap spell, but after succeeding in casting, had lost control over his newly increased Libido. At that point, Jack feels his head start to pound, and quietly moans from the intense pressure he feels when trying to recall what happened after the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Deciding to shift into a more comfortable position, Jack starts to try rolling onto his side, and off Lilith, when he notices that something very stiff and rigid is currently in his vagina, and the movement sends a tingle through his body. Shocked that he had apparently slept with Lilith in more than one way, Jack unconsciously clenches his inner muscles around Lilith's member, but instead of hearing a groan of pleasure, hears a hiss of pain. Confused, Jack looks up and sees Lilith's face in a rictus of pain, instead of pleasure, and concludes that maybe she's sore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feeling guilty about unintentionally causing her pain, Jack carefully extracts himself, and quietly moves to the edge of the bed, and ponders what to do, as any pleasant feelings he woke up with have been washed away with worry and confusion. While guessing that something had happened to cause the memory blank, Jack could also sense that the results left him feeling extremely rested, almost energetic, though as that thought passes through his mind, 'his' bodies memories supply that large consumptions of cum refill a Succubi's energy reserves, and excess is channeled into the body itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Slightly curious about the sudden insight into his current state, Jack ponders if this is what Lilith meant about the body retaining memories, before he starts to wonder if he could recall last night with this, or if he should just wait for Lilith to wake up, and get her input.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack decides...<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

If you told me what you wished done, I might be able to help you with your plan Master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Ruminating on his plan, and the possibility of it working, Jack was willing to take a 'Nerf' to the experience, since his idea would both fulfill Lilith's wish for something interesting, while also still helping you get closer to reading new spells.

But to answer your implied question, the method to help you with your astral problem, would be you possessing my body, and I help you go through the motions to help you cast the 'Linking spell'. The reason you won't be able to cast it after i help you, is similar to your Dungeon and Dragon rules about casting magics, at least in this case. With me helping to impart the knowledge, you would have one 'cast' of it, and would then forget how to do so, until you learned from the Book yourself,\" Lilith explains, stopping her ministrations and sitting up, but not before pulling her hand out and licking it clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shuddering from Lilith's antics, and forcing himself to focus on what she has explained, Jack staves off touching his painful erection.

You'll get to know her <i>very</i> well over the next few days...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack blushed a little. Was this the right choice? He chose Sarah because he wanted someone he was comfortable with. It would be too weird using his family or Kelly as guinea pigs, and it didn't feel right just picking a random person. Lilith, not wasting any time, grabbed his hand and pulled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Jack felt then was jarring. He watched as his body slumped over, him separate from it. He looked down at himself to see a pale copy of what was once his body... \"What the hell?\" He cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Master. I'll take your soul in my body and cast the link spell now.\" Lilith calmed him down, then pulled him into her. Jack felt himself fade... and then he couldn't feel anything. He could see and hear, but that was probably through Lilith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, this is normal.\" Lilith continued, then chanted something else, causing the world around Jack to ripple. Flashes of various places appeared and disappeared, until finally they emerged into somewhere that didn't flicker or fade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here\". Lilith said. Jack looked around and saw the school gym, Sarah standing on the volleyball court in her sports uniform. She was leaning forward, giving Jack a nice view of her legs and ass through her short shorts. \"Found her! Now shall we have some fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith went over the instructions with Jack to perform the link spell. All he had to do was repeat after her, while thinking of Sarah. The words were alien to Jack, but after he chanted them he felt a pull towards Sarah. Next thing he knew, he was back in a world of vibrant senses and feeling. He had succeeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack marvelled at Sarah's skill as he felt her move around and hit the ball. He barely noticed anything weird other than her hair in her face, and sweat that sometimes dripped down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you're ready for part two, Master, just concentrate really hard.\" Lilith's voice echoed, further away than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the minutes on the timer counted down and Sarah rotated to the back of the court, Jack decided to take his power to the test. He focused hard, and felt an intense spike of pleasure strike through his nethers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\" Sarah whispered, going red as she no doubt also felt it. Jack pushed harder, having enjoyed the feeling. Sarah, distracted, got hit in the head with a volleyball, screamed, and collapsed in tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\" Jack's turn. He abstained from pushing any more buttons for now. Sarah, calmed down, retreated alone to the changerooms. Now this was a better opportunity. He felt everything as she unpacked her bag, peeled off her sweaty gym clothes, and stepped naked into the shower. This was amazing for Jack... as well as a massive tease. Here he was, riding in the sexy naked body of his crush, and he couldn't even look. The warm water tickled as it ran down Sarah's bare breasts, causing Jack to involuntarily make her orgasm. This time, she reacted differently. She still blushed, but her hand down and massaged her pussy. Jack stared through her eyes as she looked down at her own body, one hand square between her tits, the other slowly and deliberately caressing her snatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack pushed harder, causing the most powerful orgasm he had felt so far. Sarah's knees buckled as she let out a moan, hand becoming more frantic as she toyed with her clit. Jack could feel everything as if it was himself. A hand, nestled tight between Sarah's breasts. Another hand, expertly teasing her pussy. Nethers that felt very different, eliciting feelings Jack hadn't ever felt before. He willed another orgasm to Sarah's body, causing her to moan again, and him to temporarily black out. Was that the spell? Or her body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndulging in the feelings of Sarah masturbating, Jack felt his vision blur. So he <i>was</i> fading. One more, then. He focused one more time, reeling from the pleasure, as Sarah let out a small cry as the latest orgasm struck her. This time, all of Jack's senses faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe awoke again in his own body, on his bed, with a large stain on his pants. Lilith stood over him with a very pleased expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back, Master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt occurred to Jack he was not actually that tired, and greedily looked for the book to learn more spells. Or maybe he could ask Lilith to go drop him back in Sarah's world?</span></div></div>",

Picking up the book, Jack starts to thumb through the pages, glancing at the spell titles, hoping that something interesting catches his attention. Minutes after searching, Jack notices that he's slowly having trouble reading some parts of the pages now. Pausing, he notices that he's now about a third of the way through the book now. Startled, Jack looks up from the book, and searches his surroundings for Lilith, who he now realizes has been silent since returning from their previous fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0A succubus-less room is all the greets Jack's gaze, sparking a curiosity in what she could be up to now. Wondering if he should bother her right this moment, or let her get into possible mischief and continue studying in relative peace, Jack mentally debates which option is better. His previous curiosity wins out, and Jack goes back to inspecting the pages of the book, now noticing that he had overlooked the margins of pages, which seemed to be crammed in tiny scrawl, with notes and possible warnings about what previous owners had to 'say'. So engrossed in his study, Jack didn't notice a slight tingle flow through his body, as if something had been altered minutely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Unbeknownst to Jack, Lilith decided to prank Jack in a similar manner to their earlier activity. Quietly teleporting back to Sarah, who had just woken up exhausted but extremely content from her spontaneous arousal and masturbation session her earlier, getting dressed and into bed with a book, apparently getting ready to relax before sleeping. Casting the 'linkage' magic from before on Sarah, as the sender, but altering it to be a slow connecting effect instead of the instant use from before. After feeling the spell take hold, Lilith casts one more spell, a slow-burn Lust increasing spell, that would start off subtle, and over time drive the target to nearly insane levels of arousal, if certain precautions weren't set into the spell that is. Her work on this end done, Lilith then silently and invisibly reverse summons herself to her Master's side. Seeing that he's just noticed she's been gone, and deciding to back to the book, Lilith strikes. Casting the receiving tether to Jack while he's engrossed in the book, Lilith also gets the mischievous inspiration to cast an enhanced sensation spell with a delayed effect, drastically increasing the sensations the target will receive for the duration of the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her prank set up, all conditions set for her entertainment, Lilith decides to find somewhere comfortable and out of the way to enjoy the upcoming show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0After another ten minutes of trying to find what spells he wanted to combine, and wondering if he really should have called Lilith back for advice, or at least to see if any of his ideas were feasible, Jack is suddenly struck by a burning yet pleasant sensation on his chest. Confused, and for some reason aroused, Jack pulls his shirt off, and looks at his now naked torso. After getting a look at it, Jack jumps, as a phantom hand seems to have squeezed his chest, causing him to gasp out in shock and pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Somewhat puzzled, but also starting to think he was right about Lilith's silence leading up to mischief, Jack is assaulted by intense sensations of a hand groping what feels like a boob....that he doesn't have, but the sensation is still there, extremely arousing and stimulating. While distracted by the quandary of phantom touches on non-existent boobs, Jack is taken again by surprise, as a feeling of fingers seems to push in right where his groin is. Attention immediately drawn from his mystery boobs, Jack falls back on his bed, dropping the book to the floor while moaning out loudly, trying to undo his pants in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Getting his pants and boxers off, Jack is greeted to his fully erect member, but the phantom fingers are just that, phantom. Taking a deep breath to try to puzzle out what Lilith has done, Jack fails to get much of one, as he let's out a loud shout of \"Ahh fuck!\" and cums all over his sheets. The sudden stop of the phantom hands makes Jack assume it's over, but is quickly corrected on that false assumption. The sensations from before quickly return, almost twice as strong, and Jack's tool aches from the instant hardness it becomes from the sudden assault after it's previous actions. Whimpering from the sudden pain, Jack is unprepared for the feeling of another orgasm, as well as the feeling of what is impossibly 'his' clit being pinched while 'his' nipple is pinched and pulled roughly. Crying out in pain and extreme pleasure, Jack passes out in a pool of his own juices, cursing, and silently thanking, Lilith's apparent actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Waking up, clean but still naked, Jack notices a note on his chest, and then recalls what caused him to pass out. Shuddering, from either the pleasure or the loss of control he doesn't know, Jack reads the note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well Master, since you decided to go back to the book, instead of having more fun, I thought you might enjoy the distraction i arranged for you. Some in this day and age apparently like the phrase 'do unto others', so i thought i would allow Sarah (unknowingly) to share with you what you did 'for' her earlier. Hope you enjoyed the break, and experience! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0On another note, I do have to congratulate your previous idea master, it helped you skip the tediousness of learning the beginner level spells, and put you just under the start of intermediate. So far it looks like you can read one spell from intermediate, which is nice, but you won't progress any farther without either more casting, or more experiences gained through energy expending activities. Whatever the case, hope you learned a lesson out of all this - Lilith.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Yeah, don't leave a succubus to her own devices, especially if your new to your powers, \" Jack mutters, bemused by his succubus' antics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stretching out, Jack stands up from his bed, then looks around for the book, and sees it on his desk. Walking over, Jack picks up the book, and turns it to a page that seems to have a bookmark sticking out. Reading the page, Jack doesn't know whether to laugh or groan, as apparently the Intermediate spell he can read is Astral Projection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sighing at the irony of that, jack decides to...</span></span></div></div>",

Slowly, Christina's eyes turned from blue to brown, and all the wrinkles in her face starting to disappear into soft, smooth teenage skin.

There's no chance that some demon, some sexy and friendly demon who wants to serve you more than anything else will just come up from a book and suddenly transforms herself into anybody you want to bang. Being an early bird person, the first thing Jack does when he wakes up is opening his window, feeling the breeze from the outside to bring his eyes to open widely. \"Damn that dream is wild.\", Jack mutters to himself. I must've had another wet dream again, he thinks as he feels some sore in his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then walks into the bathroom for a wee, perhaps also for a shower. His plan today is to do his 20-page Health homework about insulins, which could take all day long given his tendencies for some good-old-procrastination. That kind of soreness is not pretty comfortable for sitting in front of his laptop typing lots of health mumbo-jumbo. Jack, still feeling pretty groggy, walks into the bathroom just outside his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Master, how was your sleep ? I bet you have a hard time sorting out your little brother after our wonderful time last night.\" Lilith said, in her original form. She stands in front of the mirror, wearing a Patriots T-shirt just like the one Jack had inside his wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that's not a dream. It's a real thing. I really am having sex with a demon, a sexy and friendly demon who wants to serve you more than anything else which just come up from a book and suddenly transforms herself into anybody you want to bang. And now she's standing right in front of you, that hot and smoking body, wearing the shirt of the team you idolized. It's as real as it gets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm not dreaming....you really are real, eh ?\" Jack said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am, Master. I am yours, for now and forever.\", Lilith said with a very loving voice. \"What shall we do now to brighten your morning, Master ? We can pick up what we left off last night, or we could do something more interesting....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack gulps at a thought of repeating all of the craziness he experienced yesterday. \"Sorry, Lilith. I have this homework and while you've been very...helpful, I gotta take care of this for tomorrow's school.\" Jack said. Lilith looks disappointed at this, but she immediately shrugs it off and hugs Jack from behind. \"Don't worry, my master. While being a succubus, I know when to please my master and when I leave you alone. Just be prepared for more surprises that I will give you today...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh boy. Now what ?</span></div></div>",

His house is in countryside area, not a lot of tall buildings and cars driving around. Just a lot of other houses and some mini-market here and there along the road. Jack, when he's not on school, likes to walk around the neighborhood. He always said he does that to 'maintain his level of fitness', although he actually just wants to look at his female neighbor jogging around. Still, he thinks it gives him some benefits though, because by doing this he gets to interact with a lot of people, mostly with kids. He first met Sarah this way actually, when he meets her at the nearby lake. He visits the lake often to daydream about him and Sarah together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, there's nobody around the lake. Perfect time to just lie down, forgetting all about that 20-page homework, he thinks. He sits at a bench overlooking the lake, while throwing some rocks into the water. He's not throwing it far though, because he once threw a big rock strongly and ended up injuring his elbow. He can spend hours at this lake doing absolutely nothing, because it allows him to think about all the things in the world, including some nasty thoughts about any women who happens to pass him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after he finished throwing the rock he held in his hands, he sees a woman, jogging near the entrance of the lake. She wears a black jumper while holding a smartphone, probably some running app, he thought. When she comes closer, he knows her: it's Angela, the 25-year-old pharmacist from the nearby hospital. While her figures are not that sexy, just a B-cup hanging from her chest, she has a pretty attractive Asian face, which a lot of his neighbor likes. She always talks politely with others, making her very likable. Mostly anyone will prolong their drug counseling sessions just so they can be with her longer. Bad news is, last thing Jack heard, she has a boyfriend who works outside the town, but since he never shows up in the hospital, nobody knows what he's like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely though, when she's jogging near the bench that Jack sits on, she suddenly stops, as if she's forgetting something. Her eyes are looking blank, unfocused. She looks at the ground as if there are a book opened below her. Having noticed this, Jack comes to her and said, \"Hey Angela, you all right ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela suddenly wakes up from her 'hypnotized state' and approaches Jack with her gaze is focused solely on Jack's. She walks towards him slowly until she stands directly in front of him. \"What's up, actually ? You're not feeling well ?\" Jack asks again, definitely something's wrong with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd without any warning, Angela planted her lips on Jack, passionately kissed him and rubbing her face on Jack's. Stunned by what happened, Jack just can't figure out what to do besides standing still and wondering why this lovely lady somehow having an orgasm beside a lake. He then just kisses back, totally ignoring anything that might happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 seconds after that wonderful kiss, Angela shows her bright smile and said, \"I should go now.\", while continues her jogging and just keeps going like nothing happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the....\" Jack mutters, definitely still trying to figure out what's going on. And then, the answer comes from behind him, \"Enjoying your walk, Master ?\" Lilith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack then...</span></div></div>",

But it makes his morning though, because actually it's something he wanted in his teen age : some random hot girl just kissed him and then leaves. Then again, what kind of men who didn't ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, master, I believe you need to go home, because I think it's time for you to know your way around the book. The power that dwells within it is unimaginable, which can blow your mind, quite literally and figuratively.\" Lilith said. She's right actually, Jack thought, I haven't spend a lot of time with that book. Who knows anything else I can do with that book ? But then, the thought of 20-page homework just sinks in and just kills his excitement about the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can it wait till later ? You know I need to finish that paper...\" As insane his new toy is, he know that he still needs to do all of his chores, responsibilities, and tasks. Turns out Jack's still putting his 'normal' side of his life for priority. \"It's not that you're gonna disappear the next morning, right ?\" Jack asks to Lilith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, my master. I am bound to you as long as you live. I understand though that you still can't keep your mind off that task of yours.\" Lilith replies. \"I will arrange 'something' to make sure it is done as soon as possible. Right now, please just go home, or maybe I can give you another morning surprises until you get out of here....\". She starts to flick around his left hand, while slowly transforming herself from bottom to top. Her jeans turns into something black, some sort of running trousers, and her shirt is turning into a jumper. Her body becomes smaller and looks wet because of sweat. She's now a perfect copy of Angela, the woman who kissed him earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...\" Jack just gulps at this sight. A normal Angela is hot enough, and now with her entire body soaked, she is even hotter than ever. He's really having a hard time to hold his urges to plant his lips on hers right now, but being held back by the sun starting to shine around the lake, he backs off. He's not gonna kiss someone publicly in the morning. \"Fine, you won. Let's get back home...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith then holds Jack's right shoulder, when suddenly without any warning, he is immediately back to his room, sitting in his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, master, the book you possess right now, is made by Agrael, the ancient Demon Lord who once ruled a kingdom here on Earth. Before his death, he transferred all of his power to this book, hoping for someone to continue his legacy in the future. I was created to guide anyone who have the book to use it, while serving him or her along the process.\" Lilith explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack, still feeling pretty groggy because of the teleportation, can't really understand what she said, so he just nods and says \"Uh uh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not everyone can actually 'activates' this book. Only someone from the Demon Lord's heritage can harness his power, and he or she must be born in the date when this book is created. And right now, that someone is you, master.\" Lilith continues. This explanation only makes Jack more confused, and the only thing in his mind is, what can be more silly than that ? And when can I start doing that paper ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're still distracted, Master. Very well, I think she's arrived. Why don't you welcome her in ?\" Lilith suddenly suggests. And she's right: just seconds later, someone knocks the door. Turns out, she is....</span></div></div>",

She displays a wide smile, and her eyes are looking very bright, as if some child is giving their first handiwork to their parents. She wears a shirt from an event in her hospital and a black jeans. Judging by her very refreshing vanilla-scented perfume, clearly she's already cleaned herself up from the sweats she got from earlier. Jack's Sunday just getting better and better, for all the right reasons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...thanks ? What's in it ?\" Jack asks, still can't figure out what's happening. He just walks down the stairs to welcome a guest, and suddenly that guest, an ever-charming guest, gives him a CD. Not that he didn't want it, of course, but since she just kissed him just around 10 minutes past, then magically transported back to his house, then gets a lecture about some powerful magic guy, then finally saw the woman again knocking on his door. Human brain is wonderful, but anything more than that may make them explode. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just some documents to help you on your homework. Can I come in ? I want to show you what's in it.\" Angela replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, umm, yeah, sure. Sure, come in. My room's upstairs, I haven't started working on it, actually, so....\", Jack said, and then with some pause, he continues, \"Wait a minute, how do you know I had a homework ? Not that I announced to the whole world that I have a homework....\". \"Or maybe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Master, I've figured you've met Angela.\" Lilith suddenly said from behind him. Of course, who else ? Jack thought. Lilith's arrival makes Angela stands still, as if she's a statue. Her gaze is empty, and besides breathing, there's literally no movement from her. \"When we met her earlier, I had a sneak peek through her mind, and turns out, she's working on a project that has the same topic that you're concerned with. So I guess she can help you with your homework...\" She said while caressing Angela's face softly, and then hugs her from behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know what to say actually...thanks Lilith. I still wonder though, if you can came up with this, why not just magically creates the homework and puff, it's done ?\" Jack said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't do that, Master. When we first linked together, the only knowledge of this present world comes from you, that's why I speak like modern-day people and not like ancient people. If you don't know something, then I also wouldn't have any idea about it.\" Lilith replied. She then weaves her hand to Angela, and Angela suddenly she snaps back to life, showing her smile and bright look again. \"So...let's get it done now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack then shows the way to his room, and unexpectedly, Angela holds his hand tightly and places her head on his shoulder, as if they're dating and having a fun walk together. Jack stops and gives a strange look at her, and she simply just said, \"Come on, what are you waiting for ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like Lilith's mojo turns her into a very lovable woman...very lovable indeed. His brain is chugged full of happiness right now....</span></div></div>",

It contains tons of scientific journals, research papers, medical mumbo-jumbo, and chemical structures that maybe only professors can distinguish between any of them. \"Oh God, what am I supposed to do with this shit....\" Jack is having a hard time sorting all of that information to even start doing that homework. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need some help, Master ?\" Angela asks politely. She clearly haven't realized that she's bringing a Ph.D stuff to a high-schooler. \"Yeah, I might have to do some presentation of this to my teacher and classmate. I'm gonna be killed if I don't know a single thing I say...\" Jack replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, let me work on it for you then. I'm sure you have some business to do with the book...\" Angela offers her help, while kissing Jack on his left cheek. She then just proceeds to open the word processor and starts to open all of her documents that a normal human being wouldn't understand. After just watching from behind, Jack noticed that Angela actually makes all of this science mumbo-jumbo into a friendly and easy-to-understand language, while still giving out the point of the information. Any guy who gets to be with her is one hell of a lucky guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you are, actually, Master. Now come over here and let our new friend do her job.\" Lilith said. It actually kind of sucks if someone can read your mind all the time, but why bother ? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lots of spells are in this book. Some of them contains destructive spells, such as this,\" Lilith said while creating a small blazing fire from her hand, \"...or this...\", now an electric spark replaces the fire in her hands, \"....or maybe this.\", and then four small icicles are floating above her hands. Those things are very cool, Jack thinks, instead of CGI tricks he saw in the movies, he actually saw a real one right in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But those spells can be powerful only if you have an intent to kill someone or destroy something. The spellpower depends on the user, and since you, Master, are not the one who likes to do harm to others but simply to be good to anybody, I think this part of the book will suits you more.\" Lilith continues, while magically turns out the page from the book into somewhere in the middle part. \"Charms and Illusions, where you can control the mind and the soul of a human being.\" Jack feels that he knows where this thing will go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what you did with Angela here.\" Jack said. \"Exactly, Master. But this particular spell I used on her needs a lot of power, because I don't know if you have noticed, but even though she will do anything you asked, she still retains her personality, her traits, her way of thinking, and a lot more. What I've done is putting my essence inside her soul, without corrupting her mind. So she's still what she is, not just a puppet waiting for orders.\" Lilith explains. Wow, I thought it's pretty simple, Jack thinks, turns out it's a high-level spell. \"Wait, didn't she goes blank and silent couple of times earlier ? Didn't that makes her a puppet like you said ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is because I am weak, Master. Sometimes I lose my grip on her, so in order to maintain control, I had to force her entire mind to do my bidding. By doing that, I lose all the potential in her mind and I can only physically move her around.\" Lilith said. \"But you are not. You ARE strong, and thus can do anything this book have. It's just a matter of practice and experience.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, I think this, umm...lesson is dragging too long. What if we start practicing this stuff ?\" Jack finally suggests. He starts to get bored with her explanation, and having his homework is being done, he itches to do something interesting. \"Okay then, Master. Let's come out of the room.\" Lilith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey leave the room with Angela inside, still focused in the computer working on the homework. Jack's room is upstairs near the attic, and he sets up a soundproof wallpaper around his room so that he can play music loudly without anyone protesting. It is pretty useful right now, because that means nobody can hear anything when he's talking with Lilith all this time. On his way out, he saw Jenny downstairs, probably heading out to hang out with her friends, leaving him alone in the house, because it turns out all of his other family is gone too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Read these incantations in your mind and think about someone.\" Lilith said, and so Jack did. The incantation is written in latin, an old latin because he never sees it before. But strangely, he know what it roughly means, the incantation simply said that '<i>If the mind believes something is real then it is real in every sense of the word - except that it still may not have physical form</i>.' He didn't think about it too much though, because he still wondering who's the person to think about. He then just picks Jenny because he saw her just now, and, being a naughty boy sometimes, he pictures her naked in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, something appears slowly in front of him. It slowly shows some white skin, a regular and fit body, and a brown long hair. Then another body parts begin to detail, as it begins to form a woman, with a breast forming on the chest and freckles coming all over her body. Finally, her facial features starting to come clear, slowly turns into someone he knows, his sister Jenny. He has created a clone of his older sister, naked older sister, in front of him, in just a matter of seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clone just stands still without doing anything, probably not even breathing, as if she's a statue made of meat and flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, Master. This is your first spell, the spell of mirror image.\" Lilith said from behind him. \"This spell will last for about a few minutes because this is your first time, but with time, it can be there for as long as you like.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, it's wonderful...\" Jack said while checking on his newly made clone of his sister. \"Really wonderful.\" He then just squeezing every part of the clone, from her cheek, her breasts, and rubbing his hands all over her body too. He even tries to plant his lips on the clone, but the moment he moves his head closer to hers, the clone suddenly disappears into thin air, leaving no trace at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly after the clone disappears, Jack is feeling dizzy. What is happening again to him now....  </span></div></div>",

Jack then just falls flat on his back, struggling to even move around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that, Master, is what happen when you overuse your power.\" Lilith said. She then just picks up Jack, being a supernatural creature, she does it with ease, and carries him back to his room. \"Every person has a limit to their powers : yours, since you just discovered it, is pretty low. And to add to it, that illusion spell actually drains a lot from your power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, why didn't you tell me before ? My body doesn't feel so good right now...\" Jack said. As Lilith carries him in her arms, he remembers when he got an infection earlier in his childhood, which forced him to be kept for two weeks in hospital. He didn't got any fever now, but the weakness he felt is pretty much the same. \"Am I gonna be like this every time if I cast something ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith just smiles. \"Don't worry Master, your power will increase over time. Just more practice here and there and you'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey entered the room in a matter of seconds. As Lilith puts Jack carefully on his bed, he saw Angela in his room, browsing some blog about fashion and so on. It seems that she's done with the homework already, which really proves what her brain is capable of. It only takes about half an hour since she starts ! If Jack does it all on his own, maybe he'll need half a day to do it. At least it gives him some relief knowing his homework is done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only way to, say, recharge your magical power is simple : happiness. Just give yourself some entertainment or something enjoyable and you'll fit enough to do another spell.\" Lilith said, while slowly closing in on him. \"And that, is what succubus are more than capable to do.\" Oh no, now we're gonna having 'fun' again. \"Sorry, Lil, but I can't really do anything right now. Maybe later...\" He really feel exhausted, and just don't want to do anything beside not doing anything for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, Master, which is why you DON'T have to do anything. We'll see what our pharmacist can do beside studying drugs....\" Lilith said. She then approaches Angela from behind, and transforms herself to a thick, black smoke, slowly from her legs until her head also turns into smoke. That cloud of smoke then circles Angela from above for a moment, before shooting itself inside Angela's unknowing mouth. From his bed, Jack just hears Angela gasping for air until the smoke completely gone inside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparking a red glowing iris from her eyes, Angela rose up from the chair and walks slowly while taking off her t-shirt, displaying her breast covered inside her bra. \"Don't worry Jack, we're gonna fill your energy in no time.\" She then takes off Jack's trousers and underwear, showing a standing cock, armed and ready for attack. \"But first, we're gonna make you fill us with something....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================================================ <br>\r\nPS : First of all, happy new year everyone, I hope you'll have a blast in 2015. It's great to be back writing here, and I hope all of you can enjoy my works. Now, on to matters more serious, you may noticed that I never wrote any sex scene here, even though this interactive is an \"Erotica\". Not being a native English speaker, I find it difficult to describe the experience I want to show in some words. If you happen to read these stories and actually wants to add some sex scene for Jack and all of the future love interest if him, don't hesitate to send me a message about the sex stories you want to add ! I'll edit it and puts it inside the stories to come. Thanks again !<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Please just let me take a break....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith sweats flowing freely and bits of cum dripping in his thigh, Jack is really done. After a very exhausting spellcasting session, a woman does all she can to, say, impregnate herself. She thrusts her lady parts wildly into Jack's 'manly' parts while continously rubbing and touching all of his body, as if she was a sex predator, or perhaps, a sex demon. Well, she is anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that, Master...\" Angela/Lilith said seductively. \"Well, I think I should give you your well-earned rest. In the meantime...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela then strangely stops talking. She stood still, not wearing anything after the last sex encounter while not making any move, and it seems that she's not breathing either. She just stares emptily at the wall behind Jack, ignoring anything around her. \"Hey, Lilith, you okay ?\" Jack asks. It's hard to know whether something like this is normal or not, even in the craziness of this book and anything inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, all of a sudden, Angela starts to open her mouth slowly, and the same black smoke that possessed her earlier appears to come out from her mouth. The smoke crawls out of Angela's body, and making it's way to the hole in the attic. The process takes a while, as if a factory is running a large scale productions inside her body. When the final smoke comes out of Angela's body, she then just fell over to Jack in his bed, completely naked and powerless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey, you alright ?\" Jack still confused at what happens. It looks like Lilith had de-possessed Angela, but because Lilith's nowhere to be seen, he's not sure whether the Angela that is on top of his body is the same as the one who do his homework. If she's completely normal, then Jack is really screwed : he's naked with a woman who he doesn't really know, and that woman doesn't know him either, perfect formula for a rape scene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela then starts to open his eyes slowly, and mutters,\"Oh, my head....What was just happened ?\" Damn it, damn it, damn it. Jack can only make those two words in his mind right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's you, Jack. I think I must've dozed off while using the computer.\" Angela said. She said it calmly, ignoring the fact that she's in bed naked with a naked guy. \"Well, I think I should go home, I have a lot to prepare tomorrow !\" She rises and picks her cloth, which are scattered in Jack's room because of the wild session earlier. Thank God she's still the same, Jack thinks. He forget that the spell Lilith casts on her is pretty much permanent, she basically planted part of herself inside Angela.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...Angela ?\" Jack said. From his bed, watching Angela wearing her clothes, she just looks mesmerizing. Even though she's not actually the sexiest woman on earth, or the prettiest woman either (that category still falls to Sarah), she's just...nice. Her smile, her original smile, free from Lilith's sexual lust, shines bright on the lovely sunday morning. He didn't know what pushes him to say what he's going to say next, but the words just formed by itself. \"You're very pretty, and you're very kind....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, that's very sweet of you, Jack.\" Angela replied, while hugging Jack sincerely. \"Gotta go now. See you later ! Lock the door after I'm gone, alright ? I don't want to get you out of your bed, you look really wasted ! Hehe.\" She then walks out of Jack's room, walking down the stairs and then closing the front door after she leaves the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe always want to say that for a while, but he really doesn't have the courage to do it. Now, ever since he found that book, he feels doubt is slowly flying away from his mind. And she's under a spell, which is a really big help for any shy guy. He then smiles at his newfound confidence, while thinking what to do next....</span></div></div>",

He didn't really understands the languages in this chapter, maybe because of he, like Lilith said, is not 'suited' to chaos spells. But the pages contains some illustrations, which really looks like old european paintings. Some of them depicts a wizard or some kind conjuring fires from his hand, and some other just depicts some random things which Jack don't really understand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't cast any spells yet, my friendly succubi companion is gone, and I'm all alone in the house in the night. What a way to close this day...\" Jack mumbles in his mind. After Angela leaves his house, Lilith is also nowhere to be seen. Not that he wants to meddle in someone else's business, Jack thinks, but after all those strange things, surely she can't be gone all of a sudden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSleepiness again hits Jack, and he thinks it's time to close the day for good. He then gets up to pick up a bookmark from his work desk and stick them to the Chaos chapter because he wants to read it again tomorrow. But then, while bringing the book to the desk, an electrical cable trips him down. He fell down hard to the floor with the book still in his hand, and in the same time he hears something ripped, like a paper torn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe accidentally rips off the entire Chaos chapter from the book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit.\" Jack said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after the pages splits off from the book, a shining light is emanating from the book. The bright light slowly turns red, like sparks from a firework. The sparks then just blasted outside Jack's room like a laser gun, leaving nothing behind without any marks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happened ? Oh shit oh shit...\" Jack said. He really screwed up big time, he think. Moments later, Lilith appears behind him, bringing a bad news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, you've just.....\" Lilith said slowly. She looks calm as usual, but it seems that she just experience something really strange. Even with her standards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've just what ? Oh man...it's really bad, isn't it?\" Jack replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've just released Chaos into this world.\" Lilith said. \"The souls of Chaos, roaming the earth....It's the history repeating itself.\" Jack sits confused, and added with that fall recently, makes it worse. \"Let me tell you what happened long ago, Master....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Alex and Kelly, Jack's friend, is hanging out near a fireplace in Kelly's home. Her home is not that big, but it has a lot of expensive electronic stuff, from a very large television, high-end computer, and lots of wireless stuff. The fireplace didn't really fit into those electronic device, but since the design of the building is always like that, the family decides to keep it. It's a pretty cold night, a thing that is common throughout Lakewood, so fireplace or heating device really comes in handy for every household. They were talking about the janitor in the school, who confiscates Kelly's brand-new cellphone because she's caught using it in the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try to talk to Mr. Fred tomorrow, hopefully I can get that sweet thing for you babe. hehe\" Alex said while holding Kelly's hands. \"It's pretty late, I should get back to my home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks hun. You're so sweeeet...\" Kelly said while pinching Alex's thumb. \"Ow, that hurts ! \" Alex said happily while walking out the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye ! Don't be late tomorrow, okay ?\" Kelly said. Alex just winks while he slowly disappeared from her sights. Kelly decides to hang around the garden in front of her house before coming back inside. Unknowingly to her, a red firebolt is jolting above her, and blasted in the ground near where she is standing. The blast knocks Kelly unconscious, and from above, comes a red smoke that glides slowly inside her from her mouth. Seconds later, Kelly opens her eyes, not sporting the usual blue, but now sparks a bright red. A Chaos soul now lives inside a human flesh, and it is....</span></div></div>",

Each of them wanted to rule the Kingdom Of Nelthrazar or its popular name was Hell. I thought i should tell you their name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    Five Archdemon :    <br>\r\n                    1) Lord Agrael        ~ King Of Blaspheme~<br>\r\n                    2) Lady Empusa    ~ Queen Of Obscurity~<br>\r\n                    3) Lord Zelgius      ~ King Of Terror~<br>\r\n                    4) Lady Veltis         ~ Queen Of Pain~<br>\r\n                    5) Lord Belphegor ~ King Of Austere~<br>\r\n          <br>\r\n          All of them dominated different places in the Hell. Even their powers specialized in many type. They all powerful demons that reign the Kingdom Of Nelthrazar. But one day, Lord Belphegor declared war against Lord Zelgius. The situation became pandemonium as Belphegor wanted Zelgius to give his domain to him. Without thinking further, Zelgius counter the attack with his own army of demons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          The chaos and massacred blaze up across the Hell. The demons killed each other and it took a lot of lives. To prevent it became worst, Lord Agrael joined the war as the middleman. The havoc had been decreased successfully. When the Hell nearly turned into new leaf, something unexpected happened. A few of Lady Empusa's most trusted lieutenants had been killed by unknown person. She suspected Lady Veltis murdered her lieutenants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n           Again, a new conflict took place inside the Hell. This time, Empusa convinced Zelgius and Belphegor into her side. The alliance of 3 Archdemon made an uproar into Lady Veltis's domain. She fought back with all her might but the alliance too strong as Veltis can't withstand the pressure of the assault. Lady Veltis defeated in a horrific state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n           The one-on-one battle occured between Empusa and Veltis. The fight between 2 Archdemoness had torn the Hell apart. But the triumph went to Empusa. She stabbed her hand through Veltis's stomach. The satisfaction and complacency can be seen on her face. Empusa turned Veltis's body backwards. \"Now your power and body will be mine..... hahahahaha!!!!!\" She whispered to her ears. Empusa pressed her body into Veltis. \"Aaaaahhhh!!!! What are you doing, sister???  How could you do this to me??\" She ignored her words. After her body completely merged, she pressed her hands and legs into Veltis's part. She screamed in pain as her body being occupy by Empusa. Lastly, Empusa pushed her head into Veltis's head. The last screech of Queen Of Pain made the Hell trembled. The complete merge created a new form of archdemoness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n           Now, Lady Empusa became the mighty archdemon among the others. Zelgius and Belphegor kneeled down on their legs to honour the birth of new Matriarch Of Nelthrazar, Lady Empusa. The old prophecy became reality.Her appearance completely advanced and powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            The birth interrupted by Lord Agrael. He thrashed towards Zelgius and Belphegor with a hard impact. The 2 archdemons collapsed instantly. Now Agrael challenged Empusa in a new battle. Even she gained more power but she still exhausted from the previous battle. The fight took place as Agrael chanted several disastrous spells. Empusa dodged it but still unable to regain her composure. One of the attack hit her. She fell to the ground. Agrael dashed to her but she grabbed his neck. Agrael struggled to escape. Once he escaped, he attacked her in close combat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n             The battle continued until their bodies injured severely. \"Even i have new power and body, you could fight me like our strength equally matched. How you do that, Agrael??\" asked Empusa. A small grin appeared on his face. \"Heh.. to fight you it needs a lot of magic and energy if you want to know, didn't you realize what they called me?? The King Of Curse!! I have various of curses and magics that can enhance my power and attack. So, don't ever you think with your new power and body could defeat an archdemon like me... hehehehe\" he stood up and vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n              He popped out in front of her and put his hand on Empusa's body. She gasped in shock as a network of runes spread throughout her body. \"What are you doing??\" She stucked and immobilized. Agrael panting after he casted the runes. \"I think today will be our last day reigning the Kingdom Of Nelthrazar though all of us recklessly fighting each other...hehehehe\" He summoned a large tome and opened it. Agrael drew a huge pentagram with his demonic blood around the tome. \"Don't you think to seal me inside that book???.... Stop it, you scumbag!!!\" Empusa tried hard to break away but its useless. He chanted a long eccentric spells until he shouted \" Se\u00e1la!!!\" A cloud of red smoke came out from the tome and engulfed Empusa. It dragged her into the book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n               The tome closed up and sealed. Agrael enervated but he still got another two archdemons to settle down. He killed them and put Zelgius's soul inside a diabolic sword, Orenmir while Belphegor's soul was sealed inside The Scroll Of Verdict. Now, Lord Agrael reached his limit and dying. Before he died, Agrael create me, Lilith, a succubus to protect the tome. He also sealed me inside it and transcribe on the book \"Only the chosen who had demon heritage can opened this tome and obtain its power\" He put every last of his magic spells, curses, runes and others. Lastly, he died on the top of the book. </span></div></div>",

Maybe we can do it again\" Jack went to the book and closed it. \"Stop spitting such nonsense. I want to get some fresh air outside\" He rushed towards the door. \"Where are you going, sweetheart??\" asked Christine, his mother.

He stood up with his face turned red in anguish. \"How dare you disturb my family??\" A scarlet pentagram formed under his feet. He summoned the tome and opened it. A spell chanting can be heard from his mouth. Jack took out a large demon blade from the book and pointed it to the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               \"You, a low class peasant, want to challenge me?? I am Nysrogh, one of Lady Empusa's Dreadlord!!! \" You can't stand against me\". He dashed towards Jack as he in offensive position. When the dreadlord nearly approached him, Jack slashed Nysrogh's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               He fell to the ground and rolled over grievously. \"Aaaahhh.....my hand. Its burning\" The wound that been cut by the demon blade can feel the hot of Hell. Jack's anger has changed his hair from blondie to spiky red. Nysrogh tried to regain his composure and flew high to the sky. Jack casted a searing spells \"Alabaster!!!\" A huge black fire engulfed the dreadlord. Immediately, he teleported himself from been overwhelmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               Everything around Jack turned dark and silent. He collapsed after casting the spells.</span></div></div>",

He woke up and saw himself on the white bed. \"Hello, sweetie. Good morning!!\" Christine gave him a morning kiss on his cheek. Mark and Jenny were standing in front of the bed. \"Hi, Jack. Are you feel better??\" asked Jenny, his older sister. Jack remained silent as he tried to regain his composure. He turned to his side and saw Sam with her head bandaged stood beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             \"How long i have been slept??\" Christine held your shoulder. \"You have been slept for 3 days, sweetie\" Jack gasped in shock hearing the statement. \"What happened to our house??\" All of them seem down. \"It's burned completely, but don't worry. For now, we will stay at grandma house.\" A few droplets streamed down his face. \"Its all my fault.\" Christine persuade him for not blaming himself. The doctor came and examined Jack. He wanted to be alone. After the examination, all his family members left him alone except Sam. She approached Jack with her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               Suddenly, Jack dismissed her hand aside. \"Don't disturb me, Sam!!!\" \"It's me, Lilith!! Remember???... I took over your sister.\" She hugged Jack tightly. \"Lilith, why this all happen to me?? I lost my house and now that creeps is chasing us.\" He cried like a baby. \"Its your destiny, Master. You must face it even it has to sacrifice your love.\" Jack felt calm as Lilith persuade him to accept the truth. \"Lilith, from now on please stay by side. I don't want the previous situation happened again.\" She released the hug and smiled sexily. \"I always be with you, Master. Because we are bonded together. Despite, i quite liking your sister body after being in her for three days.\" Jack's face crinkled. \"Hmmmm... she is my sister. It feel weird to be with her. I think i know the nice body for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                Sam's body tingled as Lilith de-possessed her. \"Brother, where am i??\" \"In the hospital, Sam. Mom is waiting you in the lobby.\" She went outside while holding her bandaged head. Maybe Lilith must not make Sam's body getting serious injuries. \"Okay, i will wait for the body that you suggest.\"  She sat beside Jack.

Who give this scar??\" \"The brat that have the tome.

Please forgive me.\" Jack put his fore finger on her lips. \"Shusshh...don't cry. I will always be with you. Always.\" He kissed Lilith. After such a romantic moment, they laid on the bed in excitement. \"I don't even realize to fall in love with a succubus. But you are a demon soul and we can't even make a real excitement.

Suddenly, a black figure out nowhere dashed into the house through the opening door. An explosion occurred. Christine and Mark shocked as something exploded in their house. The figure rampaged through the house by throwing a lot of fireballs while searching for the tome. Lilith quickly grabbed the tome and wanted to run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout turning back, she flew out as the house burning. \"Mom!!! Mom!!!! Help me.... i'm stuck!!!\" Lilith heard Samantha, Jack's younger sister shouted from her room. She absorbed the tome into her own body and headed towards the room. \"Wait...

He can tear apart anything including demon spirit like me.\" She turned her sight towards Sam who is standing in fear. \"Maybe i could use her body for awhile.

Sam convulsed with intense until Lilith took control of her fully. \"What a nice body!! Now , we can have the real fight.\" Lilith transformed Sam's hand into a pair of sharp claws and stroke him. They clashed and exchanged blows each other. \"Wow, he too robust. I have to do that spell or i will die here\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNysrogh charged towards her with burning fists. \"Fuminous!!\" Lilith casted. A shield of rune formed to halt the punch of the dreadlord.

Holding your breath, hoping that your hiding place will work, you try to peer through the small hole in the can. Barely able to make out the figure of Kelly, who seems to be slowly entering the alley, inspecting all of it with a critical eye, you start to panic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0That rising panic is suddenly drenched in ice cold terror as half-way down the alley, Kelly stops, and starts muttering faintly, to low for you to hear. The results are completely unexpected, as her eyes suddenly glow bluish-white, and after scanning the alley again, her eyes focus on your exact hiding spot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"There's no reason to run Jack, I merely wish to ask some questions,\" Kelly says in a calm tone, all the while slowly walking towards your hiding spot. After not getting a response, Kelly stops, and attempts to gain a response. \"Seriously, a few simple questions, and I will leave you alone if that is what you wish,\" she states, standing less than 10 feet away, completely calm and trying to look as non-threatening as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Since your trapped, Lilith is not here to bail you out, and your hoping that your friendship is enough to trust Kelly, you slowly lift the lid off the can, and clamber out. After getting clear, you slowly look at Kelly with some trepidition and a weak grin. \"Oh, Kelly, what a surprise to see you here! What brings you out here this late?\" you ask after a bit of your terror calms down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Why Jack, is it any wonder i would attempt to find the source of the recent magic pulse that hit our town earlier tonight?\" Kelly asks with arched eyebrow, and placing a hand on her hip. Shocked at what she just asked, you wonder if you should try to lie, but said decision becomes moot with Kelly's next statement. Eyes still glowing bluish white, Kelly gasps, and starts laughingly continuing, \"Oh, this is too much! Not only were you the source of the pulse, but your apparently tied to the lust/love spectrum. That totally explains why you ran now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Frowning and confused by Kelly's laughing comment you are about to ask her what she means, when she suddenly stops laughing, and looks at you, with her eyes flashing back to their normal, non-glowing color. \"Jack, if you can't tell by this point, I kind of know about magic, but what i don't know is how you obtained yours, since it was apparently locked when we first met, nor can i tell how much you actually know,\" Kelly states, all mirth gone from her tone, which seems to be edged with steel and a hint of a 'calm-before-the-storm' feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Gulping at this sudden change in a person you thought you knew, you consider how to phrase what you know, when something she said catches your attention. <br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, I had potential magic before, but was locked? How would I have magic, and who would lock it?\" you state, then notice the raised eyebrow going a bit higher on Kelly's face. Deciding to get somewhere with this impromptu interrogation, you decide to purpose a deal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Obviously you have questions, I have questions, how about we exchange information?\" you ask, hoping that kelly will take the deal. By the glare that appears on Kelly's face, you are thinking that she's not happy with that idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"While I like you Jack, I feel that I should get my answers without having to reveal more to someone who has obviously stumbled into a world they know nothing about. Don't take this personally, but I have to be careful, just like everyone else,\" Kelly states, gaining a snarling visage while somehow summoning a dagger into existence in her left hand. Completely blind-sided by her words, actions, and the person who you thought you knew, you were thrown for even more of a loop by the last person you thought to see at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lilith has appeared silently behind Kelly, and before anyone moves, grabs Kelly by the neck and squeezes her throat tightly, looking slightly pissed off the whole time. \"Should have taken his deal, Dearie, for it could have made this a lot easier.\" Lilith snarls, gripping her hand around Kelly's throat until Kelly passed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Completely stunned by how your night has gone, you ask Lilith in a non-plussed tone \"What now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"That depends on you Master. As of this moment, you have a mage as your captive, that you can either erase their memory, enslave them to your will, or try to strike a deal with them. Normally I would give some explanations in this situation, but I'm bound by the book to let you make the choice in this situation, with no input on my part\" Lilith states, calming down now that everything seems under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering your options, you choose...</span></div></div>",

After a few minutes of silence, interspersed with Kelly glaring at the warlock and succubus pair, Lilith scoffs, and starts to draw symbols in the dirt. \"There's no point in letting her stall Master, she apparently cannot tell us, will not tell us, or wishes to stall until a possible associate intervenes here,\" Lilith says scornfully, her movements and words causing Kelly to pale, and start struggling against her bonds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Moments after Lilith finishes her work, the apparently magical symbols slowly start to glow, each ones glow acting as if it is being slowly filled with power, 'to indicated readiness?' Jack wonders, fascinated by the magic Lilith is and has preformed so far. Kelly's words snap Jack out of his engrossment of the charging symbols.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Alright, alright, I'll talk, call off your slut Jack!\" Kelly shouts, terror filling her voice as she continues to struggle with her bonds. Turning away from the magic pattern on the floor, Jack focuses on Kelly, face set apathetically. Upon seeing this, Kelly's struggles stop, and finally seems to realize the gravity of this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Last chance Kelly, otherwise I let Lilith do whatever she wants with you,\" Jack states firmly, looking Kelly in the eye and seeing a defeated look start to form on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Fuck, fine. This will sound a bit stupid, but it is how it is. You recall some of those games and stories we have come across as kids growing up Jack? Those ones about secret societies that have a big rule about not letting 'outsiders' or 'non-involved' people know about whatever topic the story deems? Well, lets just say that you've been dumped into that world, and right now, the city has a few factions that are fighting over turf currently. If you want an apt analogy, you just got dropped into the marvel universe, and your in between the equivalent of the Kingpin, the Maggia, and the Hand. That's not even taking into account the smaller clans that have no wishes to get involved in the current power struggle. First rule drilled into almost everyone's heads though, is to take out witnesses that are not truly connected. At this point, I'm fucked either way. Technically you're situation makes you both not connected, but being bound to your pet makes you connected as well.\" Kelly explains, looking more dejected the more she explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Motioning Lilith to stop whatever she's doing to the symbols, Jack ponders the situation he finds himself in now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0'It seems things have changed since my last master, Master. The state of magical affairs and secrecy has gotten a lot more complicated than before, more so since it seems we are in the center of this magical infighting.' Jack hears, noticing that he hasn't seen Lilith's mouth move, and comes to the realization that bound also apparently means telepathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0'Correct Master, but that isn't exactly relevant to our current dilemma. Right now, you need to decide if you wish to make a partnership with someone that has already attempted to murder you, or gain a slave that you know cannot betray you. Other options do exist of course, but the decision ultimately rests with you,' Lilith chides Jack, while laying out the situation as clearly as Jack has reached a similar conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Ok, the silence isn't really helping me know if I'm about to die or not,\" Kelly interjects with gallows-humor, laced with some false bravado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Sighing, Jack asks Lilith if there's a way to obtain Kelly's help, without enthrallment or killing her. While any compassion Jack had died with her recent actions, he also didn't want to inadvertently paint an even bigger target on himself , let alone possibly get Alex involved....speaking of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Just considering what is going on, but something I need to know, and i want the truth, is if Alex knows about any of this,\" Jack states 'Master, have her swear on her life and magic,' Lilith interjects. 'That shit is real? I thought you only found that on fanfiction sites,' Jack muses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0As Kelly opens her mouth to speak, with a micro smirk forming, Jack interrupts her, \" Also swear on your life that your and magic that your answer is the truth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Any form of smugness disappears from Kelly's face, replaced with a baleful glare, and if looks could kill, Jack would be a smoldering corpse on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Fuck! Fine, I swear on my Life and Magic that my next statement is the truth as far as I know it. Alex, my boyfriend, does not know, nor is involved with the mystical world at all.\" Kelly grinds out angrily, looking as if each word is painful to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Sighing in relief that at least your best friend isn't lying to him, Jack looks over at Lilith, an idea popping into his head all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0'Lilith, how powerful and enforceable are magical oaths? and is there a way to break one without paying whatever penalty is ascribed?' Jack queries the busty succubus, who gets a grin on her face, causing Kelly's glares to morph into terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0'Oh master, I'm definitely glad your not an idiot. If anything, i would say your pretty devious when you want to be,' Lilith responds, winking at Kelly, causing her to whimper and start trying to futilely inch away from the smirking succubus. ' The wording of such oaths is the key, and the only ones I've heard able to break them, without due penalty, are Gods. Even then, some of them can't avoid the clauses if worded correctly,' Lilith continues, her grin morphing into rapturous smile, reducing Kelly to bone-chilled terror, and promptly fainting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"....I honestly didn't think she would faint from me smiling like that,\" Lilith states, looking slightly disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, when you think of it from her position, a Succubus that has been threatening to devour her soul gets an orgasmic looking smile plastered onto their face, what would a normal person's reaction be?\" Jack points out, while taking a moment to consider where he wants to go from here.<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lilith's chanting continued, with Kelly recoiling in terror. You stared, emotionless, but also not really sure what was going to happen. Lilith had a perverse grin on her face, and she reached out and touched your forehead...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour senses blurred as you felt a cool shiver run through your entire body. You watched as the world around you began to grow, then you realized - you were shrinking! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lili...\" you started to ask, beginning to feel uneasy. Before you could finish your sentence, you felt your mouth close up. You tried to wave your arms, but they were gone too... All you could see was Kelly's terrified face, which quickly rose out of your field of view. You felt yourself rise until you were level with the zip on Kelly's denim shorts. An unseen force pushed you closer and closer until you went <i>through</i> her shorts as if they weren't even there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly exhaled sharply, a muffled sound as if she was also unable to speak. You felt yourself being shoved back and forth into her pussy, which to you was a very warm fleshy cave. It still felt like you were fucking - or what you imagined it felt like - except it was your whole body. You plunged in and out, driven by an unseen hand, until your body shook in pleasure, and you blew your load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you did, feeling began to return to your body. Arms, legs... a strange feeling of pleasure in your crotch. You crunched your legs together, feeling your bare legs rub against each other. But you had been wearing jeans and not shorts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" You groaned, disoriented. Something felt and sounded off... \"Lilith?\" A moment of clarity hit you. You were tied to something... \"Holy fuck!\" You screamed as the realization hit you. Lilith had said to Kelly something about taking her body... had she seriously just shoved you into Kelly? Was that even possible?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your restraints loosen, and you moved your hands to confirm your suspicions. Your hair was definitely longer, and you were definitely not male anymore. The tits and lack of gear between your legs were a massive giveaway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... I'm Kelly now...\" you mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct, Master.\" Lilith smirked. \"Or would it be Mistress now? Either way, yes. I put you in Kelly's body. Gotta say, she is a bit of a cutie. Shame she's a mage...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. The method I used to transfer you into her - while entertaining - was not without purpose. You're merely in control of her body for now. But, the more lust you feel - and the more you act on it - the more of her mind you'll begin to see, until you can eventually read her like an open book. When that happens and you decide to leave her body, you'll take all her powers with you.\" Lilith explained. \"Which means that you'll get all your answers, and you get to do it by doing every dirty thing you've ever thought about doing to Kelly... except you'll <i>be</i> her the whole time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat certainly sounded interesting, you thought. You were still in shock a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might even get some flashes of memory coming through now. I can help you if you want... or maybe you'd rather lead the way yourself?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nJack was tempted to pay attention to the sudden pressure he felt in his head, like a voice whispering just behind him, but at the same time, Lilith's offer pulled on his attention. While Jack never thought of Kelly in the same was as he did about Sarah, he couldn't deny that she was an athletic woman that struck a nice figure, even if she didn't have the bust that most guys drooled over. Shaking his head at his rambling thoughts, Jack weighed his options, and came to the conclusion that Lilith's offer would be better at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some trepidation, that was quickly being beaten down by giddiness at his next planned action, as well as the budding lust that started to simmer in his new body, Jack approached Lilith slowly, trying to walk seductively, and feeling muscle memory take over, succeeding in the attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBemused, and curious at what her Mistress is planning, Lilith arches an eyebrow, and starts to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly are you attempting to -!\" Lilith gets out, before Jack fakes a stumble, and launches himself at Lilith, capturing her lips and pulling her in close. Surprised by this action, Lilith stands there unresponsive, prompting Jack to keep going, in hopes that he hasn't screwed up his attempt at having fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeepening the kiss, and letting his hands explore her body, Jack tries to figure out what he can do to provoke more response out of Lilith, when he's suddenly assaulted by random visions. Multiple scenes fly through Jack's view, all from the first person, and showing different sensations that felt good to 'her'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Was that a memory like Lilith mentioned?' Jack wondered. Taking a leap of faith, and hoping it will work, Jack moves one of his wandering hands to Lilith's ass, and squeezes in the exact place he saw in one of the visions, while moving his other hand up and cupping one of her breasts, gently kneading it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, yes, like that Mistress!\" Lilith exclaims after breaking the kiss, and moaning loudly as Jack continues his ministrations, glad that the 'memories' had been correct. Feeling a bit bolder, Jack decides to slide the hand on Lilith's breasts under her shirt, and start playing with her nipple, rolling it and gently tugging it, randomly, getting an even louder moan, and finding his mouth captured in a soul-searing kiss. Surprised by this response, Jack's mouth is invaded by Lilith's tongue, which invades and dominates his mouth, causing him to moan as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith, getting into the act after winning 'Kelly's' mouth, decided to speed up with the fun, and snaps her fingers, causing both her clothes, and Jacks, to disappear in a shimmer. Having complete access, Lilith begins to caress Jack's body, focusing attention on his  breasts and hips, eliciting even louder moans from him. Deciding to return the favor in surprise department, Lilith moves her hand from Jack's hip, and slowly starts to rub his pussy, feeling it already wet and leaking. Smirking, she pauses in all her actions, causing Jack to wonder what she was up to. Feeling his confusion, Lilith plunges her fingers into his pussy, eliciting a squeal of surprise, that morphs into a shout of euphoria, as Jack cums from the sudden stimulation of fingers, and the near instant massaging of his g-spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquirming in place, mewling with pleasure, and trying to scrabble his nearly unresponsive hands towards Lilith's body to return the favor, Jack nearly collapses, as Lilith continues to finger his pussy, and play with one boob, while moving her mouth towards the other. Sucking in what little air he can, Jack looses it quickly, as he begins to shout loudly from the near constant orgasms Lilith keeps putting him through. After the 5th one, Jack manages to push her head away from his boob, and gain her attention, prompting her to slow down in her other ministrations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While this feels *pant pant* amazing, *pant * I would *pant* like to *pant* return the favor *pant* eventually,\" Jack gets out, after finally catching his breath, though having some trouble as Lilith had yet to cease her hands actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling widely at what Jack had said, Lilith decides to humor him, but not before one last stunt. Plunging her fingers in one last time, she massages his g-spot and rubs his clit with one hand, then twists his nipple and pulls on it, all at once. The response is Jack feeling like fourth of July fireworks show going off in his body, as the combination of pain and pleasure lances through his body, and waves of bliss roll throughout, feeling like it will never end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Nearly blacking out, Jack regains focus with Lilith standing over him, smiling and looking like she's 'cat who ate the canary'. Seeing that Jack is coherent again, Lilith slowly lowers herself, while musing aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While I'm glad you wish to return the favor mistress, and excited to see your attempt, i should warn you that i'll still be continuing my fun!\" Lilith states, and Jack sees no more, as Lilith's crotch is planted firmly over his face, with her pussy directly over his mouth. Taking the hint, Jack begins to lick and suckle, getting moans from Lilith, all the whilie wondering what Lilith meant by continuing her fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnseen by Jack, Lilith begins to grow a long, sinuous, tail, the end looking prehensile and phallus like. Deciding to tease her Mistress, Lilith decides to have her tail slowly massage its way down Jacks body, while enjoying his attempts to eat her out. Just as Jack gets into a rhythm and thinks that maybe he is doing well, his world is overloaded by the sudden feeling of something plunging into his pussy, as well as the stimulation of pleasure that floods his senses yet again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked, confused, curious, and wondering what Lilith is doing, are all banished from Jack'd mind, as he feels the foreign entity slowly drag out till barely anything is inside, before slamming back inside his pussy, even deeper than before, causing Jack to moan deeply into Lilith's nethers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you really wish to cause me to cum Mistress, you'll need to do so before my tail has its way with you, as the longer you take, the quicker and stronger it's thrusts will become,\" Lilith taunts in a sing-song voice, sounding highly amused by Jack's current situation. Shuddering from the implied outcome, Jack redoubles his efforts, eliciting more moans from Lilith, and in return feeling the tail start to pick up speed, slowly, but surely getting faster every few thrusts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes go by, and both Jack and Lilith continue their efforts, Lilith using her tricks learned over centuries to hold out, just to mess with Jack, and Jack using what will power and stubbornness he has to at least cause one orgasm in Lilith before passing out into a puddle of bliss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter reaching seven minutes of constant stimulation, Jack's will starts to fail, and he gives in, orgasming loudly and stopping his ministrations on Lilith. In response, Lilith decides to end her game, and gives in, cumming loudly and releasing a river of feminine cum all over Jack's face. Smirking, as Lilith feels Jack pass out through their bond, Lilith stands up slowly, savoring the mini-orgasm aftershocks that Jack caused. 'Not bad for a beginner. What he lacks in experience, he makes up for in effort and enthusiasm,' Lilith muses silently to herself, and begins to cast minor can-trips to clean up the area, and create a bed for her slumbering Mistress. Finishing up with the minor cleaning, Lilith decides to meditate and wait for Jack's return to awareness, as the next point of action would be decided on what Jack obtained from the memories. 'While i could point him in the direction or tell him what he should do, he will not grow into a decent Warlock without making such decisions on his own. Though if asked, I guess I can give counsel,' Lilith thinks to herself, before sitting on the end of a conjured bed, and levitating Jack onto it aswell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack slowly comes to, and realizes that while on a bed, it's not the one he's used to, nor does his locale look like his room. Further grogginess leaves him, and he recalls what last happened to him. Looking down, he sees he still has Kelly's body, naked and surprisingly clean. Looking around, Jack notices Lilith, equally naked, sitting on the end of the bed in a pose that one normally would expect from a Buddhist or one of those martial artists in movies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing movement, Lilith's eyes spring open, and lock onto Jack, causing him to startle slightly, before getting himself under control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back Mistress, I hope your rest was pleasant. Have you had time to get Kelly's memories, or do you need more time?\" Lilith asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon her mentioning the memories, Jacks mind is flooded with information, everything that Kelly knew is now ingrained into Jacks mind, including all the information from before being a mage. Shocked, Jack feels a momentary sensation of vertigo, as he struggles to figure out a sense of identity crisis. He recalls everything of Kelly's life, every sensation, every bump and bruise, every thought and feeling she had about her old neighbors before she moved, her first kiss.....it just kept going through Jacks head. Feeling overwhelmed, Jack snaps back to the present when he feels a hand on his leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, he sees it's Lilith, with concern on her face. Seeing her snaps Jack out of his duality moment, and helps center his mind. 'I'm Jack, not Kelly!' he screams in his mind, and it seems to help force the tidal wave of Kelly's lingering emotions/memories back down, below his normal surface thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine Lilith, though for a moment i almost lost myself. In the future, I think we should be careful about this method of obtaining information, because I almost thought i was Kelly for a moment.\" Jack states aloud, feeling better after affirming his identity to another 'person'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You technically are both now, Mistress, as you have 'ate' her soul. She'll still live after you leave, and you can even leave a puppet soul behind, but as of this point, Kelly is merely an aspect of you now.\" Lilith explains, causing Jack to ....</span></div></div>",

A sudden glow seems to surround Jack, and he slowly starts to calm down, at least physically, though mentally, he feels uncontrollable fear and guilt at what he had accidentally done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Finally the glow dissipates, and Jack feels in control enough to speak, though seeming jittery and looking like a loud sound will cause him to bolt. \"Lilith, just...just...What the actual fuck do you mean I ate her soul? When you mentioned that I would be able to read her mind, there was no mention of eating any souls! Seriously, why the hell would you think that I would want to eat her soul, especially as she was my best friend's girlfriend. How will I even be able to look him in the eye while knowing I ate his girlfriend's soul?\" Jack yells angrily, starting out loud, but slowly dwindling into despair as guilt starts to take over his thoughts. Long moments after Jack falls silent, just staring off into space and ignoring his surroundings, he feels a slap across his face, and is shocked back into his surroundings, realizing that he's now on the ground, and looking up towards an annoyed looking Lilith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm sorry for striking you Mistress, but I needed you to snap out of your funk, as otherwise you wouldn't be able to listen to anything I could say, especially as I might be able to help alleviate some of your guilt.\" Lilith says, sounding slightly peeved, but also a touch of concern lacing her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Hearing that there might be some way to fix the situation, Jack quickly sits up, and focuses intensely on Lilith, who takes it as her cue to explain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"First off Mistress, I didn't mention the 'soul eating' business, because I honestly knew, from previous Master's in similar positions, that you would balk or outright refuse such an idea, even if it could be the very thing that would save your life, or that of those you care about. In this case, you heard it yourself, and can probably tap into your new memories, and find that Kelly would have first tried to subdue, extract your power, or in case the previous two failed, eliminate you. The problem with the last one, is the fact that most mages of her ilk usually decide to 'burn the roots' to make sure that no one connected to the target could seek revenge. So to simplify, after your death, or in case she couldn't accomplish that, others in her stead, would result in the rest of your family being tortured and killed brutally.\" Lilith says quietly, never raising her voice during the explanation, but her words are loud and overwhelmingly distinct in Jack's mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Shuddering at the mental image of what Lilith had said, Jack's vision seems to blur, as a memory of Kelly's seems to play before him like a movie reel. Seeing her taking down a child that looks to be nine, and sucking out some red energy from his body, which slowly seems to whither the longer the drain goes on, until it simply crumbles to ashes. Another memory plays, this one of a failed capture/extraction, as well as failing to ambush her target. It resulted in her being captured in turn, but apparently she had left notes to her allies, that waited until the right moment to storm in and capture Kelly's target, as well as free her. The vision seems to fast forward, moving up to a point where four other people are tied to posts, surrounding the target that Kelly had failed to kill. Jack 'knew' that only two of the people tied to the posts were family, the other two were simply school friends, but all connections that could have any possible investigation into the Association's actions were to be silenced. Jack watches as each person tied to a post is killed in a gruesome and torturous way, unable to look away, as 'Kelly' saw nothing wrong with these actions, and had watched them all with no remorse, even feeling a slight tinge of pride at the results of her faction's actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Jack comes out of 'his' memories, gasping in shock, and nearly passing out from his rapid heartbeat combined with his shallow breathing. Slowly getting himself under control, and slowing his jack-hammering heart, Jack looks up, and sees concern and understanding on Lilith's face. Slowly standing up, Jack feels slightly less guilty about accidentally eating Kelly's soul, but still want's to make things right, even if it's to alleviate his now somewhat lessened guilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Taking a deep breath, and deciding to get the possible solution Lilith mentioned, Jack looks back to Lilith, and simply asks for her to continue. Getting a nod in response, Lilith waves a hand before her, and two chairs appear before her. Lilith beckons Jack over, and sits in one of the chairs, simply waiting for Jack to sit before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Now Mistress, I mentioned before there is technically a way to alleviate your guilt, and also help with your situation, as mages in general after anyone is usually a bad thing, especially for their target. So before I go any farther, I need you to tell me if she alerted anyone to your new nature, or left some kind of message to do such?\" Lilith says soothingly, helping keep Jack calm, while gently taking his hand and rubbing her thumb in circles over the back of his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Jack thinks over Lilith's question, and instead of a 'memory' playing before him, Jack gets a simple mental 'no' when focusing on finding such information. Trying a few different ways of framing a search for such information results in 'no' each time. Satisfied that as far as he could tell, only Kelly had found out about his new circumstances so far. Relaying such to Lilith aloud, Jack simply focuses on the gentle massage Lilith continues to apply to his hand, feeling relaxed and strangely content, noticing that his guilt wasn't attacking him at the moment. Deciding to push that thought away, lest it break his pleasantly content mood, Jack looks up and sees Lilith waiting for him to be ready to continue. Seeing him focus on her, Lilith begins to speak again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"That is good to hear, as that will allow you to control the information on yourself for the time being. Now the solution to your new soul issue, is somewhat simple, as I can help you in this. It would technically fall under any of the three tiers of difficulty, but in this case, it would probably be near the end of intermediate, and just a toe over the line into Advanced. To help you with your guilt, as well as gain a new ally of sorts, were going to be obtaining a Familiar for you Mistress. Normally, a is an animal or creature that can act as your agent, depending on what it is, and its intelligence level. In this case we'll be using 'Kelly' and binding her as your Familiar, hence why the distinction of it's difficulty is vague. Before we actually let her loose, we'll have to place several Geas on her, to stop her from alerting or causing your death, as even if her soul would be bound to you, she could still be spiteful enough to do so.\" Lilith explains, not letting up on the hand massage, and her tone of voice not changing from a pleasant and polite cadence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I get that this is higher tier stuff than what I should be messing with, but how does that help us exactly, as it sounds like she'll be more dangerous as my Familiar than instead of simply being ...I'm not even sure what to call a soul's stomach....never mind.\" Jack asks, only stumbling and giving up the question after finding he couldn't form the right words to explain it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Getting at what her Mistress was asking, Lilith speaks up. \"It is no problem Mistress, and I don't think anyone has ever thought to ask such a thing about soul consumption, but in this case, if we left a puppet soul inside Kelly's body, their would be traces of foreign magic that wouldn't dissipate in time, and could even be used to trace it back to you. In the case of a Familiar, and its bond, those are much harder to even discern, and can be masked easily, especially as Kelly, being your Familiar, will have access to the Magicks you just absorbed from her. While her being in her own body can be dangerous, there are measure we can take to ensure that such is minimized, as well as helping us get a spy that can alert us to any dangers in the local area. The choice is up to you Mistress, but we need to decide soon, as unless your willing to live as Kelly for the next few days, people will notice her disappearance or things being off about her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Lilith slowly ceases her hand massage, and Jack still feels relaxed, but also thoughtful, as he contemplates all he has heard, and what he should actually do. On one hand, Kelly did try to kill him, if not because of his magic, then for even knowing about such a thing. On the other, gaining an equivalent warning system, as well as possibly being able to help others in a future situation as his current one, would be useful. While Jack felt bad about what he accidentally did to Kelly, it mostly stemmed from the fact that Alex would be devastated if he found out the truth about her, and Jack's role in her current fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking a deep breath, and deciding to listen to his instincts for a moment, Jack comes to a decision...<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

I pretty sure naked ladies with big tits just don\u2019t randomly pop into my room, which means I\u2019m actually talking to myself right now.  That means it\u2019s time for me to turn in and, when I wake up, you\u2019ll be gone\u2026.so\u2026.yeah\u2026..good night,\u201d Jack declared resolutely as he simply closed his door and crawled into bed lazily and closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, Master,\u201d Lilith pouted, \u201cI\u2019ve been all this time cooped up in that book\u2026.I\u2019m a sex demon whose gone a century without sex\u2026.I didn\u2019t even get to jump into a body yet,\u201d she said as she sat in the dark.  Jack became all the more sure he was losing it.  \u201cWell, figment,\u201d he said, \u201cif you\u2019re still here when I wake up perhaps I\u2019ll let you have any body you damn well want\u2026.maybe even mine if whatever the hell is wrong with me hasn\u2019t killed me,\u201d he said half joking and half worried about what the hell was going on.  Still, Jack closed his eyes in a sense of calm, sure that he would awaken the next day fresh and rejuvenated with whatever was wrong with him fixed.  He drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack rubbed his eyes as the morning light poured into his room.  He yawned and stretched, sitting up slowly in his bed.  He rubbed the sleep from his eyes and glanced lethargically about the room.  \u201cThe naked lady with the amazing boobs appears to be gone\u2026.I never expected myself to be happy about something like that, but it means I\u2019m not nuts,\u201d Jack declared as he scratched his belly and stood up slowly next to his bed.  He was still wearing the same (now wrinkled) clothes from the night before, so he simply opened his door and trudged downstairs.  Descending the stairs, he noted a clock that indicated it was 8:30 AM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack ambled slowly into the kitchen as he continued to rub his eyes.  He glanced over toward the kitchen table and saw his mother sitting there in her gown sipping orange juice.  \u201cHey honey!,\u201d his mother said with a smile.  \u201cHi Mom,\u201d Jack answered with a yawn.  \u201cWhat\u2019s on the agenda for today?\u201d she asked in a perky voice.  Jack thought a moment as he pulled some leftover pizza out of the fridge.  \u201cWell I\u2019m supposed to meet Alex at his house to talk about the research I\u2019ve gotten done\u2026.I think Kelly will be there, and we may end up seeing a movie,\u201d Jack said absent-mindedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked up to await his mother\u2019s reaction, he was aghast at something that totally distracted him.  There, sitting on the table, absolutely 100% stark naked, mere inches away from where his Christine Thompson sat sipping her juice, was Christine Thompson!  More accurately, it was a representation of her, a form Lilith had assumed.  \u201cWoah!\u201d Jack said in amazement as Lilith sat there looking like his mom\u2026.inches away from his real mom.  \u201cIs something wrong, honey?\u201d the real Christine asked.  Lilith sat there and smiled as Jack tried to look away from the absolutely stunning figure of his mother\u2019s naked form.  Her legs were tanned and toned, and her belly was flat as a board.  The only concession to age was a slight droop in her breasts, which were wonderfully bouncy and jiggled slightly with every breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, this is what she really looks like under the gown,\u201d said Lilith, motioning to Christine as she sat there oblivious to the succubus just inches away.  \u201cAh\u2026..ah\u2026..\u201d Jack stammered, seeing naked mom right next to clothed mom.  \u201cJack, honey, I said are you all right?\u201d his real mother asked, a tone of worry in her voice.  \u201cUm\u2026..yeah\u2026.yeah I\u2019m fine,\u201d Jack said as he took a bite of cold pizza and tried to avert his eyes, only to find that Lilith magically appeared in front of Jack immediately upon his turning away.  \u201cYou know honey if you\u2019re not careful you\u2019re going to get a pudgy belly from eating that junk food,\u201d Christine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack turned yet again, and there was Lilith, still looking like his mother, right in front of him.  Her breasts were mere inches from his face.  \u201cHave you got a thing for older women, Master?  You would not be the first,\u201d she said with a kinky smile.  \u201cUm\u2026..yeah mom I\u2019ve gotta go\u2026.gotta go meet Alex,\u201d Jack said as he dawned his coat and made a b-line for the door before his mother could even respond.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack jolted into the cool morning air, with Lilith still looking like a naked version of Jack\u2019s mother and walking right beside him.  \u201cFucking hell,\u201d Jack said as he tried to wrap his head around this whole thing, \u201cyou are real!\u201d  Lilith chuckled, \u201cYes, Master, very real,\u201d she said.  \u201cPlease please look like someone else dammit,\u201d Jack asked.  Lilith smiled deviously.  \u201cYou don\u2019t want to admit it, but you DO have a thing for older women don\u2019t you?  Not that I blame you\u2026.your mom\u2019s hot,\u201d she said.  \u201cSomeone else!\u201d Jack shouted as he neared the car.  \u201cOk ok,\u201d Lilith said as her form began to shift.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack now looked at a perfect copy of himself.  His scraggly, 6 foot one frame and unkempt beard and messy hair stared back at him.  \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d Jack demanded, thinking this was a stunt.  \u201cShowing you want I want, Master,\u201d Lilith responded in Jack\u2019s voice, an odd thing to hear.  \u201cWhat the hell do you mean,\u201d Jack demanded.  \u201cWell,\u201d Lilith mused, \u201cyou gave me life Master; I want to know what makes you tick\u2026.what you like\u2026.which women are your type\u2026..what it feels like to be you.  The quickest way for me to learn these things is if you let me inside your body,\u201d she said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInside my bo\u2026..\u201d Jack began, \u201cyou mean you want to posses me?\u201d he asked.  \u201cYes,\u201d Lilith said, \u201cbut only for a little while, and I can\u2019t hurt you because you are my master.  When you really want me to get out, I\u2019ll have no choice but do get out, but yes I want to get inside you,\u201d Lilith declared.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack thought for a minute.  \u201cI\u2019ll make you a deal,\u201d he said, \u201cyou can posses me for a while if you promise to help me get with Sarah after,\u201d Jack offered.  \u201cMaster, I can give you any woman you desire,\u201d she said.  \u201cIs that a deal?\u201d Jack asked.  \u201cIt\u2019s a deal,\u201d Lilith responded with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.\tLilith possesses Jack, and suddenly he blacks out.<br>\r\n2.\tLilith possesses Jack, and he stays conscious, and Lilith goes to meet Alex as planned.<br>\r\n3.\tLilith possesses Jack, but he later finds out she lied about having to get out when he demanded it.<br>\r\n4.\tLilith jumped into Jack\u2019s body and immediately began to alter it\u2026\u2026significantly.<br>\r\n5.\tRight before Jack is about to get possessed, he hears someone familiar call out to him.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wasn't laying in the middle of a street or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's groggy mind started to turn. What the hell had happened? The last thing he remembered was agreeing to being possessed... And that seemed pretty suspicious, considering he was just waking up from blacking out straight after...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat straight up and looked around. It was dark, and he couldn't make out many features, but it seemed like he was in his bed in his room. But what exactly had transpired while he had been out? Had Lilith kept her side of the deal and not done anything stupid? He certainly hoped so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lili-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice suddenly caught in his throat. That wasn't his voice. It wasn't even a man's voice. Hell, not even a little boy would have such a high-pitched and feminine sound to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi... I am speaking...\" he said slowly, trying to identify the voice. He was sure he'd heard it somewhere. He got up from his bed, somewhat worried now. He walked over to the door and turned on the light...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...revealing that the room, was in fact, not his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a teenage girl's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, taking a glance in the mirror, he was occupying a teenage girl's body. More specifically, the drop-dead gorgeous body of Sarah, his crush. And he was looking at her wearing only a thin pink nightgown over those huge, luscious...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like it, 'Mistress'?\" a voice beside him said. Jack jumped. He darted his head to the side to see Lilith standing there in her naked beauty, looking at Jack react and looking like she was going to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This... This isn't funny!\" he said, making a futile attempt to cover up his breasts. \"When I wished to get with Sarah after you possessed me, I never meant like this!\" He used his hands to make a sweeping motion over his new body. Lilith tried stifling another laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, I only did this because I looked into your mind and saw that this is something that turned you on: the idea of becoming a sexy woman. Trust me, this is a good idea! You can possess <i>any</i> girl through me.\" She cupped her breasts. \"Even me, if you so wished it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what do you wish to do now?</span></div></div>",

Sarah is standing in the middle of her room, brown hair flowing down around her shoulders, wearing a thin pink nightgown that doesn't quite hide her C-cup breasts, and matching pink panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, <i>Mistress</i>\", Lilith chuckles, \"Right now it's <i>your</i> body...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack walks closer to the mirror, and watches Sarah's reflection do the same. He smiles. So does her reflection. He sticks out his tongue. So does Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for some fuuuuuun\" slyly says Jack, hearing Sarah's sexy voice utter the same. He begins to lift the nightgown, and watches, <i>and feels</i>, Sarah's hands caressing her firm, toned stomach. He moves her hands down her stomach, gently stroking her legs and moving around to her ass. He gives her ass a squeeze, feeling its firmness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith watches with an amused look on her face, but says nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack continues his \"fun\", moving his right hand up Sarah's nightgown, and getting up towards her breasts. He tucks his hand under the nightgown, softly caresses Sarah's left breast, touching the nipple. It's a very light, ticklish feeling, and he loves it. He closes his eyes and lets out a soft moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe again raises Sarah's hand to her nipple, and notices a new feeling - a slight warmth in his crotch. He exhales in satisfaction, and slowly runs both hands down Sarah's chest, reaching toward her panties. He tucks his hand into the panties, and slowly makes his way down. Feeling Sarah's soft, moist vagina, he begins to gently massage it, feeling a rising heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like some help, Mistress?\" Lilith smokily says in a low, husky voice. \"I can make you feel things that you've never even dreamed of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Lilith makes her way gently over to Jack, and begins to slowly pull down Sarah's panties. She sits on her knees, and runs her nose slowly up the inside of Sarah's right thigh, making Jack moan in anticipation. Lilith then extends her tongue, and draws a line above Sarah's waiting pussy. She takes her hands, and begins to caress Sarah's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack begins to feel a wetness in his crotch, having withdrawn his hands in favor of letting Lilith have her way, and gently strokes Lilith's cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready?\" Lilith asks, and begins to eat Sarah out. Her lips gently massage Sarah's clit, causing Jack to feel bursts of ecstasy. He begins to moan, the sound of Sarah's voice moaning so sexily turning him on even more. Lilith begins sucking, while her hands caress Sarah's legs. It's a feeling Jack has definitely never felt before, a soft and very erotic warmth in his (well, Sarah's) nethers. Lilith then sticks her tongue past the clit into Sarah's pussy, and begins moving it back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh god, that's amazing\" Jack moans in Sarah's voice, feeling her orgasm and squirt into Lilith's waiting mouth. Lilith withdraws her tongue, and begins again sucking on Sarah's clit. Jack feels Sarah's entire body tingle, surrendering himself to her orgasm and continuing to moan. Lilith moves her hands up to Sarah's hips, and licks her way up past Sarah's bellybutton to her breasts. Caressing Sarah's breasts with her hands, Lilith reaches up and envelops Jack in a passionate kiss, letting her breasts push against Sarah's. Lilith then moves her right hand back down to Sarah's pussy, massaging her clit with her thumb, and pushing deep inside with her middle finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's knees start to wobble, as Sarah's body experiences another orgasm. Lilith, content with herself, pulls back and watches Jack as he pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? I told you this was a good idea, Mistress!\" Lilith happily exclaims. Jack is stunned, blankly looking in the mirror. He sees Sarah, nightgown drenched in sweat, panties completely absent, her pussy glistening after two orgasms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... \" Jack starts to say something, but instead collapses onto Sarah's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Mistress, what now?\" Lilith asks.</span></div></div>",

There's <i>no way</i> this is real.\" Jack thought out loud, hearing Sarah's sweet voice. \"No. Way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Master, look around. Look at yourself!\" Lilith said. \"I can assure you this is all very real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot having any of it, Jack collapsed back onto the bed. It was much softer than his normal one, and a bit bigger. He crawled back under the covers, uncomfortably aware of certain new sensations he felt. The fact that his legs were completely bare, hairless, and that there was a lack of anything between his thighs. His underwear was a lot smaller than usual. His shirt... was much smoother and softer, and gently caressed his much more sensitive chest. As he rolled over, he met an unusual resistance as his body's breasts pushed against the mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just go to sleep... \" Jack complained. He was tired, and clearly delusional. Why else did he think he was Sarah?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't change anything, Master. But if you so insist.\" Lilith said, then vanished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack did not sleep well. His body was very distracting, and more than once he found his hand wandering to unfamiliar territory. He woke to the obnoxious ringing of an alarm clock, his head face down in a soft white pillow, hands crossed above his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hnnng,\" Jack mumbled as he pulled himself up. He was not in his bedroom. In fact, he was still in Sarah's. He looked in the mirror, and saw a reflection of Sarah, wearing her pink nightgown he had seen last night, hair going in every direction, a very tired (and cute) expression on her face. \"Oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was all real. Or, the dream was still going. Maybe he should just go along with it? Today was a school day. Would it be different going to school as Sarah? Still mostly half asleep, he fumbled around and eventually found Sarah's uniform. He slipped off her nightgown, and... stared at a mostly-naked Sarah in the mirror, wearing only beige panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" he whispered and slowly stepped closer, feeling his breasts bounce around as he did so. If this was a dream, it was <i>very</i> realistic. He cupped the tits on his chest, feeling their softness and noticing a tickle from where he brushed his nipple. He let out a slight moan. \"Ooohhhh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery realistic indeed. If that felt good, then would... Jack moved one of his small hands down to Sarah's panties, watching her reflection with intensity. He rubbed a little between his legs, feeling the flatness of Sarah's groin. He was about to do more when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Sarah, you're gonna be late!\" a loud feminine voice called from outside, and he heard a door slam. Right. He had to get to school. If this was real, he'd have all the time in the world to play with his current body later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly pulled on some stockings, dress shoes, fumbled with a bra for a few minutes, enjoying the spectacle of Sarah's breasts hanging free and unrestrained as he did so. He buttoned up a school shirt, and pulled up a skirt. Grabbing a hairbrush off the bedside table, he ran it through his hair, noting how long and smooth it was, and pulled it back into a ponytail. There. Now, looking back at him, was the perfect image of Sarah, ready for school. Well, not perfect. She still looked tired and a bit clueless, but it was good enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he remembered something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilith?\" he whispered. Lilith appeared next to him, still completely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mistress?\" she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I'm Sarah, then what happens to Jack?\" he asked. \"Also, please don't call me mistress, it's weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're a girl. Master doesn't fit anymore.\" Lilith smirked. Then, she transformed into Jack. \"Better? I'll go from your place. Well, your body's place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks... \" Jack said, noticing his reflection again. The skirt, the breasts... yep, definitely a girl. He'd have fun with that later. Lilith disappeared in a puff of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed his bag, hoping everything necessary was still inside, closed the door and walked outside, seeing a more or less familiar area. He waited at the bus stop, getting on the bus that would take him to school.</span></div></div>",

Used to feeling his jeans, and not the leathery feel brush along his bare legs, nor the A/C's chilling air causing goosebumps to form on said legs. The chill air also seemed to cause 'his' nipples to harden, and the brief breeze like sensation to flow past his nethers. All these distracting sensations were put on hold as someone sits down next to Jack after the bus stops to pick up more kids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Looking next to him, Jack sees another female student, looking expectantly at him. To buy himself a moment to figure out who this person is, he tries small talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Morning, ready for school?\" Jack tries, hoping that this doesn't blow his cover, as well as racking 'his' brain on who this could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Very funny, Sarah. You and I both know that we didn't have to be on the bus this early, except we both wanted to get some practice in before the game later today.\" said the teen, looking bored and slightly tired. Maybe they weren't a morning person, if what they said was anything to go by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Focusing on what he'd just heard, and still combing his memory, a sudden flood of information sifts into his mind. <br>\r\n'''This is Adrianna, his fellow volleyball teammate, and they were given the morning off since they had tested out of their Math class, but had declined to go for an AP course. The game was right after lunch, but for some reason multiple teams had tried to schedule gym use this morning, causing the volleyball team to have to choose either no practice for the day, or an early morning session.'''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Where did all this information come from? There's no way I should know some of that, as I didn't even know Sarah had tested out of Math class, though that explains why I haven't seen her there since beginning of the term,' Jack thinks, not noticing the curious look appearing on Adrianna's face. Feeling a poke in his side, Jack turns, and sees an inquisitive look on Adrianna's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Earth to Sarah, you home girl? Or are you still hung up on that Jack guy still not asking you out?,\" Adrianna asks, after seeing she finally got 'Sarah's' attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Holy shit, Sarah's been waiting for me to ask her out?' Jack shouts internally, both in joy and shock, and a bit of incredulity. Gathering his thoughts, and trying to speak, he's surprised when his mouth starts moving of its own voilition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm here, just a bit on my mind. And no, I'm not hung up about Jack, disappointed yes, but in that same turn, I could have asked him out as well. Besides, i have a feeling today might be interesting, and may lead to a change in that situation.\" Jack states, not of his own volition. Wondering what had just happened, Jack is shocked, and somewhat frightened upon getting his answer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[You know, while it has been interesting seeing you play as me, if you're not careful, you'll end up giving away the game] Jack hears in Sarah's voice, a tinge of humor lacing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Subtly inching his out of view hand downward, Jack pinches his thigh, and holds in the gasp, but hears a mental one alongside his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[Ouch, that hurt, though i can understand why after reading your memories] Jack 'hears' hissed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Realizing that no, he's not dreaming or hallucinating, and that somehow Sarah is communicating with him, Jack almost breaks into a panic. Suddenly, his body seems to go on autopilot, and Sarah's mental voice berates him while the vocal one starts talking to Adrianna about nonsensical things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[First, freaking out would be a bit bad right now Jack, and yes, I'm awake, in part to thanks to the randomness that is magic would be my guess. As to this situation, while not ideal, i guess it does solve the problem of us telling one another about our feelings] Sarah says, ending with mirth lacing her 'voice' in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0'Ok, so you apparently have \"read my memories\" and know about the situation....I thought you would be more pissed about a guy possessing your body' Jack comments, trying to keep calm, as he doesn't think even Lilith could have seen this possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[At first, I was upset, but after seeing that you didn't exactly plan this, nor did you try to take advantage of my body, as well as spending all night reading your memories, I decided to accept the situation. It does help that, since we both like each other, and you have access to magic, we could have some fun, if we both work together. - and Lilith is fucking hot-] Sarah explains....and doesn't seem to realize that Jack heard that last bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Mentally chuckling, and hearing a squawk of surprise - guess she read why I was chuckling - Jack calms down, and realizes that 'he' and Adrianna are getting off the bus, and heading towards the women's changing rooms. Feeling excitement well up in him, and then mortification and embarrassment after realizing that Sarah is aware, and can read his memories, Jack hears a snort, accompanied by full blown giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[Oh Jack, at his point it's more funny to watch you try to be considerate, and fight both your hormones, and mine. I'm not offended that at this point, you're going to get a free show through me, as i do enjoy the show too, but at his point, i'm going to have to sit back, as fighting your 'control' is exhausting me, and while 'replays' are interesting, i'd rather watch the live entertainment] Sarah explains, after calming her giggles, and getting quieter as explanation comes to an end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Confused, and suddenly excited, Jack feels his 'auto-pilot' shut off in mid step, causing him to stumble into Adrianna, who had stopped in front of a locker and had been trying to mess with the combination dial. Apologizing, Jack freezes, as he now has no idea which locker is 'his' nor what any of the information he needs to get into it, when suddenly it feels as if said information is shoved into his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Shuddering, and using the new information, Jack starts to get into 'his' locker, which is thankfully nearby. While doing that, Jack tries to contact Sarah, and is surprised with the response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[Before you ask, yes Jack, I gave you some information, hopefully enough to get you through practice, but at this point, I can't keep conversing if I want to stay \"awake\"] comes an exhausted sounding Sarah. Deciding to try to leave her be, and hoping he doesn't piss her off if he screws up, Jack changes his clothes and then starts stretching, only to realize that the information Sarah meant, was a basic rundown of routines and actions she does for volleyball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Figuring he should just go with it, as nothing has made true sense since picking up Lilith's book, Jack continues to stretch and warm up. Minutes after finishing, Jack heads towards the exit that leads into the gym, with Adrianna jogging over, and causing Jack's gaze to drift to the bouncing that is caused by her actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Weren't you going to wait for me Sarah?\" Adriana asks, sounding confused. 'Shit, hope she's not suspicious of me' Jack thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Sorry, like I mentioned on the bus, I've got things on my mind, and it seems to be making me air-headed today, \" Jack apologizes, hoping it's enough to ease her concerns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Maybe you should sit practice out, or take a few minutes to work through whatever is distracting you,\" Adrianna responds. The look of worry slowly morphing into a mischievous smile, \"or maybe, you should ask Jack out, since he might be your distraction, and you just don't want to admit it\" she teases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Smiling warmly, and chuckling along with her comment, Jack takes the out that Adrianna suggests, and twists it into his own tease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You know, while I may be interested in Jack, you've been bringing him up a lot this morning. Do i have sudden competition, and if so, when did this start,\" Jack returns, while playfully shoulder checking Adrianna, who upon hearing this, gains a full-body blush and starts stammering denials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Giggling at this outcome, Jack gently grabs Adrianna's shoulders and starts to direct/drag her towards the exit, all the while wondering what else was next...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

Looking around, he finds himself in Jenny's room, though instead of it being dark like when he was in Sarah, he notices it's quite bright outside. Confused, Jack looks over and finds a clock, stating it was after 10:00 am, causing him to gasp. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilith?\"<i> Jack calls out, trying to ignore how odd it was to hear Jenny's voice when he spoke.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Silence permeates the room, before finally Jack receives an answer....from outside the door? </i>\"Yes Mistress?\" <i>Comes ...his own voice?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell Lilith?\" <i>Jack hisses, opening the door to find his former body, standing there looking amused at Jack.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\"Something wrong, 'Sis'?\"<i> 'Jack' asks, seeming to be trying to stop themselves from laughing at the multitude of expressions that crosses Jacks face.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\"Why are you me Lilith?\"<i> Is the near-shouted response, before 'Jack' sighs, stepping into the room, closing the door, then muttering a bit as the door glows blue momentarily. </i>\"Really Mistress, way to almost let anyone that possibly walks past to know that something is going on.\"<i> She takes a moment to look over the room, and spends a few moments looking at the closet closely, before turning back to Jack. </i>\"If you recall, I was supposed to be possessing your body, while you got to be 'closer' to your crush. When you woke up as her, you 'requested' to be someone else, and picked Jenny. For the whole reason of you being in your sister was tied to me possessing you, I think you can understand why i'm like this, no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jack pauses as he had been building up a mound of indignation until Lilith had explained, then quickly deflates, wondering why he'd forgotten that ...then sighs breathily.</i> \"Sorry Lilith, just...i guess i was disoriented and a bit confused. This possession, magic...all of it is a bit much to take in\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Jack' nods, seeming calm and not even a bit upset at Jack's previous attitude.</i> \"It's quite alright Mistress, it does happen. Regardless, you are now Jenny, so need to act like her - it's different for all of my owners, but they can do something similar to what I'm doing, syncing to a host and being able to pass as them. It varies between each person, but the longer you spend as her, the more you might start to sync as her, which would make it easier for you to pass yourself as others if the need ever arises. If you don't mind, i'm going to go hang out with Alex, as he apparently wants to hang out today just like yesterday. Try to have some fun today, and stay in Character,\" <i>She responds, reaching into her pocket near the end to check Jack's phone, seeming to be amused at something on the screen.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jack nods, frowning at the momentary reminder that his life had radically changed, before speaking up.</i> \"Ok, i guess i did agree to this, so please try to stay out of trouble, and if anything comes up i'll try to stay in character.....is there a way to contact you if i do get into trouble?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Jack' looks up, seeming surprised, before nodding.</i> \"Yes, since you are my Mistress, we are bound to one another, so if you try to direct your thoughts to me, i can read them, and try to assist. If it's a dire emergency i'll be there immediately, but otherwise if i'm to play as you, it'll be dependent on the situation, Mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Already figuring out why Lilith kept teasing him about the 'mistress' term, Jack rolls his eyes, gesturing for Lilith to go ahead and leave. Looking around at the room, Jack decides that maybe Jenny would have a planner or something that would explain what her day was like, as he hadn't been as close to her since he started high school and her college.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just... come on in.\" She walked over to Jack and put her finger on his lip, then pulled it away as if teasing something out. She was in fact pulling out Jack's soul, and he could feel it as he slowly lost control over and the feeling of Sarah's body. Once he was completely out, Sarah's limp body fell to the floor. In the back of his mind, he was worried about her, but for the moment, he had more important things to think about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith started moving the finger on which his soul was hooked to her own mouth. The closer he got, the more he could feel a sucking feeling, as if there was a vacuum inside of her waiting to be filled with his essence. Then her finger touched her lip, and Jack's soul was suddenly sucked into the body of Lilith. All went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a bit, but Jack finally came to. He opened his eyes and saw the carpet of the room facing him. He pushed himself up and onto his feet, then almost immediately fell over due to his new weight balance. He looked straight down, and just as he'd expected, Lilith's giant breasts were sitting there, pert and defying gravity in their roundness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over and saw the crumpled form of Sarsh laying on the floor. He noticed that along with seeing her normally, he could also see a faint blue haze surrounding her. She stirred as he watched. Jack tried to hide, but it was too late. He was the first thing she saw as she got up. Or... Maybe not. Se looked right through him as she sat up and wondered how she'd gotten to be on the floor. She shrugged it off as being a nightmare then turned off the light and laid back in her bed. Se was asleep soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you having fun as me?\" This time, the succubus was inside of his mind, talking to him. He figured this out quickly and thought back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It certainly will be interesting, seeing what sort of powers you have. Not to mention exploring the pleasures of a succubus while I'm in here...\" Jack said, grinning perversely. He was getting a feeling of being extremely horny, which is how he assumed succubi were all the time. It only made sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do now?</span></div></div>",

Except it feels a lot better if someone else's hands are doing it\" she replied suggestively. Jack's gaze wandered over to Sarah, who was still lying in bed, completely oblivious to the naked succubus playing with herself in her room. His hands were still busy, and had returned to Lilith's breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that blue aura Sarah has?\" Jack asked, curious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's her level of arousal. It's blue at the moment, which means she's completely calm. Once it gets red, though, she'll be a lot more fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I make it red?\" Jack asked, getting an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we're talking, Master!\" Lilith seemed excited. \"Go up to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack did as requested. He walked Lilith's form over to Sarah's sleeping body. He noticed that Lilith's hips swayed naturally as she walked, even with him in control. He looked down at Sarah. She was adorable, covered in her blanket and sleeping soundly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now... there are a few ways to do this. Let's put your hands onto her stomach...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack began to lift the blanket. \"You won't need to do that. Just go through\" Lilith said. Jack was a bit confused, but tried anyway. He moved Lilith's hand to where Sarah's stomach would be, and found that it moved right through the blanket. He felt a warm sensation as he touched Sarah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you have contact with her, Master, just think about her\" This was easy. She was right there, and Jack again noticed how hot Sarah was. Her smooth skin, soft lips, perky breasts, slim figure... As these thoughts went through his head, he noticed Sarah's aura begin to change to red. It was soon very bright, and Sarah began to quietly moan. He saw what he thought was her hand, moving down under the covers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did it, Master! She's ready\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for what?\" Jack asked, curious and a little bit aroused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we can make her do anything now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack found this very exciting. \"Can you...\"</span></div></div>",

If you stay long enough, you'll be a perfect mix between yourself and them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis news startled you. That would explain why Lilith was so perky this morning.

Her hand was still wet from her earlier fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly turned the water on and jumped in the shower gesturing you to follow. As you entered the shower, you pressed up against Sarah because there wasn't much room. But that certainly wasn't a problem as both your bodies rubbed against one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have much time, but we have enough for a quick lesson and to take care of both our little problems\" Sarah looked down at your crotch chuckling. \"Now I\"m sure I could use my fingers and get the job done for you but why don't we kill 2 birds with one stone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you have in mind?\" You asked as you moved your hands over Sarah's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to show you a minor transformation. It's pretty easy while you're in my body. Just concentrate on a penis, it can be any penis, big or small. Think about thrusting into me, releasing into me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow Lilith's instructions. It was easy envisioning a penis, seeing how you had one just yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first nothing happened but the more you concentrated on thrusting into Sarah, you became hornier. As the ecstasy built, a penis and balls began to replace you genitalia. But it wasn't the penis you were used to. Both you and Sarah gazed on a large black studded cock that was pulsing in anticipation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems my body had a bit of a say on that. That's a nice incubus cock you have there. I'll call this lesson a success. Great job, mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout skipping a beat you tell Sarah to turn around. She obliged. Using what little room she had, she bent over and presented herself. Quickly you guided your oversized demon cock to her soaking snatch and pushed. Despite Lilith preparing Sarah's body before hand, Sarah's cunt was a tight fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pressed farther into her, Sarah let out a pleasure filled scream that echoed throughout the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Sorry, Jess, I'm probably going to take a while,\" Lilith called out with Sarah's voice. You share with Lilith a knowing grin, then step out of the shower by phasing through its door, then walk through the door leading to the hallway outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's older sister, whom you now know is named Jessica, is standing there, visibly annoyed at Sarah's response. She's dressed in a tight, red t-shirt, a fingerless fishnet glove that extended past her elbow, a black ruffled miniskirt, thigh-high black stockings, and combat boots, and her aura is a light purple. If you had to be completely truthful, you'd have to say she was more attractive than Sarah, and that was a hard thing to achieve in itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you hurry it up a bit? I left my glove in there, and I don't want to head out with my outfit unfinished!\" Jessica replies. That would explain it. You were wondering why she needed to use the bathroom when she already seemed ready to go. With this, you finally decide to stop marveling over Jessica's beautiful body and move to actually <i>inhabit</i> it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move to a position just behind Jessica and gingerly move your succubus hand towards her gloved one. With a feeling almost like a gentle magnetic pull, your hand is guided right into hers. Suddenly, you feel her glove enveloping your hand, and you flex your fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica stops what she was doing to look at her hand with a look of puzzlement. \"...The fuck? What's wrong with my hand?\" she mumbles, shaking her hand from the wrist. Satisfied with your small experiment, you join both your arms to hers, with the same magnetic feeling as before. Jessica is beginning to panic as she loses control over both her arms, somehow fighting the urge to scream. You force your whole lower half into hers, relishing in the sudden feel of her boots, stockings, and of course, her netherregions, already beginning to drip from the sheer arousal of possession. You assume Jessica doesn't notice her loss of control down there as she wasn't actively using her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shove your torso into the space occupied by hers, leaving your head to the side of hers. Once here, you decide to have a little fun before completing the possession and fondle Jessica's breasts through her tight shirt with her hands. Both you and her can feel the hot flush of arousal coming from them as she moans softly. Not wanting to chance her screaming for help, you take the final plunge and start moving your head into hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a lot of pushback this time, more so than you'd felt before, and Jessica began screaming. Whoops. You started pushing harder and harder, and Jessica's body shook as if with the force of your exertion. As you got closer to your goal, she started screaming louder and fell to her knees, screaming \"NO! NO, STOP! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! PLEASE, NO!! I'M BEGGING YOU!!\" Her spasms became more and more violent, her screams louder, until with a final, huge spasm, you were completely in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second, your vision became black; then, you could see the bathroom door in front of you once again, jet-black hair at either side of your field of view. You looked down at yourself, directly into Jessica's cleavage tucked into that tight red shirt you had been admiring from outside moments before. You stood up and looked at your hands. The black nail polish fit well with the whole theme of the outfit, you thought. Of course, you then move your hands inward and grab your chest, fondling it as you did before, but with more voracity. Unintentionally, your mouth lets out a slight, sexy moan. You'd chosen well - Jessica's body was absolute heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou compose yourself, then walk into the bathroom where you find Sarah - no, Lilith - sitting on the floor of the shower and having a bit of fun herself, the water still running. She sees you and pulls her hand, almost reluctantly, away from her slit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, that was loud. Sounded like you took the slow and fun way, Mistress,\" she giggled. \"If Sarah's mom had still been in the house, you can bet EMS would have been called.\" You grin, then spot Jessica's other glove sitting on the bathroom counter, picking it up and sliding it on over your effeminate extremity. You glanced at yourself in the mirror and - well, you were never a hand fetishist, but suffice it to say that watching Jessica slide this glove on over her hand and up her arm was ridiculously arousing to you. Maybe it was her body talking, you weren't sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But 'Jess',\" 'Sarah' moans, stroking her clit and falling into character. \"Weren't you going to join me in the shower for some... fun?\" You contemplated your options. You could either join Lilith in the shower, which meant getting a striptease out of it too, or you could stay in your amazingly sexy clothes and have some fun by yourself while you waited for 'Sarah' to finish up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you do?</span></div></div>",

Offering what you hoped was a seductive smile, you beckon to her with a slim, gloved hand - you still cant quite believe youre inside the tall, sexy body of Sarah's sister Jess - and wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you help me...?\" You ask in a sultry voice, and begin slowly peeling off the glove you had just put on. Sarah stands up, reluctantly withdrawing her fingers from their previous activity, and approaches you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you want me to start, my mistress?\" She seductively walks up, and begins caressing your legs. Right to business then. She slowly undoes the laces on your boots - you did like them, you thought Jess looked hot in them, but given the situation you agreed they had to go - and pulls them off, exposing your petite, stocking-encased feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, after the momentary distraction, slowly remove the other glove, and throw both to the ground. You moan with pleasure as Sarah begins stroking your legs, gently removing your stockings. You look down to see Jess's slim legs - which were under your complete control - and reposition them slightly. Controlling this sexy body is making you increasingly turned on, and you feel a warmth in your nethers, unlike anything you had ever felt before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext on Sarah's agenda was your shirt. After running her arms around your thighs, up your skirt and brushing slightly past your pussy - another definitely new thing you simply <i>had</i> to get acquainted with - she began to slowly lift up your shirt. For a second it got stuck around your breasts, but you obligingly lifted your arms up and had Sarah pull the tight red shirt over your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExamining yourself in the mirror, you see Jess's sexy body, wearing only a black bra and a miniskirt, long slim legs and toned stomach completely bare, and strike a pose. You see Jess bend over forward, as you move one of your fingers around your hips. Sarah is standing next to you, completely naked, but you were too preoccupied with your own body to really notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocus back on the mirror, you begin to slowly caress your firm abs, and raise your hands up behind your back to unclasp your bra. You discard it, seeing, for the first time, Jess's breasts, completely free. They're slightly smaller than Sarah's, but no less appealing. You stroke them, teasing your nipples, and squeal in delight. It feels amazing, so ticklish - except that you also feel it under your miniskirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Sarah undone the clasp on your miniskirt. It falls to the ground and you step over it, seeing a black thong as the only item of clothing left on your sexy, borrowed body. Sarah runs her hands along the inside of your thigh, past the thong, and sticks a finger into your pussy. Definitely a feeling you wanted to get more acquainted with. Seeing your reaction, she smiles deviously, removes the thong and stands up, embracing you in a passionate kiss, pushing her breasts up against yours. Her right hand is still massaging your new plumbing, and you see no reason for her to stop - it feels amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe withdraws her hand and begins to pull you into the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you need to shower, mistress?\" She asks innocently, despite there being nothing at all innocent about her intentions. Stepping under the warm water, you begin to rub yourself all over, loving the dual feelings of caressing a body as hot as Jess, and having a body as hot as Jess caressing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah decides to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><span style=\"line-height:1.4;\">\u00a0\u00a0Caught up in your efforts to enjoy the dual sensations, you're snapped out of your pleasure induced engrossment by a slow pull on your thighs. Looking down, you see Sarah, looking up at you with a grin, before she finishes pulling your stance a bit wider, then swiftly thrusting her face in your crotch. Before you can yelp in surprise, you moan loudly from the sudden attention Sarah's tongue starts to bathe you in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Throwing your arm out towards the shower wall, trying not to slip and lose balance, you catch yourself, all the while trying to keep your legs steady enough that you don't fall on Sarah. All throughout your 'struggle', Sarah continues to lick your pussy, as well as caress your legs, sending even more small waves of pleasure though your body. Moaning lowly, you finally get your arm braced enough against the wall that you can fix your stance, widening it a bit more, and planting your feet as firmly as one can in a shower. Nearly falling over again by a sudden increase in pleasure, you look down, and notice that Sarah has burrowed her head deeper into your pussy, apparently gaining more access with your shift of stance. She also has moved her hands from your thighs, and is now kneading your ass with one hand, and stroking your nether lips with the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0All these sensations going on leave you slightly frustrated that you can't help, or reciprocate, while trying not to fall on Sarah. Upon thinking this, you are surprised, which throws a dash of water on your continued rising arousal, by the voice of Lilith in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0'Silly little Mistress, you have a hand that could be playing with your breasts, or even trying to guide my head, or caress some other part of your body. And if you truly wish to reciprocate, we could always change positions here in the shower,' Lilith states in a bubbly tone, never once letting up in her ministrations on your core. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Getting over your brief shock, helped along quickly by the increased pace of Sarah's tongue lashing, you decide to take her advice, and use your free hand to start playing with your breasts. A yelp of a muffled surprise is heard, and your pleasure slightly skyrockets, as your knees buckle, shoving your overstimulated snatch directly onto Sarah's tongue, and causing you to almost collapse on top of her. Fighting to regain at least some control over your wobbly legs, you brace against the wall with your body, gently pushing Sarah's head way. Taking a deep, shuddering breath, you let out one more moan, before finally getting yourself under control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Let's change positions 'sis', otherwise, you might end up with me collapsed on you in an orgasmic induced lump, and you left frustrated,\" you state shakily, with a lust filled grin plastered on your face aimed at Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Mirroring your grin, Sarah simply re-positions herself to lay on the ground, simply waiting for you to join her. Taking the hint, you reverse straddle her, and promptly lower your head towards a Sarah's pussy. Pausing, with some trepidation about not knowing what to do, you try to figure out how best to start off. Said decision is apparently taken from you, in the form of Sarah's legs opening a bit wider, and your head suddenly getting shoved deeper. Surprised by the sudden action, you yelp, which turns into a small screech of shock and pleasure mixed when Sarah's tongue stabs into your snatch yet again, causing you to moan deeply into hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Getting the clue about what she wants, you start to tentatively lick along her lips. That plan apparently wasn't what Sarah had in mind, since your head is pushed even harder into her pussy, and instead of a tongue thrust, you scream loudly into her pussy, courtesy of her pinching your clit and shoving a finger into your pussy at the same time. Coming back from your momentary daze, you are reminded about what's going on by Sarah's renewed assault on your pussy, prompting you just give up thinking, and go with the flow. Diving in, you start trying to mimic what Sarah has been doing to you, and receive pleasured squeaks as a response. Guessing that your going in the right direction, you continue with this course of action, only pausing when Sarah's actions push you into another mini-orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0This pace seems to go on forever, and only ends when, simultaneously, you both apparently decide to pinch and twist each others clit and gently tug them. Both of you scream in ecstasy, and you pass out shuddering from the waves of pleasure that seem to continuously roll over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Waking up in bed, you find yourself still naked, but also cuddled up to Sarah, who has apparently been laying next to you this whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Welcome back, Mistress. I trust that you enjoyed yourself, I know that I did,\" Lilith asks, with a cocked eyebrow and grin plastered on her face that caused you to give a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"I did enjoy that Lilith, and I'm glad you enjoyed it to. Though now I'm at a loss for what we should do,\" you respond, your small smile disappearing into a furrowed brow as you contemplate what to do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Silly Mistress, you can do just about anything you want. If your talking about now that your awake, we can continue as these two, or we can go do something else, the choice merely waits upon your whims,\" Lilith retorts, a gentle smile gracing Sarah's face, as her hand gently strokes your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, lets...\"</span></span></div></div>",

I wouldn't recommend until you've learned a lot more about how your brand of magic works Mistress,\" Lilith answers, while slowly sliding herself back onto Jacks engorged demon tool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Getting the hint, Jack slowly continues his pumping, all the while distracted by what Lilith's reply has implied. While coming to understand that magic is real, and so are succubi, and demons in general apparently, Jack had never considered what the soul was, even after Lilith yanked his out and put it into other bodies. Considering it all now, while still going through the motions on autopilot, Jack begins to wonder what else he should ask about, since he seems to have stumbled into a world that is more dangerous than one could scarcely believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Seriously, can you finish up! I need to get ready to leave!\" shouts Sarah's older sister, adding in a few poundings to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Broken from his momentary musings, Jack focuses back on 'Sarah' in front of him, who was subtly been increasing the pace, while trying to add more stimulation where she can. Upon realizing this, your amazed that you didn't notice the extra effort, as well as the low, constant moaning she apparently has been doing this whole time, with interspersed squeals of orgasmic joy. In response, as much as a sort of apology, you pick up your pace, as well as try to add your own stimulation to 'Sarah's' efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 \"Glad your back from your introspective moment Mistress. Anything I should worry about, that would distract you from focusing on all these pleasant feelings?\" 'Sarah' asks, while suddenly twisting her body slightly and seeming to scrunch up somewhat. Slightly confused by her sudden actions, Jack is suddenly assaulted by an intense pressure, squeezing down and locking his demonic phallus in place. This sudden action makes Jack pause, as numerous jolts of pleasure over come him as 'Sarah', not moving, seems to do something that makes it feel as if thousands of tiny feathers massaged his cock all at once. Screaming out in bliss, and cumming almost instantly, Jack tries to slam into 'Sarah' while also trying to stay standing up. Long moments later, she lets go of her pose, panting while smiling coyly. Nearly collapsing onto 'Sarah', you both avoid falling to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Seriously Sarah, if you don't finish up soon, I'm going to take the car and leave you to walk to school!\" says and agitated older sister, who slams one more time on the door, before a sound of stomping is heard moving away from the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Ok, so how is it she didn't hear either of us in here? I know i wasn't as loud as I possibly could have been, but i'm surprised she didnt hear you, with the constant sounds you were making <i>'Sarah'</i>,\" Jack asks after finally catching his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"The wonders of magic Mistress, and the only limit is power and imagination. In this instance, I merely spelled the sound to not leave the bathroom while we had our fun\" Lilith responds, and Jack feels a sudden clench on his surprisingly still hard member. \"Would you like to go another round Mistress, since it seems that your still able,\" is the next question Lilith asks, while somehow slowly and rythmically massaging Jack's false phallus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"W-wh-while that does sound fun Lilith, we need to get ready for school, which means either you go as Sarah, or I somehow get back to my body and give you your's back,\" Jack stutters, trying and partially succeeding in ignoring the blissful sensations of Lilith's ministrations on his demonic cock. Taking a deep breath, Jack slowly extracts himself from 'Sarah's' body, shuddering and nearly orgasming at the suction-like feeling of his extraction. After fully out, Jack clambers out of the shower, fighting to get himself fully under control, which is alot harder than he thought, thanks to his new bodies constantly produced Lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"If that is what you wish Mistress, we shall do as you say, though it wont be as fun as I can be right now,\" Lilith says with a pout, and when Jack looks towards her face, he sees a glimmer of lust and mischief, before it disappears with a wink from 'Sarah's face. Intense pain hits Jack in the groin, causing him to look down, and notice that his \"newest\" addition, seems extremely rigid, and almost feels as if it's being pulled towards 'Sarah'. Slightly freaked out, you take a step back, and start to question Lilith on this development.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Uh, Lilith, any reason this transformation would be drawn towards you like a magnet?\" Jack asks in a slightly panicky tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Ah, well, you are in my body right now Mistress, a Lustful body that is constantly aroused, and used to giving into it's instincts unless a good reason presents itself. Seems my body wants to continue the fun instead of school,\" Lilith responds in an amused tone while standing up and turning the shower off. Getting out of the stall, Lilith wanders over to Jack, and crouches down to inspect his predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Nearly stumbling over, Jack catches himself, and pulls back just as his pelvis thrusts forward, nearly launching itself into 'Sarah's' mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you help me get rid of the transformation then Lilith? We seriously need to go, either to school, or get me back to my body for school,\" Jack peads, while straining against the constant thrusts of his demonic appendage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBemused, 'Sarah' stands back up, and saunters over to the towel rack and begins to dry herself off, all without responding to Jacks pleas. Turning around, 'Sarah' cock's an eyebrow, then sighs, and then begins to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"If we must Mistress, i guess I can walk you through getting rid of your issue the boring way. The first step is to focus incredible will into your action that you next preform, which is some method that you choose to shrink or disappear your transformation. For lack of a better example, think of your transformations like a Green Lantern Ring's power - its based on will, but in your case, Lust is also a dominant factor to it,\" Lilith explains, while putting the towel back on the rack, and then turning back around to stare at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking what she said to heart, Jack focused as well as he could, and attempted to just will his Demonic tool away. Slowly, the member shrunk until it was less than 2 inches, but didn't go any farther. Confused, Jack thinks over what Lilith said, and tries again, while adding the physical motion to push it inwards. Moments later, Jack is dick-less, and 'Sarah' is pouting and looking forlornly at Jacks crotch, almost looking like she wished he had been unable to undo his transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With a sigh, 'Sarah' looks Jack in the eye, then addresses his previous concerns. \"Technically, you don't have to go to school if you don't wish to Mistress. Before leaving I wove a spell on your room and body, to where people would not question where you were today. So for all intents and purposes, you're free from 'Jack's' societal obligations today. While it's true 'Sarah' needs to go to school, it wouldn't be too hard to either help you cast the spell, or put me inside my body again and let me cast it on her. Granted, I would sync with her more throughout the day, but then you would either have to follow me around, or find something else to do until later. Or, we could go find something fun to do with other people,\" Lilith explains, all the while slowly massaging 'Sarah's' body and slowly swaying in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking all of what Lilith has stated into account, Jack decides...<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nTearing his gaze from Lilith's teasing, Jack decides to let Lilith stay as Sarah for now, as she seems quite comfortable as her at the moment. Smiling at the thought, Jack decides that following 'Sarah' around school could be fun, especially as if he got bored, he could either possess someone else, or cause some mischief of his own. 'Wait, since when do I like mischief....could I be syncing with Lilith, even though she's not here?' Jack wonders, and decides to speak his mind, as well as clue Lilith in on their course of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok 'Sarah, enough teasing for now, we have plenty of time do so later, especially since you get to go to school today, with me following along. Though something odd occurred when I thought about following you around today. I felt a sudden urge to cause trouble if I got bored following you, and wondered if it were possible to 'sync' with you, even if you're not currently in your body,\" Jack says, getting Lilith's attention, causing her to sigh at first, before an intrigued look forms on her current face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting, I have to say I've never heard of that actually happening, but their were myths about such things, Mistress. Some magicians who...experimented in the realms of soul and demonology, but did not obtain the title of Warlock, had theorized that the older a being is, the more ingrained their 'experiences' could be in their bodies. I honestly never put stock in such, but it might be something to do with the Book, or just an unusual case of you unconsciously pushing your boundaries. It wouldn't surprise me either way, but in any case, I need to get ready for school apparently,\" Lilith responds, then putting words to action, turns to leave the room, slowly sauntering and swaying her hips in an exagerated tone, not even bothering to put on a bathrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's gaze is drawn to Lilith's antics, causing a wave of arousal to flush through his body, and he had to bite his lip to focus on his choice of getting them to school. Shaking his head to shake away his distracted thoughts, and only succeeding after 'Sarah' cleared the door, and went out of his sight, Jack sighed, wondering if he could actually make it a few hours without feeling like an oversexed horny teenager. 'Wait, with my current situation, that might be impossible, since I'm currently inhabiting a sex demon's body, and she knows what buttons to push to incite my lust...damn I'm fucked...both figuratively and literally!' Jack mentally rants, sighing as he lets a few minutes pass before walking through the door, not bothering to open it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRetracing his steps from before, Jack walks through 'Sarah's door, and stops at the sight of 'Sarah', bent over and pulling up the second stocking she's apparently wearing for the day. A tidal wave of Lust surges through Jack, and he knew if he had his cock, or even his earlier transformation, it would be standing rigid and begging him to plunge into the view before him. Shuddering, and noticing that while he didn't have his usual indicator of how aroused he was, he did have the female equivalent. 'Damn, if my nipples got any harder, i might be able to cut diamonds with them,' Jack thought, fighting the urge to tweak one of them, to possibly relieve the tension and ache he's starting to feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You know, even if she's constantly teasing me, I think I can understand now why she almost always is trying to push me into having sex, as if she feels like this from random minor things, its no wonder she acts in such a manner,' Jack muses to himself, turning away to try to calm himself down, and missing the smirk that had formed on 'Sarah's' face, as she apparently knew Jack had reacted to her 'accidental' flashing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong moments pass for Jack, as he fights to get his libido under control, and finally succeeds after trying to do square roots mentally until he failed. Still feeling aroused, but not as bad as when he walked through the door, Jack slowly turns his head, wary of Lilith trying to incite even more lust in him, accidentally or purposefully. Not seeing 'Sarah' at all, Jack stops his slow movement, and rapidly looks around, still not finding her. Confusion floods Jack's mind, until he notices a door on the other side of the room slightly ajar. Curious, Jack quietly walks over, and peeks through the crack in the door, wondering what is in the room, and if 'Sarah' is nearly finished, as they've taken quite a while to get ready for school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sarah' is indeed getting ready, as the ajar door apparently leads to a small walk-in closet, with a full length mirror sitting opposite of the door leading into said room. Standing in the center of the room, 'Sarah' is shifting through the clothing on the hangers, examining one set of clothing, and occasionally taking a piece of the ensemble off the hanger, and putting the rest back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think Mistress, something bold and daring, or enticing and mysterious for school today? I know you all normally have to wear uniforms, but I think today 'I'm' going to cheat on that rule,\" Lilith says aloud, posing in front of the mirror without turning around, showing off a sexy little red dress, that Jack can tell would leave very little to the imagination, and would show off quite alot to anyone who saw 'Sarah' sitting down. Shuddering at the mental image of Sarah in such a dress, Jack, with great difficulty, shakes his head no, and sees a smirk form on 'Sarah's' face, who promptly puts the dress onto one of the mini-dressers sitting under the hanger racks. After placing the garment down, 'Sarah' picks up another set of clothes, and holds them flush to her body, merely looking into the mirror and catching Jack's eyes, non-verbally asking his opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressed flush against her body was a white tube-top, that seemed to be two sizes too small, and would hide very little on Sarah. Against her waistline was a black mini-skirt, that seemed to shimmer when the light hit it at different angles. Holding his breath, Jack just stilled, as he had to fight off the strongest rush of arousal to hit him yet, nearly causing him to give into his bodies base instincts 'how do I know about those' (says a small part of Jack's mind). Knowing that he can't watch any longer, Jack steps back and away from the closet, getting as far back as he can until he reaches the other side of the room, and presses against the wall, the cool feeling of it slightly helping calm his hormones slightly. Panting, and with great effort, leaving him mentally exhausted, Jack somehow forcibly lowers his arousal, feeling extremely tired in the process, as well as slightly feint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes pass, and Jack is brought out of his daze by a hand on his shoulder. Looking up, Jack sees 'Sarah' in the clothing that had sent Jack into his near lust-haze, but notices that he's not reacting as much as before. As if reading his thoughts, or seeing something in his face, 'Sarah' speaks up, reminding Jack that it's not really Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Mistress, you are very lucky, but very foolish. To answer your possible question, you aren't as affected by this outfit, nor your unsatable libido currently, because you subconsciously channeled a huge amount of energy into dulling the effects for a time. Your lucky in that you didn't damage yourself, nor my body, as you just did the equivalent of forcing a hungry person to look at a steak, then tell them no, aggressively. It was foolish, as you could have fractured your mind, soul, and possibly been permanently stuck as a succubus, but without any goal aside from sex....non-stop sex....until either you die, or your victim does, and you moved on to a new one. Next time, either ask me for help, or give into your new natural instinct, as fighting it could be costly. As it is, you've spent a great deal of energy, so you won't be able to leave my body for a while until you recoup what you spent.\" Lilith explains, a look of relieved concern adorning 'her' face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked at how close he came to making such a major mistake, Jack is about to ask why she didn't mention it, until something in what she had said registered fully. ' \"natural instinct\" ....and i stubbornly fought it.....that hasn't turned out too well in history from what i rememeber...i need to be more careful in the future!' Jack mentally berates himself, before smiling tiredly at Lilith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, for both nearly injuring your body, as well as myself. Next time I'll ask you for advice on this, as I think I just realized that I'm not the only one affected by my decisions at this moment. Hopefully I don't make any similar mistakes too soon.\" Jack says, and upon hearing this, 'Sarah' smiles, and starts to help Jack to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for realizing that Mistress, and yes, while I do tease you and try to seduce you, it wouldn't do for me to let you kill yourself just yet, now are you ready to go to school?\" Lilith asks, a wink thrown in when she mentioned seducing and death. Chuckling, Jack merely nods his head, and 'Sarah' turns around, grabbing her bag, and opening the door to leave the room. Following along, Jack wonders what else will happen today, as it has barely started so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You know... so she wants me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Lilith said. \"But that is a little boring, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno.\" Jack said. \"Anyway, can we do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure...\" Lilith said. \"You're wired right into her, emotionally speaking. Just ... send some thoughts along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack imagined himself, his original body, with Sarah. In a warm, fluffy bed, completely naked, in a passionate embrace. He imagined them kissing, busy hands caressing and touching everything they could get to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think it's working.\" Lilith said. Jack watched as Sarah began to moan and very obviously touch herself under the covers. He could see one of her hands make its way directly to her crotch and move back and forth, while the other touched and went right through his own as she went to squeeze her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack\" she whispered, and continued to pleasure herself. Jack continued sending thoughts of his wildest dreams, feeling himself get aroused in the body he was currently in. But he wasn't sure whether it was his thoughts, Lilith's body, or watching Sarah covertly masturbating to him. Probably a mix of all three. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah let out another moan as he continued to imagine himself fucking her, and kicked off the covers. He could very clearly see one of her hands nestled right inside her pink panties, and it was very busy. She continued to moan, occasionally Jack's name, until she finally let out a high-pitched sound that sounded like pure pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes...\" she moaned quietly, still asleep, hand still in her panties, which were getting slightly wet from her action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was more fun than I thought\" Lilith said. \"Want to move on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack thought for a minute, looking at Sarah's sleeping body, then at his own - Lilith's naked body.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Upon hearing the request, Jack feels a surge of arousal flood his body, as well as a sense of incredible happiness. Nearly falling over from the sudden sensations, Jack doesn't notice the sudden dulling of feeling in 'his' limbs, nor that he can no longer speak aloud. He figures out something has changed, when he attempts to speak, and realizes his mouth isn't working, nor can he move his hands or feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh Master, you've just made me a very happy succubus, as we can have so much fun now, and trust me, we are going to!\" Lilith chuckles, sounding excited at the prospect of being in the driver's seat with Jack riding shotgun. Jack, wondering if he just made a huge mistake, also can't help the feeling that Lilith's words may prove prophetic .... and hopes that somehow the world doesn't end from this choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0As Jack ponders his questionable choice, he fails to notice that Sarah's room has faded out for a more familiar setting; Jacks room, standing over his body with a hand moving over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His attention caught finally, Jack sees what is finally occurring, and wonders what Lilith is doing, as well as why it involves his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"That's simple master, I figure i can have some fun, and maybe you can learn some magic, and get inspired in uses of your new powers. Also it's been so very long since I've had a cock in me,'Lilith explains, ending with lust heavy in her voice, and a tingle shuddering through her body, which makes Jack feel slightly odd, yet turned on as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Freaked out, Jack starts to plead for Lilith to either changer her mind, or at least put him back in his body, then stops cold at what Lilith informs him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well Master, I'm merely using my time before possessing you to my advantage, but if you insist, I can possess you directly and let you experience 'me' finding some nice male attention, maybe even a pair,\" Lilith teases, still moving her hands over Jack's body, which seems to be glowing slightly at this point, as well as a noticeable change in his pelvic region.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ceasing movement over Jacks body, Lilith merely snaps her fingers, and both bodies are suddenly nude, with Jacks sitting up, looking awake, if not for the vacant stare peering out. Feeling her Master's morbid curiosity at what she has done, Lilith decides to explain, while directing his body to action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Using terms you would understand Master, I've used a spell that creates a puppet soul that will occupy your body, and follow commands and act on my behalf until either it runs out of energy, or it is dismissed or banished.\" Lilith pauses in her explanation with a low moan, as 'Jack' has moved around, until 'he' was face first in her crotch, eating her out with great gusto, or at least as much as Lilith had programmed in apparently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Ahh, that feels good. Nothing like a nice warm-up. Never doubt the power of foreplay Master, as while Succubi are always ready, not all women are, and we do enjoy the buildup as it is,\"Lilith muses, moaning and directing 'Jack's' head towards more sensitive spots. Jack felt everything Lilith felt currently, and was only listening to half of Lilith's explanations, as the other half was drowned out in his constant lewd moan, that if it had volume, would continually rise after each of Lilith's redirections of 'Jack's' ministrations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Mhm, I hope your paying attention Jack, as you can either learn important spots on a female body, or use this spell as a computer programmer would - programming the puppet to do as you wish, or act as you want. The only limitation would be the more instructions left behind, the shorter its time, unless more power is used. Ahh, yes, that's it, right there. As i was saying, If you programmed a puppet with all of your mannerisms, and had it act as you for a day, it might make it through school, but would possibly 'short-out' either part way through the day, or just after entering your house, depending on random occurrences, OH FUCK,\" Lilith lectures, then shouts loudly as an orgasm ripples through her being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack whites out momentarily, as all the sensations, while trying to pay attention to Lilith's impromptu lesson, lets the sudden orgasm catch him by surprise. Coming too, Jack feels euphoric, but also overstimulated. Hoping Lilith is done with her teachings, Jack focuses on whats going on, and find himself in an odd position, as while any healthy male will explain, dreaming is one thing, but reality is different, especially from a different point of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Jack's point of view is that of sitting astride of his own body, looking at an alteration that he had overlooked by Lilith's actions, as well as his attempts at trying to listen to her. His average sized cock had been changed, into what looked like a foot long, In addition, it seemed to have gained what looked similar to a canine knot, as well as ridges along its length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Please tell me the changes aren't permanent Lilith, and why they were even necessary!?!] Jack mentally shouts at Lilith, freaked out that she had altered him in such a way, but also slightly curious as to what effects it would have....if he wasn't about to be on the receiving end!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, the changes are reversible, and besides, I thought I would increase 'our' pleasure, and take something I found in another mortals mind from some story they had read on the internet. Now I hope your ready, as I'm not waiting anymore!\" Lilith responds laughingly, until she thrusts herself down on the altered tool of 'Jack'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shouts of pleasure resound throughout the room, as well as inside Lilith's head, as the additions make themselves known. Each ridge seems to bump Lilith's clit, acting as if little speed bumps to stimulate her already sensitive pussy, ratcheting the arousal and pleasure up with each ridge bumped against it. Moaning loudly, and bottoming out after what felt like eternity to Jack, Lilith pauses to let him catch his 'breath'. After a few moments, she starts moving, screaming her pleasure for all to hear, as well as enjoying the unending moans from Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Multiple times Jack whites out, only to come back to intense pleasure, that seems to increase as time goes on, as well as feeling like one continuous orgasm is about to happen if it keeps going on like this. Deciding to let her Master have some form of rest, Lilith reaches down, and pinches her clit, shuddering while yet another orgasm lances through her body, and sending Jack unconscious, and if he had one at the moment, a stupid-happy grin plastered on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack comes to some time later, unable to tell what the time is, and also noticing that he still cannot move. Wondering if the pitch black setting around him is because of the time of day, or if because Lilith has her eyes closed, Jack is suddenly assailed by color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Good morning Master, or should i say evening?\" Lilith asks, as Jack gets his first view of the surroundings since waking. He's currently in his room still, but doesn't see his body anywhere, nor can he tell what time it is from where Lilith's head is pointed. Chuckling at this, Lilith turns her head without asking, and Jack is able to see the clock, stating that it is 10pm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n[How is it ten at night....don't tell me i slept through the day!] Jack shouts, freaking out that he lost almost a whole day, and having no idea what trouble Lilith has gotten into without him around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Laughing at his train of thought, Lilith decides to take pity on Jack, and starts to explain, while looking downward, showing that Jack is currently in his body, with alterations still in place, but with Lilith still in control it seems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You did indeed sleep through the day Master. It seems that  you unconsciously used the bit of magic available to you to stay coherent enough to last through all the orgasmic feelings you were having, but upon depletion, and the last orgasm you felt, your mind shut down to recuperate, as well as recharge what little reserves you had. As to your worry about me getting into trouble, well....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

While riding shotgun has been interesting, I'm starting to feel slightly restless, what with the not being able to move myself] Jack says mentally to Lilith, prompting a non-masculine giggle to erupt from Lilith's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Aww, and here I thought I had kept you entertained enough with such a new experience. But if that is your wish Master, I can accommodate it for now,\" Lilith responds after regaining her composure. Standing up, Lilith moves her hand up to her chest, and starts to trace invisible lines in the air, before Jack looses sight of her actions, as his world fades to black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The world suddenly bursts into color, and Jack feels control over limbs again, as well as full sensation of the air on his skin, instead of that slightly dulled affect he hadn't noticed from before while being possessed. Shaking his head, Jack pauses mid-shake, as he notices a curtain of red hair dangle in front of his face. Looking downward, Jack sees that he apparently isn't in his body, as he's now sporting large melon-sized breasts on his chest, and feels a slight breeze in his nethers. Slightly amused that Lilith apparently stuck him in a female body, Jack pushes it away, and starts to take in his surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He apparently is still in his room, over near the desk, and looking around, notices that Lilith is on the bed, smiling widely while pumping her tool slowly. Shaking his head again, Jack tries to focus on gathering what Lilith did as him, but is having trouble, as his gaze keeps wandering back to Lilith's actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking a moment to consider his attention issues, Jack realizes that he's been feeling a slight static tingle in both his pussy and chest, not painful, but a dull pleasant 'hum' that seems to get slightly louder the longer he looks at Lilith stroking her cock. Dazed, Jack finally realizes that Lilith has been talking to him, the whole time that he had been zoned out on her movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"...I did happen to score you a date with Melissa Robinson for tomorrow night, as well as one with Sarah the night after, but she's under the impression it's just two friends hanging out. All in all, it was a peaceful day, and that is saying something since i was around unsupervised,\" Lilith says, winking after noticing Jack has finally come back to coherence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Wait, why would you set me up on dates? Not that I'm ungrateful, but last I checked Melissa was dating Shaun Gregory, the star of our football team. Also, why would Sarah choose to hang out with me on a school night, she usually has practice and other things she usually does most of the time. Did you use magic or something?\" Jack asks, startled and confused about what Lilith has said, at least, what he actually heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well Mistress, I figured you would like to have some fun, and start learning more on how to use and harness your powers. One of the simplest and fun ways is through sex, the more passionate and lustful, the better. As to Sarah, she's the one that technically came onto me, just like Melissa did. I didn't have to use any powers because it was technically your fault, I merely accepted on your behalf.\" Lilith says, increasing her hand's pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fighting his sudden urge to focus on Lilith's antics, Jack takes a moment to think over what she had just said. 'My fault, how would that be the case, since i was unconscious for the whole day? Guess I'll have to ask for clarification' Jack silently ponders, before refocusing on Lilith's face, as he felt it might be safer than taking in her whole body (and its actions).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"How was it my fault that they both came up to me asking for dates....and you still didn't explain Melissa asking when last I heard, she was dating Shaun,\" Jack states, unconsciously starting to rub his thighs together, as his increased hormones were starting to get to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Smirking at the success her actions of teasing had accomplish, Lilith took her time in answering Jack. Moments of silence fill the room, before she finally lets out a put-upon sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"I guess you don't recall what I told you when we first met, Mistress. Your body now produces pheromones that will attract women to you, whether they're attached to someone or not. As to the Melissa dating issue, she said that she had dumped him the night before, and wished to pursue you. If anything, I probably could have invited her to the bathroom or roof of your school, and gotten some wild sex on campus if i had merely asked, her Lust was pleasantly intoxicating to me while talking to her. Oh, I almost forgot to mention, your pheromone strength apparently doubles if I'm possessing you, so I wouldn't be too surprised if you get a lot of people asking for dates, if not just quickies in the near future.\" Lilith answers with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shocked by her explanation, Jack looks away in thought, not noticing Lilith stop her masturbating, and silently get up from the bed.<br>\r\n'So technically it was my fault, as it was my body, as well as my blunder in letter her have free reign as me, that got me those dates....not that i'm really complaining,' Jack thought to himself, not noticing Lilith sneak past his view and silently stand behind him. 'I wonder what I should do about the dates, cause while they do sound fun, I don't exactly know Melissa too well, and I don't to accidentally drag Sarah into any magical shenanigans at this moment, not until i get more control over my powers.' Jack ponders silently, before his attention is suddenly snapped back to his surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lilith, bored that Jack is fighting his lust, and deep in thought, had decided to try teasing him more thoroughly, by playing with his body, that she had very intimate experience in teasing. While seeing him deep in thought, Lilith had snuck up behind him, then slowly reached her hand out to encircle him in a partial hug, ready to grab his breasts and plaster her body against his. Taking a moment to savor the excitement of surprise and mischief she was about to unleash, Lilith broke Jack's thoughts by quickly encircling his arms, and latching her hands onto his breasts, while molding her body tightly against his bare back and ass, slowly rubbing her altered tool against his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Whoa, w-what are y-you doing Lilith!?\" Jack squeaks out, surprised and slightly aroused by sudden stimulation, and secretly, the feeling of being partially pinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Why Mistress, I thought I would help you with your attention issues, as you keep seeming to get distracted while we were talking. I know that my body has a higher libido that most, but I also know the simplest way of keeping it in check, is to indulge it, quite often if I can. Also, while you may have experience sex as me while I was in control, you haven't experienced the pleasures of sex from the female perspective, at least not with you being an active participant, yet.\" Lilith responds seductively, increasing the pace of her rubbing against Jacks cheeks, as well as the gentle massaging of his breasts, gently pulling on them at random intervals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After saying such, Lilith starts to lightly kiss the back of Jacks neck and earlobe, occasionally nibbling on it, and causing Jack to shudder and writhe in place. Removing one hand from her ministrations of Jack's boobs, Lilith moves it down towards Jacks pelvis, before gently pulling her legs apart, prompting jack to unconsciously follow her silent orders. Accomplishing that, Lilith moves her hand up to Jacks soaking pussy, and starts to rub her hand at the top of it, while slowly lowering her pelvis to angler her cock to rub against Jack's now exposed and wet slit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shuddering from all this stimulation, Jack tries to regain his focus, but knows it's a losing battle, as Lilith knows her body very well, and has set him masterfully. Jack's mind momentarily blanks out, as Lilith, sensing Jack finally getting some measure of thought to function, instead of acting on instinct, reaches her boob massaging hand forward slightly, and lightly pinches the areola, sending a lance of pleasure throughout Jacks body, and causing a mini-orgasm to occur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack screams out in pleasure, surprised about the sudden lance of electricity that seemed to travel from his nipple to his core, then spread out through the rest of his body. Shuddering Jack nearly falls boneless against Lilith, who hasn't paused in her ministrations, even after her sneak attack on Jack's teat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"So Mistress, would you like to continue the pleasure here, or on the bed?\" Lilith asks huskily, increasing the pace of her hand and lightly dipping a finger into Jacks pussy at random intervals, causing deeper moans to escape his lips each time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nearly blinded by the constant pleasure and teasing that Lilith is subjecting him to, Jack has a moment of clarity, and says aloud...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

Smirking at these words, Lilith lets up on her ministrations, and guides Jack, who is still dazed, towards the nearby wall. After making sure they're close enough, Lilith spins him towards her, and launches forward, her mouth capturing Jack's, and earns a squeal of pleasure from Jack, who continues to moan into Lilith's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pleased by this, Lilith renews her previous actions, but stops short of penetrating Jack, as she want's him fully cognizant for that moment. Smirking at the thought, Lilith starts to fondle Jack's boobs with one hand, and lightly rub and tease his exposed clit with the other, continuing to dry hump Jack's leaking slit, earning even louder moans, as well as occasional gasps when Jack has a mini-orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack's world is just one blur of bliss, only changing when a new sensation adds to the symphony of sensations coursing through his overstimulated body. Slowly, while still feeling the full effects of pleasure coursing through him, Jack starts to regain some sense of his surroundings, such as his back against the cool wall, adding a pleasant chill to his overheating body. Realizing that he's still locked in a kiss with Lilith, who hasn't let up in awhile, Jack wonders how they could have kept it up so long, when he receives an unexpected response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0[Ah, so your finally aware again Mistress? Wonderful, while it's fun to play my old body like a harp, it does get dull when there's no new reaction after awhile. As to the kiss, well, your new body doesn't require air, nor food, as you live off the energy you absorb, as well as excess energy in the air, though that doesn't' mean you can go forever without 'feeding'.] Jack hears in his mind, with Lilith's normal voice, instead of her body's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Suddenly all the pleasant feelings afflicting Jack's body stop, and he looks up as the kiss between him and Lilith is broken off as well. Confused, Jack opens his mouth to ask if something is wrong, when he catches sight of Lilith sporting a massive grin, and a gleam of pure lust filling her eyes. Worried about what shes about to do, Jack starts to wonder when he's suddenly answered by a sudden wave of pleasure striking at his core. Looking down, Jack sees himself speared on Lilith's altered cock, its engorged size splitting him in half. Shocked that it even fit in him, even if he had seen/felt it previously, Jack's mind strains to keep coherent from the sudden arousal flooding his body, as Lilith renews her previous actions, eliciting loud continuous moans from Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the initial lance of pleasure, Jack's world becomes one continuous wave of bliss, as Lilith starts off at a slow pace of thrusting, and after a few minutes of enjoying and adapting to what garnered the loudest moans, changed her pace to a faster and slightly rougher one, causing Jack to scream loudly, as over-stimulation causes him to keep launching into orgasm after orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Loud slaps of flesh punctuated by loud screams of pleasure fill the room, and in a small part of Jack's mind, he wonders how no one has come to investigate what has caused all this noise. Sadly, that small part of Jack's mind is shoved far down and out of reach, as his bodies nature demands all attention to be focused on pleasure, whether giving or receiving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another few minutes of thrusting, and one more change of pace, to the point where loud thumping can be heard, as Jack's body is slightly pulled away from the wall, and rammed into it repeatedly, as well as the occasional squelching sound, as Jack's pussy has overflown with his juices leaking out enough to cause such a sound. On one last thrust, Lilith grins, and catches Jack's limited attention, prompting her to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Did you never wonder about the alterations I made to your body's cock, Mistress? While it might seem aesthetic, it's fully functional in its design,\" Lilith states, sounding smug and eager to see the reaction to her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack's perception of time pauses as he's somehow able to hear and comprehend Lilith's words. 'Well, from what I saw when Lilith was in control, and I was the passenger, she made my dick look like a ....Oh SHIT!' Jack comprehends, as he recalls that Lilith had given his body a knotted cock that seemed similar to a canines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seeing that Jack has realized what she had hinted at, Lilith thrust one last time, and explodes against Jacks insides, also locking them in place, as her knot flared out completely. Jack screams out louder than he previously had, overstimulated as well as shocked by what Lilith had said and done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Coming down from his orgasmic high, Jack starts to wonder why Lilith would mention such a thing, when he feels her start to slowly thrust lightly inside him again, the knot bumping against his insides, locked in place, but also causing untold amounts of pleasure to spread through his body. Shuddering, Jack looks up towards Lilith, hands trying to scrabble weakly to grab her shoulders, and sees her grin wickedly, while lightly picking Jack up, and carrying him to the bed. Each step taken feeling as if he's being strained, as the knot pulls roughly against his inside, not yielding and stimulating Jack deeply. Shuddering after having yet another orgasm just from the short steps it took to get to the bed, Jack is lightly placed on his back, and then gently kissed on the lips by Lilith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Don't worry, even if you pass out, I'm sure you'll enjoy it, as I know I'm not done yet,\" Lilith says sweetly, lust still flooding her eyes, as she starts to gently thrust into Jack again, causing the low moaning to return, parsed with the occasional squeal of pleasure. Getting her previous rhythm, Lilith picks up the pace, flooding Jack with intense pleasure yet again, and causing his mind to finally shut down from over-stimulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chuckling at her Mistress finally succumbing, Lilith continues to take her pleasure from Jack's unconscious form, not perturbed by it, as she knows that even unconscious, the body will react, as succubi bodies are more instinct driven than thought based.<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack wakes up slowly, feeling blissfully full, as well as content, with occasional jolts of pleasure coursing through him. 'Wait, why would I be happy with being full? Could this be an instinctual thought conceptualized?....when did I even learn such things?' Jack ponders silently, only being drawn out of his internal musings by a voice speaking behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Finally awake Mistress? Good, I hope you don't mind, but I felt we needed to change positions, as were still joined at the moment,\" Lilith says behind him, lightly running her hands over Jacks arms and legs at random intervals, sending shivers to run through Jack. Upon hearing this, Jack realizes he can still feel the knot in him, not as large and flared as before, but still not deflated enough to decouple him from Lilith. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Sighing, Jack decides that while stuck here, he might be able to get some answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"So, any reason why you felt the need to alter my old bodies cock into such a thing, especially when you had apparently planned on at some point getting me to have sex with you in the male position,\" Jack asks, not even realizing that he hadn't known the last detail until speaking it, further cementing his earlier thought/instinct that his new body was able to instill information to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hearing Jack's question, Lilith chuckles, causing Jack to feel slight movement in his pussy, as Lilith's cock twitches from the vibrations it caused, sending tiny shockwaves of pleasure through Jacks body. \"Well, I didn't think the instinctual synching would begin this soon, but you are a surprising one, Mistress.\" Lilith purrs. \"I'll admit, I only caused this alteration to test out some of the things I had come across from your mind, as well as the brief glimpses I picked up from nearby peoples, one of which mentioned such transformations and the interesting things sex with the transformed could get up to. I believe a reference to a specific scenario, that I adapted to his, came from Sarah's house, something that was about an gynoid and space captain, that got up to interesting antics with specialized attachments, including a knotted tentacle cock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack shudders at the mental image that springs to mind, slightly aroused by the thoughts of what fun it could be to test out some different transformations and such. Snapping out of his mini fantasy, and even if he couldn't see it, knew that Lilith was smirking behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"If the clenching your pussy just did is any indication, I think your not so much upset about this outcome, as it was you not either being in control, or being surprised by it,\" Lilith responds smugly, reaching around and gently cupping one of Jack's breasts to massage it, eliciting a sigh from Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Conceding the point, and at least getting some answers, Jack settled in to his current position, shifting slightly until he felt completely comfortable, or at least as comfortable as one can get when knotted.<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An hour passes with light fondling and massaging being done between Jack and Lilith, with occasional small talk of random facts, both recent and ancient. Finally, the knot deflates enough that Jack slowly eases himself up and away from Lilith, and lifts himself slowly, expecting gallons of cum to come flooding out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Upon seeing none, Jack wonders, and his new instincts give him the answer. ' Cum directly absorbed into body to store for energy for spells and nourishment. Huh, that's convenient,' Jack thought to himself, moving somewhat quicker, and relieved he could finally move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feeling slightly empty and sad, Jack stands, and moves over to the desk, looking at the Book. Wondering what to do now, Jack ponders his options...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

While having all this power, and new sensations that kept reminding him that he was definitely able to experience new things, he had no idea of what to do now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Noticing her Master's sudden idleness, and getting the sneaky thought of having some fun, Lilith silently casts a silencing spell on the room. Upon successfully anchoring it Lilith speaks up, using their shared mouth, startling Jack out of his contemplative mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Master, while i know you said you wished to be me for a while to get experience in the female form, standing around in Sarah's room is not much of an experience, even if you now have the female form,\" Lilith teases, while subtly increasing Jack's arousal in small increments. Mentally smirking upon seeing the success her manipulation has caused, as well as the possible avenues it has opened, Lilith continues. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You can now enjoy the pleasures of masturbation in the female form master,\" Lilith states factually, while taking a moment to pause while manipulating the sensitivity of 'their' body. \"If that does not interest you Master, though i do not know why it wouldn't, you could always find a male, and enjoy the use of a 'partner' to get the full female experience.\" Upon finishing that sentence, Lilith tweaks both there pussy and breasts inner nerve endings, causing Jack to collapse to 'his' knees, moaning loudly and shuddering from the sudden pleasure attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Mentally crowing that her actions were bearing fruit, Lilith continues on, sounding as if she doesn't notice what was currently happening to Jack. <br>\r\n\"If, for some reason you don't find sex that interesting at this moment,\" pausing again to tweak their nethers, eliciting another loud moan and shudder from Jack, \" there is always the option to cast spells, or wander around the town to find some fun.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Jack, who is trying to catch his breath from the sudden onslaught of sensations, and barely able to comprehend what Lilith has stated so far. With great effort, and hope that these pleasurable jolts are merely him getting used to her body (and getting the sinking feeling that she's messing with him), Jack attempts to focus on what Lilith is saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"...As a last option, to make it even more interesting, you could put me in your body for the next day, and follow me around your school, causing mischief or having fun with your new abilities,\" Lilith states, mentally laughing from the fun she's having with messing with Jack. As she finishes stating options, she decides to make sure Jack experiences the difference between male and female pleasure, and tweaks their shared clit and g-spot nerve endings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Able to hear the last of Lilith's ideas, and wondering what sounded like a good plan to follow, Jack falls over, screaming loudly in euphoric ecstasy, feeling as if lightning has struck his body repeatedly, and is continuously running it's charge through it on a loop. Writhing on the ground, panting and trying to gain control over his body, Jack attempts focus, and speak, taking a lot longer than he thought it would to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Fuck, that was intense! Also, Lilith, while i do appreciate the sensation, that was kinda messed up. Especially since i was taking your opinion seriously,\" Jack tries to chide Lilith, and fails to sound truly upset, especially with the shudders still sporadically running through his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Aww, I merely wished to emphasize the differences between the male and female forms, Master. I'm sorry that you feel my help wasn't useful in such an endeavor, but I do appreciate you taking my opinions into account,\" Lilith states sincerely, but with a hint of hidden laughter lacing her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Sighing, and realizing that Lilith has been helping, even if she's been taking immense pleasure at keeping him off-balance, Jack attempts to slowly get back to his feet, the last shudders of pleasure from the unexpected 'Lilith-induced' orgasms finally fading. Once standing, Jack mentally runs over the options Lilith listed, and decides to go with the one sounding interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"At this point, I think it would be interesting to have you go to school as me, and I follow you around and have fun there. Who knows, maybe we both will have fun,\" Jack states, not able to see the shit-eating grin that plasters Lilith's mental face upon hearing Jack's decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"As you wish Master. Did you want me to get us to your house, or did you wish to attempt it?\" Lilith asks, contemplating how much fun she could have with Jack's choice. To be nice, as more fun was guaranteed now, Lilith subtly reversed her previous changes, all the while salivating at the opportunities of mischief and fun Jack presents.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I can try, as long as you tell me how Lilith,\" Jack responds after a momentary pause. Suddenly, as if he knew it all along, information on soul-shifting, a form of teleportation for souls, appears in Jacks mind. Curious if it's Lilith supplying the information, or if it's the current body hes in, Jack shakes his head, and attempts to use the new technique he now 'knows'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0A sudden feeling as if his body has been bent at an odd angle, and then yanked, Jack appears in his room, but stumbles and falls onto the bed. Upon landing on the bed, face first, Jack hears laughter, and realizes its coming from his mouth. Frowning, the laughter stops, and Lilith simply comments 'oh come on, you would find it humorous too about newbies and their landings.' Wondering what she means, a plethora of images, all centered around people trying stunts of differing types (biking, skateboarding, parkour) trying a stunt, and landing awkwardly, if not horribly. Seeing her point, Jacks frown ceases, and he slowly pushes himself up and off the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well Master, at this point, I think you should help me into my new body, and let me get some sleep, as <i>I</i> have school in soon,\" Lilith states innocently. While she felt she could still have fun messing with Jack, she also knew that she would have more opportunity later on at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Unable to argue with Lilith's statement, Jack experiments, and tries to 'recall' the information on moving souls from body to body. Moments after thinking about it, the information appears in his mind. Raising his index finger to his mouth, Jack focuses, and slowly moves it away, feeling a slight tug on something from inside his current body. After long seconds of teasing something out, Jack sees a glowing purplish-pink ball of flame floating on his fingertip. Mesmerized by the sight, and the intricate pattern of its shifting 'flames', Lilith's sudden clearing of her throat - 'how is that even possible?' Jack wonders - snaps his attention back to his task. Moving the soul towards his body, Jack slowly lowers it to the open mouth. As if a vacuum was suddenly turned on, the soul is suddenly yanked off Jack's hand, and sucked into the mouth of Jack's old body. Curious about the sudden reaction, Jack is startled by the sudden opening of eyes, and grin that near instantly formed upon seeing Jack standing above the body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0For one last spot of mischief before the next days fun, Lilith lifts an arm up towards Jack, catching the fabric of 'her' shirt, and yanks down. Pulled off balance, and barely getting 'her' arms out to catch 'herself' Jack is suddenly surprised by the sudden actions, and following passionate lip-lock Lilith initiates between them. Unbridled Lust surges through Jack, causing his arms to nearly buckle from loss of control. Just as he was getting into the kiss, and ready to do more, Lilith stops, and gently pushes Jack back, with a 'butter-wont-melt-in-mouth' smile plastered on her face. \"I simply wished for a good night kiss, <i>Mistress</i>.\" Upon saying this, Lilith lays back down and closes her eyes, settling in for sleep apparently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Highly aroused, and nearly bursting with desire to ravage his old body, Jack lets out a frustrated moan, while taking a few steps back. Taking deep breaths, and trying to focus on non-lustful thoughts (a very hard thing to do in a lust-created being), Jack tries to calm down. Silently grumbling after minutes of agonizingly fighting the incessant lust flowing throughout his body, Jack finally realizes he has nowhere to sleep. 'Ugh, if her teasing wasn't enough, she didn't even give me an idea of where she sleeps, or if she even does,' Jack mentally whines. Upon focusing on those thoughts, Jack learned some surprising facts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Succubus' do, in fact, sleep, but they do not need it as humans do, nor as often. Instead, they can bypass said need by simply expending their energy (usually gained from lustful acts), or meditating. Sadly, not many have been able to meditate successfully, as the longer a Succubus goes without lustful acts, or the essence of others, the more aroused and distracted they become, until they go into the equivalent of a beserk-like state - fucking everything in site until their base need is met, which could be anything from two orgasms, to hundreds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Shuddering at the influx of information, and the previously unknown reason why succubi could have such a bad reputation, Jack notices it said nothing to help with his current situation. Thinking about it more, Jack gets inspired, and moves towards the Book on the desk, and opens it. Thumbing through the pages, Jack is pleasantly surprised that it has the spell he was looking for, not honestly expecting it. Concentrating, Jack makes the hand motions, with a clear image in his mind, and finishes with a snap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0*Poof*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A small bed appears on the wall, opposite of 'Jack's' bed. Feeling mentally fatigued, Jack stumbles over to it, and lays down, not even considering trying to disrobe or play with his new body right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0The next day...</span></div></div>",

After three times of this happening, Jack decided to try meditation, as sleep apparently wasn't what his body was going to let him have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack was able to get two hours of meditation in, but was interrupted by a sudden pain in his breasts, prompting him to open his eyes and see his old body (momentarily confusing him at such a sight), pinching his nipple, smirking while looking down at him. After the initial pain, Jack's body seemed to flood with arousal, as well as an undeniable urge to tackle 'Jack' who let go and stepped back a few steps away from him. Fighting down his urges, as well as trying to use his annoyance to help with it, Jack finally calms down enough to actually focus on his surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Looking around, Jack notices that light is filtering into the room through the gap in his closed curtains. Panning his view, he finally looks towards the clock, and sees that its ten till seven am. Shocked at the time, Jack turns his gaze back to 'Jack' and notices 'he's' fully dressed, with 'his' bag on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Welcome back, Mistress. I guess you didn't wish to explore your form, nor let your body follow instinct, and decided to try to meditate?\" 'Jack' asked, sounding smug while looking down at Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well yes, after waking up three times to unconscious masturbation, I decided to try something else, as while my body was willing, I personally didn't want to indulge. It might be foolish, especially since your bodies memories are answering many questions, but I just felt like I should adjust to my new situation before enjoying it.\" Jack responds, seeming somewhat unsure, and slightly embarrassed, if the blush that crossed his face was any indication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah, that is true, and something I don't think anyone has ever previously considered. I'm glad your at least thinking things out, instead of falling deeper into your new base instincts. Many a foolish Master has fallen victim to overindulging, and suffered the consequences.\"Lilith says thoughtfully.\" Before you ask why i did not warn you, consider the fact that while I'm here to guide you, you would not be able to learn much if I simply held your hand the whole time. The best way to learn is to experiment, with the occasional guidance keeping you out of some danger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hearing this, Jack's face scrunches up in consideration, as Lilith's words ring true, especially as he feels much more at ease with himself now than he did before trying to sleep and meditate. Nodding to himself, Jack stands up, feeling his back pop in a couple of places. Stretching, and seeing the leer that spreads across 'Jack's' face at the sight of his stretching, Jack adds a little hop to his stretch, amused by the sight of 'Jack's' eyes following the movement of his breasts. Giggling, he finishes his stretch, and looks down at his clothes. Seeing that the had shifted into a negligee with a tasteful cut to its chest area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Knowledge on his new shape-shifting powers floods Jack's mind, and his clothing starts to change, as he morphs it from his current clothing, into what he desires for the day's adventure. Slowly the negligee shrinks inward, exposing his naked pussy, followed by his taut stomach, and finally disappearing into the straps around his shoulders, exposing his impressive bust to 'Jack', who licks 'his' lips hungrily. Standing there naked and aroused by the admiring gaze focused on his current body, Jack decides to tease 'Jack' as he had been when their roles had been reversed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Slowly swaying in place, Jack forms a red thong in hand, that leaves little to the imagination, and slowly slips it on, not taking his gaze off 'Jack' who is now slowly moving his hands towards his crotch. Smirking, Jack forms a ultra-thin white blouse, and starts to put it on, before considering that while most people wont see him unless he lets them, he might still want the option of it, so puts the blouse on the bed behind him, turning around to thrust his ass at 'Jack' hearing a sharp hiss of breath, as well as the sound of a low groan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Still turned around, Jack decides to create a black lacy balcony bra, and slowly slip it on, still swaying to an invisble tune, and hearing the sound of unzipping behind him. Smirking, Jack turns around, and sees 'Jack' has pulled his cock out, and started stroking it, intent on relieving it's pressure. 'Not this time, Lilith' Jack thinks, and silently casts a spell, just as 'Jack' starts to moan loudly, only to stop and glare at Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"You know, I honestly didn't think you would start your payback this soon, but I guess i deserve this somewhat, but hurry up, we need to leave soon if you want to keep with your plan,\" 'Jack' whines, after taking a moment to admit that this is 'his' fault for earlier actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Simply smiling at this, Jack continues his teasing, next forming a black micro-skirt, and slowly sliding up his legs, turning to the side as he bent over to pull it up, earning yet another groan from 'Jack'. Standing up after swaying his ass in place for a few moments, Jack turns towards the bed, and picks up the previously placed blouse, and pulls it on. Feeling that the blouse isn't just right, Jack focuses, and the lower part of the blouse shrinks until settling just under his bust, showing off alot of his midriff. Sighing at feeling 'complete', Jack turns around, and see's 'Jack' looking pleadingly towards him, almost begging for release. Chuckling, Jack snaps his finger, lifting the spell he had cast, and quickly moving out of the way, as 'Jack's' release flew through the air, landing in the exact spot Jack had been previously, going on continuously for a good thirty seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whistling in appreciation of such a feat, Jack smiles at the dazed look that has crossed 'Jack's' face from his orgasm. Poking 'him' in the shoulder, and gaining his attention, Jack mimes zipping up, then turns around and moves towards the door, not bothering to open it, and moves through it to the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hearing an angry growl, and a low muttered comment of \"fucking tease,\" causing Jack to giggle silently, Jack continues on down the hall, the stairs, and then to the living room, seeing no one around. 'Guess the rest of the family left early,' Jack thought to himself, finally hearing Lilith coming down the stairs and stopping behind him. Turning around, Jack sees that she is more under control, and ready to leave. Simply nodding to her, Jack walks towards the front door, and walks through it, heading towards his car, followed shortly by Lilith, who still had to open doors to go in and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After getting into the car, they take off, neither bothering to talk as it was only a five minute drive to the school. Parking in his usual spot, even though he wasn't driving, both Succubus and Warlock got out, and turned to look at the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"So what are you going to do now, Mistress, that we are at school? It is about fifteen minutes until my English class starts, unless you wish to cast a spell and alter such. If not, you can simply amuse yourself here, or even follow some commands I give you during any classes. Otherwise, I have no idea what your plan is, aside from having fun,\" Lilith says, breaking the silence that had been between them since leaving the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Considering what Lilith had just said, Jack took a moment to really think about what he should do. 'While I'm now a creature of Lust and Love, and my 'memories' could help, I really don't know what to do at the moment, aside from either follow Lilith, or experiment with spells on random people in the school.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"I don't rightly know Lilith, as this was kind of a spur of the moment decision, if you recall. Saying that, I guess I'll...\"</span></span></div></div>",

Also, you could travel to other locations, and explore. You could even have me occupy your life for a day, and either follow me around doing my requests, or practice some magic from the book while I'm at school for you.

Sadly, Jack's ego promptly fell towards said effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"While I could do that, how would we enforce it, since you could simply ask me something truly outrageous, and I would balk and most likely, and understandably, back out.\" Jack responds, not even thinking about the fact that he's considering her suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mentally smirking, and keeping her physical form from giving away the game, Lilith holds back her glee at causing Jack to stumble into such mischief. \"That's simple master. All you need to do is swear a <b><i>geas</i></b> to follow my orders for the day, or suffer the penalty, which we can work out before you swear it. I'll even be generous and give you two free 'skips' for whatever I order,\" Lilith explains, excited about possibly having her master under her control for a day, granted he would probably only try for the 8 hours of school, but that would be easy to manage into longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"First let's get home, so I can think about this, as well as see what the book has to say about <i><b>geas</b></i>, as what little i know from history says they're very dangerous,\" Jack answers, somewhat apprehensive, but also feeling like he should consider the option, if nothing else to show he is willing to push his own boundaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As he mentions home, Jack notices the world around him shift rapidly, and is now in a familiar room, his room to be exact. Surprised about how that happened, Jack wonders if it was Lilith, or her body acting on his stated desire. Shrugging, and getting momentarily distracted by the sudden shift of weight on his chest, being reminded about his boobs, and then why he wanted to be back in his room, Jack walks towards his desk, where the Book innocently sits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Long moments of searching the Book, and noticing that he can read alot more of it than he could before, Jack finally comes upon the section that talks about geas'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i><b>Geas</b></i> are not to be taken lightly, unless one believes they know enough loopholes to avoid breaking it, or they have complete trust in the one laying the geas upon them. The most drastic thing to consider when involved in one is the wording, as in most cases, it is <i><b>Literal</b></i>, and depending on the circumstances, can lead to death (most commonly leads to death, but some find that outcome to be less appealing). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reading the section over multiple times, turning it over in his head until he believes he understands it and its implications, Jack considers if he should take Lilith's challenge and submit to a geas. Long minutes pass by, silence filling the room, when Jack finally comes to a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Lilith, I'm willing to take your challenge, as long as the wording is done correctly, and were both satisfied by it, and I want you under one as well, since I'm placing a great deal of trust in you.\" Jack states aloud, not exactly content, but willing to accept his course of action and not change it when the doubts creep in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"As you say Master, and that is actually quite understandable, surprisingly many don't consider a counter-geas as a safety precaution....thinking on it, a few previous book holders were caught in a trap by such a situation.\" Lilith responds, before taking control of Jack's hand and reaching for a piece of paper on the desk, along with a pen. Obtaining both, she begins writing out a standard geas phrasing, occasionally crossing out one word, or adding another above and between a pair of words.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Long minutes of scratching and scribbling sounds fill the room, with Jack reading what Lilith jots down and crosses out. As time drags on, Jack realizes he should work on phrasing exactly what he wants Lilith to swear, as he doesn't want her to take advantage of whatever he says, or in this case, doesn't say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0About a quarter of an hour after Jack began his inner dwelling on what he needed to construct, he's brought out of his mind, and notices a pristine paper, with two whole lines looking immaculately written on the center of the piece of paper. Surprised about how simple her work looks, Jack decides to look it over, before continuing on his own counter-geas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*I, Jack, swear to follow all commands given by Lilith for the period of the school day, no matter how outrageous or odd the command may be, until the end of said school day. I will accept the two free passes on orders given, that I can use at any time, and if I fail to uphold my geas, my time will be extended by two hours at each breaking of the geas.*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thinking it over, Jack realizes that as long as he trusts Lilith not to kill or completely screw him over, he doesn't have to be completely laywer-ish in his approach. Taking a minute, Jack quickly writes down his counter, and hopes that Lilith doesn't fight him too hard on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*I, Lilith, will not abuse the trust Jack has place in me, and will not trick him into going longer than 24 hours in penalties, nor will I cause his untimely death, or strand him in a horrible situation.*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Looking it over, and feeling generally satisfied with it, Jack prompts Lilith to give her input. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"I've looked over your geas, and find it reasonable, though I'm still worried about what you'll do. In any case, do you have any issue with what I've countered with?\" Jack asks, some trepidation filling him, as he doesn't know what he'll respond with if he's told that she wont go along with his counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"It's reasonable, and I'm glad you have some faith in me Master, but I would suggest being careful of your wording in the future. There are worse things than death, especially since we can play with souls, and from some points of view, death can be bad, but being stuck as a worm for its natural lifespan can be infinitely worse.\" Lilith answers, helpfully pointing out that while Jack is lucky that she apparently doesn't wish for him to die or suffer badly, he should learn more before entering into these kind of deals with others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After both agree that they're satisfied with the wording, Jack and Lilith state their geas', channeling their 'magic' while saying the spell (after Lilith walks Jack through on how to channel said magic during speaking). A feeling of a light chain settles over Jack, not constricting, but also noticeable in the fact that he knows that he's bound by his word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shuddering at this feeling, Jack manages to dismiss it for now, and stands up, moving over towards the bed, and his apparently sleeping body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Would you mind putting me in my new body for now, Master...or is it now Mistress, with how our agreement will be soon?\" Lilith asks, seeming amused by Jack's new title. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Har, Har. Now how exactly do I do this Lilith, since it would be nice to know how to do such things in the future, in case they're needed,\" Jack responds in a deadpan voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, for normal actions you would try to feel for the soul, which each being's will feel different, and slightly phantasmal than the physical feel you normally associate with. You can practice later, but for now, I'm going to speed things along, as I need to get some sleep for school that starts in six hours,\" Lilith says, and as she finishes talking with his mouth, Jacks legs suddenly give out while his right arm flings outward, causing him to turn and fall onto the bed, miraculously landing on top of his body, with his mouth covering his old bodies mouth. Upon contact, his lips suddenly start to kiss 'Jack's', and he feels the sensation of something warm and soft flowing out of his mouth. A moment after that feeling passes, Jack is grabbed and pulled down onto the bed, rolled over and pinned to it by his old body, which deepens the kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Excited by this sudden situation, as well as the sudden arousal that swells up in his new body, Jack starts to respond to the kiss, when suddenly its broken off. Confused, Jack looks down at 'Jack' who seems to see the confusion plainly on Jack's face. Chuckling, 'Jack' gently pushes himself off Jack, and leans back, a grin plastered on 'his' face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"I merely felt like giving you a good night kiss, Mistress. I can't wait for school, as I feel it will be an exciting day for both of us,\" Lilith responds, apparently deciding on getting one last tease in before going to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Damn, that was cruel Lilith, especially since your Lust seems out of control right now, its taking everything I have not to rape my body!\" Jack states, shocked that his outburst is spot on, and slightly scared that he even considered such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah, yes, I was mitigating my hormones before, but simply think of this as training in controlling yourself, 'Lilith',\" 'Jack' responds, smirking while moving to the other side of the bed, and getting under the covers. Snapping 'his' fingers, 'Jack' somehow turns off the lights in the room, and promptly goes to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0'Fuck, I know she's mischievous, but equivalently blue-balling me like this is just plain mean!' Jack rants in his head. Trying to calm himself down, Jack contemplates trying to take care of his urges, or just wait until school, since he knows Lilith will somehow get him to have sex there at some point.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Slowly, he finds himself able to 'sense' his magic, as well as something primal. Slightly worried, yet curious, Jack's mental wanderings move closer to this sense, and finds himself bombarded by the arousal he was ignoring, yet also finding himself randomly 'knowing' different things about 'himself'. He knew how old 'he' was, as well as the best ways to manage energy use for spells. He even found a trick to manage his lust, but to do so he'd honestly have to pleasure himself at random times during the day, or go screw a few people.</i><br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n<b>'Who knew that being a succubus was so difficult?' </b>Jack thought to himself, not even noticing that he'd passed the 6 hours that was left before 'Jack' was to wake up for school.

Slowly, taking a few deep breaths and trying to ignore the shudder of sensations that just breathing had caused, Jack leans away from Lilith, who silently gasps as few had shown such an iron will....or such stubbornness!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thanks, but not right now...\" <i>Jack bites out, literally panting as his body keeps trying to urge him to do many things to the other person in the room, hell, his body was telling him to do things to itself, and was causing him to barely hold back.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n~~<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nIt was ten minutes till school officially started, and even though it had been a rocky start to the day, Jack felt that he'd at least gotten things somewhat under control, so he could probably survive the day as long as Lilith didn't go too overboard. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to look at 'Jack' who had a wide and slightly sinister grin on 'his' face, Jack wondered if optimism was a bad thing-<br>\r\n</i></span></div></div>",

I-I thought you were going to be my new master?!\" you say horrified out of your mind. \"I would but I'm finally free from the book so I can just go to Hell and get a new body.\" \"W-what do you mean go to Hell.\" you say panicking over what to do. Suddenly Lilith grabs a nearby pocket knife and slits his/her throat with it then falls to the ground. You quickly rush to try to save your old body but you are too late. The moment Lilith's soul goes you start to feel a strange tugging sensation and you look to see what was pulling you. You turn to see the book and quickly, you try to run away but you're being slowly pulled towards the book. The moment you touch the book your body goes numb and you black out.

Blinking away the daze and surprise, Jack is taken aback by 'her' surroundings, as well as nearly stumbling from the sudden influx of information. Centuries of memories, many that 'she' notices are not even the previous Lilith's, flood through Jack's mind. Fighting to keep what little of his old personality and sense of self alive and dominant, Jack is helped by the unexpected shout from behind 'her'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What the fuck!?\" comes the high pitched should of a surprised female, prompting Jack to regain focus and control of 'herself'. Turning around, Jack's sense of self has apparently been saved by the last person he expected to see, 'her' former life's crush, Sarah. Shocked, but apparently not fully in control yet, Jack's mouth and voice act of their own accord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Greetings Mistress of the Book. As you have summoned me, Lilith the succubus, I am bound to you as is the book, until you die, or summon another servant that breaks the conditions of the bond. \" Jack neutrally states, somewhat confused by the words, the lack of control, and wondering why Lilith hadn't had to do something similar when he accidentally summoned her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What the hell do you mean Mistress? How the Fuck did a naked, busty woman appear inside my room, and what bond are you talking about?!?\" Sarah shouts rapidly, worry and fear tinging her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"In order: the one who bonds to the book through blood, and has the capacity for magic, is Bound to the book, able to learn the magic held within, and Bound to the Guide that is bound inside the book, in essence making you my Master, or in this case, Mistress.\" Before continuing on, Jack finds a momentary lapse in 'her' forced speech, and interjects in the apparently planned speech, getting at least some words in that 'she' hopes will spark Sarah's curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"As to my appearance, this is the form of my previous succubus, before i was tricked into taking her spot. After getting sucked into the book the clothes i had were returned to ether, as they were merely made from magic at the time. As to the Bond, it is the connection that helps facilitate jump starting your potential power, and helping teach you at an accelerated rate than what one could normally learn if attempting to do it the normal way.\" Jack states, hoping that 'her' little addition will prompt Sarah into asking about 'the previous owner'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Silence fills the room after Jacks answers, and after dragging on for minutes, Sarah looks at Jack closely, before asking a question that she seemed to have been contemplating deeply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"If you are not the original bound creature of the book, how did you get tricked, and is there any way to verify your story?\" Sarah asks, worry etched on her face. Upon hearing that question, Jack's heart soars, and 'her' voice seems to speak one last time, before relinquishing control to 'her'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I stumbled upon the book at my local library while looking for information for a European History homework assignment. Finding the book, taking it home to inspect it, and subsequently cutting myself on a can of soda and spilling a few drops of blood on the book, Summoned the previous succubus Lilith. As a guy, \" \"you were a man?\" \"Yes. As a guy, a sexy naked chick appearing in ones room leads to distractions, and after, what i can now tell, are misdirections and tricks into garnering my trust, I  accidentally gave away my body. Apparently, upon getting a verbal agreement that was vaguely stated, the previous <span class=\"cviolet\"><u><i>Lilith</i></u></span> killed my body, and traveled back to hell to get another one, and once my previous bodies life ended, i was sucked into the book, awaiting my new Master/Mistress.\" Jack states, sagging in relief, and then stiffening as one last phrase comes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"As to verification, any direct order by the Master/Mistress of the book will be carried out, unless it proves impossible or will result in the books destruction,\" Jack states, sagging again from the forced tone and posture that 'she' was forced to take while formally introducing Sarah to this new situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Quiet contemplation covers Sarah's face, and Jack feels some trepidation over what could possibly be going through her mind. While Jack could read 'her' Mistress' mind, 'she' felt that would be a breach of trust, even though it apparently is a normal procedure all the previous 'Lilith's' had taken to doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"<b><i>Succubus, I command for you to prove and verify your story in some manner that does not endanger me, nor harm any innocents</i></b>,\" Sarah states in an authoritative voice, squaring her shoulders and looking very serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everyone wondered what the hell happened, especially since there was no apparent cause for the sudden action. Your family, devastated, moved away, and your friends have been struggling in school since it happened. The only thing that is really odd is when you said your name, I couldn't hear it.\" Sarah rambles on, explaining details, and Jack notices that when she says 'her' former name, it sounds alien, as if it is wrong, and doesn't exist in said context. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Suppressing a shudder at the fact that 'she' had lost not only 'her' body, life, apparently family, and even 'her' name, Jack slumps to the floor, holding back the tears that 'she' wishes 'she' could shed. Upon seeing this, Sarah stops talking, and runs over to Jack, embracing him in a tight hug, trying to comfort the obviously distressed 'man'. Taking a few minutes to compose 'herself', Jack gently pushes away 'her' Mistress, and helps  her stand up after regaining 'her' legs first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Thank you for your consideration and concern Mistress, as well as the information on what has happened so far. Now, I need to finish explaining what this all entails for you, as luckily for you, I'm not after your death, nor any machinations to destroy your life,\" Jack states, some distress still tinging 'her' voice, but sounding as if 'she' is mostly under control now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What do you mean, don't you want to get your life back, or try to help your family and friends?\" Sarah asks, shocked that Jack was pushing aside his issues for her. When about to protest further, she is cut off by Jack raising a hand in a halting gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"If I could do so, I would Mistress, but just as the book and I are Bound to you, I'm Bound to the book first, meaning that it's rules are iron-clad, as well as it's power over me. In time, if I wished to suborn your life, and ruin it among a few others, I could get back some semblance of my previous life, but I choose not to do so, as that is what many previous Lilith's have done before. While in my previous life we rarely interacted, I still had a huge crush on you, and wished to one day at least gain a date with you,\" Jack explains, adding some levity to the somber mood with a quip at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Stunned by what she has just heard, Sarah stops her actions, standing stock still and apparently going over what she just heard. Less than a minute later, Sarah launches forward and embraces Jack in a bone crunching hug, seemingly trying to infuse gratefulness and remorse into the hug. Returning the hug, Jack slowly disengages it, and steps back, taking a breath before launching into one last explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"As I said, I need to finish explaining your situation Mistress. Currently, you are now considered a fledgling warlock, and the current planes of magic you have access to are Love and Lust. Not only are you stronger in casting magic from those schools, you will learn them faster, as well as be empowered by such emotions and actions in your vicinity. As a perk, at least for some depending on your orientation, those that found you attractive before, will be slightly more attracted now. The effect is enhanced significantly if i'm nearby, but over time, you will get to the same strength as what my presence causes.\" 'Huh, she left that out when explaining it to me,' \"Also, since you are a female warlock, your orientation can affect this aura that you will project subconsciously, so if your interested in women, they will be affected likewise.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Upon finishing that statement, Jack sees Sarah turn bright red, whether from embarrassment or something else, 'she' doesn't know, but continues on with the explanation.\"I feel the need to warn you Mistress, that while I was <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"><span class=\"cred\"><u><i><b>Jack </b></i></u></span></span>before, I am also influenced by the book, my new nature, as well as the previous succubi. In simple terms, I will need sex, and so will you. While i would enjoy it with you, I wont push it like <span class=\"cviolet\"><u><i>Lilith </i></u></span>did with me, but you will also need it to power your spells and increase your resistance/capacity to its effects, Especially as your magic will grow, and demand attention and use if neglected. \" Jack finishes, learning against the desk that sits in Sarah's room, hoping that the last bit of information doesn't cause too many problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A long stretch of silence drags on, and jack begins to wonder if hes about to be in trouble for being the 'bearer of bad news'. A loud, drawn out and noisy sigh expels from Sarah, who apparently has reached a decision, and begins to speak her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ok, this situation is very confusing, and also way outside anything I could normally believe, however, unless this is a very elaborate mental break on my part, what you've said has explained a lot. Right now, i feel that we should just get some rest, and try to deal with this tomorrow, which should make it easier as its Saturday, giving us the whole day with minimal interruptions,\" Sarah says tiredly, and begins to pull at her shirt before pausing and looking at Jack. \"Uh, sorry if this is rude, but could you shift back to your previous form <u><i><b><span class=\"cred\">Jack</span></b></i></u>, it seems stupid, but standing around getting undressed in front of a guy is a bit awkward, and only slightly less with a woman present,\" Sarah says, embarrassment and slight mortification lacing her request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Conceding the point, as multiple memories flash through 'her' mind, showing other men and women who were in similar positions, all feeling the same. Shifting into 'her' base form, and then concentrating to add a sexy black negligee, Jack turns to the side to give some form of privacy. Moments later, a gasp is heard, drawing Jacks attention to Sarah, who is staring at Jack, and blatantly ogling 'her'. Smirking at the look on Sarah's face, and somewhat enjoying the sudden spike of lust 'she' felt, Jack strikes a pose, in turn snapping Sarah out of her staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Coughing to hide her embarrassment, - at getting caught or for it even happening, Jack did not know - Sarah climbs into bed, then gains a conflicted look on her face. Moments later, sighing, she pulls the blankets off herself, and pats the bed while looking at Jack expectantly. Getting the hint, and not voicing the obvious questions 'she' wished to ask, Jack complies, and gets into the bed with Sarah. Both getting comfortable, each settle down, one to sleep, and the other to apparently passively meditate while keeping senses active for possible dangers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nThe next morning...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In her case, there must always be a <span class=\"cviolet\"><u><i><b>Lilith</b></i></u></span> bound to the book, and when previous ones attempted to circumvent that, it ended poorly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A slight moan next to her brings Jack's attention to Sarah, who seems to have been awoken by the sound of Jack's chuckle. Feeling that it isn't his place to hassle or nag Sarah, Jack moves off to the opposite side of the room, after fixing her side of the bed, the conjuring a simple chair to sit in and wait for Sarah to finish waking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Long silent minutes pass before Sarah bolts upright, looking around panicked until seeing Jack on the other side of the room, letting out a sigh after seeing her. Curious about such a reaction, Jack simply waits, deciding that she technically has all the time in the world, or until someone replaces her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"So it wasn't a vivid dream, and you really are here <span class=\"clred\"><span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"><u><i><b>Jack</b></i></u></span></span>? Ok, well, i guess that makes sense, as dreaming about a dead guy coming back as a demonic lust maiden and appearing in my room would be a really odd dream,\" Sarah says aloud, rambling as she tries to get a grasp on her situation. Deciding to try to help, Jack snaps her finger, and a glass of water appears before Sarah, floating a few feet above her legs. Shocked by the sudden appearance of the glass, Sarah stops rambling, and just stares at the glass for a full minute. Chuckling at the scene, especially as after the minute of staring, Sarah slowly raises a finger and gently prods the glass, as if expecting it to disappear upon contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack's chuckle brings Sarah back to her surroundings, and she gingerly grasps the cup, and takes a sip of the water, pauses, then starts to down the drink as if she's dehydrated. Finishing the glass with the sound of 'ahh' escaping her lips, Jack merely waves her hand in the general direction of the glass, and it slowly fades away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"How did you do that? Was it an illusion, and how did the water taste so great if it was? Would I be capable of doing such?\" Sarah asks rapidly, not pausing to hear an answer to any of her questions until another chuckle escapes from Jack. Blushing at her actions, and slightly embarrassed with the chuckling that Jack has been doing at her actions, Sarah dives under the covers, hiding from her embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stopping her chuckles, and deciding that she was awake enough to have a conversation, and possibly get to a lesson sometime soon, Jack stands, and dismisses her chair. Moving silently towards the bed, Jack quietly removes the covers, finding Sarah face down in her pillows, trying to apparently enact \"out of sight, out of mind\". Upon seeing this, Jack fights hard, and is successful at stopping the laughter she feels the situation warrants. Instead, Jack gently shakes Sarah's shoulder, prodding her new Mistress to get up and face the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah complies, still red faced, but willing to get up and become active, 'which is better than some of my previous masters' Jack thinks, the lines between herself and previous succubi slightly blurring. Shaking her head, Jack simply walks away from the bed, and moves towards the closet, picking out things that she thinks Sarah might want to wear for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moments after collecting various ensembles, Jack levitates them out, and floats them to in front of Sarah, who is surprised by such an action, before becoming enraptured by the different styles and clothing combinations. Taking a minute of close inspection upon each set, Sarah finally decides on a pair of tight jeans, and a long-sleeve top, both in the color of dark blue. Seeing the choice made, Jack snaps her fingers, and the rest of the clothes rapidly return to the closet and sort themselves into their proper places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Thank you <span class=\"cred\"><span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"><u><i><b>Jack</b></i></u></span></span>, and I'm sorry for the rapid-fire questioning. Are you ok? You haven't said anything this morning, and you just grimaced when I said your name...\" Sarah asks, trailing off as she sees a frown cover Jacks face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"It is no trouble Mistress, as it is my duty to help you, I'm merely doing it different than previous <span class=\"cviolet\"><u><i><b>Liliths</b></i></u></span> have acted, though in a century or two that might change. As to my grimace, that would be because my former name is somehow painful whenever I hear it directed at me, for what reason I know not, merely that it does.\" Jack states calmly, not giving away the slight grief she felt at the reminder of her folly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm sorry .....I don't feel as if i should call you <span class=\"cviolet\"><u><i><b>Lilith</b></i></u></span>, even if that is supposed to be your new name, so maybe a derivative? How about Lily, or maybe <u><span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"><i><b><span class=\"cred\">Jill</span></b></i></span></u>?\" Sarah asks, seeing no reaction to Lily, but seeing a grimace at Jill, apologizes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"It is no problem Mistress, it is not truly painful, but more akin to vibrations that sound completely wrong and alien. As to my name, technically it can be whatever you wish. Now, if you don't mind, we need to start your day, either with you doing whatever you normally do, or we could start on your first lesson in being a warlock.\" Jack states, smiling gently to get the point across to drop the naming issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Getting the hint, Sarah merely nods, before biting her lip momentarily, then standing up and approaching Jack. After reaching her, Sarah embraces Jack in a light hug, rubbing his back in smooth circles for a few moments, before stepping back, and composing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, I have nothing planned for the day....Lily, so after a shower, and seeing if my sister needs me for anything, we could possibly start on me learning magic,\" Sarah says, trying to sound upbeat and positive, whether its for herself or Jack, she doesn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"As you wish Mistress. Do you require aid in the shower, or would you like me to make you breakfast while you are showering,\" Jack asks, wondering if Sarah was as horny as she constantly felt. Jack was surprised that she was even able to talk and act calmly, until he realized that she was expending a low amount of mana to fight off the effects his hyperactive sex drive caused. While she would not run out of mana to power such an effect for the time being, she would either need to sate his urges soon, or ask for time to find somewhere to obtain her 'kind' of nourishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah paused in thought at the question, biting her lip and subtly rubbing her thighs together, hoping that Jack wouldn't notice (she does, but doesn't mention it). Deciding on hedging her bets, Sarah responds \"You can cook something for breakfast, and if you finish making it before I'm done, you could join me, as you might enjoy a shower also.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Smiling, both in amusement at her response, as well as her subtle attempts at stimulation, Jack decides to appease her, and nods, while moving towards the door, not bothering to open it, and steps through, hearing a gasp of shock behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moving towards the kitchen, and seeing no one else awake or at least in the general vicinity, Jack quietly inspected the cupboards and refrigerator, seeing what she had to work with. Upon seeing the ingredients in the kitchen, multitudes of recipes flit through his mind, as all the past experiences are available to her, and she decides to make use of a simple omelet recipe that she <b>knows</b> has been lost for at least two centuries. Chuckling, and hoping that everything will turn out alright, Jack begins to cook enough breakfast for not only Sarah, but her sister and mother as well.<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

Upon seeing Jack smiling and putting his creation onto a plate, she stops and smiles at the look of slight happiness on 'her' face. Still somewhat shocked at what had happened to him, Sarah wondered if she should disregard Jack's wishes to not reconnect him to his family somehow, but her attention was drawn towards her suddenly growling stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Embarrassed by the sound, Sarah looks up, and sees a smirking Jack, holding out a plate with a simple yet delicious looking omelet, which Sarah moved over quickly and placed down on the counter nearby, accepting the proffered fork and cutting a portion to taste the food before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh my God, how in the hell did you get it to taste this good?!? It's like a mini-orgasm just went off in my mouth, and that was only a small bite....I think I want you to cook more meals from me in the future 'Lily' !\" Sarah says, praising Jack's creation greatly, and earning a small blush from the new Succubus. The sound of silverware clattering and scrapping against the plate fills the silence, as Jack feels no need to interrupt 'her' Mistress' meal, nor does Sarah seem to want to waste a second of not eating her omelet to bother talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Less than ten minutes after sitting down to eat, a slightly embarrassed Sarah (at her most recent actions) and an amused Jack, look at one another, silently waiting for each other to speak up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah breaks the silence first, \"So now that I've eaten, and thank you for that and making enough for the rest of my family it seems, what are we going to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well Mistress, we can see if your sister needs you, and if not, follow your earlier suggestion of learning about your magic, or you could simply start on your magic, and possibly use your sister as a 'volunteer' for your practicing.\" Jack states, seeming nonplussed at the question, nor at 'her' suggestion on using Jess as a practice doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"I can't just use my sister to test magic on, that would be wrong....wait, what kind of magic would we be testing?\" Sarah cries out indignantly at first, but pauses before curiosity strikes and makes her wonder at the suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Grinning, Jack answers. \"Well, the most basic of spells you can learn are lust and arousal inducing spells, which you could test on me, but the results would be negligent, as my nature causes those to be always at full blast. You could test them on yourself, but you might not be happy after realizing that there isn't a real 'counter-spell' to those basic spells. There are other spells you could test on objects and such, but for your protection, being able to paralyze someone from unending and unquenchable arousal seems like a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah's face seems to morph as Jack's answers seem to elicit different emotions as they go on, ranging from pity, to shock and embarrassment, with some mortification, and then finally a small yet devious smile. Long moments stretch on as Sarah contemplates Jack's explanation, before finally coming to a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Lily, let's ...\"<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

With that she hurries upstairs and as quickly as she went up she comes down fully dressed. \u201cReady? Let\u2019s go.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait.\u201d She says stopping you at the door. \u201cYou sure you should be going outside while you\u2019re still naked?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m making sure no one can see, hear, or even feel me expect for you. Here, watch.\u201d You say as you whiz your right arm right through her, causing her to shiver in fright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh, that\u2019s creepy, well anyway let\u2019s go.\u201d She says as you both leave the house. \u201cSo Lily, I was wondering, what sort of stuff you could do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLots of things Mistress, I can do seduce people, shapeshift, summon clothes and food, summon hellfire and imps, I can even possess people.\u201d You say as you search through your memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait. You can possess people? Like anyone?\u201d You hear Sarah say curiously but with a little excitement in the tone of her voice. Clearly she was planning something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Mistress, I can possess anyone for as long as I want even you, but of course I need your permission to do it to you. How about you pick someone out I\u2019ll prove it for you?\u201d You say gesturing to the other side of the street which had some people walking to and fro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, how about her?\u201d Sarah said pointing to a girl on the other side of the street. She was a blonde girl who looked to be in her mid twenties who had her hair in a ponytail wearing a red dress that went down to mid-thigh, an unzipped black leather jacket and knee high brown riding boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing.\u201d You said as you fly over and land right behind her. Then you slowly lift your left leg and jam it into hers. You then feel a near orgasmic rush as you feel the warmth of her leg. \u201cThe heck?\u201d The girl says as she notices her leg went numb. Not wanting to draw attention and too entranced by the feeling, you quickly cover her mouth and begin shoving yourself into her. Once you finally are fully inside her you finally orgasm as you feel yourself stain your new panties. \u201cMmm it always does feel so nicely warm and tight while I\u2019m in a girl\u2019s body.\u201d You say looking back through \u2018your\u2019 memories. You then snap your fingers, cleaning yourself off as you walk back to Sarah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo? Did you do it?\u201d Sarah asks nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, Mistress. See? I told you I could do it.\u201d You say smugly as you place a hand on your hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s so cool!\u201d She says giddy looking you up and down, inspecting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Mistress, what do you want to do know?\u201d You ask.</span></div></div>",

What other way?\u201d She says a little excitedly happy to know there is a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell normally you wouldn\u2019t be able to pull such a high level spell off by yourself but, I could easily help you pull it off.\u201d You say trying to reassure her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?! That\u2019s great! Follow me, I have an idea!\u201d She says as she rushes off down the street. You quickly run off after until you both stop at a house a couple blocks down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMight I ask why you decided to run down to this house, Mistress?\u201d You say while trying to catch your breath in your borrowed body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you see Lily, ever since you died, your old family moved away, now a new family had moved in. But the thing is that they have this mean girl named Tanya who is really awful to me and a lot of other people at school but somehow she gets away with it. So, I thought that possessing her and messing with her would be the perfect way to teach her a lesson.\u201d She says while looking up at the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure Mistress, I would love to help.\u201d You say cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, how exactly are you going help me do this Lily? More importantly how are we supposed to get inside undetected?\u201d She asks looking for a way in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy.\u201d You say as you place your hand on her shoulder. You then concentrate on sensing where Tanya is. Then feel a gush of wind as you teleport Sarah and yourself into Tanya\u2019s room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Woah woah! You can\u2019t just teleport us into her room she\u2019ll spot us immediately!\u201d She roars furiously while looking for a place to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax Mistress, she won\u2019t be able to see nor hear us, so just calm down.\u201d You say trying to reassure and calm her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmph. Alright, but next time you are about to teleport us, warn me ok?\u201d Sarah says, clearly still a little upset. All of a sudden a raven black haired girl walks into the room wearing a white tank top, denim bootie shorts, and wedge toe sandals walks into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. Strange, I could have sworn I heard something.\u201d The girl says as she looks around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s her Lily, so how are we supposed to do this?\u201d Sarah says anxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh it\u2019s real simple I\u2019m gonna push you into her.\u201d You say. \u201cJust tell me when you\u2019re ready, ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I\u2019m ready.\u201d She says as she tenses up her muscles and closes her her eyes shut, bracing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe.\u201d You chuckle at the sight of her. \u201cReady? 3 2 1 Go!\u201d You say as you shove her at Tanya. You then watch as Sarah phases completely into Tanya as Tanya\u2019s body gets knocked to the floor. After a little while of spasms, Tanya\u2019s body gets up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow Lily! You were right! It really did work!\u201d Sarah says as she inspects her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee? So what\u2019s the plan now, Mistress?\u201d You ask.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \"Well who are you...or should I say what are you?\" an unexpected voice says from the stairway, catching Jack's attention and causing her to gasp, as she sees to images, one imposed over the other. Confused by this, Jack, without looking, finishes up the omelet she was making, and continues to inspect the sight before her, not even bothering to answer as she tries to understand what he is seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Standing on the bottom step of the stairs, staring at Jack with a sort of confident sneer, is a petite, yet amazingly beautiful Asian woman, whose brown eyes stare unerringly at Jack. Ignoring the stare and the apparently waiting for a response person, Jack continues to inspect the woman. She stands around 5'3, with a decent chest, and long but thin legs, shown off enticingly as her only clothing seems to be skimpy sleepwear that most would blush to be seen in. The long brown hair which frames her face currently, also has an after-image of being pulled up and done in a bun on top of her head. Noticing that difference, Jack see's other details that the after-image shows, indicating something is definitely off about the individual before her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Done with his inspection, and having unerringly plated the food and placed it on the counter without taking his eyes off her, Jack considers how to respond to the question, when her 'memories' supply the missing piece, causing her to smile and the woman to frown, and shift her stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"That is an interesting question to ask, especially from a ghost possessing someone else, isn't it?\" Jack asks, letting 'her' know that she knows something is off about her as well. The woman sighs, before moving over, deciding that both had information and the only way to alleviate the situation was to share it if possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Ok, so we both aren't what we appear to others, and neither of us has been hostile yet, so a truce for answers?\" Asks the Asian, taking one of the plates and digs in, not even deigning to ask if she could have the plate. 'Lucky I don't have to eat actual food, but damn, that was going to be my first meal in my new life.' Jack thought silent, before nodding and indicating that the food thief should start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Swallowing a bite, and letting out a small moan as she apparently enjoyed the taste, the Asian started talking. \"Well, as you can probably tell, I'm part of the supernatural community, and from your comment, already know that I'm a ghost, but as to why I am here, I'm watching over family and friends, and enjoying life as much as I can with my existence. Now your turn, and damn your a good cook.\" she said, taking another mouthful of omelet, and letting out a slightly louder moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, the short version is that I'm a Succubus, bound to a Book, and am here to serve my Mistress, who lives in this house. I was once mortal, but was tricked into my situation, as apparently has happened before, if 'my' memories are anything to be trusted. This is actually the first 'day' of freedom I've been from the Book since capturing, so I have nothing else to do, but serve my Mistress and prepare her for the 'Supernatural' world as you put it.\" Jack states, garnering a gasp as the Ghostly woman seems to have some idea of his situation, especially if the look of pity adorning her borrowed face is anything to go by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Ah, you befell that Book, didn't you, the one that is meant to spread Lust and train Warlocks? I recall that Book, though the last time I came anywhere in contact with it was about ...300 years ago, as one of my decedents had come across it, and befell the enticing offers the book gives out. Hate to put it this way, but thankfully, he wasn't tricked out of his body like you apparently were, but he did end up losing his soul in a bet with something far worse. That being said, what now, since were both aware and non-hostile of the other?\" The Asian ghost asks, seeming more relaxed after the brief exchange of information, and also trying to subtly reach for another omelet, only to have her hand smacked by Jack's spatula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, as long as you mean my Mistress no harm, I have no problem with what you are doing, though as a courtesy, at least from what 'my' memories tell me, I won't inform her of your existence without permission unless it's an emergency. As to what you will do, that is up to you, but if you want to help and have some fun, you could always introduce yourself to my Mistress, and maybe give your own view on her new circumstances.\" Jack offers, slightly interested in this situation, as while he had all of his predecessors memories to go by, he personally had no real experience with this aside from his brief interactions with Lilith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"That sounds like something interesting, though I will ask that you keep Jess out of the Supernatural if possible, as she is the one I'm currently watching over. While it has been fun to be a teenager again, my host, which is my many times descendant, made some requests that I must honor, in this case, to watch over and attempt to keep safe, her friends. Aside from that, it might be interesting to be on the other side of the machinations of a budding Warlock, instead of the side that suffers.\" The Asian responded, seeming intrigued by the idea, and also resolved in keeping to her apparent descendants requests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, I guess the last thing to do, before introducing you to my Mistress, is to tell each other our names, though mine at the moment is changeable by my mistress, as you can guess I don't exactly like this body's name. So for the moment, you can call me Lily.\" Jack states, and receives a pitying and understanding look from the Ghostly woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Understandable, I've worn many names as I possessed others, but the name I always try to go by would be Hana, my hosts, Luckily enough, is Hana Lolikon. And while we just met, I think we'll get along just fine.\" The now named Hana states, while holding her hand out in a polite shaking gesture, Jack following her lead and feeling somewhat happy that she had someone to talk with about his predicament, even if it was a ghost.</span></div></div>",

He feels her breasts push up against his back, until suddenly, they aren't. He feels a strange numbing feeling across his whole back as Lilith continues to step into him... and then Lilith inserts her head into his, and he blacks out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut only for a second, as he comes to and finds himself staring at his own body, standing outside his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, that's interesting...\" Lilith, in Jack's body, muses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What happened? Why can I see... myself?\" Jack asks, but he is barely able to hear himself. He looks down at himself, and realizes that he is... rather transparent. He can barely see himself, as he has taken on a slight blue color. His clothes are still intact (on him, and on his body). \"Am I a... ghost?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks that way, Master\". It definitely was weird hearing his own voice speaking to him, almost like he was talking to himself. But then again, Jack thought, he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why?\" he persistently asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I've displaced your soul, Master. This can happen sometimes if the individual I'm possessing is particularly strong. Usually I just cruise on in and suppress their being, and I get full control. In this case, I still get full control, but your soul is now sitting outside your body.\" Lilith explained. \"Don't worry, only I can see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now? Can you put me back?\" Jack asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could, but wasn't the point of this for me to get to know you from the <i>inside?</i>\" Lilith responds. \"Besides, nothing bad will happen to you. And it takes a couple of hours for me to fully integrate with someone, anyway. We can still go ahead to Alex's, except that you'll be spectating from the sidelines, so to speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...\" Jack replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continue a to walk down the street, Lilith in Jack's body, and Jack as... well, a ghost. He was disappointed to find that he still had to walk on the ground, and didn't float. He hears footsteps behind them, as if someone is running. He didn't give it much thought, people jog in the mornings all the time, and they wouldn't just bowl someone over. Until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack found himself stumbling to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... \" he began, before realizing that there was no one else around, and that he was a bit too solid for a ghost. Lilith, meanwhile, was laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Jack asked. Something was different. He was sweating, for a start. Looking down at himself, he saw...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreasts? What? Why did he have breasts? That wasn't right! He was wearing a pink sports bra, toned midriff completely bare, with tight, black, short shorts. He was now distinctly aware of the lack of manhood between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?\" he asks. Lilith is still laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you caught your neighbor finishing her run, Master. Or should I say, <i>Mistress</i>?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fumbled around, before finding a phone tucked into a sleeve which was around his arm. He took out the phone, and saw the reflection of Chloe, a woman in her early to mid-twenties who lived a couple of houses down. She was very fit, and he did think she was hot. Besides, she had always been nice to him, and had even come over for dinner a few times - she sometimes accompanied Jack's mother on her morning runs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... can you get me out of her?\" Jack asked, now noticing that he was, in fact, speaking with Chloe's voice, and that her reflection in her phone was moving her lips as he was speaking. \"Wow, this is so weird. I'm actually her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Master, you are <i>actually</i> her at the moment. And yes, I could pull you out, but I do still need more time. Plus this could be fun for you.\" Jack sees his own body, piloted by Lilith, look him up and down very appraisingly. Well, less him and more the sweaty, attractive, scantily dressed body of his neighbor Chloe that he was currently inhabiting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, you can't tell me that you aren't <i>in the least</i> interested in what it's like being a sexy twenty-something woman...\" Lilith winked, tone and facial expression definitely hinting at something dirty. \"You have the chance to get to know Chloe here much better than anyone else ever will, if you get my meaning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, within the space of a second, Lilith's whole demeanor changed and became that of just a friendly neighbor, as if she had not just suggested he spend the next couple of hours masturbating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Chloe, I have to run - I'm going to a friend's place.\" Lilith said, actually doing a damn accurate impersonation of Jack in his body. Then, in a whisper, she added, \"I'll drop by in a few hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, without any further chatter, Jack watched as his body walked off down the street, leaving him standing there, sweating and kind of tired, in Chloe's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, might as well go 'home'\", Jack said to himself, fishing Chloe's keys out of the phone pouch. He proceeded to walk to her front door. It was a different experience, he'd never walked in such tight shorts before, and - as he felt Chloe's thighs rubbing together - he'd never walked without a dick between his legs before. Thinking about that made him realize that he wasnt too bothered by having breasts, either because Chloe's were on the smaller side (not more than Bs), or because her sports bra was putting in a lot of work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he opened the door, he realized that he had never actually seen inside Chloe's house before. The entryway was tiled, and the tiles lead all the way to a kitchen. Walking through to the kitchen, Jack sits down on a bar stool and sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I have a few hours to kill.\" thought Jack. Lilith had given her suggestion as to what Jack could do in those hours. But she had also said that she could pull him out. Plus, if he had accidentally managed to possess Chloe, he should also be able to depossess her as well, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"...try to get out,\" Jack thought. This was just too weird. He didn't want to spend 3-4 hours alone, in an unfamiliar house, in an unfamiliar body. Although he was curious about what it was like being a woman - given his current situation, it was hard not to be - he wasn't sure he was up for the whole \"exploration\" process Lilith had suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill sitting on the bar stool, Jack closed his eyes, and focused. Nothing happened. He didn't even know what to focus on. Other than the obvious fact that this was Chloe's body and not his, he didn't feel much different from when he was still in his own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, that might be it! He thought about when he was still in his own body, and what Lilith had done to get him out. Lilith wasn't here, but this was still Jack's only lead, so he went with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack closed his eyes, steadied his breathing, and focused on that strange numbness he had when Lilith had forced him out. He began to feel something - a slight tingle on the back of his neck. Then it was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit!\" he cursed softly, slumping his shoulders. The motion, and the slight shaking on his chest that followed, made him remember exactly <i>who</i> he was at the moment. \"This is so weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe must have thought that a hundred times now, but he was still slightly weirded out by everything that had happened. He was, currently, sitting on a bar stool in his neighbor's kitchen, in his neighbor's sweaty, <i>female</i>, body. He got up, poured himself some orange juice, and sat back on the bar stool. He didn't even think that he somehow knew where the juice was, where the glasses were... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stretched out his arms, and noticed that he was quite sticky from the sweat Chloe had worked up on her run. It was distracting. Maybe, he thought, he should go wash up. Then an idea hit him. To focus better, you needed to be relaxed, right? He decided to go run a bath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the bathroom, he noticed that Chloe had a rather large and fancy tub, and a lot of bath gear - lots of oils, lotions, a variety of scented bath bubbles... She clearly took baths often. Turning on the hot water, Jack began to undress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, he took off Chloe's socks, then her bra. It was on quite tight, but he managed to pull it off anyway, exposing Chloe's sweaty breasts. Naturally, Jack was distracted. Having never had breasts before, then suddenly finding himself sporting a rather nice, fully developed pair, he of course had to cup them. And massage them slightly. And play with his nipples. They were very ticklish, but in a pleasant way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnough of that though, he had a bath to take and a neighbor to depossess. He took off his shorts and underwear in one swoop, exposing yet another distraction. He stepped into the bath, and laid down in a half-seated slouch. The water was perfect, but only reached just past his legs. And, Jack noticed after looking down, to his <i>pussy</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's new...\" Jack thought. Unable to help himself, he reached down and began to fiddle around. As his fingers reached inside, he felt a jolt of pleasure. Then, snapping himself out of it, he remembered what he was actually trying to do. And it wasn't self-pleasure. He closed his eyes, now a lot more submerged in the warm water, and tried again to hop out of Chloe's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill no luck. How was he supposed to do this? How was Lilith able to just push him out? She was a lot more experienced, he thought. Since he wasn't getting anywhere, he decided to just sit there and relax. The tub was almost full, so Jack reached out and turned off the water, breasts slightly splashing as he raised them out of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why doesn' this work...\" Jack sighed in Chloe's voice, and laid back, almost completely submerged. He felt himself dozing off, and noticed a familiar feeling in the back of his neck. He focused everything he had on that, and the feeling expanded through his torso, down his back, and through his arms. As the tingling-numbing sensation reached his legs and his head, he felt himself get a little dizzy. He tried to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd stood up, out of Chloe's body. He had done it. He walked out of the tub, still somehow wearing his ghost clothes. The water didn't even move when he touched it. He looked down at his neighbor's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe was lying in the tub, water up to her neck, asleep. She was completely naked, hands on the sides of the tub, small breasts suspended in the water, as if reaching for the surface. She looked very relaxed, and didn't appear to notice him. Jack wondered how much of the last... half hour or so? she would remember, and hoped that it wouldn't be much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, now that he was out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

As he reached to open it, he noticed that his hand reached through the door. \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack pushed himself through the door with minimal effort, appearing on the other side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was interesting... I can go through things.\" He thought. Then looked down and noticed that he was still quite solidly standing on Chloe's front porch. \"Except the ground, apparently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack made his way over to Alex's. He figured Lilith would still be there, since when he hung out with Alex, they could get stuck playing videogames for hours, and Lilith was unlikely to break character. Alex lived a good 15-20 minutes walk away, but since Jack didn't own a car and there weren't any reliable buses in the area, he just walked. Plus how was he going to get on a bus in his ghost form anyway? He figured he could <i>try</i> to possess someone, then depossess them at the right stop, but he wasn't even sure how he had managed to depossess Chloe. It wasn't worth the risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe passed a few people on the way to Alex's, being very careful to always stay outside arm's reach. He did not want to accidentally hit anyone again. When he arrived, he beelined straight to Alex's bedroom window, figuring that that's where he was most likely to spot Lilith. And sure enough, he saw Alex and Lilith, in his body, controllers in hand, sitting on the edge of the bed. If Lilith noticed him, she didn't show it. Jack stuck his head inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey can we pause?\" he heard his own voice say. \"Need to take a leak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure.\" Alex replied. With that, Jack saw his body get up and walk over to the bathroom. Jack jumped and followed. As his body closed the door in the bathroom, he heard Lilith's voice in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Master, it seems you figured out how to hop out of someone.\" Lilith said, but Jack wasn't sure how. His body was just standing near the toilet, still fully dressed, lips not moving. \"Did you at least have some fun with your neighbor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably not the kind of fun you had hoped\" Jack answered. \"And how are you talking to me, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Telepathically. I'm sure you noticed that I'm not actually talking.\" cane the reply, still in Lilith's voice. \"And why not? You were completely alone, no one was going to interrupt you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack thought about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just a bit freaked out. I was in a stranger's body, you were gone, I wanted to get out.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, Master. Next time, I'll help you...\" Lilith said mischievously. \"But I have to go. It doesn't take this long to take a piss, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Lilith got up and went back to Alex's room, where they no doubt continued their gaming session. As for what she had said, Jack had some... interesting ideas as to what she meant, and was rather intrigued. Seeing as he was invisible to most people, he decided to go and at least hang out in the same room. Then he had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lilith,\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Master?\" came her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be able to find me regardless of where and who I am, right?\" Jack inquired. He hoped that Lilith's answer was what he was expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I will, Master. Our bond is special like that, I'll always be able to find you. And eventually you'll learn to always be able to find me too.\" she responded. Perfect, Jack thought. He could go off on an adventure. He figured he could try again at possessing someone, but this time on his own terms. Lilith's words had reassured him, and he figured that no matter what, or who for that matter, he got himself into, she would be able to help him out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a Saturday, and there were a few places nearby he could think of where he could find some people to... have some fun with. Or, more precisely, Jack thought with a devilish grin on his face, have some fun <i>in</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a public pool nearby, and on a nice weekend day like today, Jack was sure it would be quite crowded. Plus, a pool meant that most of the girls there would be wearing bikinis... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the other direction, but a bit further, there was a large shopping mall. There would definitely be a lot of people there, too. Probably a lot more people than at the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking up his mind, Jack began to make his way to the...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The three girls were walking together, chatting animatedly. but Jack could not hear their conversation topic. He watched as the three walked together towards the changerooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder what fun I could have in there...\" Jack thought to himself, grinning. He began to make his way over to the changerooms, and the girls. As he approached, he could make out a part of their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go get us a nice spot then. I can't believe you two didn't get changed already!\" It was Aelita talking. She was wearing a light, loose-fitting low-cut top, short shorts and flip-flops. She was the youngest of the bunch, but dressed the most provocatively. Then again she did have quite a nice body, Jack thought, so he wasn't going to complain about her choice of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not all of us were sitting at home, Ali,\" Janet retorted, and Nikki laughed. The two older girls were wearing much less revealing clothes, with Janet wearing jeans, a t-shirt and flats. Nikki was wearing a pale yellow sundress. Just because he could, Jack crept up and looked up her dress. She was wearing regular underwear, not swimming gear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure to get a spot with some sun and a view!\" Nikki called, and left with Janet to change. Jack considered following them in and playing with them a bit, but decided he would have some fun with Aelita instead. She was alone, so it would lead to less awkward moments when someone noticed something was up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAelita walked over to a nice sunny spot by the lap pool, and laid down her towel. Jack noticed that there were a few members of the local competitive swim team practicing. So that's what Nikki meant by \"a view\". Well, it didn't bother Jack, he had his own view, right in front of him. Aelita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had begun to undress, removing her top to unveil a very petite figure with moderately sized breasts showcased in a bright pink bikini top. It seemed to push her breasts up, making them stand out even more. They were definitely deserving of attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Jack drooled over her breasts, Aelita had started to remove her shorts. Underneath was the matching pink thong. So, Jack thought, she had picked out a swimsuit to match her hair. In a burst of confidence, Jack reached out and touched her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his great surprise, he wasn't immediately absorbed into her like had happened before. Instead, he felt his hand move through her body as if like through running water. He felt that he could... grip something. So of course he tried, and saw Aelita noticeably stumble, as if her muscles had momentarily given out. Had he just grabbed her soul? That could be interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that new piece of information, he decided to get to the good part right away. Aelita had gotten herself out of her outer clothes, wearing only her flip-flops and bikini, and was now positioning herself on her towel - not pink - in what Jack assumed would be a comfortable pose. She was lying on her back, breasts sticking up into the air, ankles crossed. She had gotten some large sunglasses from somewhere, and had put them on. Jack stood up, extracting his hand from her shoulder, and stepped over to her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment's thought, he decided to do this slightly differently. He carefully stepped over her until he was standing directly over her crotch, and then knelt down. Still not touching her, he admired the body he was about to inhabit. Her skin was very smooth, lightly tanned, without blemishes. She took very good care of herself. She was reasonably short, quite thin, but with large breasts. As Jack looked at her bikini bottom, he began to want to just possess her already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he did. He sat down into her crotch, turned around so his legs were in line with hers, and positioned them together. He felt a tingle go through the lower half of his body as he integrated into Aelita. She still seemed clueless. At least until Jack began to turn around, accidentally moving her leg and crossing her knees over. After all, he was in control of the lower half of her body now. She opened her eyes and stood up in alarm... right into Jack's ghostly torso. Her head struck his, and he felt the same tingling sensation go through his upper body. He was now almost entirely in control of Aelita. He threaded his arms into hers, and took full control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh, this is nice...\" Jack contentedly whispered to himself, eyeing Aelita's petite form through her own eyes. Not being able to resist, he lightly caressed her legs. Her skin was rather sensitive, and a tickling feeling went through Jack's lower body. \"Oh we're definitely going to have some fun together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the moment, Jack decided to just enjoy himself in a more... publicly acceptable manner, replacing Aelita's sunglasses (she had thrown them off) and lying back down on her towel. The sun was nice and warm, and the feeling was pleasant to his borrowed skin. He began to doze off until he was interrupted by someone approaching. He looked up to see</span></div></div>",

Jack thought he looked vaguely familiar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStretching out, Jack pushed out his chest, trying to emphasize Aelita's impressive rack. From what he could see in front of him, he felt like he had succeeded. He glanced over at the boy, who was coming closer. He had paused to take in the sight. Yep, he had definitely succeeded. And it felt good. Was this what it was always like for attractive girls?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was thoroughly enjoying the feeling of the sun on Aelita's skin when the boy finally walked up to him. He looked nervous as hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... Hi Aelita. You.. umm... look really nice today.\" he stammered. Definitely nervous. And quite awkward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Jack cheerfully replied. Then it hit him where he had seen the kid before. He was in his sister's year. \"You're Colin, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm.. Yeah. We're in the same Math class. And History. I think.\" Colin replied. Of course Colin knew what classes he had with Aelita. He probably spent every one of them staring at her. Colin seemed surprised that the gorgeous Aelita even knew who he was, not to mention the fact that she was actually talking to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack knew that normally, girls like Aelita wouldn't even consider giving guys like Colin the time of day, but today was special. Today, Aelita wasn't quite herself. Today, Jack was running the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Colin, what brings you to the pool?\" Jack asked Colin, smiling Aelita's lovely smile, shifting his shoulders back to slightly lift Aelita's breasts. Colin was caught completely off-guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... \" he fumbled, eyes fixated on Jack's chest. Jack looked down at the breasts he was 'wearing', and thought that he couldn't really blame Colin. Aelita's bikini top didn't leave much to the imagination, her chest very much on display. Colin, finally snapping out of his stupor, finally finished his train of thought. \"I'm here for swimming practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't look like he was the swimming type, or that he was here for swimming practice. He was probably there to \"admire\" the scenery. Or other people. Like, in this case, Aelita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack had an idea. He had always been curious (and ever so slightly resentful) about the power that girls like Aelita had over guys like Colin, guys like Jack, guys in general. Now that power was his. He could lead Colin on, mess with him a bit... maybe let him mess with Aelita a bit. That would be fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, he could try out more of his powers. He had managed to momentarily displace Aelita's soul earlier, what if he could do the same now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what was it going to be?</span></div></div>",

Jack concentrated, closing his eyes, and <i>pulled</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColin shuddered, and Jack felt  a familiar numb sensation in his arm. He could clearly see Aelita's hand on Colin's shoulder, and his ghostly hand <i>in</i> Colin's shoulder. He pulled harder and twisted to the side. Colin's soul left his body, and Jack was pulled out of Aelita. Colin's body stumbled and was about to fall when Jack half pulled, half pushed Colin's soul as hard as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColin's soul was shoved into Aelita's body, where it was quickly absorbed.

Aelita, what was tha...\" Aelita asked, confused. Except that it wasn't Aelita anymore. Colin was in her body, and it seems that he had just noticed that he was looking at his own body. \"Why am I standing there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aelita, are you ok?

Should I call a lifeguard?\" Jack asked in a concerned voice, in his best Colin impression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aelita... but I'm n..\" Colin said in Aelita's voice, and looked down.

I'm going to go get some help...\" Jack says, trying to not sound amused. With that, he slowly walks off but continues to observe Colin's actions in Aelita's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack watched as Aelita's hands began to move, up her midriff to her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I really am Aelita.\" her voice said, quivering. Then, Jack heard Aelita moan slightly. He looked to see her hands caressing her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his vantage point, Jack could see that Nikki and Janet were approaching <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ali, what are you doing?\" Janet asked, frowning. From her view, she arrived to see her friend feeling herself up, in full view of everyone at the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, if you're going to do that you should go to the changerooms at least, people here can see you.\" Nikki added with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... sorry. I'll ... uhh...\" Colin couldn't find the right words, and went bright red. Jack had never seen someone so embarrassed, but he had to admit that Aelita did look very cute, red-faced like that. \"I have to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Jack watched as Colin took Aelita's body, still cupping her breasts, on a beeline towards the changerooms. As if by habit, he almost walked into the boy's changerooms, before remembering he was holding <i>his own</i> pair of tits in his hands. Aelita's body then quickly disappeared into the girls' changeroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot particularly wanting to be Colin for the rest of the day, Jack walked in the direction he had seen him come from originally. Not far off was a backpack and a towel. The backpack had his name on it. Jack sat down, and willed himself out of Colin's body. The body collapsed on the towel. Just to make sure he wasn't dead or anything, Jack checked and found Colin's body to be steadily breathing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's good. Now I'm free to go have some more fun,\" Jack thought to himself, and walked off. \"But what to do? I guess if I want a show I can go and see what Colin is up to in Aelita's body...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or I could leave him be and go find someone else to play with...\" Jack continued, scanning around the pool for some girls to have fun with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Using his intangibility, Jack floated through the wall and into the girl's changing room, where he had seen Colin run off to. He had set this in motion and he was curious to see where it would go. As he phased into the room, it seemed empty, but he could see a pair of feet underneath one of the stalls. <i>'Not wasting any time, huh pal...'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Jack creeped into the stall to find Colin fixated on a mirror mounted on the wall, hands preoccupied with his new breasts. \"This can't be real...\" Colin breathed, as he moved his hands behind his back, struggling with his bikini tie. As it came undone, revealing his new breasts, he stared at his reflection, eyes wide \"...wow... it is real.\" His hands shakily moved down to his hips, pulling down the bikini bottoms too, Aelita's face turning completely red now as Colin processed his new, naked body in the mirror, hands running all across his new form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack just chuckled as he watched how flustered Colin was as Aelita. He realized he had acted a bit similar when he had possessed his neighbor earlier, but it seemed so funny to watch from the outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 'playing' for a few minutes, Colin seemed to regain some control over himself. He pulled his bikini bottom back on and struggled to get the bikini right too. It stayed on but even Jack could tell he tied it wrong. Colin took one more look in the mirror, nervously turning his head left to right, and moved in to kiss his own reflection. Jack cackled a bit at the sight of it, but Colin couldn't hear him. '<i>This kid's more hopeless than me... I wonder what I can do for him...'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Colin continued to enjoy his time with the mirror, posing and grabbing at his new body, Colin decided to intervene again.

Possessing her this time was more difficult, and her body buckled a little as he gained control. Hands on knees, Jack pushed himself upright, and felt his thighs rub together. His smooth, slender thighs with nothing between them. He had done it, and was back in Aelita's young, cute body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding upright, feeling his - <i>Aelita's</i> - breasts jiggle slightly, he stretched and began adjusting the bikini top Colin had barely secured. He removed it, sneaking a peek at the exposed globes of flesh on his chest, and re-tied the top of the bikini in a more stable manner. Then, adjusting the top, he stepped out of the changeroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack glided over to one of the larger swimming pools, hips slightly swaying as he walked, and heard a voice in his head. Colin's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... what's going on? I can't... control my body anymore\" Colin complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought this wasn't your body...\" Jack muttered under his breath to not draw attention to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... no, but I was... \" Colin stuttered. \"Who are you, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... no one in particular. Just... a ghost, I guess, having some fun.\" Jack replied, again in a whisper under his breath. He figured Colin would feel the words, even if he wasn't able to hear them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool! So... why me? Why Aelita?\" Colin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing personal against either of you... you just happened to be in the right place at the right time. For me, anyway.\" Jack, thinking about it, replied. Then got an idea. \"Hey, want to have some fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure... I guess. What were you thinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack walked up to the diving board, noticing the sheer number of spectators he had. He knew that they were mostly interested in Aelita's body, but he didn't care. He purposely exaggerated the motion of his hips as he approached the board, then jumped. He hit the water in a sharp, precise dive, cutting through the water smoothly as he pulled himself to the surface. The water cascaded around and off his breasts, but bikini top held in place, which was a relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... so what were you thinking?\" Colin asked again. Jack realized he couldn't exactly have a conversation with Colin now, not with so many bystanders checking him out. So he tried something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you hear this?\" Jack projected the sentence as he had seen Lilith do not too long ago. Strangely enough, he heard it as Aelita's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Came the enthusiastic reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look around\" Jack continued to converse with Colin in his head. To help, Jack slowly turned around, giving Colin a full view of everyone around. \"Anyone catches your fancy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... what do you mean?\" Colin replied, hesitation in his voice evident. \"You can't mean... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you perv.\" Jack laughed, trying to imitate someone of Aelita's age in her manners. \"Is there anyone here you want to <i>be</i>? We can walk up, say hello, and I can... drop you off, so to speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" the relief was almost tangible in Colin's voice. \"Umm... and I guess you won't let me stay where I am now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guessed it. Let's give Aelita here a break, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you'll...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll switch too, shortly after you\" Jack said. Although he wasn't sure how soon that would happen. He was enjoying his current body. \"So, go on, don't be shy, pick someone out!\"</span></div></div>",

Cassidy was much taller than Aelita, and her breasts were at least a cup size bigger than jacks current mount. Not to mention, Cassidy had a killer ass and legs. Jack smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, get ready\" Cassidy walked over, both 'Aelita' and Cassidy having the attention of many watchers. As Cassidy neared, jack thought of a way to plant Colins sooul in Cassidy. Finally, as Cassidy was in range, jack lunged at her and locked lips with Cassidy, sending Colin into his new host.

Maybe she hasn't had a boyfriend for a while.\" joked Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or she has one who treats her <i>very</i> well\" added Janet. \"Anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack eyes the two girls. Janet, the younger one, had bright red hair which cascaded past her shoulders. She was a bit shorter than Nikki, pale, with decent-size breasts that Jack estimated to be around a C. She was relaxing on her towel in a black 2-piece bikini. Next to her was Nikki. Taller, slimmer, more tanned, but with smaller breasts, she was wearing a white bikini. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, who should I play with...\" Jack asked himself. Then an interesting idea came to him. \"I know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked up around Janet, and stood behind her, getting a good look at her cleavage. Not as impressive (or as forced) as Aelita's was, but still pretty nice. And, he thought, more to play with than Nikki's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the way his sisters had always complained about the taller, older girls at school and how she was so jealous of them, Jack figured that the same was going on here. Even though Janet and Nikki were friends, Jack didn't really doubt that Janet was in some way jealous of Nikki's body, and her height. Well today she was going to get a nice surprise. And Jack was going to have some fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing Janet's shoulders, he <i>pulled</i> her soul out. She let out a grunt, and went silent. He was now, somehow, holding a ghostly Janet by the shoulders up in midair. Her ghost form was surprisingly light, and she didn't really seem to be doing anything. Just kind of lying on the ground, except a few feet off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Janet, are you ...\" Nikki glanced over and started, hearing the sound her friend had made. Realizing he should probably do something fast, he dropped Janet into Nikki's body. \"... ok? Huh? Am I...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She thinks she's switched with Nikki...\" Jack thought. \"Maybe I can play along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack jumped into Janet's body, feeling himself become solid once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, what was that...\" Jack said in Janet's voice, feigning surprise. Her voice sounded and felt more pleasant than any of the other bodies he had inhabited today, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki?\" Nikki asked. Well, it was Janet in control, but Nikki's body. \"Is that you in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Janet?\" Jack responded, making a point of looking down at his new body. \"Did we... did we switch bodies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks that way.\" Janet looked down at herself, admiring Nikki's nice body maybe for a little bit more than necessary. \"Hey, do you think that's what happened to Ali?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you mean you think she switched with that nerd?\" Jack replied, trying to keep in character. \"Would explain a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, what a pervert. Gets swapped into a girl and first thing he does is grab his tits.\" Janet complained. \"Poor Ali, wonder how she's doing in his body. She looked pretty shocked before she ran off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack didn't want to tell Janet that pretty much <i>any</i> teenage guy would have done the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now?\" asked Janet. \"Should we go find Ali?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should just try to pretend nothing happened.\" Jack sighed. \"I hope this will be over soon. Until then, probably best to just go with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right, Nik.\" He could see Janet barely containing a grin at being left in Nikki's older, taller, sexier body. She stretched out, yawning, fully extending her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't enjoy yourself too much\" Jack said, trying to sound unimpressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry... but you know how much I've always envied how tall and sexy you are, Nik. I can't help it...\" Janet replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fine, I guess we can enjoy ourselves while we're here.\" Jack added, then had another idea. He pushed Janet's breasts up with his new hands. \"Besides, I've always wanted more in the chest department.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's win-win!\" Janet exclaimed, no longer hiding her excitement. Jack smiled in her body. \"So, shall we go for a swim? Hope you don't mind, but I want to see what it feels like for you when you get <i>all</i> the attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure, knock yourself out...\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he watched as Nikki's body, piloted by a very excited Janet, got up. She was grinning ear-to-ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!\" Janet called, extending her hand to her former body. Jack took her hand, and she pulled him up. \"Let's go already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Am I going to call you Nikki while we're doing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Janet turned around in Nikki's body, mischievous glint in her eye, \"You can call me whatever you want, <i>Master</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilith?\" Jack asked, dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one and only!\" Lilith replied cheerfully with Nikki's voice. \"My, you <i>are</i> being rather generous today, Master. Or rather, my <i>Mistress</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, <i>Mistress</i>, last I checked, the title 'Master' doesn't really apply to someone with tits and a pussy. Or did you not notice...\" Lilith said cheekily, looking Jack's borrowed body up and down to make the point stick. Jack looked down at himself, and saw Janet's black bikini, the top part of which was being filled out nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I meant.\" Jack pouted. \"And I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, I'm just playing with you.\" Lilith laughed. \"What I meant was, you leave your sexy neighbor alone, then you come here. You drop into a <i>very</i> pretty young thing, whose body you then give to a horny teen who has never seen a real pair of tits before. He's having the time of his life in the changerooms with that girl's body, by the way. Something <i>you</i> haven't even tried yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... \" Jack stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then you put this girl,\" Lilith continues, pointing at Jack's body, \"into the body of her <i>much</i> sexier friend, and pretend like it was all an accident that you had nothing to do with. That was a nice touch, though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm not saying what you did was bad - on the contrary, it sounds like you were having a lot of fun - but I wish you'd have properly <i>enjoyed</i> a woman's body before playing these games of yours.\" Lilith said. \"I <i>know</i> that you want to, I can <i>feel</i> it. What's stopping you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't know. I just felt like having some public fun that wouldn't get anyone in too much trouble,\" Jack replied. \"Pretending to be Nikki in Janet's body was pretty cool, though. I think I did a decent job of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith walked up to Jack and stood very close, hungry look in her eye. Her whole stance and attitude changed instantly. How did she do that so smoothly? She was so close that their breasts were almost touching. Lilith leaned in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my <i>Mistress</i>, you did a <i>very</i> good job imitating me...\" she said in Nikki's voice in such a sensual way that Jack started to get turned on just by hearing it. \"Now how about I give you your reward, hmmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith was very close. He could smell her sweet breath, and could feel her erect nipples through her bikini top pressing against the top of the breasts that he carried. He felt his own nipples hardening, the fabric of Janet's bikini tickling them slightly. He also felt an unfamiliar warmth in his crotch. He fidgeted slightly, pushing his thighs together, and becoming very aware of the lack of his usual manhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, I can make it feel <i>very</i> nice down there, Mistress...\" Lilith cooed, taking one hand and gently caressing Jack's back, drawing her hand down around her hips. Then she stopped. \"But I'm sure you don't want this here and now. After all, it might get someone <i>in trouble</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right. As much as Jack wanted to continue - and he <i>really</i> did, after Lilith's teasing - he still felt like he should be at least somewhat responsible. He looked longingly toward the changerooms. He could get some privacy in there. Or he could just go swimming and satisfy his newfound urges later.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly feeling like he was able to get a minor amount of revenge, Jack acts without though, and quickly steps to Lilith's side, blocking view of anyone nearby from his sudden actions. Feeling bold and mischievous, Jack swiftly moves his hand towards 'Janet's' bikini clad pussy, and teasingly caresses her slit through the fabric, eliciting a surprised moan from Lilith. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Emboldened by the reaction, Jack takes it one step further, and slips 'his' dainty hand inside the bikini, and finds 'Janet's' clit, once found, he starts to slowly rub it. Shocked by the sudden actions of her Mistress, Lilith's knees buckle, and she nearly falls face forward, being saved only by Jack's close proximity (and him moving closer as she fell) catching her and holding her up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Looking up at Jack with wanton desire, with Lust brimming in her eyes, Lilith attempts to capture Jack's lips in a kiss, but misses, as Jack, apparently seeing her intent, had prepared and evaded her actions, while redirecting her to stumble ...right towards the pool. Unable to stop her movement, Lilith staggers forward, and falls headfirst into the pool, and for the first time in a long while, finds her burning arousal slightly doused by the sudden chill of the pool she just fell into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Laughing that his plan worked, and hoping that her revenge to his minor pay-back wouldn't be too bad, Jack saunters over to the edge of the pool, calling out to Lilith to keep up their performance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"You know, if you were so excited to cool off <i>Janet</i>, you didn't have to nearly fall in like that,\" Jack taunted, chuckling while trying to keep his balance at the edge of the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sputtering at the audacious act as well as the mouthful of water, and feeling extremely turned-on by the boldness of her Mistress, Lilith decides to go along with the act for now, and plot the appropriate revenge while letting him think he'd won for now. Fighting down the wicked smirk that wants to appear on her face, but knowing that will tip Jack off, Lilith smiles innocently instead, and simply responds to 'Nikki's taunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well <i>'Nikki'</i>, there's plenty of room in here, and I'm sure you need to cool off as well, besides, there's plenty of time for me to make sure you are completely fine too.\" Lilith responds, then deciding to take the perfect opportunity Jack has left her, sends a brief but intense wave of arousal directed at 'his' pussy, getting some satisfying results as 'Nikki' pitches forward into the pool suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hearing Lilith's response to his taunting, Jack wonders if he overlooked something, and realizing that he's a lot closer to the edge of the pool than before his taunting, tries to take a step back, but is suddenly assailed by a sudden jolt of pleasure centered directly in his nether's. His mid-step, and sudden jerking and buckling of legs pitches his body forward, and while annoyed with this turn of events, Jack feels he cannot blame Lilith, as it's quite similar to what he had done to her earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Landing in the pool, the shock of cool water causes Jacks nipples to harden, despite the subdued lust his sudden dip has caused. After surfacing, Jack sputters water just like Lilith had previously. Looking over at the smirk 'Janet' is sporting, as one, both Jack and Lilith laugh loudly, and decide to continue teasing each other later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A couple of hours of swimming, with the occasional hidden gropes and teases, Jack and Lilith both decide to get out of the pool and head towards the changing rooms. Along the way, Jack sees 'Aelita' sitting next to a still 'passed'out Colin, poking him occasionally, as if expecting it to wake up. Chuckling at 'Aelita's' actions draws Lilith's attention to it, and prompts her to chuckle as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I wonder if i should put Colin back yet, or wait for him to try to find me,\" Jack muses aloud, prompting a giggle from 'Janet'. Curious, Jack looks over, and sees mirth in 'Janet's' eyes, as well as a devious grin that seems to get wider the longer the giggling goes on. Seeing she has your attention, Lilith decides to answer after her amusement subsides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"You could do that Mistress, but from the strength of his soul, he'll be ejected back to his body within the next ten minutes. So technically you don't need to help him, but it will be amusing to see his reactions from the sudden displacement,\" Lilith explains, holding back even more giggles, and causing Jack to think there's a bit more to this than amusement at a sudden ejection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I know I'm really new at all this Lilith, but why is his ejection and displacement so funny?\" Jack inquires, intrigued by learning more about this branch of magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, since he was not the one to initiate the 'possession', nor is he the one to end it, the side effect will be to drag his current 'host's' soul along, and reverse their positions, as well as giving a partial memory of his actions while she was suppressed. Some people in the past that I've witnessed this happening to have had the best reactions I've ever seen,\" Lilith reveals to Jack, barely making it to the end before bursting into giggles again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hearing this, Jack wonders if he should do anything about it, or just go into the changing room with Lilith, or even possibly just find something else to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

He had managed to get out of Chloe, so he was sure he would be able to do it again. With that knowledge backing him up, he could safely have some fun... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were chatting about something. He wandered closer, and they split up. Aelita walked over to the pool area, while Janet and Nikki went to the changerooms with their bags. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know who I want...\" Jack said to himself, and followed the two girls into the changeroom. Aelita was a bit too young for him - she looked younger than his younger sister, and that would be far too weird. Jack made his way into the changerooms, following the two girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he saw was at once something out of his dreams, and something rather strange. There were maybe ten women, of varying ages, in various states of undress. Sure, there were cubicles as well, but none of these ladies seemed to really care. He spent some time staring at a rather attractive woman in her thirties, who was completely naked, putting on her two-piece swimsuit. Her breasts were sagging a little, but still looked pretty good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing back on his initial targets, Jack saw that Janet had decided to go to one of the cubicles. Nikki teased her for a second, instead opting to go off to the side and find a spare spot. <i>Perfect</i>, thought Jack. He wouldn't need to deal with the awkwardness of her friend. Janet closed the door behind her, and Jack turned his full attention to Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was the oldest of the three girls, looking at about Jack's age (or a little older). Her long purple hair was tied back in a ponytail, which Jack found curious. Purple wasn't a super popular color - at least, he hadn't seen it before. She was dressed in a pale yellow sundress, which she was slowly peeling off. Jack watched with interest as she removed it, revealing a slim, sexy figure wearing a matching set of white bra and panties, with maybe B-cup breasts. Pretty small, but she was tall, slim and otherwise very toned. Jack would enjoy this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nikki undid the clasp on her white bra, Jack practically drooled. When she carefully removed her bra and put it in her bag, perky breasts exposed, Jack couldn't hold himself back, and stepped forward towards her. <i>This is it</i>, he thought. As much as he was enjoying the show of the gorgeous Nikki putting on her swimsuit, he would much rather be running the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki was still bent over, fumbling around in her bag, when Jack stepped behind and into her. His legs overlapped hers, and he found himself glued in. A tingling feeling went over his legs as he realized he was now integrated into Nikki's bottom half up to her waist. He flexed his legs, enjoying the feeling of the cool air running over his bare thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was daydreaming, Nikki found what she had been looking for - her bikini, a tiny bright yellow two-piece. She stood up in an effort to put it on... and her torso collided with Jack's ghostly form. Jack felt a jarring <i>snap</i> as he was pulled right into Nikki's upper body. The cool air around certain new features of what was now his body showed him that the possession was complete. He smiled, and brought his new, slim and feminine hands up to his new, perky breasts and gave them a nice squeeze. They were firm, and sent a small electric shock through his body when he accidentally grazed a nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm\" Jack moaned quietly, relishing the feeling of Nikki's slim body as his own. He looked around. Janet was still changing, and no one else had noticed anything was wrong. </span></div></div>",

He had managed to get out of Chloe, after a little while. So there was no panic. He could take his time, have some fun... and when he was bored, he was sure he would be able to move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls were talking among themselves, but Jack couldn't hear what they were talking about. As he approached them, they split up - Aelita went toward the pool, while Janet and Nikki went inside the changerooms. Jack snuck one last glance at Aelita - she was pretty, but far too young. That would be too weird, he thought. The others, however...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know who I want...\" Jack said to himself, and followed the two girls into the changeroom. He hoped he would be able to split the two up - it would make possessing one of them a lot easier for him. He floated behind them and turned the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he saw was at once something out of his dreams, and something rather strange.

Nikki teased her for a second, and went off to the side and find a spare spot. <i>Perfect</i>, thought Jack. He half floated, half walked over to Janet's cubicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cubicle door closed right in his face. Except, it didn't really bother him. It kind of... went through him. The cubicle was actually pretty large, considering. He stood right at the door, staring at Janet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet was the middle of the three, a year or so younger than Jack. Her long, bright red hair went down past her shoulders and over her black t-shirt. The t-shirt she was now removing... Jack watched with fascination. Janet was of medium height, not thin but not really chubby, with a pretty nice rack. Plus, he was sure she would feel pretty great anyway... Janet peeled off her shirt, exposing a white bra which covered her C-cup breasts. She rummaged in her bag for what Jack figured was her swimsuit, while Jack stared at her ass. She was wearing jeans, Jack noted, and they tightly hugged the contours of her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet dug out her swimsuit - two-piece and black, and set it down next to her. She began unclipping her bra... at which point Jack decided he wanted to view from a different angle. He stepped around her, careful to not touch her lest he be sucked into her body before he was ready... and stared at her exposed breasts, as she picked up her bikini top, and put it on over them. Janet tied it up behind her neck, and behind her back, then adjusted her breasts. <i>I could be doing that</i>... thought Jack, and stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Janet began to unbutton her jeans, Jack reached out and touched her shoulders with his ghostly hands. Janet froze - did she feel something? She stood up and looked ahead, right through Jack. <i>Ok, gotta make this quick</i>... Jack thought. He pulled himself into her, his face going into her face, his torso hitting hers, his legs overlapping hers... Jack felt a slight sensation of dizziness as his world spun, and he found himself facing the back of the cubicle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at himself, and saw large breasts snugly resting inside a black swimsuit. He pulled his hands up, grabbing a feel. They were nice and soft. He shook his head, sending red hair flying around and out of his eyes. Then, he smiled. He had done it. He was inside Janet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's borrowed hands returned to where they had been before - undoing the buttons on Janet's jeans. He lightly brushed her crotch as he undid the buttons... a feeling of anticipation washed over him. He remembered he hadn't actually tried anything like <i>that </i>when he had been in Chloe... and now was the perfect time. Nikki was still getting changed, and he was locked inside his own private cubicle, Janet's body entirely at his command...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, he might be able to have more fun if he met up with the other two girls first.</span></div></div>",

That last time had proven a bit too uncomfortable. It was going to be a long walk - half an hour or so - so Jack decided to try something interesting. He jumped, and noticed that he went a bit higher than usual - he jumped a good five feet in the air, and slowly floated down. If he could do that, could he...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more minutes of jumping, and Jack thought he had the hang of staying in the air a bit longer than he had before. He jumped, this time a good twelve feet, and sat there. In the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...\" Jack whispered, in awe. \"Ghosts have so much fun...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe proceeded to float forwards, slowly at first, but picking up speed as he figured out he didn't need to push against anything to move as he normally would have if he were still solid. Within minutes he was at the entrance to the mall. He stopped abruptly. It was a huge building, perhaps six stories high, with hundreds of shops, restaurants, boutiques... it didn't have a movie theater though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flew in through a second story window into what appeared to be a large department store. In front of him were rows of shelves with kids toys, while off to the side were electronics. Jack looked around, and didn't really see anyone. Barring any cute employees walking around, he wasn't going to find a body to have fun in where he was right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly making his way out of the department store, sticking to the ceiling as he did so, he decided to pass through the women's clothing section. There was still no one of note actually shopping here - the only person in the section was the fitting room attendant, and she looked to be well into her fifties and wasn't in the best shao. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks,\" thought Jack, and left the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe halls of the shopping mall were a lot more populated, with lots of people milling about holding bags of stuff they'd bought. Jack's eyes caught a group of teenagers laughing, on the escalator going down toward the food court, maybe a year younger than him. Three guys and four girls, with at least one established couple among them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" thought Jack. That was a group he could definitely have some fun with. All of the girls in the group were attractive, and one especially - blonde, wearing a white low cut, sleeveless shirt and tight jeans which showcased her fit legs and ass. \"Oh, she's <i>nice</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack floated over to them, he noticed someone else very... intriguing. Tall, slim, maybe a year older than him, the girl had white blonde hair, and was dressed in a form-fitting bright blue dress that accented her curves. She was heading to a nearby clothing boutique, and Jack was very interested in what she was going to try on - or rather, take off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe followed...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The couple went one way, two girls went another, the two remaining guys went a third way, and the girl he was following went alone. What a stroke of luck, Jack thought.  He stayed floating above her, careful to not accidentally make contact with anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl made her way to a salad station, hips slightly swaying as she walked. Oh, she had a confident air about her, alright. Might be a cheerleader. She had the body for it, that was for sure. Fitter than Chloe, and now Jack knew exactly what he was getting into...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost at the front of the line, the girl put her phone away and started actually looking at the menu.

He felt a tingle go through the lower half of his ghost form - curious, he hadn't felt any physical sensation betore - as he gradually sunk deeper into the girl's back. She appeared to have frozen, slightly alarmed. Jack didn't know what she was feeling, but she did seem to still be able to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept floating down until his feet had gone past her hips. He felt himself lose the sensation of his legs as he continued to float down. By the time his shoulders had met hers, he noticed he was not as large as he usually was. His shoulders were barely wider than hers. Jack pushed himself farther, now only having his arms and head outside her body. He snapped his head into place and felt a surge of dizziness. His arms followed, and his senses faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack came to moments later, a rush of feeling returning to him. He was solid again, and he lifted a hand to brush the hair out of his eyes. He felt a mischievous smile creep onto his face as he became aware of more sensations - stretched fabric hugging every inch of his legs, something lightly constricting bound around his chest, and a very billowy shirt which didn't quite cover his sleeves. Jack pulled the phone that was in his hand up to his face, seeing a very cute - and very feminine - face looking back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had done it. He was now the hottie, standing in line to order salad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smile widening, some ideas raced in Jack's head. Now was his chance to properly <i>get a feel</i> for a woman's body. But he was in a public place, and the girl's friends would be expecting her to rejoin them - salad and all. He looked around, trying to spot the rest of the group. The two guys were already seated, and the couple weren't far off.</span></div></div>",

Why possess just this one girl - no matter how hot - when he could play with an entire group of her friends too? Settling for being a spectator for now, Jack floated and took in the view from above. The girl's top was quite low-cut, exposing her perky breasts at the perfect angle for Jack to admire. She was staring at her phone, and was blissfully unaware of the ghost practically drooling over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she ordered her salad and went back to the table. Jack floated on after her, seeing that the two guys, as well as the couple, had already sat down and were waiting for everyone else. Turning around, Jack saw the last 2 girls approaching. Oh, the miracle of timing. The group sat down, opened their meals, and began eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack, meanwhile, was thinking of a game he could play. He wasn't sure exactly what he was capable of as a ghost. All he knew was that last time he as much as touched anyone, he was absorbed into their body and effectively became them until he otherwise extracted himself. Lilith had displaced his soul easily enough, perhaps he could do something similar?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that since he didn't know where to start on that front, he would go with something simpler, Jack thought to himself. If touching one person sucked him in, what would happen if he was to touch multiple people at once? He was sure he wouldn't be in control of multiple bodies, he couldn't even begin to imagine what that would be like. Best way to find out was to try, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack floated above the group, spread his limbs as wide as he could. The group was sitting fairly close to each other, if he bent his arms in just the right way and dropped himself down perfectly level, he should be able to hit all at once. He spun, looking at the group. Two girls, one with midlength brown hair, the other with long black hair tied back in a ponytail. Three guys, next to one of whom was his girlfriend - a shorter girl with bright red hair in a pixie cut. Finally, the girl he had followed here. Long, free flowing blond hair. Jack stayed facing her, and began to lower himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking around to make sure he was going to tag everyone, Jack forced himself downward.

Yeah, I'm Ash.\" the brunette replied. \"Who do I look like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you look like Lisa...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marie?\" Ash asked from Lisa's body. \"You're in Todd? But HOW?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I knew...\" Marie answered. \"So, who's everyone else? Let's start with the obvious, it looks like Eddie ended up in you, Ash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, why'd I have to get the pervert...\" Ash muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't hate!\" Eddie chirped from Ash's hot body, hands caressing her torso. \"I'm sure not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, enough. Lisa, where are you?\" Marie said. The guy next to Jack answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're in Steve. Steve?\" Marie asked again. The black-haired girl responded that time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, Steve, you're me. That is, Marie. I'm in Todd, so that leaves Grace and Eddie.\" Marie said, then added. \"Thanks, Steve, for being normal and <i>not</i> trying to cop a feel. Unlike some of us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I can't help it if Stevie is boring...\" the blonde girl said, hands on hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um. Well, I'm Grace.\" said the third guy, who Jack assumed had to be Eddie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Everyone's accounted for.\" Marie finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo... Jack's current body was Grace. He snuck a quick peek down, and saw a button-up shirt covering a decent sized rack. It was definitely the biggest at the table, anyway. He could have some fun in here... but everyone (except Eddie, who got the blonde girl's body) was focused on everyone else, so Jack wasn't likely to get a moment to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"How did we even get here?\" one of the guys said. Jack vaguely remembered hearing him say that he was Grace - the original owner of the nice curvy body he was currently sitting in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beats me...\" said Ash - the real Ash, inside the brunette girl. \"I just hope it stops soon so <i>Eddie stops fucking feeling himself up in my body</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, are you upset?\" Eddie said from Ash's body, running his hands up and down her sexy petite figure. \"I'm having a lot of fun...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack watched with interest as Ash's hands travelled up to her breasts and squeezed. The brunette, Lisa - with Ash inside - looked positively furious. Jack sneaked a glance down at his own chest, encased in a button-up short or dress - he wasn't sure, he couldn't see under the table. He shifted his legs a little and felt a refreshing breeze caress the inside of his thighs. Dress, then. Nice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the group started bickering, arguing about whose fault what was, who was lucky to be in whose body. Eddie, meanwhile, was taking advantage of his temporary new body and situation, and had one hand up Ash's light blouse. Then, out of the corner of his eye, Jack saw a woman approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss, you know that's highly inappropriate.\" The woman said, and everyone turned around to face her. Jack got a good look at her, and his jaw nearly dropped. She was tall, with flowing red hair, slightly tanned skin and lightly painted lips. She had an impressive rack which was tightly held in a button-up black shirt. A short black skirt and sheer black stockings covered long, fit legs that ended in sexy knee-high boots. And... she was wearing a security badge and a walkie-talkie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean I need to be punished?\" Eddie said in Ash's voice, with a suggestive tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking great, he's going to get me arrested\" muttered the real Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should come with me.\" the officer said, then walked over to Jack and tapped him on the shoulder. \"Miss, mind coming along as well? You seem the most levelheaded here, maybe you could help talk some sense into your friend here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack nodded and got up, and walked with Eddie and the officer away from the table. Eddie whispered \"Todd, right? I don't get why you're not having the same fun as I am. I mean Grace is a hottie too... Not as much as Ash, but still.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack didn't respond. Instead, he looked closely at the officer. She was familiar somehow... then it hit him. It was Lilith. They arrived in what appeared to be a security booth, and Lilith ushered them in, winking at the dumbfounded security guard sitting at the desk and closing the door behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now...? Are you going to spank me?\" Eddie teased. Lilith looked over at Jack, who smiled back knowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like this guy. Can we keep him?\" Lilith asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, lady. I don't know who you're looking at, but there clearly aren't any <i>guys</i> in here.\" Eddie said, looking down at his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're saying your name isn't really Eddie?\" Lilith responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha... \"? Eddie said, stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I know what's going on. And I like fun as much as the next person.\" She winked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait wait wait. You expect me to believe that? Who the hell are you, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm Lilith. I'm a succubus. Inside your lovely friend's body over there is my Master, Jack. He's a local, you could say.\" Lilith explained. \"Oh and he's the one who switched up your group, but I think it was probably an accident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You expect me to believe that?\" Eddie muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at yourself. Your body. Hell, shove your hand down your pants, like you've been wanting to ever since you noticed you weren't yourself anymore. \" Lilith said. \"Should be proof enough for you, considering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie thought for a second.</span></div></div>",

How do I know this wasn't just some... cosmic glitch or something?\" Eddie said, defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, a cosmic glitch that just affected your group?\" Lilith laughed. Eddie stood his ground. \"Fine. More proof, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith walked up to Eddie and stood very close to him. She was a head taller than him in her current form. Then, she began to transform. Only slight changes at first - skin and hair getting lighter, body getting slimmer. Then, her clothes began to change color and form as well. Within a few seconds, Jack looked to see two identical (and hot) girls standing in front of him, staring at one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's that?\" Lilith, now a carbon copy of Ash, asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... uhh... \" Eddie stammered, unable to process the fact that he was now looking at a clone of his friend - whose body he was in right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's make something else come out of that pretty, disbelieving mouth of yours, hmm?\" Lilith said mischievously, and took a step back. Then, she undid the top button on her jeans, and slipped a dainty hand into her pants and began to move it back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lilith proceeded to pleasure herself, Jack watched as Eddie's breath began to quicken, and his eyes widened. He let out a small moan and reached into his own copy of Ash's jeans, as if feeling around for something that wasn't there. He bit his lip and stifled another moan as whatever he was feeling seemed to increase in power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stared, growing conscious of the fact that his own body was capable of similar things, and that it was quite different from his own. And now was as good a time as any to check it out. He began slowly unbuttoning the buttons on the dress he was wearing, revealing an impressive cleavage held in place by a thick black bra. He slipped off the dress, looking down at Grace's body. It was nice, albeit not as petite as Ashe. Not fat by any means, Jack thought as he caressed his now completely exposed stomach and reached down to Grace's panties with a careful curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA muffled sound brought him out of his trance and he looked up to see who he assumed was Eddie, getting very into his actions. One of the Ash-looking girls had removed her blouse, revealing a slim figure in only a small bra and a half undone pair of jeans. The other, who Jack assumed was Lilith, had a devilish smile on her face as she still stood, fully clothed, still pleasuring herself exactly as before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie ripped the jeans off Ash's toned legs, and, turning to Jack with a look of lustful hunger in his eyes, pounced on him. Jack felt as the bare flesh of Ash's body caressed his own borrowed body, Ash's small breasts, still in their bra, pushed against Grace's larger ones, as he felt Ash's face crudely and passionately mash itself into his. He returned the ... kiss, he figured, and pulled Ash's body closer to himself. This was getting unexpectedly good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh's hand moved around and squeezed Jack's borrowed ass, and then made it's way down the front of Grace's panties as Ash pulled back for more comfortable access to her goal. Jack felt as her delicate, warm hands stroked the surface of his borrowed pussy, and felt his own arousal grow. He pulled Ash in for another kiss, his own hands fumbling to remove her bra and her panties. She continued to stroke him, and slipped a long finger deep into Grace's waiting pussy. Jack managed to maneuver himself into a position where he could return the favor, his own hands making their way to Ash's already moist crotch as she continued to finger him, sending waves of pleasure coursing through his body. Jack let out a loud moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes of pleasure later, the two stood apart, completely naked and glistening with each other's sweat and other fluids, grinning at each other. Jack saw a completely naked Ash - regardless of who was piloting her body - in all her sexy glory, blonde hair matted, slim form standing in a pose that would have been suggestive even if she had not been completely naked. Jack looked down at himself, a less slim, more curvaceous body, also standing with a very stupid grin on his borrowed female face. Lilith, still fully clothed, withdrew her hand from her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me now?\" she smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I say no, does that mean we get to do that again?\" Eddie panted. \"Because I'm inclined to say no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith laughed. \"Well, if you come along with us we can do that whenever, with and as whoever you want... I'm just in it for the fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck yeah, I'm in.\" Eddie said. \"So where to now?\"</span></div></div>",

This girl, though, he wouldn't want to miss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked oddly familiar. Jack floated at ceiling height, admiring her as she walked through and browsed through various coats and dresses. This was boring. But there was a cute attendant walking around...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack quickly swooped in and possessed the attendant, a cute girl in her early twenties wearing a loose-fitting green dress and white wedges, all obviously from this store. Jack thought it matched nicely with her dark blonde hair - that was currently sitting at the corner of his vision. Feeling the familiar bounce of small breasts, Jack flittered throughout the store, just enjoying moving around in this girl's body. It was very comfortable, and the air conditioning blowing up and around Jack's exposed legs added a bit to the thrill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde in the blue dress, Jack's original target, had made her way to the fitting rooms. Perfect. Jack focused, feeling that pinch at the back of his neck as he drifted out of the attendant's body, leaving her disoriented. That was definitely easier the second time, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing his original quarry into the fitting rooms, he found her in one of the booths, choosing what to try on first. Just as Jack floated behind her, she picked out her first item. Much to Jack's delight, it was a black miniskirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack watched as the girl slowly unzipped her blue dress, peeling it off and carefully folding it. Now dressed only in a black lace bra and matching panties, she stood holding the miniskirt. Jack figuratively drooled over her - her body was an easy 10, perfectly proportioned, fit and toned. She began to slip on the skirt, then admired her reflection in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Jack do?</span></div></div>",

I was actually about to possess her, but heard you coming into the store, and decided to see why you were here.\" Jack says, curious as to if Lilith was really here by random chance, or if she had engineered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As if reading his mind, Lilith smirks, before quietly responding to Jack's unasked question. \"Well, about ten minutes after your visit, Alex had gotten at text from Kelly asking if he wished to go to the mall with her for shopping. After reading it, and thinking nothing of it, Alex invited me along to 'suffer' and help carry any of Kelly's purchases. As you heard upon our entrance, Kelly was most...displeased, with Alex's actions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack chortles at the story, wondering how Alex didn't pick up the signs that Kelly had blatantly dropped. 'seriously, a girl doesn't ask the boyfriend along for clothes shopping just to be a pack mule unless they've done something to piss them off recently' Jack silently said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, now what are you going to do master, as it would defeat the purpose of me possessing you, if you took back over this early.\" Lilith asks, staring subtly at a passing attendant, licking her lips after she passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"No idea, as the blonde I had targeted earlier doesn't seem as interesting. If anything I might stick around and see the show Kelly puts on, or go find something else to do.\" Jack answers, slightly curious as to why Lilith had asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"That sounds boring Master, why watch the show, when you could participate in it!\" Lilith quietly shouts, her tone suggesting that Jack was being an idiot in her opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Participate? While I don't mind possessing strangers at the moment, I don't think I really want to possess Alex, as part of you possessing me was so you could 'sync' with my memories faster, and 'interacting with familiar routines' was something you mentioned. Me possessing him would alter how he normally acts, thus defeating the purpose, wouldn't it?\" Jack asks, drawing a pained yet thoughtful look from 'Jack'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Sighing quietly, while lightly face-palming, Lilith decides to answer Jack after taking a few deep breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"While I am impressed by you recalling that little detail, and with trying to help me acclimate better, I feel you're overlooking a very simple thing Master. I'm here with Alex AND Kelly! To participate while keeping with the plan, you could possess Kelly, get experience in the female form, and have some fun trying something new.\" Lilith explains, sounding exasperated near the end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack is stunned, not only by the suggestion of possessing Kelly and putting on a show for his best friend and Succubus, but also for overlooking such a simple option. Slapping himself in the forehead, and then groaning as he still felt pain, even if was currently a spirit, Jack looks at Lilith and sees her smirking at his actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Sorry Lilith, I really don't know why I didn't think of that option.\"Jack apologizes. \"While it does sound intriguing, I don't know if i really want to do that, especially if Alex decides he wants to get intimate with Kelly while I'm possessing her. While it would be a new experience for sure, I really don't want to ever see my best friend in such a setting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lilith sighs again, shaking her head in apparent disappointment. Looking up, and panning her view around the shop again, to keep up appearances, decides to voice her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Master, while it is not my place to tell you how to have your fun, nor how to use your powers, it is my place to try to push your boundaries, and teach you how to control and grow your power. In this case, I would recommend you possess Kelly, regardless if you might end up in an uncomfortable situation, as you might find you like the outcome. If you do not try new things that you believe, without trying first, you will dislike, you will not grow, as a person or Warlock,\" Lilith states seriously,garnering Jack's full attention, as her words seem to strike a cord within him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pondering over Lilith's statement, and how it made him feel, Jack thought about if it would really be bad if he accidentally ended up in an intimate setting with Alex. 'It would be awkward yes, but I could technically bail, either de-possessing Kelly or leaving and asking Lilith to help alter Alex's mind...but that would be chickening out half-way through. Damn, Lilith really does have a point...' Jack silently debates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Whatever you choose Master, choose soon, as I believe that Kelly is dragging Alex towards the back part of the changing rooms, and I saw her talking to an attendant, who partially blocked off one changing area, making it a bit larger.

She sure was a hottie, and Jack still struggled to come to terms with the fact that only a minute or so ago he had <i>been</i> her, if only for about half an hour. Releasing Lilith sure had changed a lot in his life...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack left Chloe's house and began to walk down the street, staying aware of everything and everyone around him. No need for any other 'accidents' to happen. He figured he was lucky that it was Chloe who had run into him - she was young and exceptionally fit. What if it had been someone like his mother's friend Jennifer? She was about twice his age, and about twice his weight. Nice enough, but Jack couldn't imagine being in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know where he was going - he was just aimlessly turning occasionally, not really paying attention to where he was. Lost in his own thoughts and trying as hard as he could to not bump into anyone, he didn't really have any attention left for where he was headed. As he continued to walk, he began to feel ... something. He couldn't quite describe it. Nervousness, perhaps? As if something was missing, or as if he desperately needed something. Thing is, what was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about what it could be, he tried to pinpoint when he first felt it. Maybe... halfway on his walk? Definitely well after Lilith left, and after he left Chloe's body. Wait a minute... could he be needing a body? A sense of panic struck him. What if he couldn't handle being a ghost for too long? What if he was fading away, and this was his body... or whatever he was at the moment's way of telling him? Surely not... then again what did Jack know about ghosts?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking, he looked around for someone - anyone. who he could jump into and see if the feeling went away. He did see a few people across the road, but again he wasn't sure if he wanted to or not. Of everyone he saw, only one really stood out at all. She was about his age, with dirty blonde hair tied up in a ponytail. She wasn't what Jack would have called absolutely stunning, but she wasn't ugly either. Wearing a button-up green shirt and black slacks, and a really tired look on her face, Jack figured she had just finished what looked like a long shift at the local grocery store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else around was either older, much younger, or not in good shape - she looked to be at least reasonably fit. Not nearly as fit as Chloe looked, but then again that was quite a high standard to meet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack decided to go for it...</span></div></div>",

He waited until it was safe to cross - a different meaning for him, but still something to check for - and ran to the other side of the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked right beside the girl, and saw she did indeed look tired, and she was walking with her hands in her pockets. He hoped she lived somewhere nearby - he would hate to get stranded in some random place in a random body. Jack looked her over - might as well enjoy the view from the outside while he still could. She was shorter than him, maybe 5'8, average build, with what looked to be C-cup breasts, although he couldn't really tell for sure through her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Well, I guess.\" Jack thought to himself. He braced himself and jumped at her. He felt a shock go through his body as his vision blacked out for a second. Then, he found himself standing alone on a road, no more girl next to him. Jack glanced down at himself to see a green button-up shirt covering moderately sized breasts, he realized that it had worked - he had possessed that girl. He also noted that the feeling he had been experiencing earlier was gone, but it was replaced by a longing of a different kind - a new body meant new experiences. It was also possible that the girl he had jumped into had been thinking about something ... interesting earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a step forward, noting some new sensations coming from his borrowed body. First of all, his thighs slightly rubbing together, which also highlighted his new body's ... uhh... equipment. It was really strange to think that this wasn't the first time he had suddenly found himself with girl parts, but it was true. Didn't make the feeling any less weird, though. He felt breasts jiggling on his chest as he walked - much bigger than his previous experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to check who he actually was, he fumbled around in the girl's pocket for an id or something. Eventually he found it and took a look. Amy Winters - she was 19, and apparently lived right around the corner. Perfect. Jack noticed that her photo was also rather cute. He made his way to her house, trying to ignore the strange feelings he was getting from his body. Eventually he found it, walked in and, closing the door behind him, collapsed on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he wondered whether he was alone or not, some of Amy's memories came to him. She was a college student studying Pharmacology, with today being a day off. She had just finished a 6 hour opening shift at the grocery, and both her parents were at work. So, he thought, Amy was alone for the day. Which was perfect, since her memories also let him know of some of her... private hobbies. She had some particularly good toys she liked, and had been looking forward to 'unwinding' after a long shift at work when she got home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack decided to...</span></div></div>",

Catching his near stumble, Jack realizes that he's solid again....but looking forward in confusion, he sees that his original target is still a good dozen feet away....so who had he accidentally possessed? Looking down, the first thing Jack notices is that he has boobs again, and sadly not as big as Chloe's, though they do feel really sensitive. Thinking on that, Jack realizes that apparently he's not wearing a bra ....or any underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0'Seems whomever I'm possessing is a bit of an exhibitionist, or just having a bad day,' Jack muses silently, then goes back to inspecting his form. Continuing his inspection, Jack sees his top is a thin white tube-top and a short white denim skirt, with 'his' legs encased in a pair of knee-high boots, with  some fish-net stockings covering what is visible of his thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Really curious about who he's possessing now, Jack looks around for some kind of reflective surface, since upon raising his head, all Jack can really tell is that he's now a blonde. Spotting a chrome lamp post, Jack moves towards it slowly, trying to get used to his new weight and balance, especially with the sway his chest seems to try to add when leaning forward. Shivering from the slight breeze, even at such a sedate pace, Jack reaches the improvised mirror, and after just staring at the reflection for a few minutes, begins to imitate a fish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Starting back from the pseudo-mirror is his best friends girlfriend, Kelly! Completely baffled about how the quiet and nice girl he usually sees with his best friend could be dressed so provocatively (and sexily), Jack wonders if he even knew her ...or if Alex knows about this!

Jack being within about five minutes from Alex's house focuses and de-possessed Kelly's body. Jack in spirit form ends up at Alex's house in less then a minute and then finds Lilith.

What do you mean l<br>\r\nlilith and why is Alex acting like nothing is happening? Well in order you exited her body making me think you either accidentally de-possessed her or didn't like her and de-possessed her. Second I put a type of bubble spell on your friend he won't notice anything we say or do. Hell I could fuck his girlfriend and his mom right in front of his eyes and he would be none the wiser. Ok well don't do that or at least with my body said Jack. So are you done with my body yet? Well I could be. Said Lilith but I'm having so much fun I haven't even fucked anyone yet. What does that have to do with anything? Jack asked. Nothing much but I have been trapped for a century master with no sex can you imagine that? No I can't Jack replied. Well how about a deal Lilith said I'll not only give you back your body but I'll give you an extra reward if you fuck me before I do so. You mean you want to fuck me? Jack asked. Not like that was Lilith's reply see your body while not being a super stud is still rather nice. Tell you what there is a streat fair a block away possess someone there and return and I'll fuck what ever women your wearing. And give you both a night of sex you will never forget. So you wilm wait right her Jacj asked Lilith still in his body. Yes your friend is and will still be under my spell so like I said he would be none the wiser.

So the closest is the 34 year old Jessica Dean a teacher in the middle school you always thought she was sexy never had kids and was widowed a few years back. She would be a contender with her natural C cup breast and cute ass age has started touching on Miss Dean but not enough to ruin her looks. Next is the curvy Abigail Smith she was a big girl but not an unattractive big all the weight kinda distributed into the right places her breast where an all natural DDD cup and she had a nice big sexy ass she had long hair red in color with black highlights and wore clothes that showed off her natural curves well. She wasn't ashamed of her body in fact she made sure all men wanted it. Lastly we have Susie Green a slightly above average blonde with an average body her cup sive was some where between your neighbor Chloe and Miss Dean and she had a small ass but still decently shapped.

You wait a minute and see her put on a low cut V neck sweater and a miniskirt. Then stockings and heels. You wait until she is finished and then possess her. After a second of blacking out Jack looks down he sees he is in Abigail and alsk sees her massive rack. I don't know what she was planning but I know Lilith will be happy. Jack then walks back to Alex's house only to find his mom who was kinda hot naked and scrubbing the floor while Kelly was masturbating in the living room and Alex was doing the same. Hello mistress Lilith said in your voice. My you sure picked a fine women such nice tits. What the hell did you do Lilith? Oh I swapped Alex and Kelly then put an extreme lust spell on them and as for Alex's mom I put a spell on her to make her perfure nudity so she will do everything at home nude. After all she looks so good for her age a DD rack and a nice ass I almost wanted you to possess her, but I see you had a great choice in mind. You only half listened to Lilith's explanation you were entranced by Alex's mom Miss Evans a little bit. I see you know how attractive she is don't you mistress. On to the main event however. Lilith kisses you but as she does so with your mouth you start to feel super horny. Don't worry mistress thats just my way of making sure you enjoy what's about to happen as much as I will. Lilith then takes your bodys fingers and starts rubbing your new clit. While taking your skirt off with the other. My she wad ready for sex tonight already mistress. Lilith says while still fingering you. You just barely manage to get enough control to take off the sweater and bra while finally surrendering to your current bodies desire. Lilith stop playing with me fuck me fuck me now with my own body you say. Now if that isn't an invitation I don't know what is. Lilith fucks you for an hour in the living room surrounded by two people masturbating and a newly declared nudist. You orgasm multiple times each better then then the last as you finally pass out. You wake up to find your back in your body. Welcome back master comes from Abigail's mouth. Lilith why are you Abigail? This is my reward for you master letting me have sex for the first time in a century. I planned to fuck you with the body you brought back.

He figured that Lilith was right - this was a very unique opportunity for him to experience a whole new world, and it would be a damn shame to waste it. He did have a few hours alone, after all. What would the harm be in enjoying himself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked down at Chloe's sweaty form. Pink sports bra barely exposing her B-cup breasts, bare midriff, cute belly button, very tight black shorts which only went to mid-thigh, and long bare legs. He had taken off her sneakers, and was left with bright pink ankle socks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, I need to go find a mirror\" Jack said, thinking out loud, relishing hearing Chloe's sexy voice saying his dirty thoughts. \"This is so <i>hot</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack walks over to Chloe's bedroom, and finds a full length mirror. He did pause to think about how he knew exactly where the bedroom was, having never been here before. Lilith had mentioned \"integrating\" with a body, maybe this was what she meant?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMysteries of possession momentarily discarded, Jack examined himself in the mirror. Chloe's blond hair was tied back in a ponytail, and she still looked a little sweaty. As Jack brought her hand upward, stroking her ass on the way, he let out a little moan of satisfaction. This was going to be amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah\", he whispered. He continued to move her hand across her midriff, drawing a line just on the inside of her shorts. He didn't go all the way in - no, he was saving <i>that</i> particular experience for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chloe did work up quite a sweat,\" he thought. Maybe I should help her get cleaned up? He grinned devilishly, and saw Chloe's reflection do the same. \"I'm going to go run a bath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made his way over to the bathroom, and saw that Chloe had a luxuriously large tub, jets and all, with an array of various bath oils and cleaning products standing on the edge. He turned on the water, and made his way back to the mirror. He wasn't done there yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where were we...\" Jack asks himself, trying to make Chloe sound as naughty as possible. The anticipation from what he was about to get up to was causing him to feel an unfamiliar warmth in his crotch, but he still decided to wait. Moving his hands up to Chloe's sports bra, he cups her breasts in both hands. They were very firm - and he couldn't feel much through the bra. It had to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack pulls the bra over Chloe's head, and looks back in the mirror. He sees Chloe, now topless wearing only her tight shorts, breasts in their full glory, just waiting for attention. Discarding the bra, Jack moves his hands over to Chloe's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's <i>much</i> better,\" he moans, feeling jolts of pleasure from massaging Chloe's nipples. Her breasts are warm, sweaty and very sensitive. He strokes her breasts, feeling Chloe's nipples perk up. \"These tits are amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack traces the full contour of Chloe's breasts with her hands, loving the firmness and the ticklish feeling he gets when stroking them. He lets out a moan, more to hear it than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are being naughty, aren't we, miss sexy neighbor\" Jack taunts in Chloe's voice, spanking her taut ass with her hand. He hooks his thumb into Chloe's shorts, and pulls them down. Watching Chloe undress herself in the mirror makes Jack feel more and more warmth in Chloe's privates - which were about to get a whole lot less private. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulls the shorts off , and the socks for good measure, leaving Chloe standing in only a pink thong. She did seem to like pink. Snapping the thong's elastic against her ass, Jack makes his way over to the tub, making sure to sway Chloe's hips. The anticipation is almost too much at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tub is only half full, but Jack decides that it's enough. He throws off Chloe's thong, and slides her legs into the water. The temperature is perfect, and he feels a ripple of pleasure course through his borrowed body which wasn't in any way sexual. The bath was just that good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot letting that stop him, Jack strokes Chloe's breasts, moving his hands down to her midriff, and touches her pussy. The reaction is instant - a small wave of pleasure, and he wants more. He begins rubbing Chloe's index and middle fingers up and down, massaging the outside. Finding the clit, Jack strokes it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh... that's good,\" Jack moans as the warmth in his crotch rises. He begins stroking Chloe's pussy harder and harder, plunging two fingers deep inside. That elicits a much stronger feeling of pleasure, and Jack continues to have Chloe finger herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck that's amazing,\" he pants, continuing to use Chloe's fingers to plow her pussy. He feels a burst of pleasure pulse through his entire body, and lets out a long, satisfied, moan. With Chloe's voice, it sounds just <i>so sexy{/}. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if...\" he thought, noticing that he hadn't turned on the jets yet. He turns them on full blast, and feels a warm stream of pressurized water against his back. The massaging effect is rather pleasant, but his back wasn't what he wanted to massage with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipping himself over and around, Jack positions Chloe's pussy directly over the  that was behind him. It's very different from when he just used her hands... it's much more full on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit,\" he keeps panting, feeling wave after wave after wave of erotic pleasure course through his body. He arches his back, and lets out a loud whimper of pure satisfaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that was intense...\" Jack moans, sagging down into a half-seated, half-laying position in the tub, feeling completely worn out. The jets were still going on the other side of the tub, but he didn't care. His head was spinning from the experience, and he just wanted to relax a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack continues to lie there, content in Chloe's afterglow after an orgasm that had to be several times more intense than anything he had ever felt in his own body. Eventually, he dozes off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, Jack wakes up and finds that...</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack awakes to a loud, obnoxious buzzing sound. Probably the doorbell<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... \" Jack complained, trying to stand up. He slipped, and crashed back down into the bath. \"Huh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked down at himself, seeing the completely naked body of his neighbor Chloe. Right, he <i>had</i> accidentally possessed her, and then played with her body. He propped his arms up on the side of the bath, and tried to lift himself out. He slowly dragged Chloe's wet, naked form out of the tub, only to be startled again by the buzzing doorbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine\" he muttered in Chloe's voice, quickly dried himself off, puts as much of Chloe's underwear as he could find back on, then slips into a heavy white bathrobe. \"That should do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack walks to the door, and peeks through to see who's there. It's Lilith in his body. He opens the door, lets Lilith in, then locks it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like someone's had some fun\" Lilith taunts, looking his body - Chloe's body, still slightly wet from the bath, wrapped in only a bathrobe - up and down. \"You know, I'd hoped you'd listen to my advice but I didn't think you'd <i>actually</i> do it. So... how was it, Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack went red in the face and stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That good, huh? Didn't realize Chloe had it so good.\" Lilith smiled slyly. \"Now I'm curious...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she walked over to Jack, and yanked the belt of the robe he was wearing. The front of the robe parted, exposing Chloe's breasts and thong. Jack instinctively covered up, and not just because he was uncomfortable having his own body look at him like he was a piece of meat on display. It was also quite cold inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, don't be shy, Master. It's all right.\" Lilith stepped behind Jack, threaded her arm around his waist and into his bathrobe. She caressed his borrowed body, sliding her hand slowly up to his breasts. Jack didn't resist. With one smooth motion, Lilith pulled the bathrobe right off Jack, leaving him exposed in all his glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, she <i>is</i> a pretty one,\" Lilith murmured. Then, louder and directed at Jack, \"Or, should I say, my <i>Mistress</i>, that <i>you're</i> looking rather enticing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked at his own body as Lilith spoke, and noticed that Lilith's pants were bulging slightly. Oh dear... The scariest thing was, he was almost looking forward to it. He blushed in Chloe's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, so enticing. So cute, so <i>sexy</i>\" Lilith continued. Jack began to eye his own body with interest. What was happening? Did he <i>actually</i> want to fuck himself? He looked away, but felt a now familiar warmth in Chloe's crotch. No matter what his mind was thinking, his body was <i>definitely</i> turned on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're looking a bit conflicted, <i>Mistress</i>.\" Lilith laughed. \"Don't worry, this is normal. I mean, you're a woman right now, so it's perfectly fine - healthy even -  for you to be wanting a man's attention\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why...\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the more time you spend in another body, the more you adapt to them. You start to see their memories, feel their desires... \" Lilith hinted. \"Besides, remember I mentioned your sexual aura? With me in control, it's growing all that much stronger. It's... speeding up the process, you could say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was speechless. So this is what women would feel, looking at him? If that was the case, he would have no issues talking his way into <i>anyone's</i> pants. He figured that sometimes, he wouldn't even need to do any talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, <i>Mistress</i>,\" Lilith cooed, embracing Jack from behind, moving one hand to his breasts, with the other making its way past his thong and to his pussy. \"Are you interested in seeing what being a woman <i>truly</i> feels like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack gulped. Lilith pressed her - <i>Jack's</i> - now hard cock against Jack's - <i>Chloe's</i> - ass as she fiddled with Jack's nipples and massaged his clit. He could feel his borrowed body was excited, and the warm feeling in his crotch was urging him to let Lilith do her thing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  While a bit freaked out about his current bodies slowly ramping lust, as well as the fact that his previous body was currently the cause of, and continuing to cause said lust, Jack was also the slightest bit excited by the sensations, especailly after his earlier explorations. Giving in before you psyche yourself out into bailing, Jack leans back into Lilith and presses against 'him'.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Reaching around to 'his' neck, Jack pulls Lilith down a bit, and locks lips with Lilith, while lowly moaning into 'his' mouth. While kissing, Jack fumbles with Lilith's jeans, finally getting them open, and seeing 'his' arousal tenting 'his boxers. Breaking the kiss, and reaching a hand into Lilith's boxers, Jack dexterously start to stroke 'his' shaft, using some of the tricks he knew from your previous 'expertise' in such matters. Lilith's breathing slightly increases, and so does her ministrations upon your body, causing you to let out more moans of pleasure. Pausing in your stroking, Jack looks up at Lilith with cocked eyebrow, simply asking, \"Is there any reason that your taking your time getting naked, or are we not going to do this?\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n Chuckling at your question, and tweaking your nipples while pulling, causing you to grip 'his' shaft and moan lewdly, Lilith lets go and starts to take off 'his' shirt. <br>\r\n  \"I'm sorry mistress, I thought I would let you set the pace, and after your started, simply forgot to continue disrobing for the main event,\" Lilith responds, with a cocky smile plastered on 'his' face, and a gleam in 'his' eyes. Finishing getting the shirt off, Lilith kicks off 'his' shoes, and then takes 'his' boxers off. Looking down, Lilith cocks 'his' own eyebrow, before asking \"Are you going to just hold onto that, or get back to what you were doing?\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  Snapping out of the daze that he seemed to have fallen into while staring at Lilith's naked form, Jack begins again to stroke and pull on Lilith's cock. After getting Lilith to full attention, 'he' stops your actions, and directs Jack towards the couch to sit on it. After doing so, Lilith crouched down in front of Jack, and inspected 'her' closely. <br>\r\n  \"You got me nice and ready, but unless i use a spell, we need to get you ready as well. While i have no problem with doing such magic, I think you should get the full experience, even if it's enhanced by a lust aura,\" Lilith explains, before lowering 'his' head towards your crotch, and taking a slow, agonizing lick along Jack's slit.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n  Moaning loudly, and clutching the couch cushions tightly, Jack feels a cacophony of pleasure race through his body from that single lick. It only gets more intense, as Lilith forgoes the slow, torturous licks, and starts to plunge 'his' tongue into 'her' pussy, while using one hand to massage Jack's clit.  After a few more minutes of this ramping lust and arousal reaching Jacks limit, Lilith plunges 'his' tongue in as deep as 'he' could and at the same time, pinches Jack's clit hard. The stimulation too much, Jack faints briefly, all the while screaming loudly and lewdly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Waking a few moments later, Jack comes to with Lilith standing poised over 'her', lined up and apparently waiting for a conscious Jack before suddenly plunging 'his' cock into the overly wet, and well stimulated pussy in front of 'him'. Momentary panic is overridden by the instant pleasure that floods Jacks body again, even more intense than before his brief blackout. Moaning loudly, and making tiny squeaks of pleasure on every thrust, Jack is overwhelmed by all the sensations, and just lets Lilith do what 'he' wants at the moment. Seeing the state Jack is in, Lilith decides to hook 'her' legs over 'his' shoulders, and regain use of 'his' hands, which promptly find their way towards Jack's breasts and ass. Even more pleasure floods Jack, to the point where he, for all purposes, is just a passenger, a loud, moaning, overstimulated and happy passenger. Lilith goes one step farther, and starts to massage, then pull on Jack's nipples in a rhythm that matches the speed of her thrusts. This proves to be too much for Jack again, and he passes out once more.<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Lilith point of view)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  After seeing my Mistress pass out again, and only after 5 orgasms, I decide to finish up, since it's not as much fun to fuck an unconscious person. Finishing, i pull out, then cast the spell to prevent any possible pregnancies from happening. Waving my hand while casting another spell, both me and Mistress are cleaned up, as well as the part of the house we are currently in. <br>\r\n  With that done, I decide to lay Mistress down on the couch, and then join her to cuddle...as well as caress and play with her. While i could use a spell to speed up Jack's awakening, I've found over the years that while there is a spell for everything, it doesn't mean you need to use them all the time. Not unless it will help with more lust and love being spread that is. Settling down and slowly caressing Mistress' body, I simply wait while wondering what else we can do...</span></div></div>",

He feels a strange numbing feeling across his whole back as Lilith continues to step into him... and then Lilith inserts her head into his, and he blacks out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jack came to, he was staring at the front of his house. When he looked down, he saw that he was still himself but was transparent with a slight blue color. Jack saw his neighbor Chloe jogging by in her pink sports bra and tight shorts.

When Jack tried to open the door, his hand went through the door knob as if it didn't exist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was now worried.

He though about going to school and trying to find someone that might be able to see and help him. He also thought about going to the local church down the street.

Eventually, he made it to school. Luckily, he didn't live too far away - far enough to not want to walk every day, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now...?\" Jack asked himself. The fatigue he had been feeling was building up - he didn't know what it was, but he didn't want to be away from his body for much longer. Then again, who knew where Lilith actually was? Ahead of him was the school - a large set of buildings, grey asphalt walkways, and a couple of reasonably maintained football fields. Where would he go? He thought of a few options. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the library - he could maybe look for something in there to help - although he didn't know if he would be able to find anything or anyone that could help. He could go to class, hoping to find his body. Or he could go to the infirmary.

He cautiously walked forward, into the door, and found himself on the other side of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around - the library was pretty quiet. A few students studying, none of whom took any notice. A couple of librarians, one at his desk, sorting through a pile of books. Another stacking books, her short stature not quite enough to reach the top shelf without effort. Jack wandered past all of this, quietly, without drawing attention to himself. Assuming anyone could actually see or hear him, what would they do? What would he say to them that wouldn't freak them out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the back of the library was a study room, which a lot of students sometimes used between classes. It was also used by various academic clubs at the school. Jack approached, and noticed that it was dark, with a strange purple light glowing inside. Closer to the door, he saw a group of students and one teacher, most from his year or the year below, sitting around a table holding a curious-looking electric lamp. That was the source of the glow. They had a bunch of random stuff boxed up - tarot cards, an ouija board... they looked to be the supernatural and occult club, for sure.

So, he casually walked through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, check it out!\" one of the boys inside, someone Jack didn't recognize, said. Was he looking at him? How could the guy even see him? Jack turned around and saw that on the wall was a dark patch, shimmering, vaguely shaped like him. So the light wasn't just some toy - it could see him. That was a start. Jack started speaking, but no one reacted. So, he waved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something's here!\" someone else called out. At this point, everyone had turned around and was watching Jack's shadow with interest. The teacher, a tall, brunette woman Jack recognized as Ms. Wallis - one of the admins - stood up and began to attempt to communicate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.. hello?\" Ms. Wallis said. \"Can you wave if you can hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack waved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Can you try to speak? Again, you can wave after a few seconds if we don't respond.\" Jack tried to speak, forming words that apparently only he could hear. Frustrated, he waved again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you can't talk to us, but we can talk to you. Well, we should still manage. Just... wave for yes, and stand still for no, I guess.\" Jack waved in confirmation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a girl stood up. She was... from the year below Jack, maybe? Small - barely over 5' tall, with dyed short-ish black hair tipped with purple, wearing black jeans and a faded Metallica t-shirt over her tiny frame, she cautiously approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... hi. I'm Cassandra...\" Cassandra said, half-blushing, half stuttering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cass, what are you doing?\" Ms. Wallis asked. \"I know what you're thinking - you sure this is a good idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... it's ok.\" Cassandra said. Then, she took another step forward. Full-on blushing, she continued. \"Anyway, umm... if you wanted to talk with us... you can.. umm... borrow my body...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was stunned. What? Did she expect him to possess her, or something? He didn't even know if he could... then again, it wouldn't surprise him. The next question was, did he want to? Even if he was just 'borrowing', and with permission - it would be weird, being someone else. Especially a girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvidently Jack's indecision was caught by Ms. Wallis, who then reassured Cassandra and Jack that it would be fine either way. \"I understand if you're lost and don't want to do this. But if Cassandra is insisting - then it is entirely up to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack decided.</span></div></div>",

Jack waved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... so that's a yes?\" Cassandra said, still blushing and stuttering. Jack waved again. Cassandra walked even closer, standing directly in front of him. Then, she turned around and faced her friends. \"Um... ok... please be nice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stood behind her, a good foot taller than her even in his ghostly form. He couldn't believe that he was about to do this - to try to possess Cassandra. <i>Well, here goes nothing...</i> Jack thought, stepping forward to overlap his ghostly form over Cassandra's tiny frame. He felt a sharp tingling sensation in his legs and torso as he stepped right into her, then a sharp snap as his head was yanked hard toward the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe inhaled. So many sensations - things he usually took for granted, but was especially thankful for now. The feeling of the air conditioning caressing his face and ever so slightly ruffling his hair. The smell and taste of the air around him. The feeling of becoming suddenly aware of his tongue in his mouth, as he moved it around again. The minor itch as the tag at the back of the t-shirt he was wearing scratched at his neck, the tug of the jeans around his waist. All sensations he had felt before - had gotten used to. Now that he had been without them for even a short time, they were like heaven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were, of course, a bunch of sensations he <i>wasn't</i> used to. Under his t-shirt, something tight wrapped around his chest. His jeans were tighter than usual, hugging his legs. He also felt a peculiar... something he couldn't quite put into words, right around his crotch. However, those were all problems for another time. He looked up, seeing everyone in front of him eyeing him with interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... hi?\" Jack said, noticing his voice was very different from what it usually was. Very high pitched, very feminine... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi. So now that we meet... in the flesh, I guess,\" Ms. Wallis started, \"I'm Ms. Wallis. You're inside the body of a student and friend of mine, Cassandra Jackson. And you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this will sound weird.\" Jack started, still not used to hearing Cassandra's delicate voice from his mouth. It was technically Cassandra's mouth, her body... but Jack still felt weird hearing himself speak in a voice that wasn't his own. \"My name is Jack Thompson, and I'm actually a student at this school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack? From senior year?\" Ms. Wallis asked. \"That is weird. How did you... how did you end up a ghost? I've never heard of anything like that happening before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will sound even more weird.\" Jack started. He then explained how last night he had found the book, how he had accidentally released Lilith, how she had tricked him and evicted him from his own body, then disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... some story.\" Ms. Wallis said. \"Unfortunately, I don't really know much about that kind of stuff. That's more... uh... Cassandra's interest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra... as in the girl who had let him borrow her body? Shame he couldn't read her memories... if that was even a thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now? I mean I can try to leave her, but I have no idea how. \" Jack offered. It must be weird for everyone, seeing and hearing Cassandra talk about herself in third person. She wasn't the one in control, but that isn't something you really just accepted normally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or we could try to help you track down your own body. Maybe confront this Lilith, if she's still there. \" Ms. Wallis offered. \"Although if she's half as powerful as you suggest, that might not work quite as simply as we hope. Up to you.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Yeah, confronting Lilith now is probably a bad idea\", Jack replied. \"Thing is, I don't actually know how to get out of Cassandra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked across the room at everyone - a group of maybe ten or so people, Ms Wallis and Cassandra included, with slightly more boys than girls. He looked down at the arms of the body he was currently inhabiting - Cassandra's very slim, light arms, which he was not used to at all. He had to at least try to get out of her, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here goes...\" Jack said, before closing his eyes and focusing on becoming a ghost again. He focused on the idea as hard as he could, yet nothing seemed to happen. \"Nope. Not working. Can anyone help? I don't want to be stuck as Cassandra...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe try the light? It seems to do something with ghosts...\" suggested Ms Wallis, while one of the boys shot Jack a dirty look. Was he weirded out by hearing 'Cassandra' speak about herself in third person? Or something more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring the suggestion was as good as any, Jack stared at the light and focused again. This time, he began to feel a little weightless, and noticed he was rising. Soon, he stood again behind Cassandra, a foot taller, mostly transparent. Cassandra stood still for a couple of seconds, then shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cass?\" Ms Wallis gently asked. Cassandra nodded. \"You remember anything? What was it like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... \" Cassandra replied. \"It was like I was dreaming. Kind of fuzzy, not really too bad, but I don't remember anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Wallis proceeded to explain everything that Jack had told her, Cassandra blushing slightly when she found out that it had been a male student who had inhabited her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... well I have heard a little about something like this before. Like... there are seven of these books. I don't know much about the demons locked in them, but I'm pretty sure I can help Jack.\" Cassandra said. Jack waved in happiness. \"I'd need to know a little bit more though... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack tried to say something, but again, no one could hear him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately I don't think using my body again will work since I don't remember anything.\" Cassandra said, blushing. \"Can someone else... lend Jack their body? It won't be for very long...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the boys spoke up. \"Uhh... no. Why are we even helping this kid? We don't know him!\" Jack recognized him as the one who had given him the nasty look earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figured you'd say no, Shane.\" Cassandra retorted with a scowl. \"First chance to do something cool and you back out. Like always.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShane went red. \"That's.. that's not what I meant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This club is about supernatural stuff!\" Cassandra said, louder. \"What's more supernatural than a ghost! Right here! And a demon! Come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOthers began to murmur among themselves, but still no one volunteered their body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know he probably could just go and jump into any one of you if he wanted...\" Cassandra said, devious smile on her face. Jack stood still. \"But it looks like he doesn't want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack waved in what he hoped was a gesture of peace. Yes, he probably could go and possess any one of them - but it would not do to waste his good fortune in a group of people where at least someone wanted to help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, and to Jack's great surprise, Ms Wallis stepped forward. \"Fine. I guess if no one else wants to...\" she said. \"Besides. This shouldn't be too bad. Just.. don't do anything stupid. Any of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked up to stand right next to Cassandra. She was a little shorter than Jack, so about a foot taller than Cassandra. She was also had a much more well defined figure, and was wearing a long but comfortable looking pale brown dress that went up to her knees. \"Jack, whenever you're ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stepped forward into Ms Wallis, and felt the same shock he had felt when possessing Cassandra. Moments later, he felt the air conditioning on his face, clothes on his skin, weight on his chest, and a nice breeze caressing his now half-bare legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... I'm back.\" Jack said simply, in Ms Wallis's more mature voice. It sounded... different. Definitely more mature than Cassandra, and notably more feminine than his usual. He sat back down in Ms Wallis's chair, crossing his legs, not super comfortable with the dress he was now wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... so...\" Cassandra began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did she want to know?</span></div></div>",

He then went to the door and opened it, and Jack followed him outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where are you going to look?\" Shane asked. He clearly did not want to be there, and was less than happy about Jack's current body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking English class. That's where I'd be right now.\" Jack replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok can you please at least talk about your... normal body in third person? It weirds me out to hear Cass speaking about herself in third person and about some random guy as if she's him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack thought for a second. He hadn't even thought about that. \"I'll try. Ok... <i>Jack</i> would be in English class right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked over through the mostly empty school - it was the middle of class, so the only students and teachers around were those on break. Luckily for Jack, Cassandra and the other members of the SOC were on break - clubs were one of the \"recommended\" ways for students to spend their free periods. They wandered through the school until they reached Jack's building, then walked up the stairs and past the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack peeked inside through the door.</span></div></div>",

Then it looked up - and smiled at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He saw me!\" Jack whispered, and ducked away from the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now, then?\" Shane asked. \"Can we go, so we can have Cassandra back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I guess.\" Jack said... then the door opened and he saw his body step into the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi...\" Jack's body said, and grinned. \"Looks like you're having fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... \" Jack said, not sure what to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh relax, I'm just enjoying highschool life for a little bit. \" Jack's body - now obviously still piloted by Lilith - said. \"You should enjoy it too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hold on...\" Shane said, getting visibly angry. \"So it's true? You stole Jack's body... and now he's inside Cassandra?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Borrowed, more like. But pretty much.\" Shane began to ball his fists. \"Calm down kid.

About what it could do for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack gulped again, and Lilith smiled. Jack felt his face go slightly red, and started fidgeting. \"What... what are you doing?\" he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing much. Just flexing my muscles, as it were.\" Lilith replied, smiling again. Jack began to feel increasingly uncomfortable, going even more red and feeling a cold sweat form over his body. There was also a curious... sensation in his nethers. Just thinking about it made him go even more red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should go... it looks like you're about to explode.\" Lilith laughed, then turned to head back into the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stood, feeling uncomfortably aroused in a foreign, tiny, very <i>female</i> body, blushing hard.

Either way, Jack was running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the door, having to double-take and nearly going into the men's bathroom out of habit - but then, he currently was definitely not a man. He stepped into the ladies room, found an empty cubicle, and closed it behind him. He sat on the toilet, thinking. What had just happened? Why was he feeling so... horny? It was very strange. Not even the fact that he was a girl - although that in itself was weird. The fact that Lilith had so easily put him in this state. And that he was now experiencing it, firsthand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack breathed, feeling their air enter Cassandra's lungs. He needed to calm down. He had found Lilith, and she hadn't seemed to wish him any particular harm. If he could go back to the club room, maybe jump out of Cassandra's body, he could go find Lilith again and get his own body back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensations his body was feeling had not faded. Jack was still sweating slightly, a sticky feeling under his shirt. He felt a moistness in his crotch, an itch that was demanding to be scratched. But this wasn't his body - and Cassandra seemed nice - she had been willing to lend him her body so he could get his own back. He wasn't about to just violate her trust - and her body - just because he felt like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, what would she have done if she was the one who had run into Lilith?</span></div></div>",

He was already alone - and since he was currently in Cassandra's body, what harm would it do if he were to enjoy himself? Especially considering her body needed it right now. Sure, he would feel guilty afterwards, but it would be better than her getting her body back in an aroused state. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack slipped off Cassandra's oversized shirt, dropping it on the floor. He looked down at her tiny frame - she was very thin and pale, with a perfect innie bellybutton and smallish breasts held tight in a bra. His slim hands made their way to the breasts, fondling them through the bra. It felt good, a little ticklish. Jack unclipped the bra, dropping it on the shirt. Cassandra's small breasts hung free, small and perky. If Jack were to guess, they looked to be only a little bigger than an A. It didn't stop him from tweaking his nipples, though. Now that was a pleasant sensation. Very sensitive, and Jack only got more and more aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out an erotic, quiet moan from Cassandra's lips, Jack moved his hands along her slim body, caressing gently. He undid the top button of her jeans, and rubbed the outside of the jeans. His nethers were getting increasingly moist. This was also, Jack thought, his first time touching a pussy - or even just between a girl's legs. How weird was it that it was <i>himself </i>he was touching like that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhaling sharply again as he felt a small jolt of pleasure, Jack continued rubbing his jeans. Enough, thought Jack, and slipped a hand inside. It was very warm, sticky and slick. He gently massaged Cassandra's clit, feeling a growing burst of pleasure emanating from there. He stifled a moan - couldn't do that at school - and started rubbing one of Cassandra's slim fingers along her slit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aahhh\" he moaned as quietly as he could, the feeling growing too much to handle. It was pure pleasure, much better than anything he had ever felt as a guy. The pleasure kept building as he plunged his hand deep into Cassandra's jeans, getting as many fingers as he could deep into her waiting snatch. He moved his hands back and forth, back and forth, relishing in the orgasm he felt from Cassandra's slim, tight form. She had such a nice body... Jack thought. It felt <i>so good</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe withdrew his hand from his pants, covered in Cassandra's fluids, and breathed heavily. Her topless, slim body glistened with sweat, and Jack took his other hand - the one not covered in the result of his playing - and stroked his breasts gently. It was a pleasant ticklish feeling, even after having masturbated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack wiped himself off, flushed the evidence, and slipped Cassandra's bra back on. He then buttoned up her jeans, and put her shirt on. He left the cubicle, slightly blushing, washed his hands, and stepped out of the bathroom. </span></div></div>",

After taking a step back, and realizing who you ran into, and what they've asked, Jack fights the urge to scream, and somehow forces it to only come out as a squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh Master - or is it Mistress in this situation? - there is no reason to be frightened by me. I'm merely here to check on your well being,\" 'Jack' states, 'his' grin increasing the more he speaks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Looking around to see if anyone is around that could possibly help, Jack notices the hallway empty, except for Shane, who appears to be near the end of the hall, blankly staring at the wall. Taking a deep breath to gather what little control he felt he currently had, Jack focuses back on 'Jack', and decides to put on a brave front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Look Lilith, just give me my body back, and I'll let the nearly letting me die slide.\" Jack states with as much bravado and conviction he could muster, while trying not to freak out for threatening the very creature that got him into this predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Is that so Mistress, and what will you do if I don't comply?\" 'Jack' remarks, raising an eyebrow in question and crossing his arms over his chest. Racking his brains, Jack thinks back over all that Lilith had told him, and what he could recall about myths on magic. Struck by an epiphany, Jack's false bravado turns into a genuine shit-eating grin, causing 'Jack's' eyebrow to rise higher, and be joined by its twin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Because Lilith, <i><b>I order you, Succubus to put my soul back in my original body this instant, and then explain why you set this whole situation in motion</b></i>!\" Jack shouts out in Triumph, with his voice (while high pitched) seems laced with an otherworldly command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A smile blossoms on 'Jack's' face, before raising one of 'his' arms in between the both 'him and Jack, and snapping 'his' fingers twice.The world lurches as if Jack had been accelerated rapidly, then someone hit the breaks and it stopped on a dime. Falling over onto his ass, Jack realizes that he's back to his body now, and looks around to see if anything else has happened. Cassandra seems to be on the ground also, and Shane is still down the hall staring at a wall it seems, but the biggest surprise is Lilith, who is standing nearby with a pleased smile on her face, which baffles Jack greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Well done Master, you passed the first test that many warlocks have failed. As per your orders, I will now explain what prompted this situation,\"Lilith states, while continuing to stare at Jack with a bemused smile replacing the pleased one from earlier. \"The trials of being a warlock are many, and the benefits even more, but sadly the reason their are not many warlocks, is because too many in the past few centuries have failed to grasp that while sex is fun and stimulating, one shouldn't delve into the paths of Lust and Love, without being ready to pay the price.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Seeing a confused look on your face, Lilith sighs, then decides to wave her hands in a circle in front of her a few times, causing a sigil to form in air. Suddenly the air seems charged with some energy, and Jack wonders what Lilith has just done. \"This could take longer to explain, so i altered a spell that you could use later on to extend ones pleasure during sex by slowing the experience of time. This would normally just alter a person's perception of time so they could enjoy it all more, but with this alteration, instead of stimuli power the spell, I'm channeling it using some of my excess stored energy to meet the demands that you have laid out in your order. While we could stand around all day with me explaining this, I deduced you would rather not miss school any more than you currently have, nor take too much time with long explanations and little answers to show for it,\" Lilith explains, conjuring a chair for herself to sit down in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The Book originally did not have tests, but after many warlocks burned through their life, and destroyed many cities in quick succession over a short time period, Master level warlocks tracked down the book, and included the tests as a sort of 'safeguard' to stop the rampant destruction that was happening. Before the tests had come about, the foolishness of previous 'masters' had caused a group to form to hunt down all magic users around the counties of Europe. That group later went on to be known as the Spanish Inquisition, so you can thank your predecessors for your little test you went through today. On that note, congratulations for being the first to pass it in 50 years without getting anyone else killed, and within 24 hours of it beginning.\" Lilith continues, looking pleased again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Listening to all this, Jack is happy that he passed the unknown test, but now has to wonder if there are any more tests, and how difficult they could be. While he did stumble into this world, and has enjoyed some of the things Lilith has told him is possible, he doesn't want to get anyone else injured or killed like it sounds others have done before with this Book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, there will be more tests Master, and no, I cannot tell you how many, or what will spark their activation. I will say that this was the one that usually got everyone, because either they forgot that I am bound to the book, or they made a mistake, and did not use their wits to work through the situation. A simple test, but one that can be very effective, especially since Lust can be very pleasant, but oh so distracting, no?\" Lilith speaks up, answering the questions Jack had just thought up, and causing him to wonder if she can read his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0'Yes Jack, and speak to you mentally as well. Bound to the book both of us are, and while that is in effect, their are benefits and downsides. Some i can explain, but some you, the warlock, must discover on your own,' Lilith mentally states while looking you in the eye with an amused smile gracing her lips. Seeing the comprehension form on his face, Lilith stands up, dismissing the chair she had conjured before, and moves over to stand in front of Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Do you have any other questions or concerns left, or should we continue on with the school day? If you wish, there are spells to get you out of school for the time being, or you could take the rest of the day to think over your situation. You cannot back out right now, as the book may or may not have more hidden surprises, but do know that i will endeavor to help you, both have fun and survive, and loosen up hopefully,\" Lilith asks, the last bit being said under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking it all in, Jack decides to first have Lilith fix Shane, who Jack had honestly almost forgotten about, then chose to</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rounding up Shane and Cassandra - of whom Cassandra looked much happier to see him - and started walking back. Shane was quiet and simmering with rage, while Cassandra was ... blushing? They walked mostly in silence, only to be greeted by a rather enthusiastic Ms. Wallis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack?\" She asked, upon seeing Jack enter with the other two in tow. Jack nodded. \"So I guess it went well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack began to explain, in very sparse detail, what had happened. How he had run into Lilith in the hall, run away, then confronted her. He left out the parts about what Lilith had done to him in Cassandra's body, and what had followed. He did mention that Lilith didn't seem to be malicious, but was just playing around and testing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later, a soft bell rang in the room, signaling the end of the free period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, today was more interesting than usual. Jack, did you want to join us next time?\" Ms Wallis asked. That sounded interesting, so Jack agreed. A few people said some encouraging words, while Shane kept giving Jack the stink-eye. Everyone picked up their bags and began to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack walked out, Cassandra ran up next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what else you did\" she said in a sly voice. A chill crept down Jack's spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" He asked warily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you ran into Lilith, probably in the bathroom.\" She said simply. \"Remember it is <i>my</i> body you were in.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack paused. \"That was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter what it was, why or whatever. If anyone finds out, I'm sure it'll suck for you.\" Jack didn't think someone as small and shy as Cassandra could suddenly be so... assertive. \"Not that I really mind, I knew what I was getting into. I've read a lot about possessions and such, you see. Lust plays a big part in quite a few. Vengeance as well, but you didn't seem like that type of ghost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what... \" Jack started, before he was cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it isn't much, I just want to meet Lilith and maybe have some fun as a ghost myself\" Cassandra said, showing more of the shy side he had seen earlier. Jack breathed a sigh of relief. \"Easy, huh? I promise I won't tell.\" Then, she winked. \"Maybe I'll let you go again if you share\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack felt himself starting to get a bit aroused. She was really into this possession thing. Maybe it wouldn't be a bad thing to have someone else know about Lilith in more detail?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if reading his mind, Lilith popped into existence next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blackmail, huh?\" She mused. Jack knew no one else could see or hear her, but that didn't apply to him. He tried to project his thoughts. \"I hear you, Jack. Don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now this one... she doesn't have any magic innately, but I do sense a lot of knowledge. And desire. If you wish it, Master, we could recruit her. And no, it won't do anything to her in the long term. No bonds, thralls, contracts or anything. If you don't, we can deal with her in other ways... I could possess her, wipe her memory or just enthrall her. No? That doesn't sound appealing? Master, I can sense your fear. And your interest. Don't be shy, you should let her in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack?\" Cassandra's voice pulled him out of his 'conversation'. \"She's here, isn't she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilith. Jack, you're a bad liar and you've been zoned out for a good minute.\" Cassandra stated simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh. Jack had to make up his mind, then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

'Besides, if this doesn't work out, we can always do option B like Lilith suggested,' Jack thinks to himself, and sees Lilith smirk as that thought apparently was picked up by her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Fine, but don't blame me if you end up in her shenanigans as well,\" Jack says aloud, walking towards his next class slowly, debating on when to introduce the two officially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[You could do that now master. A simple spell will make everyone think you two are in class, and another will make whatever location your in repel unwanted interruptions] Lilith responds mentally, and Jack is proud that he didn't jump or scream at the sudden voice that sounded in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Where would you suggest we head towards then, since you must have something in mind if you're offering to help us skip classes....or your just horny and bored right now,' Jack thinks, knowing at this point Lilith will pick up on his thoughts. Lilith darts in front of him, and continues to float along backwards in front of Jack, holding a pouting face as if what he said upset her. Not breaking his pace, Jack continues on, and holds in the chuckle that threatens to escape from Lilith's current facial expression and antics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[We could always go to the pool at this time. While being you, I did happen to pick up the nuances of your schedule, as well as the memories of the school's 'usual habits'] Lilith finally responds, while sticking her tongue out at Jack. Seeing no reaction aside from slight shaking of shoulders (and guessing that he's holding in even more laughter), Lilith decides to go back to teasing Jack by slowly licking her lips sensually, and beginning to caress her body slowly, still floating in front of Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Trying to ignore the teasing, Jack considers Lilith's suggestion, when his attention is drawn back to his until now, silent companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ok, I haven't gotten a clear yes or a no, and I'm guessing that Lilith has done or said something, because it looked like you were laughing a few minutes ago, so whats the verdict,\" Cassandra asks, finally getting tired of the awkward silence she felt permeating the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, sorry, and yes, Lilith was trying to get a reaction out of me, and was annoyed somewhat when I didn't rise to the bait, so switched tactics and got me laughing. I didn't want to look crazy laughing aloud, and possibly freaking you out, so tried to keep silent. As to the 'verdict' as you put it, both Lilith and I are willing to give you a chance, we were merely discussing where to start from,\" Jack responds, changing direction towards the pool, as Lilith's suggestion sounds intriguing. Seeing this, Lilith gets a beaming grin on her face, and pumps a fist in the air signifying victory, all the while not stopping the teasing show still floating in front of Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Awesome, for a moment i was afraid that you were going to reject my request,\" Cassandra says, her shy nature hindering the relief that she tried to hide with a nonchalant tone. Chuckling at that, Jack merely opens the door to the pool, and holds it open, beckoning in Cassandra, while sending a mental prompt for Lilith to 'work her magic'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lilith stops her teasing dance, but not before dipping a finger into her pants, and coming out soaked. Bringing the hand up to her face, Lilith looks at it for a moment, before winking at Jack, then blowing a kiss towards him over her juice covered hand. A light pink wind seems to form in the air, and circle around Jack first, then Cassandra who shivers as if suddenly chilled, before flying out the door through the cracks. Smirking at the bemused look on Jack's face, and the confused look on Cassandra's, Lilith finishes up her casting, but walking over to the door, dipping her hand in her pants yet again, and pulling out a drenched hand this time. Surprised, and wondering how it was possible, Jack observes Lilith drawing several symbols on both doors that lead into the pool, as well as the doors that lead into the locker/changing rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Upon finishing, Lilith disappears, the reappears behind Cassandra, embracing her from behind, and molding her figure to her body, causing Cassandra to squeak and try to jump, but seemingly unable to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I heard you wished to meet me, little black mailer,\" Lilith whispers loudly next to Cassandra's ear, and then licks it, causing Cassandra to squeak again, but turns into a low moan after Lilith continues to lick and nibble on said ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Shuddering, and trying to fight off the feeling of Lust that she's currently feeling, Cassandra (tries) to steel her voice, \"Yes, I wished to ....\" and stops, shuddering again as Lilith reaches a hand around, and gropes one of Cassandra's breasts firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, I know what you wished for, but what is in it for me? Or Jack for that matter? He's being generous enough to not use his powers to mind wipe or have his way with you, and what you ask for would be difficult without either of us helping, let alone maintaining it if we were 'under duress by threats or coercion',\" Lilith interrupts, sounding coy at the beginning, but ending in a taunting tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pleasure convulses through Cassandra's body, but not enough to distract her from what Lilith has said. Thinking on her feet, Cassandra says, \" ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

Cassandra began to moan as her face blushed harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stared with fascination, feeling a tent growing in his own pants, while Lilith's hand expertly tended to Cassandra's. Every minute motion of Lilith's hand was met with a breath, a moan or a squirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ngh... aaaaaah... but I.... can... tell...\" moaned Cassandra, forming words with difficulty through the involuntary motions she was wracked with. Lilith adjusted her hands, causing Cassandra to slip down and nestle her head between Lilith's tits. \"Aaaahhhhh\" a louder moan escaped Cassandra's lips as Lilith's hand continued its work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear, your words don't hold any weight...\" Lilith cooed. \"And your threats are meaningless and empty.\" It was almost like Lilith was just teasing her, Jack thought. Cassandra continued to breathe heavily as Lilith fingered her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack continued to stare as Lilith slowly and gently sat herself down in a comfortable pose. Jack's stare turned to curiosity as he watched Lilith slowly shrink, hair darkening and clothes adjusting as she did. The tent in Jack's pants did not let up and after peeking down to see how obvious it was, he was greeted by a strange sight. Sitting on the floor, with the moaning and red-faced Cassandra in her lap, was a perfect clone of Cassandra!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, little one?\" Lilith teased in Cassandra's very own voice, continuing her toying in the real Cassandra's pants. \"What power do you have when I can just become you?\" She followed up with a kiss on the cheek, before withdrawing her hand from Cassandra's jeans. The real Cassandra turned around and stared wide-eyed into the eyes of her copy, who shushed her with a slim finger. \"Quiet now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack watched, Cassandra's face very quickly went from blushing to pale. Jack soon saw why - the bottom half of Lilith's torso was smoothly attached to Cassandra's own, and her legs were nowhere in sight. Soon, Lilith slipped an identical arm into Cassandra's, twisting herself so that while the real Cassandra was on her knees, Lilith was directly behind her. The other arm followed, then her chest, then her head... until there was only one Cassandra left. The real one, but presumably possessed by Lilith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Cassandra' stood up and dusted herself off. She stood with a confidence she had never had before. \"Well, that was fun!\" She chirped in a very Lilith-like tone. \"I can still feel the heat from my work earlier, her body is so sensitive!\" Definitely Lilith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilith?\" Jack asked, tent in his pants raging uncontrollably. He watched Cassandra smirk and nod. \"So what happens to Cassandra?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Master... I decided to teach her a lesson. She won't be hurt at all, except maybe her pride. What we could do with her, though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But is she awake?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can let her be...\" Lilith smirked again. \"Alright. Now she can see, hear and feel everything, but is for all intents a prisoner in her body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we let her have some fun, at least? Let her try being a ghost?\" Lilith grinned at the suggestion, then...</span></div></div>",

Jack could still see her - that must be Lilith's influence. The proceedings had not impacted his arousal at the whole situation, and he still felt the tent in his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was something that apparently did not escape Cassandra's notice either, for she zoomed up to Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if you can hear me, Jack, but I feel like you owe me one!\" With that, Cassandra plunged herself into Jack's body, causing him to recoil.

You've been displaced instead of just being overwritten temporarily.

But she might not know that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked on incredulously as his own body felt itself up, a hand down his trousers evidently playing with himself while the other roamed aimlessly. He flew around to see a stupid grin plastered on 'his' face. Jack didn't really care. He wasn't feeling particularly weak right now, plus he could just ask Lilith for help since she was right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilith?\" 'Jack' asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;I'll play along for now if you don't mind, Master&gt; Lilith projected.

She sauntered up to 'Jack', leaning provocatively - as much as she could in Cassandra's tiny frame. For Lilith, it was still a lot, Jack thought as he watched with interest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, transform back into your usual form\" commanded 'Jack', Cassandra clearly being unnerved by the sight of her own body teasing her. Jack could see that his body was still very much aroused. Lilith complied, growing a few inches in height and ballooning out all her feminine curves until she was back to her old busty and perfectly proportioned self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is master happy now?\" She said as she stepped even closer to 'Jack', leaning forward to display cleavage while speaking in a tone that dripped sex.

That's great.\" Jack's body stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like you could use a hand... or more...\" Lilith teased. 'Jack''s mouth dropped open as Lilith confidently slipped a hand down his pants and began servicing his tool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked on with interest as Lilith leaned in closer to 'his' body, until her lips were almost touching his. All the while, she continued her efforts in 'Jack's' pants. 'Jack' let out a gasp and what sounded like a moan, and closed 'his' eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Lilith struck. She exhaled what looked like a fine red mist, which quickly disappeared into 'Jack's' mouth. Jack watched as his eyes opened with a slight red tinge, then glazed over. Lilith withdrew, leaving 'Jack' standing still, as if enthralled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go. That'll be a lesson or three.\" Lilith remarked, pleased with her efforts. She licked her hand while looking Jack dead in the eyes, then beckoned. \"Master, what shall we do now?\" Lilith motioned to Cassandra's body on the floor as one option, which gave Jack something to think about. </span></div></div>",

He felt... disconnected from everything. Looking around, he observed two humans. Excellent. He could feed his lust using the two of them. A hand stroked his hip, savoring the feeling of his flesh. Though he could mould it as he pleased, there was something... sexual about being in what could mostly pass for human form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to the girl, who appeared to be amused, he flashed his eyes in an attempt to enthrall her.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A memory stirred... a memory of a book. The book in which Lilith had been sealed. A succubus...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked down at himself, seeing the form of the succubus the book had contained. The thrall and his attentions were of little concern. The girl here had power enough to resist his magic. That meant she was dangerous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoving the thrall aside, Jack bolted for the door. The girl stifled a small laugh as Jack ran right through the door and into the hall. It was empty - for now. He turned a corner, only to nearly run into an older female. This one did not resist, and was instantly enthralled. Jack skimmed her thoughts - five minutes until classes ended. Perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeking to make distance between the one who he could not enthrall and himself in those five minutes, Jack flew through the building, up and down flights of stairs, into another hallway. The doors would be opening soon, and many students would be spilling forth. The teacher he had enthralled minutes ago slowly followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang, signifying the opening of the doors. How to do this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stood at the end of the hall, as many humans of both genders exited their classrooms. After they had all exited, Jack slowly strolled through, arms wide. Anyone he touched became instantly entranced. After walking the length of the hall, he turned around. Jack was met with the sight of close to a hundred, all in his thrall. Now, he needed power. He could feed off the lust of his thralls, but this was not the place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, Jack and his army entered the gymnasium. A large open room was perfect for this. Jack let out a wave of pure lust, and grinned as it began to take effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround him, all the students were grabbing each other, fondling, and kissing. No hands were idle, and there were no cares for gender pairing. Jack sauntered past two males, digging into each other's pants. Another male, head burrowed inside the skirt of a female. Two females, lips locked and hands roaming each other's bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Jack found what he wanted - someone for him personally. A touch on the shoulder was all that was needed for the girl to turn around, neglecting her previous partner. Her previous partner - a taller girl with short hair - immediately latched onto the pair next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack passionately kissed the girl he had chosen, who returned the kiss and began to grope his breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lust emanating from each of the people in the room poured into Jack, and as the girl's hands moved to Jack's nethers, he felt himself fading. An intense orgasm rocked him as the girl continued her work, causing him to shake. The last thing he remembered before his world went white was forcing himself inside the body of the girl...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you had some fun\" a short girl said, standing over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...\" Jack mumbled. It occurred to him that he was on the ground, surrounded by other students. Now entirely lucid, he recognized the girl standing over him. Cassandra. Or more accurately, Lilith inside Cassandra's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Jack asked, noticing that his voice wasn't his own. Or Lilith's, for that matter. He remembered...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't remember?\" Lilith asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... not really\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's to be expected. You must have panicked and let your instincts take over. Honestly, I'm kind of impressed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack forced himself to sit up, feeling a jiggle on his chest. He looked down to see a creamy pair of breasts, hanging completely free. He was completely naked - and in the body of a girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who did I...\" Jack wondered. His voice sounded familiar...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, see for yourself!\" Lilith sniggered. She conjured a foggy mirror for only a second, but it was enough to see whose body Jack was occupying. His crush, Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround him, he heard the sounds of other students stirring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

Cassandra seemingly lost her train of thought under Lilith's attention, letting out a louder moan as Lilith's hands worked their magic. She sunk down into Lilith's frame, helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stared with wonder and arousal as Lilith continued her work. She had Cassandra at her mercy, and seemed to be enjoying it. Cassandra also seemed to not mind, her eyes closed and her cheeks flushed, letting out one quiet moan after another. Eventually, Lilith stopped, and Cassandra slumped down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or two she opened her eyes, slightly dazed, with a trace of a smile on her face. \"Ughh... what was I saying? Oh yeah...\" a satisfied moan escaped her lips. \"I've always been fascinated by possession and ghosts and stuff... when Jack came to the club I really wanted to join him...\" she said, picking up confidence. Then she retreated, blushing a bit more. \"So I let him possess me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith nodded in approval. \"Know what? You pass. So Jack gets the final word.\" Lilith looked at Jack, who nodded. \"Welcome to the fold...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra squealed with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... well, uh...\" Cassandra stuttered. \"Can I be a ghost? I want to try possessing someone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right to the fun stuff, huh? What's going to happen to your body then, huh?\" Lilith countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While Jack was off ghosting around in your body, I was taking care of his. But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you be able to look after mine, then?\" Cassandra exclaimed, giddy with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're willingly letting me in?\" Lilith asked with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... yeah? I'm not gonna be in it, and I hope you'll let me back when I'm done...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sure. Master?\" Lilith turned to Jack. \"Any thoughts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Jack thought, Lilith quickly stepped in line behind Cassandra. She was a bit taller, so it was strange watching her sink into her petite body. Cassandra let out another moan as Lilith's torso connected with hers. As Lilith pushed her head into Cassandra's, Jack saw a ghostly version of Cassandra emerge from her body. She turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so cool!\" Ghost-Cassandra exclaimed. She waved at Jack, who returned the wave. \"It's so great that you can see me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Lilith-Cassandra walked around Ghost-Cassandra, surveying her ethereal form. \"Not bad for a first time...\" she said with a confidence that Cassandra had never had before. She turned around to face Jack, her body language much more pronounced and inviting than the shy girl's norm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, you make me look <i>hot</i>!\" Cassandra said. \"But I would appreciate it if you toned it down a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith smirked, which looked weird coming from Cassandra's body. \"No promises. But, my spell should still hold, so you don't have to worry. Master, er, Jack - what about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? You mean, what am I gonna do? You can't exactly shepherd two bodies at once... can you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Master, I can't <i>inhabit</i> two at once, but I can put one to sleep...\" she said, twirling a finger, leaving a small trail of sparks behind it. \"Or I could just tag along and we could have fun all together...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what was it gonna be?</span></div></div>",

Shaking his head at how ridiculous his thoughts had turned, Jack smiles, then looks towards Lilith, who's begun amusing herself by idly causing random colored sparks to bounce between her fingers. Watching momentarily, and nearly getting lost in the distracting colors and action, Jack refocuses on his determined choice, and speaks up, getting Lilith's attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I think I'll follow Cassandra and try to keep her out of to much trouble for the moment, as we don't want her stuck and possibly fading like I almost did,\" Jack states, getting a smirk from Lilith, who merely winks in response to his statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"As you wish Master, and just remember, it was part of the test, which you passed. I think I can amuse myself for the time being if you wish to explore with your new friend. Just try to remember to call me if you get into something truly fun,\" Lilith responds, turning to look at the floating Cassandra, who's been apparently trying aerobatic stunts and ignoring the ongoing conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Chuckling at that, and amazed at how much his life had changed that he seriously considered Lilith's 'request' for inclusion, Jack signals for Lilith to help him 'go ghost'. Seeing a grin appear on his face, Jack is surprised when 'Cassandra' launches across the distance between them, and collides bodily into Jack, somehow not bowling him over. Stunned, Jack opens his mouth in shock, as 'Cassandra' molds her body to his, and upon his mouth opening, latches her mouth to his, in a soul-searing kiss, one with enough passion to curl his toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the kiss goes on, Jack hears an indignant shout of \"hey, that's not fair,\" outside of his line of sight, but also notices that his body is feeling less responsive, as if he's losing control. Slowly, as the kiss winds down, Jack feels like the only thing still with feeling is his head, and as 'Cassandra' pulls away, that feeling slowly recedes, until the familiar sensation of 'ghostliness' from earlier reasserts itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Looking down, Jack sees his body being held up by the shorter and smaller 'Cassandra', who's looking up at him with a wide mischievous grin. 'Well, that was one way to get me out of my body that didn't feel too bad' Jack thought to himself, seeing his body being dragged over to one of the benches along the wall, and laid down upon it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, now what, since we're both ghost-like,\" Cassandra speaks up, drawing Jack's attention to her, and away from Lilith for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No clue. I thought I would follow you and see what you get up to as a ghost, as you seem to know more about the supernatural than me. I figured if nothing else, I could get a better understanding of this new world, and keep you out of too much trouble if something bad happens,\" Jack responds, after pondering what two ghosts could do in a High school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Huh, it's almost as if you assume I'll get into trouble Jack. In any case, I figure there are a couple of things I, or in this case, we could do. We could go and mess with the occult/supernatural club. There is exploring the school itself, or we could go farther afield and explore some part of the town. Though, how long we stay like this is based on whatever limit Lilith informs us of,\" Cassandra states excitedly, her enthusiasm for getting her wish seeming to override her usual shy nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, that's easy, as long as I put you back before 24 hours is up, you should be fine Cass. Though, if you start feeling faint before that, you might want to return sooner. Jack doesn't have that issue, because of his new nature, but as you have no innate magic, nor anything that could help substitute or manipulate your circumstances, you have such limits,\" Lilith speaks up, after going back to amusing herself with those strange sparks of electricity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, maybe after we get to know each other better, we can work something out?\" Cassandra says aloud, sounding somewhat down that she had limits, but then seeming to rebound and 'dance' in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Lets...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

I wanna go see who I'll possess for a bit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack smirked. She was having more fun than he had on his first time. Then again, she knew what she was getting into. He didn't. \"Sure. Any ideas on who you're gonna be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope! That's half the fun!\" Cassandra giggled. \"I do have some ideas on what I'm looking for though...\" Cassandra flew ahead and down the hall, careful to stay a foot above everyone. Jack followed her, curious. He wasn't that sure what he wanted to do - if he wanted to take over someone, or to just watch and maybe play some pranks. Now that this was on his terms... maybe he would just possess someone near whoever Cassandra ended up going for. He didn't want to leave her stranded in someone else's body, but he could still have some choice that way. His memories went to his time in Cassandra's body, in the bathroom... he could just go disappear for a little bit and borrow someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooo, I always did wonder what it would be like to have big boobs...\" Cassandra mused, snapping Jack out of his daydreaming. He glanced around and saw who Cassandra must have been talking about. Walking down the hall, suspiciously alone, was a girl a year below Jack. Tori, maybe? Anyway, as Cassandra had mentioned, her distinguishing feature was her impressive chest. Jack didn't know much about cup sizes, but they were almost melon sized. She was taller than Cassandra - not that that was saying a lot, since she was tiny. That could have been another motivation. \"Nah. They're too big. Probably super uncomfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack nodded his agreement. Cassandra's eyes lit up and she grinned. \"Ahhh... what if I possessed Tommy? I'd totally be able to check him out however I wanted...\" Tommy was the star quarterback, built like a tank, and apparently the wet dream of half the girls in the school. He was a decent enough dude too. Jack smiled, glad that he wasn't the only ghost around having inappropriate thoughts. If she decided to go for Tommy, they could agree to split up and he could go take his pick of the cheerleaders. Maybe even Melissa Robinson, the blonde cheerleading superstar of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround the corner came more people, one of whom immediately caught Jack's attention. Sarah. \"Oh, she'd be fun too!\" Cassandra said. \"That's Sarah Saunders, right? Look at her! Tall, hot, popular, great figure... I'd love to spend a day in that body!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack gulped. That wasn't something he would be super happy with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... do you have a crush on her?\" Cassandra teased, noticing Jack's reaction. \"Even better then! I could totally help set you two up! It's a win-win!\" She was definitely more enthusiastic about the idea than Jack. \"Or, you know... you could possess her...\" she suggested. \"Live a day in her shoes, get to know her better.\" Cassandra winked. \"But decide quick, or I might just take her for myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thinking quickly, Jack increased the height of his current hover, while trying to keep his eye on 'Sarah'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"You go on ahead with the others Emily, I need to go use the restroom before next period.\" 'Sarah' says to Emily, who apparently stayed behind in concern for 'Sarah'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Are you sure? I know that you've been pushing yourself hard lately, especially since you've been frustrated that Jack hasn't picked up any of your hints about a date lately. Maybe you should skip practice today, I'm sure the coach would understand.\" Emily responds, unknowingly alerting Jack and Cassandra about Sarah's feelings as of late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'She's been dropping hints? I thought that was playful teasing? Damn, wish I had noticed sooner.....why does Cassandra currently have a Cheshire-like grin plastered on her face!' Jack berated himself mentally, only to freak out after noticing 'Sarah' gently push Emily down the hall, telling her she would catch up soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A few long minutes go by before the only ones in the hall are 'Sarah' and the invisible Jack. Looking around, Jack drifts somewhat closer, now seeing that they're pretty much alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"I can't see you right now Jack, but I'm going to assume you're currently around. If you don't want to miss out on a show, you can follow me, or you could try to find a body to possess, and join in on the fun,\" 'Sarah' says aloud, slowly walking down the hallway towards the nearest bathrooms, hips swaying seductively the whole time, capturing Jacks attention, and slightly stalling his decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack shakes his head, regaining focus, and decides...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

As Jack entered, he realized it was the gym coach explaining a siuation to the school nurse, who was hovering over top a student who was lying down unconscious in a bed. The young girl was wearing short shorts and a tank top, seemingly having just been in PE. She had dark skin and curly black hair held up in a bun, and seemed fairly athletic, with very strong, tall legs. The nurse was measuring her pulse. checking her breathing and trying to wake her up. The nurse herself was a somewhat older woman, probably in her mid to late thirties. with wide hips. She was wearing a pretty simple outfit, Khakis and a pink blouse. Jack remembered her name was Mrs. Simon, but he didn't really know the girl on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's worrying, and I'm going to call an ambulance to be safe, but I think it's just shock,\" she replied. \"The bump just doesn't seem severe enough to be a concussion and her breathing is even. Can you call her parents?\" The nurse asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coach nodded. \"I'll be right on it,\" he said as he hurried out of the room, passing by Jack without even thinking about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the nurse went over to go find a phone, a thought struck Zach. '<i>Can I do what Lillith did to me?</i>' When Lilith entered his body, it knocked his soul out. He didn't understand the mechanics very well, but he worried that possessing the nurse's soul would have similar reaction, or some sort of resistance. In addition, she was a fairly busy person even if her body would impart some authority. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That girl is knocked out though,\" he murmured inaudibly. If he phased into her, he wouldn't have to worry about any kind of resistance, right? He'd be able to puppeteer her just fine, even if he'd have to be a girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe realized he didn't have much time. If the nurse called an ambulance, this girl would probably have to leave no matter what. If he could get her on her feet though, maybe he'd be able to convince the nurse she was okay and go on the hunt for Lilith.</span></div></div>",

He could barely feel his new body - rather he just felt static all throughout, as though all his limbs were asleep. He reached his head up for just a second, to try to dissuade the nurse from calling his host's parents, but it was no use, he quickly passed out, just as the girl herself had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack found himself feeling weightless. He was unsure of where he was, and barely had time to remember his attempt at possessing the girl who was knocked out. The area around him was dark and hazy, he could barely see beyond his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-who are you?\" A voice asked. It was feminine, and sounded concerned. \"Stay away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I'm not sure where I am,\" Jack replied, not sure how he was speaking. \"I, uh, I'm Jack.\" He wasn't sure if it was wise to give his name, but felt it best to put the other voice at ease. \"Who are you? Where is this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? I'm Anna,\" The voice replied. \"This is.. it's ... I'm not sure. I remember running - too fast - then I tripped...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...\" Jack began to piece it together. The fog around cleared, and he could see the face of the girl before him. \"You're -!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna?\" A new voice suddenly broke through the haze. A man's. Jack's eyes flickered, and he winced as a light was flashed straight at him. \"There we are!\" The man said, gladly. He had a shortly cropped beard and a combover - both brown and grey. \"You gave us a bit of a scare miss! Tell me, how many fingers am I holding up?\" He held out a hand, 3 fingers out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three, sir,\" Jack answered, blearily as he pushed himself up. His eyes popped momentarily once he heard his voice - high pitched, just like the dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy there! No need to overdo it,\" the man put a gentle hand on his shoulder. Jack breathing heavily, began to look over the room - realizing it was some sort of doctor's office. Did they take him to the hospital? How much time had passed? He looked to the window, seeing the sun was still out much to his relief. Surely it hadn't been too long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was more stunned, however, once he caught sight of his own body. His once pale arm was now much darker, and very exposed by the athletic gear the girl was wearing before she passed out. He realized her breasts - moderately sized - seemed to juggle with every breath and movement as he patted himself down as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any bruises I should no about? Lingering pain?\" the Doctor asked. It seemed he interpreted Jack's self examination as the normal reaction of a girl who just woke up from an injury, not that of a boy who just woke up in a girl's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stopped to think about it. \"Uh, no, nothing.\" It was actually true. \"My head's a bit sore I guess. but that's it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, all seems normal. I think it was just too much a shock to your system, but no lasting harm. Your parents are here to take you home,\" he gestured towards the door. \"Out in the hallway. They'll be glad to see you're okay. Do let us know if you have any more concerns though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack shook his head slowly, feeling the girl's hair - tied in a bun - bob behind him. \"Er, yes sir. I'm sorry for worrying you. Say, uh, before I go, is there a bathroom?\" He was still speaking a bit slowly, acclimating to his new voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor nodded his head towards a door on the east side of the room. \"Certainly, right over there. Don't take too long now though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack thanked him and hurried into the room, flicking on the light and looking at his new reflection in awe. It worked - he'd possessed this girl. Anna? But it didn't help him at all. Lillith was probably out their causing chaos as him while he spent his time conked out in some girl's head. What was that hallucination in the middle there anyways? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a lost cause. I need to exit.\" He told himself, staring into his new brown eyes with determination. He closed them tightly and began to focus on drifting away, exiting upwards, out of this body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes suddenly opened, and to his surprise, he was still in the girl's body. Now, however, it didn't seem to respond to him. His face looked confused, and a hand slowly raised up to rub the sore spot on his borrowed head. \"Ugh...\" his voice groaned in discomfort. \"That was weird... was like autopilot...I don't even need to pee... why did I come in here.\" His body turned on a heel, and left the bathroom while he was completely sidelined. <i>'What just happened?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout his input, the girl's body left the doctor's office room and into the hall, where she was greeted by an older man and woman - maybe in their 40's - who were ecstatic to see her okay. <i>'Her parents?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were worried sick Anna! Are you sure you're alright honey?\" The woman asked, hugging her daughter (and Jack) tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl returned the hug. \"I'm alright mom. Just sorta dizzy still - just gonna take it easy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best you should,\" the man said, putting a hand on her shoulder as the mother released her from the hug. \"Class just ended for you, so let's go straight home. Maybe you should stay in tomorrow too if you're feeling dizzy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see how I feel tomorrow morning,\" she said with a grin, following past her parents towards their car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Did... she take back control? That can happen?'</i> This wasn't in his plan. Not only could he leave, but he was being dragged further away from Lillith. What did he do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So... he had accidentally hit someone coming out of gym class? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack started to panic. He wasn't prepared to be a student. As the nurse, he could at least keep to himself. Not as whoever he was now... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First things first\" thought Jack. \"I have to figure out who I am now\". He slowly continued to walk in the same direction the girl had been before. As he did, he began to feel a bit more comfortable in her skin. As if her personality and memories were leaking into him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack confidently strode into the girls' changeroom, internally grinning at the sight of his female classmates in various states of undress. If he had been a guy, he would have greatly enjoyed this. His body didn't really react to the sight, though. He auto-piloted his way to the girl's locker. Through the metal face of the locker, he caught sight of his new face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, he was in the body of Adrianna Priors. She was a year younger than him, star athlete on the volleyball team... the team where Sarah played. This could be used to his advantage, Jack thought. Sarah wouldn't think twice about Adrianna being around her, but if it were Jack in his original body, it might come across a bit suspicious. That was for later, though. For now, he needed to follow Adrianna's school day to completion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened her locker, combination and all, and took out her clothes. He looked around some more. There was a block of showers, but he probably wouldn't need to use them. Slowly peeling off her top, Jack caught sight of his body's fit abs. Damn, she was fit. Her sports bra was next, revealing a small pair of tits which Jack was so tempted to play with. While putting on Adrianna's bra, Jack made sure to take extra effort to 'adjust'. After swapping out her skirt for the longer day-to-day uniform skirt, he proceeded out of the changerooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack knew he had to go find Lilith and his own body, but was that the right thing to do right this minute? He knew he didn't have any classes with Adrianna, and she couldn't just go and miss class for no reason. But his ghost form had no class to attend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Jack do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Checking to make sure no one was around, Jack entered a cubicle, and thought about how to go about depossessing Adrianna. Taking a few deep breaths, and trying to feel what was different about his current form, did nothing for Jack, except remind him that while breasts are fun for pleasure and arousal , they are also killer on one's back the larger they are. 'Thank god Adrianna's are smaller than some of the ones i've seen,' thought Jack, after giving up on trying to feel differences. Taking another deep breath, Jack focuses intently on depossessing Adrianna, trying to will himself out and away from her body.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n  Suddenly feeling weaker, and not solid at all, Jack realizes that he lucked out on that method, as he now is a spirit again, floating in a girls restroom.... 'damn that sounds really perverted when placed in such a context,' thought Jack. Starting to slowly feel drained, but not as bad as before, Jack wanders through the wall, into the hallway, and deftly avoids running into some passing students. Looking around for a clock, to get an idea of where Lilith could be currently, if she was following his normal route, he finally finds a clock. 11:45am<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  'Ok, she'll possibly be heading to either the roof, or the cafeteria, depending on what she did after she took over,' Jack thinks, while also hoping he can either take his body back by force, or convince Lilith to give it back. While in thought, Jack starts drifting down the hall, dodging the student traffic that seems to have been disgorged from all the nearby classrooms. 'Wow, I know some ladies like to flout the rules, but dressing like that is just asking for the staff's attention,' Jack murmurs to himself, admiring a busty red-head strutting down the hallway, wearing a torn white dress shirt, tied just under her DD-cup breasts. Her skirt, also modified, barely left anything to the imagination, and if Jack could, and wasn't in danger of fading, probably would have tried to conjure a gust of wind, just to see what she had on underneath. <br>\r\n  *smack* 'Ok, note to self, spirits can hit themselves and hurt themselves, even in \"spirit form\",' Jack mumbles, rubbing his cheek after trying to snap his attention back to not fading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Regaining focus on his goal, Jack heads towards...</span></div></div>",

Long minutes of gliding up the seemingly endless flights of stairs, Jack finally finds himself in front of the roof access door. Pausing before trying to 'walk' through it, Jack hears a sound, but he honestly can't believe he's hearing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, fuck! Yeah, that's the spot! Go faster and harder dammit!\" a feminine voice shrieks, all the while moaning loudly with occasional yells of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0'Wow, someone has the guts to do this during lunch period? Wonder who it is,' Jack thinks to himself, while slowly drifting towards the door to phase through it, hiding even though he is pretty sure no one can see him currently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Slowly tilting his head forward slowly, Jack's vision at first fills with the dull gray metal color of the door, before it explodes into the bright sunny outdoors of the roof, blue skies with nary a cloud, the only hint of contrast being the shaded overhang near the doorway. Confused, Jack cannot see the person he heard recently, at least not directly ahead of his current vantage point, though he can still hear her, and her lewd moans and constant chanting of \"fuck, fuck, fuck,\" after what one would assume is each thrust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Turning his head to the left, Jack sees nothing, but upon turning his head to the right, he sees not five feet away the two people currently having sex, and is stunned. Standing there, with her back flush against the wall, legs wrapped around her partner, bouncing rapidly in hopes of continued pleasure, was Jack's history teacher Ms. Watson!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shocked by the sight, it takes Jack a few moments to even notice who is currently ploughing Ms. Watson....Himself! Snapping out of his shock, Jack realizes that Lilith apparently has decided to have sex during lunch while using his body. Slightly turned on by the sight, as Ms. Watson ticked alot of the boxes on his attraction list, especially with the enthusiastic actions causing his arousal to simmer into being, Jack tries to focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0'Ok, so far as I can tell, Lilith hasn't notice me, so I could try to slip in and possess my body, but if I miss, I think I might be stuck until either she stops screwing, or she decides to do something about me trying to stop her fun.......so, don't miss!' Jack thinks to himself, trying to psych himself up to act. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Slowly drifting around to be behind 'Jack', Jack attempts to figure out the rhythm of their screwing, to see if he can time when to attack. Unseen by Jack, Lilith gains a grin as apparently she noticed his presence on the roof, as well as the slow flanking action he had taken. Debating about letting him ruin her current fun, Lilith wonders what else she could do currently, while moving one of her hands holding onto Ms.Watson's ass to her boobs, starting to pull and massage while increasing her pace even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0'Damn, the pace changed again....could she know I'm up here? No, otherwise she probably would have cast a spell or done something....maybe?' Jack thinks, doubt striking him as his plan hits an unexpected snag, causing him to have to adjust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Long moments go by, with Jack attempting to yet again see if he can get a timing down, when suddenly 'Jack' changes his pace again, moving the hand on Ms. Watson's boobs down towards her pussy, causing even louder shrieks to cry out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Becoming impatient, Jack decides to throw caution to the wind, and lunges forward, not able to see the smile appear on 'Jack's' face the moment the 'attack' starts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

Jack continued forward, unable to stop his dive as he collided with the two writhing bodies. A jarring snap confirmed that he had indeed connected with someone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck!\" was the first thing out of his mouth as he came to and felt an overwhelming wave of pleasure rack his body. He felt himself moving up and down, the pleasure in his body only building. He looked up, expecting to see Ms. Watson looking back. Instead, he was greeted with his own face, who winked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck!\" Jack cried out again as he looked down at 'his' body. Ms. Watson's breasts - surprisingly firm considering she had to be about forty - hung free from his chest, being caressed by one of Lilith's hands. In his moment of lucidity he also noted he was wrapped around his former body, the latter's erect cock plunged deep into 'his' hungry pussy. Lilith was also using her spare hand - the one not working on Jack's current body's tits - to finger Ms. Watson's clit. Jack let out another moan as the pleasure in his body reached a climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer lucid and instead at the whim of his current body's hormones, Jack rode his body back and forth, back and forth, hungry for more pleasure as the succubus in charge of his usual body played her own part, caressing and pinching her way across Jack's current body. Jack let out a scream as a mindshattering orgasm unlike anything he had ever felt coursed from 'his' pussy through every fiber of his being. He went limp, still impaled on the shaft of his former body, and let out a quieter, more subdued moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith let him down slowly, Jack's legs giving out and leaving him sitting naked on the roof on a small puddle of his body's - both - juices, sweating slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back, Master.\" Lilith teased in Jack's voice. \"Or Mistress, is it? I can totally get into this student / teacher thing\". She winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack just let out a moan. \"Hngg... that was... uhhh.\" He couldn't quite find the words - or the breath - to express himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh yes, under my hand the female orgasm is quite the experience.\" Lilith said. \"Shame not all women can feel that...\" she smirked. \"I was hoping you would find me up here, Master. This way you could know firsthand what kind of fun we could get up to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack just nodded. But what now? He was in Ms. Watson's body, naked, and if he wasn't mistaken he had history class in about thirty minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if reading his mind, Lilith offered some words. \"Well you could stay in her body, Master. You'll eventually 'sync' and get her memories, so you'll handle class well enough. Or we could skip it entirely, instead going for some fun elsewhere. Finally, I could let you go and pick out new bodies for us in history class, and go from there. I'd ask that I stay in you in that case, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack thought about his options, and decided.</span></div></div>",

Refocusing on Lilith, Jack slowly tries to stand up, only to stumble and fall down, his legs unable to support him. Landing in the puddle of combined juices with a plop, Jack merely looks up at Lilith imploringly for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chuckling, Lilith decides to take pity on her Mistress, and waves a hand over 'her' body, as well as over the general area. The puddle of cum Jack was sitting it suddenly wavers, then disappears, as well as the sweat and juices that had clung to his current body. Surprised, and somewhat apprehensive, Jack tests his legs once again, and finds them somewhat more agreeable to him trying to stand. Slowly, Jack stands up, noticing the extra weight, as well as the change of balance from what he's usually accustomed to. 'Wow, while huge breasts look awesome, and are great fun during sex, they do seem to weigh alot...how do women put up with them?' Jack muses to himself silently, taking in the differences of his new body, now that he's more lucid and in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Your choice Mistress, or are you wanting to go another round?\" 'Jack' asks, snapping his fingers, and his cock suddenly springing to full mast, causing Jack to gasp, as well as shudder from the sudden spike of lust that lanced through his body at the sight of his former rigid tool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"As much fun as that sounds, I think I would like to go to class as someone else, but before that, would you mind explaining why I was left behind to fade out of existence?\" Jack asks, getting himself under control, and trying to sound somewhat normal, even if that question had sparked some anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah, that...well, the short answer would be a test. Most budding warlocks are so engrossed and distracted by their new powers, that they don't exactly think about the consequences, especially when jumping headlong into possibly dangerous territory. While I do like you better than previous Masters/Mistress', I am still bound to test, train, and challenge you to grow. The quickest way to accomplish that in the beginning I've found is the \"Deep end\" method. I let the warlock have enough of a chance to succeed, but they're thrown into the deep end of a subject and either sink or swim.\" Lilith explains, her coy smile slowly turning neutral as her explanation went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"I am glad that you made it to this point Mistress, and am hoping that you are not too upset enough to do something foolish. Some previous 'owners' decided to either try to destroy the book, or supplant the rules inside, and found the consequences.....unpleasantly fatal,\" Lilith finishes, waving her hands over 'himself' as well as over Jack's current body, appropriate clothing forming over both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking a deep breath, and thinking over Lilith's explanation, Jack decides to come back to the issue later, when he's had more time to process it, as well as look more closely at the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Alright, I can understand how it came to this situation Lilith, but a bit of a warning next time might be more appreciated, especially as this hurt the trust I had in you.\" Jack responds, seeing a flash of disappointment cross his former face, quickly replaces with a cheery fake smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"As you say Mistress. Now that you've decided to join your class as someone else, are you ready to leave now, or did you wish to walk down to the class, and un-possess Shannon outside the class room?\" Lilith asks, moving towards the door and opening it for the both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Deciding to take his time in a physical body, as he still wished to avoid the chilling sense of being a spirit wandering, Jack merely motioned Lilith onward. Taking the hint, Lilith merely grins and starts on down the stairs, with Jack following slowly, trying to get a sense of how to walk in heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Minutes of silence go by, and Jacks coordination and movements slowly become more smooth and natural, until he stops focusing on that, and begins to notice the oddly empty halls. Looking down at his wrist, Jack sees the time is only 15 minutes until class, and is confused as to why no one is currently moving in the hallway towards the classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"It's because I cast an aversion spell on you for the moment, as I thought you would appreciate the time to adjust to your current situation, Mistress,\" Lilith suddenly says, answering your question, and leading you to wonder if she can read your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Technically it could be classified as something else, but in this case, I can read your mind without really trying, as we both are bound together through the medium of the book. It's easier for me to 'read your mind' than for you, as I have much more practice and control over my power, while you are still working through your first day of your new circumstances.\" Lilith responds, still not bothering to turn around, but atleast answering your unspoken questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another few minutes of travel and both Jack and Lilith arrive outside of the history class room, hallway still eerily empty. Shaking his head at the oddity, Jack decides to open the door, and walk into the classroom to head into the office that is attached inside. After crossing the threshold, Jack noticed that Lilith hadn't followed. Confused, Jack looks back, and sees Lilith standing with 'his' back to him. Wondering if something is wrong, Jack decides to voice his worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Are you alright Lilith? You've been silent the whole way here, and while I'm happy that you've been explaining things, you also haven't been acting as you first did when we met.\" Jack asked, hoping that he could possibly fix whatever was wrong at this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"I will be ok Mistress, I am merely...distressed that what little trust you had in me has been damaged. While I will admit it is my fault in this case, I am still bound by the book as well as its 'orders' as the case may be. Like I said before, I like you more than previous Masters, and I am happy you overcame your first test, but I also am saddened it came at the cost of your trust.\" Lilith says, finally turning around and displaying genuine dismay on 'his' face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"...I'm sorry that you are hurt by that Lilith, but it will take time to fix this, and at the moment I kind of am worried about you, since a sad Lilith isn't something I'm used to. Granted, I've known you less than 12 hours, but I'm pretty sure a succubus isn't supposed to be 'down-in-the-dumps' but usually trying to tempt and sex up the area!\" Jack says, trying to console Lilith, as well as add some levity to his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Smiling at the horrible way Jack tried to help, Lilith giggles, making Jack feel odd seeing his old body do something so unusual. Seeing that the situation is fixed for the moment, Jack heads towards the office door, and opens it, seeing a simple office with a desk covered in papers as well as a decent computer on top of it. Circling around the desk to the chair, and pulling it out, Jack slowly eases himself into the chair, amazed at how comfortable it feels. Shaking his head at this, Jack shrugs, then relaxes and starts to de-possess Ms. Watson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The feeling of warmth and physical being slowly fading, Jack starts to feel the familiar surrounding cold from earlier as a spirit. Opening his eyes, Jack sees he's currently floating behind Ms. Watson, who looks dazed momentarily, before looking over at her computer screen and notices the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Shit, must have dozed off during lunch period instead of getting work ready for class, only a few minutes left. Damn that wasn't a hot dream though, maybe at some point I should attempt it,\" Shannon says quietly to herself, unknowingly telling Jack something about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Wow, so apparently her mind made her think it was all a dream....and apparently she might want to jump me later?' Jack mentally muses, before shaking his head and floating back towards the classroom. Arriving at the doorway, Jack sees the classroom filled up, with Lilith sitting near the back where Jack would normally sit. Looking over the class, Jack sees many potential targets to take over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Isn't that purplette in front of Lilith supposed to be Nikki, and beside her, her friend Janet the red-head? And isn't that the chick I almost possessed in my search for Lilith ....damn don't know her name,' Jack silently says to himself, admiring the busty red-head from before, that still seems to have the altered uniform on that accentuates her curves and legs enticingly. Shuddering from the spike in his arousal, Jack notices many other's he could target, but keeps looking to see if theirs a feeling of 'that one' possibly striking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moments later, after hearing Ms. Watson stand up, and the click of her heels on the floor signalling that she's heading towards the door, Jack decides to pick ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

Jack looked at the options immediately next to his regular body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not.\" Jack thought out loud, before gently slipping himself inside the tall and slim body of Nikki. The transition was a lot less jarring than his previous possession of Ms Watson, but he did still feel a little bit of a shudder as he took control. This was an entirely new sensation compared to before. Nikki was slender, and a lot less top-heavy than his history teacher, and it definitely showed in how different the two felt. That, and maybe the age difference too. Nikki was so much lighter, and Jack felt so much more comfortable in her skin than in Ms Watson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly turning around to look at his old body, he saw 'Jack', or rather Lilith, give him a quick wink. He smiled with his new face, then turned back around. A strange feeling welled up inside you, one you had never felt before. Almost like... arousal? Figures. Succubus and all that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet nudged him with her elbow. \"You and Jack, huh? When did that happen and how do I not know about it yet?\" Jack stuttered. \"Girl, you're telling me all about it after class!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack shrugged, taking a dainty hand and brushing a strand of purple hair out of his eyes. At that moment, the office door closed and the teacher finally walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright class... oh, Miss Hart. Still dressing as conservatively as ever, I see.\" Ms Watson said. The busty redhead from earlier, dressed in the 'modified' uniform, shrugged. \"Anyway. Today, we're going to discuss the impact of...\" Jack zoned out at this point, more focused on the odd feeling 'Jack' had sown in him only moments earlier. He began fidget, causing his smooth thighs to rub together inside his skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's attention was drawn back to class when the teacher said his name. \"Mr Thompson, care to answer?\" Jack froze. He hadn't even heard what the question was. Before he could gather his thoughts, someone else answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" His own voice, from behind him. Oh, right. He wasn't technically 'Mr. Thompson' right now. He was 'Miss Rhodes'. Whatever it was that his body had answered, it seemed to satisfy the teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good, Mr. Thompson\". Ms Watson said while intently staring at 'Jack'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say, I aim to please!\" 'Jack replied with a laugh, causing Ms Watson to purse her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lesson seemed to be taking forever. Looking at the clock, Jack saw there was still a whole half hour to go, while he was sitting in Nikki's body and under some sort of spell. What now?</span></div></div>",

Reaching the cafeteria after what felt like forever, and having the vaguest urge of saying 'rib-bit', Jack peeks through the wall, being careful to avoid leaning too far through it, and possibly accidentally possessing a person either leaning there or passing by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally able to see the room, and glad that his view is unobstructed, Jack looks around to see if Lilith is there. Nearly a minutes passes before Jack finally spots her, and is surprised by who is sitting with her. Sitting at a table near the far wall and next to the windows sits 'Jack', and his table is accompanied by some of the hottest and most desired females of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 'Jack's' left sits Sarah, Jack's crush, who is talking enthusiastically about something if her hand gestures and occasional laughter are any indication. Sitting next to Sarah (her left) was her fellow volley ball teammate Nikki, the athletic purplette that had many an admirer, with just as many females cursing her looks. On Nikki's left was her best friend Janet, who seemed to be acting out some part of a story, as her actions had prompted her to push her seat back and start gesticulating in wide motions, causing her large chest to sway and bounce wildly, drawing the eye of many other males in the room, as well as the glares of many fellow females. Sitting next to Janet's chair, and opposite of Nikki, watching with amusement at Janet's antics, was the white haired Gwen, last year's cheerleading captain that had stepped down this year for mysterious reasons. While she had stepped away from the cheerleading scene, she apparently kept her body in excellent shape, if the well toned legs and tight midriff were anything to go by. Completing the circle, and sitting between 'Jack' and Gwen, sitting opposite of Sarah, was Melissa Robinson, current Head cheerleader, as well as the unofficially recognized leader of the drama club, even though she doesn't' seem to be in the club, nor go near it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shocked doesn't even begin to describe the feelings Jack feels at seeing Lilith surrounded by such popular and alluring women, all seeming to be friends, even though Jack cant recall a day before today where any of them really seemed to interact...positively that is. Shaking his head, and trying not to daydream from the possible thoughts of why Lilith has apparently gathered the bevy of beautiful babes around herself,  Jack ponders how to approach Lilith in such a crowded room, as he wasn't sure what Lilith's response would be to his appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Deciding on observing for now, as he can't honestly think of a way of sneaking up on Lilith, who occasionally seems to be glancing over where Jack is hiding, freaking him out, but not seeing any true indication that Lilith sees him. Watching the girls talk to each other, but unable to hear the conversations, Jack starts to wonder what Lilith is up to, as she seems to honestly be acting like a normal person, instead of the seductive temptress that shamelessly flirted and teased him since he had accidentally summoned her. Distracted in his thoughts, Jack misses Melissa slowly lower her left arm to under the table, and start running it lightly up and down 'Jack's' upper thigh, not even breaking her conversation with Nikki and Gwen, nor giving any indication to her current actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack finally snaps back to reality as the feeling of fading that he had previously felt when this misadventure started had reasserted itself, not as strong, but he could tell that he was running out of time to stay as a spirit. Not willing to risk possessing someone, then leaving them, as he had no grasp on how long it took, nor if that would help stall the fading feeling like before, Jack came up with a, even in his own mind, reckless plan. Not thinking on it too much, as looking up, Jack saw that Lunch period was almost over, and the bell for the next period would be ringing in fifteen minutes, Jack started to levitate upwards, reaching the ceiling, and partially phasing into it to try to hide his 'body' from view. Feeling concealed enough, and noticing that the fading had seemed to speed up after levitating up, Jack shoved the thought aside and started to slowly drift along the roof of the room, trying to reach over Lilith's table without alerting her to his presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Long minutes that felt like an eternity to Jack passed as he slowly progressed across the ceiling, until he finally was hovering above 'Jack'. The feeling of fading seeming to accelerate, and if Jack had to guess, it was an indicator of him expending 'spirit energy', he realized he had less than a minute to drop down and try to land on his body, and hope that he doesn't miss. Taking aim, Jack stops his concentration on hovering, and falls downward, not as quickly as if he was physically, but not slowly either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just as Jack is five feet above Lilith ...<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

Somehow, he'd possessed Sam! That realization, as well as the millions of new sensations that bombarded him, made Jack extremely uncomfortable. He found himself still looking down at himself = rather, at Sam's bright tight orange t-shirt, grey yoga pants, <i>boobs</i>... he had boobs! He was a girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey kid, you alright?\" Jenny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... just... I dunno. Gimme a sec\" Jack breathed in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Slightly bemused, 'Jack' starts to travel to where 'he' can sense no life signs, while also giving privacy. Along the way, little things start to change on 'Jack's' body, while more simple information is learned, processed, and 'copied' for later possible use. 'Jack's' gait and posture slowly start to change, as if some weight is slowly being added to the torso, and as if parts of his legs and arms are changing. The pleasant walk that 'Jack' is enjoying, while heading towards 'his' destination seems to be altering more and more in his appearance now. 'Jacks skin has taken on a darker tone, one would almost say it could be blue or purple, maybe a mixture of the two. 'Jack's' height has also changed, from 6 to 5'7\", and small stubs of some hard, bone-like substance has started to grow from 'his' scalp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Jack's' gait has also changed, into a sensual sway that on a woman, would look enticing, but currently, seems really odd, then again, it appears the changes are still on going. The torso seems to have had some weight added, which started out small, and has ballooned out to a very nice set of E-cup breasts, with very sensitive nipples, if the slight moaning is anything to go by while 'Jack' continues 'his' walk. The face has also slightly alterd, from a masculine face to a more feminine one, something that most would say would not be out of place on models. Oddly enough, as if in an anime, 'Jack's' hair has also decided to be odd, and change into an out of the norm color (especially since it appears to be 'natural'). The color of purple now fills out 'his' head, as well as growing out to be neck length. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost to 'his' destination, the final changes seem to be taking place, in the fact that the clothing seems to be changing into something that one would expect to see in video games, erotic literature, or places that \"adults only\" are allowed. A tight leather corset died dark blood red, along with a choker in the same color has slowly appeared and replaced 'Jack's' torso, along with what appears a pair of wings starting to grow out of 'his' back. 'Jack's' jeans and shoes slowly alter as well, into a leather G-string and fishnet stockings, and a pair of 9\" heels. Completing the ensemble, the nub like protrusions on 'Jack's\" head have grown into two pairs of horns about 3\" tall, and one inch thick in diameter. A mirror appears out of nowhere, floating along in front of 'Jack', while an object that looks like a stick of lipstick coalesces in 'Jack's' hand, which is promptly applied to 'his' lips. The mirror continues to hover in front of the altered 'Jack', while said 'person' pirouettes in place, examining all the changes, and humming happily to 'himself'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost perfect from what i can tell - i wonder if he'll be happy, or freak out first\", 'Jack' says aloud, in a higher pitched voice than what 'he' started out with. Leaving the mirror floating in place, 'Jack' traces a symbol on the ground in the warehouse he has apparently walked into, and slowly starts to chant in a foreign language. Nearly 30 seconds go by, and the chanting finally ceases after the symbol has changed into some runic circle and  has expanded to cover the warehouse. Finally ready to finish, 'Jack' conjures a chair, sits down, and slowly starts to control 'his' breathing, going into what appears to be a meditative trance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour or so of this meditation, 'Jack' springs up, dismisses the chair, and promptly stands in front of the mirror. Taking one last look at the work that has been done, 'Jack' snaps his fingers, conjuring a piece of paper and a pen, and writing down a quick note, before placing it behind 'him'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's see how you react to this Master,\" Jack says aloud, and suddenly is enshrouded by a dark mist that quickly moves away from Jack, and reforms into Lilith, who promptly turns invisible.</span></div></div>",

'He' can't tell what is wrong, but can tell something is different, even before attempting to open 'his' eyes. Taking a deep breath, and then pausing as he notices first that 'his' weight seem a bit different, as if 'his' chest feels heavier, and also that 'his' sense of balance seems different. After letting the breath out, starting to wonder just what Lilith had done, Jack opens 'his' eyes, and quickly notices 'he's' not anywhere 'he' recognizes at all. Taking in the location, Jack can tell it seems like a warehouse, and a pretty empty one at that. The only thing 'he' can see at the moment seems to be a large vanity mirror that 'he's' on the opposite side of apparently. Looking to see if Lilith is around, and not seeing her, Jack attempts to take a step towards the mirror, and instantly realizes that something is truly off from before the possession. <br>\r\n Quickly looking down to see if something is hindering 'his' movement, of if 'he' is in any way restrained, Jack promptly realizes that Lilith did indeed do something to 'him'. The sight of breasts encased by a dark blood red corset, and the color of 'his' skin, started Jack's worry morphing into a mini panic attack. Continuing the impromptu inspection Jack notices that he seems to be lacking his dick, and apparently has a leather G-string in the same color as 'his' corset. Further down apparently was a pair of fishnet stockings, as well as heels. Almost afraid to find out, Jack takes careful steps towards the mirror, moving as carefully as 'he' can to not slip, fall, or accidentally stumble into the mirror. As 'he' Inches closer to and around the mirror, Jack notices a piece of paper on the ground, but ignores it for the moment, as his panic overrides any common sense about why a piece of paper could be on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Looking into the mirror, Jack sees the full alterations that Lilith had done, and while beautiful, sexy, and lust inducing, also had Jack freaking out about how 'he' wasn't a he anymore, and also about why she would do this! Seeing horns sprouting from 'his' head, and the rest of the changes that Lilith had made, including some wings that seemed folded at the time, as well as the change in hair color and skin tone. Suddenly, Jack realizes why this sexy figure looked familiar, it had been one of the avatars 'he' had seen online while browsing forums for character building - one that required a mod just to have the \"race\" succubus actually work in the game. Snapping out of the daze that realization sent him, Jack recalls the piece of paper on the ground, and carefully squats down to pick it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Dear Master, or is it Mistress?' \"Dammit Lilith, you start a letter off like that wondering about titles, instead of trying to calm me down first!\" Jack shouted, and then gasped, as 'he' realized that just as his looks, height, and clothes were altered, so too was 'his voice. Taking a deep breath, Jack attempted to read the paper again.<br>\r\n'Aside from learning all i could about you like we discussed, i happened to stumble upon some of your fetishes, fantasies, and dreams. In the process, i figured that not only could we use some as a training exercise in your powers, but that you would get to experience something way outside your normal boundaries. The alterations to you are only permanent if you die, lose the book, or somehow screw up majorly multiple spells all at once. You can find a way back to your normal form through spells, or trying to use your new innate shapeshifting powers. Think of it as something akin to that magic woman from the movies you thought was hot, 'the one with pink hair.' Regardless, <br>\r\nthink of this as an opportunity to experiment, explore your magic, or even take a new lease on life. I'll be back soon unless an emergency comes up, otherwise, good luck on getting back to being \"Jack\" - <br>\r\nwith lust from your succubus, Lilith<br>\r\nP.S. Only one idiot in all of the time I've been in the book has screwed up multiple spells majorly, and that was many centuries ago, so don't freak out too much about that.<br>\r\nP.P.S. BTW, might want to figure out what you wish to do, since i also altered your hormones to fit your new form. Good luck, concentration training starts after reading this sentence' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as 'he' read the last sentence, Jack felt a sudden lust come over him, causing 'him' to lowly moan and drop the paper on the ground. Now feeling as if 'his' whole body is tingling and aroused, as well as noticing that 'his' new nipples have hardened, Jack tries to focus on making a decision, while unconsciously rubbing his thighs together, and slowly running 'his' hands up and down his sides.</span></div></div>",

She was the daughter of the pastor of the local church, and dressed appropriately. Her dark hair was tied up in a simple ponytail, and she wore a fully buttoned up white dress shirt over a calf-length brown skirt. A cross hung from her neck, glittering in the wind. She seemed completely oblivious to the fact that her sizable breasts bounced up and down in a very distracting manner as she ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, who's this?\" Lilith asked, intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mary, what's up?\" Jack asked, somewhat nervous due to Lilith's presence.

It wouldn't do for her to think he was crazy, or worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the innocent ones are always the most fun to mess with...\" Lilith grinned. It was strange, watching her act like this while looking and sounding identical to Jack. There wasn't much he could do about it, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what happens now?

Still in disarray, he turned around to see what Lilith was up to. Sure enough, she was still standing there, looking like him. She was much further away than he remembered,  but if he had wandered closer to the road that would make sense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack completed his turn and felt that something was very wrong. There was an unusual tickle at the back of his neck, and an unmistakeable bouncing sensation on his chest. A quick glance down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?\" Jack squealed in a high pitched voice that was most definitely not his own. He was staring down at a massive pair of tits hanging off his chest! In a dress shirt... It was then that Jack realized he hadn't seen Mary since he blacked out. He raised his hands and stared at Mary's slim, neatly manicured fingers. The reason he hadn't seen her was because he <i>was</i> her! \"Oh my God...\" he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright, Mary?\" His body asked him. Not a trace of anything being wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... not really?\" Jack replied, still not used to hearing Mary's voice from his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body suddenly grinned. \"So how is it in there, Master?\" Of course Lilith had done this. But that meant... she and her powers were real? Not just some two-day-long fever dream? That was both awesome and terrifying at the same time. \"Enjoying the body of the church girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you that?\" You questioned. Before you could say anything more, Lilith cut you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you agreed to let me possess you, didn't you? And your soul had to go somewhere... I figured it'd be more fun if you got to know some of my... talents while I was borrowing you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm stuck as Mary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not stuck... I can change that whenever. But at least try to have some fun first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...\" you had to admit, you were a little curious about what Mary was hiding under her good-girl clothing and attitude. And how better to find out than how you were now? But it still didn't feel right...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, do you need convincing?\" Lilith asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought for a second, looking down at the large breasts attached to your chest as you ran a hand over your cheek. This was surreal. You were in the body of Mary Fairweather. So now, what were you going to do? Lilith took a few steps towards you.</span></div></div>",

The previous haze has faded, and your mind is renewed. You were Mary Fairweather, and a few things were clear to you. One, you felt a little aroused. Two, you were interested in the body of Jack Thompson, who was conveniently right in front of you. Three - and this was the best part, Jack was possessed by Lilith. And Lilith had to obey your commands...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou loosened the top few buttons of your shirt, exposing a generous portion of your cleavage. Your hands smoothed down your shirt, feeling the contours of your body. With a body as hot as this, why did you always wear such boring and conservative clothing? Oh, right. Pastor's daughter had to keep up the image of a good girl. But today you didn't feel like being a good girl. You roll up your skirt to a much more reasonable mid-thigh, and tucked it in underneath. It looked a bit ridiculous, but at least now your legs could <i>breathe</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approached Lilith, who was grinning in Jack's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lilith,\" you started.

While waiting for a response, you notice 'Jack' lick his lips, while taking a moment to blatantly check you out, focusing especially on your now exposed cleavage, and your newly exposed thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well <i>Mary</i>, I don't know why I've never invited you over, and while it isn't too late, as long as were quiet and careful, i think a tour can be arranged,\" 'Jack' states, while moving closer to you, and putting his arm around your waist, guiding you in the direction of 'his' home. While walking, you notice that 'Jack' has started to subtly rub 'his' hand up and down your hip, in small motions, and it feels wonderful. Further along the walk, you put your head on 'his' shoulder, after moving 'his' hand from your hip, to your ass, all the while enjoying the slowly increased arousal you are feeling along this wonderful walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Minutes after 'Jack's' hand begins to caress and fondle your ass, you both arrive in 'his' driveway. 'Jack's' hand has traversed your ass, and is now between your legs, slowly rubbing up and down your panty-clad pussy, sending shivers throughout your body. Taking a deep breath, you spin around in place to face 'Jack', throw your arm around 'his' neck, pull 'him' down towards you, and give the best soul-searing, lust induced kiss you've ever given ....or read about at least. While initially caught off guard, 'Jack' quickly reciprocates, and then turns the tables on you, winning the battle of tongues, and making you feel as if you're about to melt from the amount of lust and arousal this kiss has sparked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Breaking the kiss, 'Jack' pulls back with a giant smirk on 'his' face, and a gleam in 'his' eyes. Taking a moment to let you get your bearings, 'Jack' takes your hand, and slowly guides you both up to 'his' house, all the while rubbing small circles on the back of your hand, keeping your pleasant feelings at a high level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Damn <i>Mary</i>, if I knew you could kiss like that, and were that excited for a tour, I would have invited you over a lot sooner,\" 'Jack' states while unlocking 'his' front door, ushering you in all the while. Closing the door, 'Jack' suddenly moves towards you, picks you up, and carries you up the stairs, all the while giving brief nondescript two word explanations about the rooms of the house and the wallpaper. Less than three minutes after entering 'Jack's' house, you both are in 'his' room, on 'his' bed, making out passionately and caressing each other. Pausing in between kisses, you feel your skin heating up even more from your lust, so you rip your shirt off quickly, almost snapping the buttons off, and quickly throwing the shirt in a corner of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0'Jack', during this pause, has also removed his shirt, and stops to admire your now bra covered cleavage. After taking a moment to appreciate it, he finishes removing his shirt, and starts to remove his jeans as well. Taking the hint, you start to take off your bra and panties as well. Just as you reach to take off your skirt, 'Jack' calls out. \"Wait, I think you look sexy with it on like that,\" while his attention is drawn to your naked breasts after you abort taking off your skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Finally, both of you naked, hot, and bothered, launch at one another, as if two magnets drawn together. 'Jack' starts to fondle your breasts, and rolls your nipples every few seconds, eliciting a low moan that continues to grow in volume the longer 'he' rolls them. Your hands caress his body, all the while watching 'his' tool grow to a size you wonder if is even possible. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Jack, fuck me now, or i swear to God, I wont be held responsible for what I end up doing,\" you state, in a lust-crazed voice. As you say this, you grab his member, and slowly start to pump it, all the while staring into his red-tinted eyes.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"All you needed to say was that you were ready, though i am curious what you would do if *oomph*,\" 'Jack' gets out, before you kiss him deeply, and aim his cock at your entrance and slam down hard on it. Fireworks go off throughout your body, and your deep, guttural moan is only subdued due to the kiss that 'jack' is currently keeping up, all the while holding you too him. The kiss ends, and 'Jack' pulls back some to look you in the eyes, while playing with your breasts again, then slowly moves 'his' hands to your hips. After placing them on both sides, 'he' slowly lifts you up, then down, gently, all the while keeping eye contact with you. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n Placing a hand on 'his' chest, while looking adoringly at 'Jack', you give a look that makes 'him' pause, and in that moment, push 'him' down, onto his back, and start slamming yourself down on him, all the while shouting out \"Fuck being nice, you have me so aroused, that slow and gentle wont cut it 'Jack'!\" After hearing this, and gaining a shit-eating grin, 'Jack\" grabs your nipples on your upward bounce, and pulls down hard, setting off even more fireworks. This goes on for a few more minutes, every time you start to get a pace set, 'Jack' does something else that sets off even more arousal in you, until the point where you honestly wonder if you can take much more of this mounting lust. <br>\r\n  Just as that thought crosses your mind, 'Jack' snakes 'his' hand between you two, finds your clit on your upward bounce, and pinches it while pulling you down on 'him' All that mounting arousal and Lust cresend, setting off a rolling chain of sensations that just feel like they're going on forever, until you suddenly black out. <br>\r\n - <br>\r\n  Waking up after a few minutes, and feeling extremely sore, tired, but pleasantly happy with yourself, you look towards 'Jack' who is still under you, smiling like the Cheshire cat from Alice in wonderland. Moments later, 'Jack' helps move you off of 'him', and helps you get comfortable on the bed. <br>\r\n\"Well mistress, how do you feel?\" 'Jack' asks, while slowly moving 'his' hands in an odd pattern. Just as your about to answer, a red spark starts to jump between 'Jack's' moving hands, and you slowly start to recall things that feel as if they're a dream ....{/linespa</span>ce}</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack\u2019s heart raced as Lilith gazed lustily at him.  This whole experience was so new, so strange.  He gulped, his eyes darting about the room in a mad effort to find something else\u2014anything else\u2014to look at to tamp down the obvious tension and nerves raging inside him.  \u201cUm, uh, could\u2014could you bring me the book please,\u201d Jack said meekly, retreating into his kind, good-natured personality.  Lilith chuckled, seeing her new master\u2019s obvious fish-out-of-water mannerisms.  She walked sexily (the only way a woman with a figure like Lilith\u2019s could walk) over to the desk and retrieved the book, bringing it to Jack as requested.  Jack lightly took the book, his eyes fixed upon its yellowed pages as he tried desperately to make sense of all that had unfolded in just the last few minutes.  His finger traced the ancient pages and arcane text that seemed to him like gibberish at this point.  The tome contained hundreds and hundreds of pages, so Jack began in a sensible place\u2014at least near the beginning of the book.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, um, what . . . what does this one do?\u201d Jack said as he pointed to one of the spells and directed Lilith\u2019s attention to it.  She sat her curvaceous body down upon the bed next to him as she glanced at it.  \u201cOh,\u201d she began, \u201cthat\u2019s the one about revealing truth\u2014it\u2019s a compulsion spell,\u201d she explained.  \u201cCompulsion?\u201d Jack said, puzzled.  \u201cYes,\u201d Lilith answered, \u201cso one of the early things you want to know how to do if you are going to be a master of lust is to learn what people\u2019s sexual desires are.  What do they like?  Some women like short fat men with stubbly beards.  Some women like teacher-student role-playing.  Some women are attracted to older men, and some 40-something divorcees would like nothing better than to fuck the pool-boy,\u201d Lilith said.  \u201cThing is, most people\u2014women or otherwise\u2014don\u2019t like to talk about their sexual desires, so this spell is a way to help with that.  You say the spell, and then you have to physically touch the target.  The spell lasts for about an hour at first, during which you can ask the woman or man anything you want, and the target will have to answer.  The target will not want to answer, and he or she will remember answering, but she will answer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack tried to wrap his head around what he had just heard.  \u201cSo, if I do this spell on, like, my history teacher, she\u2019ll have to tell me anything I ask?\u201d  \u201cYes,\u201d Lilith said, \u201cat least for the hour or so that the spell works.  She will not know why she\u2019s answering, but most targets of this spell are too embarrassed by what they have revealed to do anything after the fact.\u201d  \u201cWow,\u201d Jack said, \u201cthat\u2019s interesting.\u201d  He flipped to another section, this one too early in the book.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about this spell?\u201d he asked, and Lilith looked at the identified page.  \u201cThat\u2019s called \u201cThe Eyes of Another,\u201d she said.  \u201cIt lets you see what someone else sees, again for an hour or two.  You don\u2019t need to touch the target, but you do need something belonging to him or her to make the spell work.  You do the spell with some personal property of the target, and for the next hour or so, you are inside that person\u2019s mind.  You will have no actual control over the mind or over the person\u2019s body, but you will get to ride around as a passenger, and that can sometimes be useful if you want to spy on someone close to the target,\u201d said Lilith.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack\u2019s mind swam again.  These were just the first couple spells.  What other secrets did the book hold?  Why did most of the spells look like gibberish to him?  When would he get to know about the big spells, the really powerful ones?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll in good time, Master,\u201d Lilith said with a chuckle.  \u201cHow did you\u2014\u201c Jack began, surprised.  Lilith simply smiled knowingly, \u201cI\u2019m linked to you, Master; I know what you\u2019re thinking.  And to answer your other questions, you cannot read most of the spells yet because you don\u2019t have the skill.  The book reveals itself to the one who has it little by little as your magical aptitude grows, which happens only as you case small spells at first and then progressively harder ones,\u201d Lilith expounded.  \u201cMagic is incremental, so you don\u2019t get the biggest most impressive spell on the first day.  You get better little by little.  You start with a spell that makes people answer your questions or be a passenger inside their minds.  Later there will be one about making people accept really weird things as normal.  Some place, there will be one about bigger things\u2014changing\u2019s people mental ages.  Then their physical ones.  So many hundreds of spells master!\u201d Lilith said excitedly, \u201cAnd in time, you\u2019ll learn them all.  You just won\u2019t have them revealed to you all at once . . . you have to prove yourself to the book.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack sat on the bed as his mouth dropped open.  He tried to take in all of what he had heard.  \u201cOh my God,\u201d he said as he clumsily stood up and backed away from the grinning Lilith,\u201dI . . . ah . . . I don\u2019t think I\u2019m comfortable with, with, with all that stuff.  I don\u2019t know if I want this.\u201d  Lilith laughed a bit, \u201cWell it wants you, Master,\u201d she said, standing and walking her voluptuous body over to he nervous Jack, standing only a few inches from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack tried to make sense of it all.  \u201cThis was going to be a perfectly normal, boring Friday night reading for my history project, and now I have to deal with a big-bobbed succubus telling me how I have to use an ancient book to make the sexual universe my plaything.\u201d  Lilith looked down briefly at her gorgeous chest and then back up at Jack, \u201cWould you really prefer my boobs were smaller, Master?\u201d she asked.  \u201cNo, no,\u201d Jack said, \u201cfrankly they\u2019re awesome,\u201d he said, blushing a bit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith paused for a moment.  \u201cMaster,\u201d she began, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you take tonight to get used to the idea a bit.  Spend time thinking about which of the fairly easy spells you\u2019d like to try first, and we can discuss it later.\u201d  Jack pondered momentarily, \u201cYeah, yeah time to think is good,\u201d he said emphatically.  \u201cOkay,\u201d Lilith said, patting Jack on the shoulder firmly.  As she did so, Jack suddenly felt very strange.  The whole world seemed to blur, and his balance became wobbly.  Jack swayed and caught himself on the edge of his bed.  He recovered after a couple seconds, thinking it must be some after-effect of the magic now inside him, or perhaps just a result of his being tired.  Lilith disappeared into a wispy puff of red smoke, and Jack turned around and headed out of his room and slowly downstairs.  The boards of the floor creaked below him as he headed to the living room where his mother had been watching TV but no longer was.  She\u2019d gone to get ready for some function she had agreed to attend that evening, but Jack forgot what it was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly lumbered over to the couch and plopped himself down upon it as he tried to clear his head.  He put his feet up and turned on the TV.  \u201cThe Governor said he looks forward to the trip,\u201d the newswoman said, apparently at the tale end of a story, \u201che says what our Mayor is doing to fight crime can be a model for the state.\u201d  \u201cBlah blah blah\u201d Jack said as he snapped off the TV and stood to get himself something to drink.  As Jack walked through the hallway, he heard a noise coming from his mother\u2019s room.  \u201cIs someone there?\u201d she called from behind the closed door as she prepped for her event.  Jack stopped just to tell her who it was making the noise; but, as he turned toward the sound of her voice, he caught his reflection in a mirror that hung on the wall in the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly.  Shit.\u201d Jack said as he found himself staring at a reflection that was most certainly not his.  Whose was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)\tStaring back at Jack was the image of his own mother\u2014Christine Thompson!  His real mother was probably making her way to open her bedroom door right now; how would she react if she saw a copy of herself standing in her own hallway dressed just as she was.  What would happen if Jack\u2019s siblings saw him this way?  Most importantly, how the hell did Jack come to look like his mom in the first place\u2014he didn\u2019t feel any different.  <br>\r\n2)\tIn the mirror, Jack saw the spitting image of Lilith, whose beautiful face mimicked his every amazed expression.  Could he hide before being seen?  How did he come to look like his curvy succubus anyhow?  How long would it last?  How would the family react to seeing this buxom stranger in their midst?<br>\r\n3)\tIn the place of his own face, Jack saw that of 42-year-old Jennifer Grubman, a quite overweight woman from down the street whom, as it appeared from the reflection, had donned stretchy jogging pants and a large sweatshirt.  Jack now remembered that his mother had invited the plump Mrs. Grubman to be her running buddy so that the latter could lose some weight, which she really did need to do.  Could Jack play the part of his rotund neighbor convincingly?  And why didn\u2019t he notice until now that he looked different?  He didn\u2019t feel that way.<br>\r\n4)\tJack saw his younger sister Samantha staring back at him.<br>\r\n5)\tJack beheld the visage of Lena Serlinkov.  Lena was a new friend of your mother\u2019s.  She had recently fled Russia in a hurry because her family had incurred the wrath of certain powerful people who remained nameless.  Lena took millions in various securities (bought with oil money) with her and fled to the United States.  She retained a fairly rough and pronounced accent but had a quite meek personality, probably owing to the fact that this whole country was new to her.  She was very quiet and very respectful of all she met.  She was also, and Jack had noticed this, a total hottie.  Red hair cascaded down her shoulders and framer her beautiful face.  Your mother had started taking her to Yoga class in an effort to give her something to do and maintain her wonderfully curvy and voluptuous body.  Jack would not mind getting with her if he ever had the opportunity.  <br>\r\n               <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How would he be able to explain this to his mother if she saw him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran quickly to his room, Lilith's breasts only slightly bouncing despite their size, and locked the door. \"Phew, that was close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he was safe, Jack paused, taking in the full feeling of being Lilith. He felt... pretty normal, despite being inside the body of a presumably powerful sex demon. He looked down, seeing Lilith's breasts encased in the tight tank top she had morphed onto herself earlier. He moved his hands down, grabbing a handful. Very soft, and he felt a pleasant tingling sensation when he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down further to what else <i>he</i> was wearing, Jack saw tight jeans accenting very feminine hips and slim, fit legs, and almost-knee-height leather boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm actually <i>really</i> hot...\" Jack whispered to himself. \"What should I do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Master is suddenly more interested in what he can do, hmm?\" Lilith's voice echoed in Jack's head. Jack, startled, let go of his breasts. That was very strange, referring to them as his. But, he reminded himself as he looked down, they most certainly were attached to the body <i>he</i> was currently in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since this <i>is</i> my actual body you're in, Master, you'll be able to cast much more interesting spells than if you were still in yours.\" Lilith explained. \"So we don't have to start with the easy stuff and can get right to the good stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack thought about it. He had been curious about some of the spells in the book, for sure, and now he would have a much easier time of trying some of them out. But on the other hand... He was inhabiting a sexy female body, which was completely new. Not to mention Lilith had already proven that she was no ordinary sexy female. Plus, she had already as good as told Jack that while he was in her, he did have access to her powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or would you rather get to know me a bit better?\" That was spoken with a much more suggestive tone, as if Lilith actually wanted it. Then again, Jack thought, she probably did. \"Both will be all kinds of fun...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack decided to...</span></div></div>",

When he got there, he shut the door behind him, giving himself a view of his reflection in the full-length mirror on the inside of the door. He saw the reflection of Lilith staring back at him, red hair cascading down her shoulders, hungry look in her bright green eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Jack said, looking around. He saw a bunch of hair accessories on the counter - a curling iron, a straightener... they were probably Jenny's. Actually, that was an idea. He closed his eyes and focused on Jenny. He pictured her as she was in her Facebook profile picture, mid-jump while somewhere on her college campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt his skin begin to tingle as a chill ran down his spine. A strange, crawling sensation made its way up his legs and torso, then suddenly stopped. He opened his eyes, and turned to face the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...\" he stared at the mirror, seeing a perfect copy of his sister Jenny. Long brown hair, brown eyes, athletic figure, wearing a sky-blue tank top, grey short shorts and white sneakers. Exactly what she had been wearing in her Facebook profile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so cool! I'm Jenny!\" Jack stuck out his tongue, imitating one of Jenny's habits she had retained from her younger years. Then, he had an idea. \"Hmmm...\"</span></div></div>",

And how to prank him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack watched the mirror as an evil smile formed on Jenny's face. Then, he closed his eyes and focused again. His skin began to tingle again, and his head began to spin slightly. After a few seconds when the minor discomfort went away, he opened his eyes. Staring back at him from the mirror was none other than Alex's girlfriend Kelly. Short, kind of flat chested, with shoulder length blonde hair and blue eyes, wearing her usual outfit of a small black t-shirt and skinny jeans. Jack put his hand on his hip, feeling the material of the jeans. It felt pretty real...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaalex...\" he said, copying the way Kelly would get his friend's attention, putting on a pouty facial expression and sticking his hips out, showing off Kelly's ass. She didn't usually draw attention to her body like that, Jack was just having fun. But, he thought, she definitely looked sexy doing that. Then, he winked at himself, grinned ear to ear, and slapped his own - Kelly's - ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, I bet Alex has fun with you...\" Jack mused, then stood facing the mirror again. \"But...\"</span></div></div>",

Jack made a vomiting gesture, laughing out loud at watching the Kelly in the mirror. \"Who next...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack closed his eyes and began to think. Who did he want to transform into? Hm. That was an idea. He focused on a photo from last year's yearbook, when the football team had taken first place in the district competition. In particular, the cheerleaders on the sideline...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe familiar tingle came and went, and he opened his eyes to find the head cheerleader staring back out of the mirror. Tall, blonde with striking blue eyes, wearing a sleeveless red and gold cheerleader outfit that hugged her moderately curvy body and stopped not much past her waist, Melissa Robinson was a total hottie and the envy of many people at the school. A lot of the girls wanted to be her - head cheerleader, very talented and athletic, dating the star quarterback, had an amazing body, got straight As, and was from a rich family. Pretty much every guy in school had at least once fantasized about taking her to bed, and Jack wasn't exactly ashamed of being one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright smile on his face, reflected in the mirror as Melissa enthusiastically grinning, Jack waved his arms around. He had been too busy admiring his reflection he had only just registered the silly pompoms that he was holding in each hand. Then, with a sly smile, he jumped in the air, hands and feet out, and screamed \"Gimme an L!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe start of the support routine that everyone thought was stupid, but none of the guys really complained. Jack continued to jump around, loving the feeling of Melissa's fit and very well maintained body as he did so. He also... paid close attention to his reflection, where Melissa's hair and breasts were bobbing up and down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woohoooo!\" Jack yelled as he landed in the splits, outfit slightly rising up as he did. That was one of the things that not many people could do, even on the cheerleading squad. He felt the cold tile floor of the bathroom on his body's bare thighs, and for the first time became very aware that there was nothing between his legs. Then again, he hadn't really been expecting anything since he was transforming into girls one after the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up, caught his breath, and looked at his reflection. Melissa was really hot, and her body was a lot of fun - so fit, he could jump and dance around for hours and probably not get tired.</span></div></div>",

Again, he felt his skin tingle, and everything that was clothed itched as if wool was being pulled over it. And again, after a few seconds, it stopped. Jack opened his eyes and looked at his reflection. He smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring back was Sarah Saunders, the girl he had had a crush on for the better part of two years. Brown hair that went just past her shoulders, brown eyes, and a slim yet amazingly curvy body. Wearing a tight-fitting red shirt and very short, very tight black shorts, Sarah was in her volleyball gear and had a dreamy look in her eyes. It was very similar to the look Jack got if he stared at her for too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up straight, feeling the soft fabric of the shirt brush against his belly, and walked closer to the mirror. He loved watching Sarah walk, and now he had his own private viewing, so to speak. He noticed the reflection didn't move her hips very much as she walked forward - despite having reasonably wide hips and a very well-rounded ass. Must be the fact that it was Jack controlling her movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack reached out and put one of Sarah's slim hands on the cold glass of the mirror, watching her reflection mimic his action. He put the other hand to his face, feeling the smooth contours of Sarah's cheek and nose. He pressed a finger to her soft lips, then took another step closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding so close to the mirror that he could see every pore on her beautiful face, Jack gazed into the eyes of his reflection. He leaned forward just a little bit more, and felt his chest come in contact with the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack...\" he breathed, just to hear what it would sound like if Sarah said that. It came out with perhaps more longing than he had hoped, and he loved the sound of it. Maybe he could stay as Sarah for a bit?</span></div></div>",

Yes, he did have a crush on her, but it almost felt like he was betraying her by turning into a copy of her and having his fun. So, he had to change. But into whom? He had already spent a few minutes as his sister, as well as a couple of people from school. Speaking of school... he had only transformed into people his own age so far. What about some of the teachers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had the perfect person in mind. Stepping back from the mirror, Jack gave one last look at Sarah's reflection, then closed his eyes. The familiar tingling covered his body once more, and disappears as quickly as it came. Opening his eyes, Jack beheld the sight of his English teacher, Ms. Karen Robertson. Ms. Robertson was in her early thirties, but in very good shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack eyed his reflection. Brown hair tied up in a bun, blue-grey eyes behind thin glasses. A white button-up shirt, a black jacket with a matching black tube skirt, and black flats. The real reason Jack had thought about Ms. Robertson, though - under her white shirt were a massive pair of tits. Like, Es at least. They were the source of many lewd comments among the male student population, but it didn't seem to bother Ms. Robinson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay class.\" Jack imitated Ms. Robinson's tone, and leaned over towards the mirror. Her shirt was buttoned to the very top, so her massive breasts stayed out of sight. Then, with a cheeky smile on his face, he began to undo the buttons on the shirt he was wearing. Just the first few, enough to get some air. Then, he leaned over again. This time, Ms. Robertson's glorious cleavage was much more on display, the globes visibly pushing together and nearly spilling out of the shirt that they were encased in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm\" Jack hummed to himself. \"Maybe Ms. Robertson should teach something <i>other </i>than English, for once...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an evil smile on his face, he straightened out and cupped the breasts hanging off his chest. They were soft, pleasant and rather heavy. Giving them a good squeeze, he moaned slightly. \"Oh, I think it'll be a great class...\"</span></div></div>",

But you've been Kelly - who I'll admit is a bit scrawny, but she's cute. That cheerleader from your school. Her body was fantastic, I haven't seen a human with a body like that for centuries... and yet you just jump around a bit and stop. Then Sarah. The girl you're practically in love with. She's hot, and you had a chance to get to know her the way no one else in the world ever can. Yet you decided not to. Then the body you're in now. Not as young, but it seems guys these days like a good pair of tits. This woman has quite the pair, I have to admit. You were going to have a nice private education session, but then you stop that too! Are you afraid or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uhh... I don't feel right just yet\" Jack mumbled, off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my body, you know. You're in control right now but I also feel everything you're doing.

I'll look into your memories and pick out someone you haven't thought of yet... and you'll get to feel everything too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack hadn't thought of it that way. Maybe he could let Lilith have some fun, and then he could go back to doing what he was before? He hadn't actually thought about pleasuring himself while in someone else's body, now that he had the chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.\" Jack said, having decided.</span></div></div>",

In fact, he'd already been one sister so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the now familiar skin tingle and head spinning as everything rearranged itself. Staring back at him, dressed in jeans and a baggy hoody, was his younger sister Samantha. \"Ah, I suppose I was wrong about the family,\" Lilith stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" Jack said in perfect imitation of his sister's dismissive and flippant attitude. But as he looked in the mirror he noticed something: he never realized how cute she was. Her eyes, her lips, her whole face. Why was she always dressed in these unflattering clothes? \"Hey Lilith,\" he calls out, \"I don't have to change everything do I? If I wanted to change just clothes I can do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Master,\" the succubus replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack concentrated and suddenly the clothes morphed into a loose, long shirt and pair of yoga pants. The same outfit he'd seen his sister in earlier. Yeah, this was much better. He liked the tight feeling of the pants especially on his legs and butt. But what if...? He made another change, this time into the shorts and camisole she usually wore to bed. Man she was cute, why hadn't he noticed it before? With another change he was now in a two-piece bikini. This really set him off and out of curiosity he raised a hand up and grabbed at a breast, taken aback by the sensitivity of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was feeling more and more... \"Hey what's going on,\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well even though I'm not completely in control it's still my body, Master,\" Lilith said. \"So I did a little trick tying my libido to yours. Every time you change, you get a little hornier. You're going to have to relieve it really soon. I'd say you have about two? Three? Four? Only a few more changes before it becomes unbearable and you'll pretty much be forced into relieving my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a few changes and with such an imprecise number? And what if he got caught in a shape he didn't want. Maybe he should just do it now, as Samantha. Samantha wouldn't know, she's in the other room texting her friends... her cute friends. Friends that you've maybe had a design on once or twice yourself. Yeah if you wanted to you could check them out as well.</span></div></div>",

Where Sam preferred large, baggy clothes, Lexie preferred tight and slightly revealing. Where Sam liked to go 'natural', Lexie would go full on with makeup. Yet, despite the outward differences, the two were close friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was still in some form of control, Jack began to focus on the image of Lexie in his mind, and felt the familiar tingle make its way across his mostly bare skin. The feeling subsided after a couple of seconds, and Jack opened his eyes. He looked in the mirror and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the mirror now showed Lexie, hungry smile on her face. Short and curvy, she had shoulder-length straight dirty blonde hair and brown eyes. Her large, D-cup breasts were only half covered by a beige tank top about a size too small, also exposing her midriff and pierced bellybutton. Her taut ass, wide hips and juicy thighs were encased in very tight, very short black bike shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack moved his hands along his now bare midriff and toyed with the waistband of the shorts he was in as he admired Lexie's form in the mirror. He let out a sensual moan as he cupped Lexie's ass. Now this was a body he could explore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a nice body, Master.\" Lilith commented, eager for him to start. Jack only moaned again in agreement.</span></div></div>",

His hair lengthened, straightened and became very dark. His face became rounder. The breasts shrunk but his thighs got a bit bigger. The clothes remained the same as they were something Jack had come up with and not something he'd seen on Lexie. His lips became plump and on his face appeared glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, who's she Master,\" asked Lilith in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was Melanie Chen, a girl who lived in the neighborhood and had been Sam's friend for a long time. She was a pretty Asian girl, thick without being fat, who Jack had seen many times. He rubbed his thighs and cupped his breasts which were, admittedly, smaller than Lexie's but stuffed into that tight shirt still looked bigger than they actually were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel himself getting wet and began rubbing himself through the shorts. \"Oh yes, Jack,\" he said trying to imitate Melanie, \"touch me however you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems you're almost there. Let me help you,\" Lilith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack, confused, felt her presence leave his head. A minute or two later the door opened and in walked Samantha, closing the door behind her with a wicked grin on his face. \"Sam,\" Jack exclaimed in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Melanie... Master,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilith,\" he exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct,\" Lilith-Sam giggled. \"I might not have my body but I do have my spirit so I had just enough power to make a jump into the nearest body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well get out,\" Jack declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cannot,\" she replied. \"Not until you do your thing. From the sounds of it you only have on transformation left anyway.\" With that Lilith-Sam walked over to you and grabbed you close, falling onto the bathroom floor. \"I can help you with that though. But I will warn you, once you pleasure my body it will be a release of energy so while it will be more powerful it will take a while to recharge. You will be stuck as you are as will I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What,\" Jack stated in shock. \"For how long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe a few hours, maybe a day. I do have much power that needs to be recharged.\"</span></div></div>",

Don't talk\" she whispered, and sat upright, mounting Jack. She reached a small hand down to Jack's hips and flicked the waistband of the tight shorts Jack was wearing. Her hand glided across Jack's smooth, bare midriff, causing Jack to let out a sharp breath of pleasure. Jack felt himself become even more wet as 'Sam' continued to tease him, reaching slightly into his shorts but not actually going anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, ahh... \" Jack moaned in pleasure, a high-pitched sound coming from Melanie's soft lips. He couldn't take it anymore - he was too horny. He reached a hand down to his shorts, but was caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-uh, Master. Not yet.\" 'Sam' said as she held his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnngh!\" Jack moaned and pulled 'Sam' in closer, free hand reaching behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally...\" 'Sam' whispered and collapsed onto Jack, sliding a hand under his shirt and fondling the breasts Jack was currently wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack grabbed the thin shirt 'Sam' was wearing and pulled it off in a frenzy, leaving it only hanging on the arm that was currently busy on his breasts. 'Sam' returned the favor and peeled the tight fabric of Jack's own shirt off, then pressed her exposed stomach to Jack's. The feeling of 'Sam''s warm flesh on Jack's own was intoxicating, and he reached behind her back to unclasp her bra. She let it fall free, and pulled him up to do the same to him. Their breasts pushed against each other, and Jack felt the wetness in his crotch building even further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sam' clearly sensed this, and smiled mischievously as she withdrew from their top-naked embrace to again begin teasing Jack's lower region. Jack shivered as 'Sam' reached into his waistband and caressed his skin, getting ever closer to his desperately waiting pussy. With one swift motion, 'Sam' pulled down Jack's shorts and panties, then reached a hand back and started...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh God, finally. Jack thought as he felt 'Sam''s delicate fingers run up and down the length of the moist slit between his legs. Waves of pleasure pulsated through his body, and he surrendered himself, leaning back and letting out a quiet moan. 'Sam' continued, teasing Jack's - Melanie's, technically - clit with her thumb as she continued to use her other fingers to caress the folds of Jack's pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Melanie, you really are wet...\" 'Sam' smirked. Then, with a pout and a suggestive tone she added \"I hope you do me next...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack continued to moan, sensual gasps coming from Melanie's lips as 'Sam' continued to finger him, pushing deep into Melanie's pussy. Jack's hands found their way to his breasts and he began to tease the nipples, heightening his body's sensitivity and compounding the pleasure he was feeling. \"Aahhh!!\" he squealed, as the pleasure built up to a point where he could no longer contain himself. 'Sam' pressed herself down onto him, breasts again covering Jack's, locking his hand in place, while her hand continued its work in Jack's crotch. She put her lips to Jack's neck and sucked, sending another shiver of pleasure through Jack's already excited body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack panted again, and felt an overwhelming wave of pure bliss emanate through his entire form, and an explosion of pleasure from his nethers. He lay there, naked on the bathroom floor, basking in the afterglow of his first female orgasm. He looked at 'Sam', topless, small pert breasts at attention, now sitting on him in just her yoga pants, suggestively licking her fingers as she withdrew them from Jack's pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn?\" she asked, laid down on Jack, and pulled them around such that Jack was now on top of her. Jack, despite his orgasm, still felt horny. </span></div></div>",

He closed his eyes and tried to focus. The familiar tingling sensation came again, but then 'Sam' touched him down there again, and his concentration broke. He looked up, and 'Sam' was smiling innocently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely able to contain the fire building in his loins - he needed relief, and <i>fast</i> - Jack tried one last time to focus. 'Sam' tweaked his breasts, sending a burst of pleasure arcing through his entire body. He still tried to focus through it, frustrated and very horny, and felt the tingling sensation once again pass through his body. This time, though, it was much stronger than usual. As the sensation spread through his entire body, he slowly felt himself go numb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling returned and he felt himself collapse onto his hands and knees, nearly hitting the floor of the bathroom with his face. But something felt strange. He wasn't quite as horny as he was before. Sure, some residual feeling remained, but he didn't feel <i>wet</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah..\" Jack panted, opening his eyes, and saw the bathroom floor just inches from his face. But, he didn't see anyone else in the room. He turned around, and saw Sam in the mirror. Only Sam. \"Huh? Wait...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he spoke, Jack saw Sam's reflection mouth the exact same words. He looked down at himself, and saw the same loose-fitting shirt and grey yoga pants Sam had been wearing. He ran his hands down his torso, and watched as the reflection did the same. He was definitely in Sam's body, but where was Lilith?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to close his eyes and concentrate on transforming again, but nothing happened. What if he was in the <i>real</i> Sam's body? If that was the case, what had happened to Lilith? What would happen to Sam? Jack sighed, and got up. This was the third time he'd been one of his sisters today, but this was completely different. This was actually his sister's real body. Or it felt like it was, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

Taking longer than he thought it should, Jack decides to try clearing his head with a bit of water. Turning on the nearby facet, and cupping his hands together to form a bowl, Jack fills his hands, then brings 'his' face close enough to splash the water on it. The shock and pleasant feel of the cool water jars loose his disoriented thinking, and Jack finally put all the facts together...or he thinks he has at least?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0'Firstly, trying to preform a shift while super horny and distracted is dangerous.... not doing that again until I can talk to Lilith about it,' Jack thinks, starting to list off his theory of what happened. 'Secondly, I felt a numb sensation, and Lilith disappeared after said sensation ended, and i was not feeling as horny or excited after either. Lastly, Lilith's disappearance and silence could mean either i somehow ended up possessing her, or pissed her off with my stubbornness of keeping on with the shifting,' Jack concluded, wondering if he could mentally contact Lilith somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0'I have to say Master -or should it be Mistress now? - While overly annoyed that you kept trying to shift, it wasn't my intention to disappear, but the results of your actions,' Lilith states, her voice sounding slightly distant, and yet close by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\" What do you mean Lilith?\" Jack asks aloud, looking around, and only seeing himself in the mirror, talking to empty space apparently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0'Well Mistress, most of my bodies powers are based on Will, Lust, and energy. All of those are hard to manipulate, especially if someone is distracting you, even more so if they are trying to give you an orgasm, and you keep ignoring them!' Lilith states, sounding particularly peeved near the end of her statement. Again, Jack looks around, and still isn't seeing her, until looking at the mirror, yet again, he sees a flash of pink flit across 'his' eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0'Ahh, finally figured it out Mistress? Yes, your botched transformation attempted forced you to possess me while I was in Samantha. To make things worse, you used up all your current energy, and nearly all of my reserves. Apparently, only enough energy is left to sustain communication, and that wont last long unless we both rest, or are able to siphon some off through lustful acts with others.' Lilith states, sounding even more annoyed after mentioning his blunder costing her reserves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Gulping, and with some trepidation, Jack voices his concern now that he has some idea of how bad he messed up. \"Um, not to be an ass Lilith, and i do apologize for using your energy, but how long till either of us is \"recharged\", \" Jack asks, hoping the answer is positive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0His hopes are dashed just as quickly by Lilith's response. 'Dammit, Mistress, while I don't mind adventure, your stubbornness just cost us 72 hours of waiting, unless your willing to set aside your morals and go find someone to fuck, maybe more than one depending on how fast you want out of this mess,' Lilith states, sounding highly annoyed by Jacks question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0A lump forms in Jacks throat, mostly because he just contemplated if he knew anyone he could have sex with to speed up the process. Shaking his head, he tries one last question, hoping it will turn out positive. \"What about masturbation Lilith? Would that speed up the process at all?\" Jack asks, nearly praying that her answer will be favorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0A burst of snide laughter dashes Jacks hopes, and Lilith's answer makes it only worse. 'Well sure, if by speeding up, you mean by about five minutes per orgasm, and then when you rub yourself raw, your magic will drain to try to heal yourself, now that its active, then yeah, it will totally speed up the wait time,\" Lilith responds in a condescending tone. Jack can't exactly blame her, since even he could admit he screwed up here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm sorry Lilith, for being stubborn, and also not even returning the favor of trying to give you pleasure too,\" Jack apologizes, while trying to figure out if he should wait out the 3 days, or find someone to have sex with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

His mother had just walked out the door. His father was away on business. His older sister was... somewhere, probably with her friends. That left...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like it's gonna be Sam,\" thought Jack and made his way over to her room. As he walked, he barely noticed anything different about his body, despite the fact that it was obviously <i>very</i> different. \"Hey Lilith, why doesn't this feel weird? As in, your body\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... that's an interesting one, master\" Lilith replied, voice clear in Jack's head. \"It isn't <i>really</i> a real body, I guess. It can <i>feel</i> like one if you want it to, but you probably just won't notice anything unless you focus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that, Jack did notice a few oddities. The way his legs moved as he walked, for example. Arriving at Sam's door, he stopped. His sister was lying on her bed, facing the ceiling, legs crossed. She was staring at her phone, and was wearing a small black t-shirt, grey yoga pants and white socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm, she is a cutie isn't she?\" Lilith teased. Jack didn't respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how does this work? I mean shes... smaller than you.\" Jack questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you just call me fat?\" Lilith demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Of course not!\" Jack protested. \"Thats not what I meant, and you know it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know.\" Lilith laughed. \"Anyway, you just have to put yourself on top of her, and concentrate a little. You'll sink right in...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack awkwardly made his way over to Sam, crawled onto the bed, and placed himself next to her, except face down. Then, he rolled himself over in her direction...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and collided with her. Sam didn't even budge, yet he felt himself hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? I thought that was meant to work...\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to at least <i>imagine</i> not colliding with her, Master.\" Lilith explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack tried again, this time focusing on falling through her. The thought was silly, but he found himself slipping, rolling all the way onto his back until he was directly over where Sam was. He could see her hands above him, holding her phone and mashing on the keypad at an impressive speed. Momentarily distracted, Jack lost his focus, and felt a shiver run through his entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he felt himself holding a phone, which he dropped in alarm. Jack yelped as the phone hit him in the ribs, a high pitched sound he was pretty sure was outside even Lilith's usual range. Looking down at where the phone landed, Jack saw... a small black t-shirt with small breasts poking out, grey yoga pants hugging slim legs that were folded over at the knee, and white socks. He pulled himself up and shook his head as a large amount of blonde hair suddenly found its way into his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa\" he said, hearing a familiar voice escape his mouth that was neither his nor Lilith's. Jack pulled himself up off the bed, phone forgotten, and looked at a nearby bedside mirror. Staring back at him was the young, pretty face of his sister Samantha. \"I... I did it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes master, you did it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm Sam? Cool!\" Jack said in his sister's voice. \"This feels a bit different...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stood, he began to take note of many new sensations. The way his hair was longer, his body was much slimmer. The contours of the black shirt he now wore, and everything under it. Specifically, things he didn't usually have. The feeling of tight, even if not heavy, pants, and everything in them. Specifically, the lack of things he usually had. So this was what it felt like, going from a... spirit body to a real one. Being Sam, a high school freshman. Being Sam, a young teenage girl. The sensations he felt were almost overwhelming after being Lilith. And with new sensations came curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aahhhh\" he moaned. It was a sensory overload. There were so many things he wanted to do, so many things to try... to touch, to explore. But this was his <i>sister's</i> body he was in. It felt... wrong on so many levels. He figured he could either just try to calm down, get used to the feeling of having a real body again, or he could find and possess someone he had less moral dilemma with. But that did mean more effort.</span></div></div>",

It might take a few tries to get anywhere, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack does as instructed, and closes his eyes. Thinking of who he wants to 'try on', he focuses on a house he had driven past a few times with his mother. He opened his eyes, and found himself in front of a small, yet luxurious house not too far away. It belonged to a new friend of his mother's, a young woman named Lena Serlinkov. She was in her mid-late twenties with an amazingly curvy figure, perfectly proportioned, rather large breasts, and a sleek mane of bright red hair. Having recently arrived here from Russia, she didn't have too many friends, and was quite likely to be home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting himself inside, Jack began to wander around. He had never been in here before, he had only seen it the few times when his mother had asked him to drop her off after the yoga class she took with Lena. Jack couldn't find anyone inside, but the keys were at the front door. Surely, she was around somewhere. After walking around a little more, Jack heard the sound of running water. He followed it to a bedroom, into the master bath, and saw the source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena was taking a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect...\" Jack whispered, and walked closer. The glass of the shower was fogged out, but could just see the silhouette of a woman behind it. Phasing through the glass, he then beheld her up close and very personal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was washing her hair, eyes closed, water pouring down her face as her hands massaged her hair. Jack's attention quickly turned to the rest of her body. Her breasts were hanging free, and they were perfect. Just the right size for a woman of her build, not so big that they would seem fake, but definitely enough for any hands to be delighted. Her stomach was lightly toned, and right below were wide hips, a firm, curvaceous ass, and long, slender legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, great choice, Master! She's gorgeous!\" Lilith said. \"I have a feeling you're gonna enjoy her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack figured Lilith was right, and that it was time to get right to that. He focused on becoming transparent again, and stepped back into Lena. He dropped his focus, and <i>snapped </i>into her body. The first thing he noticed was the water, the hot stream of water rolling down his entire body. After that came the rest of the sensations he had felt in Sam's body, but heightened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the long, wet, heavy hair down his back, the breasts hanging on his chest... the pleasant tickling feeling of the water gently flowing down his new nipples. The feeling of again being much slimmer than he normally was, the wide hips, slender long legs, the gap between his thighs, and the lack of a manhood in that gap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaahhhh, feels so good.\" he moaned, in Lena's voice and in her accent. \"Oh, yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack began moving his new slim hands all over his new body. Washing could wait, he had exploring to do. Hands found their way to Lena's soft, sensitive breasts, and Jack stroked and squeezed. It was a very pleasant sensation, and he felt himself becoming very aware of a warmth between his... Lena's legs. One hand made its way down, enjoying the feeling of the toned abs he now had, and slapped Lena's ass. A loud crack echoed through the shower, and Jack smiled. It had felt good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm...\" Jack moaned, relishing in the sounds Lena was capable of making as his hand moved down the front of his body and began probing Lena's tight pussy. He stroked back and forth, pleasure building. Then, he had an idea. He took the shower nozzle and brought it down there as well. The water was warm, and it felt amazing. But still not quite enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved Lena's dainty fingers to her snatch and began to probe. Now THAT was much better. The back-and-forth of his fingers while the shower lightly sprayed elicited another moan, while the hand holding the shower began to slowly fiddle with the spray settings. He suddenly felt a large burst of pleasure. He had hit the massage function, and it was doing its job <i>very</i> well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack moved the shower head closer, and put his other hand back on Lena's breasts. He moaned again as the massage hit another spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaahhhhh, My Goooooddddd..\" he half screamed, half moaned in Lena's usually soft voice. The pleasure in his crotch had reached a climax, and he felt waves and waves of pure sexual satisfaction pulse throughout his entire borrowed body. He dropped the shower head and leaned forward, hair going in his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\" he panted. Deciding to still enjoy the shower, he put the shower head back in its place and stood under it, feeling the sensations of hot water running down his sexy, feminine curves. After what was probably an hour, he decided to finally turn off the water, dry off, and put on a bathrobe.</span></div></div>",

Does that mean that I can transform now?\" Jack asked, curious. It felt like he was talking to himself. And in a very weird way, he kind of was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, you could do that, Master...\" Lilith responded, almost disappointed. \"But I can do so much <i>more</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do I transform?\" Jack stubbornly asked. He was set on this for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close your eyes, picture who or what you want to transform into. The more detail, the better. Then imagine becoming that person.\" Lilith instructed. \"It gets a lot easier with time, and I can fill in the blanks for you for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack closed his eyes, and decided to go for something familiar. He focused on himself, as he was just before he had mysteriously ended up in Lilith's voluptuous form. He felt a strange sensation across his body, and felt himself shifting. After a couple of seconds, it was done. But something felt off. His pants were way too tight, and his shoes were way too small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, he saw he was still wearing Lilith's tank top, jeans and boots. His arms were bare, the tank top barely sitting over his torso. The jeans were painfully tight, cutting off blood flow to some rather important organs. And the boots were too thin, and a couple of sizes too small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the... how did this happen?\" Jack asked, confused. But at least in his own voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my... \" Lilith laughed, her voice still echoing in Jack's head. \"I've never seen that happen before... You must be very attached to the fact that your clothes aren't a part of you. Well, since you're me right now, what you're wearing now <i>is</i> a part of you. Try changing just the clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Jack focused on the clothes, and quickly found himself in a much more comfortable outfit of a loose t-shirt, baggy jeans and sneakers. Much better. \"So these clothes are <i>part</i> of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Technically, Master, since they're just made from the same energy that keeps me bound here. But they'll feel exactly as if they were real, and they'll even hang around for a bit if you take them off.\" She emphasized that last part, not really hiding the fact that she wanted Jack's activities to involve taking off his clothes, no matter which form he was in. It was definitely an interesting thought though, maybe something Jack could play with that later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for now, satisfied that he could easily control this particular power of Lilith's, Jack decided he wanted something more interesting to play with now. He began to focus again, this time remembering to not ignore his clothes. He felt the now familiar sensation of his body shifting, tingling, rearranging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's figure shortened and slimmed, and he felt his hair pushing outward. His clothes tightened over his shrinking form, and he felt some slight pressure as breasts emerged from his chest. Well, not really technically <i>his</i> anymore, Jack thought to himself, as he felt his pants constrict and hug his nethers with no resistance or bulges whatsoever. Within seconds, it was over, and Jack now stood in a new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilith, is there a way I can have a look at myself?\" Jack asked in a familiar voice. Not his own, not Lilith's, but nonetheless very familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, Master, let me conjure up something for you.\" Lilith's voice echoed in his head as a fine mist shimmered in front of him, forming what Jack figured would be a mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack reached for the mist, and found that his now slim and feminine hands passed right through it, but that it did seem to clear as he touched it. The mist continued to float, but Jack could now much more clearly see his reflection in front of him. He smiled, seeing that he had indeed managed to correctly shift into someone else. His reflection smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had become...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hmmmm\" Jack mused, in Sarah's voice. \"Let's see what I've got here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took his hands away from his breasts - that was a weird thought - and placed his hands on his hips. He gazed into the mirror, admiring his morph. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the hazy. yet somehow clear, mirror he saw Sarah. Long, brown hair, brown eyes, very pleasant-looking face. He smiled, and so did the Sarah in his reflection. He loved her smile, and being the one to control it made him feel a little turned on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sarah in his reflection was wearing a small black t-shirt which didn't quite hug her amazing figure, although it did emphasize her breasts quite a bit. Breasts that he had felt in both ways just seconds ago. He was looking forward to this. Her arms were slender, but toned from her volleyball practice, and she wasn't very tan, but wasn't pale either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack admired the reflection even more, seeing very tight black yoga pants which left absolutely nothing to the imagination and showed off Sarah's fantastic ass, as well as the sporty shape of her legs. She wasn't super tall, but she wasn't short either. Jack twisted slightly, giving himself a better view of Sarah's ass in the mirror. He spanked himself, feeling the tightness in her butt. She must really work out to have an ass as tight as that, Jack thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now I have it all to myself\" he said aloud, relishing in hearing Sarah's sexy voice utter such things. He gripped both cheeks in his feminine hands and moaned. \"Mmmmmm.. Oh that feels good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack began to lift up his t-shirt, glancing at Sarah's toned midriff in the mirror Lilith had made for him. She was in really good shape. A shape that he was going to very much enjoy for the next hour or so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther lifting up the shirt, and seeing some glorious underboob, Jack realized that the Sarah he had become wasn't actually wearing a bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well.\" Sarah's voice said, as Jack continued to lift up the shirt. A second of struggle as he pulled the shirt completely over his head, and he was left staring at a reflection of a completely topless Sarah. \"Wow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts were not too large, but very perky, and her nipples were standing erect. Jack lifted up his hands and massaged them, feeling a very intense and sensual tickling sensation as he did. He moaned as he slowly caressed his newfound breasts - a slow, erotic moan that he never imagined he would hear out of Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing to move his hands up and down his temporary body, paying extra attention to the breasts, Jack found his hands making their way down towards his waistline. He looked up at his reflection, and enjoyed the sight of Sarah, his crush, feeling herself up. The best part was that he was in control, and could feel everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting his subconscious direct his actions, he continued to stroke Sarah's firm breasts, and toned stomach, finally slipping a finger into his tight pants. Tracing a line just below his waist, he noticed that this form wasn't wearing any underwear, either. Not that he cared, he had Sarah's body all to himself and no lack of undergarments was going to delay his enjoyment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed his hand all the way down, and found Sarah's pussy. It was already quite moist, as he was rather turned on by the whole situation. He had never felt a pussy before, in any way, and now he was playing with <i>his own</i>. It was very strange, exciting and erotic all at the same time. He pushed his middle finger slightly in, and began to stroke. The feeling was indescribable. It was a kind of warmth that spread from his crotch. Not overwhelming, but very pleasant, and it only built up as he continued to massage Sarah's - <i>his</i> -  pussy with his finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching a point where he wanted more, he hooked his finger, and shoved it deep into his pussy. That feeling was a bit more intense. Moaning slightly, Jack took his pointing finger, and plunged both fingers in. And out. And in again. The feeling in his crotch was growing, and he began to feel a heat rise through his entire body. Glancing in the mirror, he saw the reflection of Sarah, red-faced, pants around her thighs, furiously fingering herself. Another sight he never thought he would see, but now he was living it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body reached climax. He let out one last, long, orgasmic moan, and sat down on his bed. Sarah's yoga pants were still partway down his legs, and he had worked up a light sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing...\" he panted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had fun, Master?\" Lilith's voice came calling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah..\" Jack replied in a breathy voice. Hearing Sarah talk, even if they were his words, was so hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to do now, hmm?\" Lilith asked. </span></div></div>",

She was quite short, cute, with shoulder length blonde hair and blue eyes. Jack smiled again, watching the Kelly in the mirror also smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, it really worked!\" Jack exclaimed, admiring his reflection. Kelly was wearing a tight pink tank top which hugged her B-cup breasts, and very tight, very short black shorts. Jack took a moment to appreciate Kelly's curves, her well-formed hips and tight ass. He put his hands on his hips, and made a pose. He watched as his reflection put her hands on her hips, pushed her breasts up and ass back. Jack spanked his ass. \"Mmmm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, Alex is one lucky bastard\" Jack thought, running his hands up and down his body - Kelly's body. He groped at his breasts, enjoying how firm they were.\"Definitely lucky. Although she could be a bit bigger in the chest department...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt very weird hearing Kelly's voice speaking about herself in third person, but Jack loved the fact that it was him doing the talking. Then he had an idea. He was still technically in Lilith's body, just transformed into Kelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his eyes, focused on his chest, and felt his tank top tighten. He looked in the mirror and saw Kelly, but now with much more generous C-cup breasts. She looked remarkably good after the 'upgrade'. He also noticed that he could see her nipples pressing through the shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I'm not wearing a bra?\" Jack muttered to himself as he cupped his now larger breasts. \"Wow, that's something I never thought I'd say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Master, did you think to morph on a bra?\" Lilith's voice echoed in his head. Then, laughing, added.\"Or any underwear, for that matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack paused. But then, he had to check. He moved his hands down, looked past his pink tank top and augmented breasts to the tight shorts he had on, and stuck his hand down his pants. Sure enough, there was no underwear. But he did feel an unfamiliar (but completely expected) emptiness where his dick used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh\" Jack squealed, Kelly's high pitched voice even surprising him a little. He pushed his hand further down and touched something magical. \"Oooooooooh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to have some fun, Master?\" Lilith suggested. \"I could make it more <i>interesting</i> for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack weighed his options. He was curious about the ... <i>finer</i> points of the body he was in, but he was also very excited about 'customizing' Kelly's form and having more fun that way.</span></div></div>",

Kelly's upgraded body, aroused expression on her face, stared back at him out of the smoky mirror Lilith had conjured up for him. And fittingly, too - Jack was very much turned on by his current body. A small moan escaped his mouth - a deeply sexual, feminine moan, from Kelly's lips - as Jack began rubbing the fabric of his tight shorts. He felt a pleasure rising in his crotch as he did - the shorts were very tight and thin, and he had already noticed he wasn't wearing underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh\" Jack moaned again, dainty hand massaging the empty nethers of the body he had morphed into, while another hand lifted a corner of the pink tank top and made its way to a large breast. Jack groped at his left breast, feeling its cushiony softness and letting out more moans as he became more and more turned on. By now he felt that his shorts were moist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved his right hand from the shorts slightly higher to the tank top, throwing it over his head with one smooth motion. A chill went over his now topless body, nipples standing on end and sending further tickles through his crotch. A glance in the mirror showed Kelly, flustered and blushing, completely topless. Her breasts, much larger than in reality, hung as two perky and glorious, gravity-defying orbs, nipples erect. Jack grabbed them with both hands, kneading them, as the feeling of pleasure built up in his crotch. He noticed that there was a wet stain on Kelly's shorts, now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of his hands slowly made its way down from his breasts, caressing his midriff, sneaking past his bellybutton, and into the waistline of his tiny shorts. He moved his hand around, grabbing a handful of Kelly's - <i>his</i> - taut ass, and let out another moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hnnnnng\" he moaned as he quickly relieved his body of the shorts they were wearing, leaving himself now completely naked. He stared into the reflection at Kelly's neat, clean-shaven little mound between her legs, and smiled. Now. it was going to get good. Returning one hand to his breasts and squeezing, his other made its way down to his moist, eagerly waiting pussy. When his finger first made contact with it, he felt a wave of pleasure unlike anything he had experienced so far go through his body. His knees buckled and a sharp breath escaped his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh yeah...\" he half-whispered, half-moaned as he used his index finger to rub along the length of his pussy, thumb teasing the clit. The pleasure was building, and he felt it was nearing its peak. He shoved two fingers deep into the inviting. soft warmth between his legs, and felt a wave of ecstasy rock his entire body. He let out a loud moan and began furiously pounding himself with his fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orgasm was intense. His head spun and vision swam as pure bliss emanated from a spot right above his groin and pulsed throughout his body. He found himself lying on his bed, breasts to the sky, panting in satisfaction. He admired his hand, now a sticky mess of fluids, with a weak smile on his face. Was this the kind of fun Kelly could have all the time? And a better question, was this something <i>he</i> could now do all the time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you enjoyed yourself, Master.\" Lilith's voice echoed out of nowhere. Jack could only pant, not having caught his breath yet. \"Did you want to have some more fun in my body now? I can do a bit more than transform, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As much fun as it was being Kelly, maybe he could do something different. \"What else <i>can</i> we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so many things, Master. Mind control, possession...

Jenny, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack made his way over to Jenny's room, making sure no one saw him. It would raise a lot of questions if someone did - why was Kelly here? Why was she naked? And what happened to her chest? Then, Lilith reminded him that he was invisible and that no one could see or hear him anyway. Opening the door to her room, he walked in to find her in front of her dresser, applying makeup for the party. She was dressed in tight jeans and a loose-fitting tank-top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how does this work, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, Master. Just walk up, and imagine slipping right into her. Once you're in, you're in control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, Jack thought. Let's give it a go. He crept up behind her, and slipped one arm into hers. Surprisingly, he felt no resistance. It just flowed right in. He tried to pull it back, and found he was dragging her arm with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuck?\" Jenny muttered, pulling her arm back. Jack, realizing how this was going to work, smiled and slowly pushed his right leg through hers. He felt a slight tingle as he took control. He swung around in front of her, careful to not accidentally touch any more of her, and bent forward. He took a step back, overlapping everything below the waist. He bent his - Jenny's - knees, causing her to let out a small whimper of alarm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to not torment his sister anymore, he stood up. His torso flowed into hers, as did his other arm and his head. He felt a <i>snap</i> as he fully took control, and found himself looking in the mirror at the tall, fit body of his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Jenny,\" he said in her voice. \"Let's go party!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked outside, where an Uber full of Jenny's friends was waiting to pick her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About time you made it!\" someone called out. \"Come on, get in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack got in the car, in the back seat. He looked at Jenny's friends, and smiled. Amelia, a short, very curvy blonde, was sitting there and wearing a tight white dress that barely went past her thighs and showed a good amount of her impressive cleavage. Marie, a tall girl with a thin figure and long black hair, was dressed in a tight blue shirt and short denim shorts. In the front was Lisa, a redhead wearing a loose-fitting light blue dress that flared out and went just past her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I could have some fun here... Or I could wait til the party.\" Jack thought. There would be a lot more people at the party, and Jenny's friends would be more conservative than a lot of people there.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hmm... \" Jack thought to himself as the driver took off. He sat on the right, overly conscious of the jeans constricting his inner thighs - although he had already technically been a girl for at least half an hour, it was still weird and foreign to him. He looked around, and wondered what other fun he could have before he got to the party. He didn't want to do anything funny in Jenny's body - she was his sister, after all, and that would be kind of fucked up. Her friends, though... not only were they hot, they weren't related to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of the backseat, right next to him, was Amelia. Her white dress hugged her generous curves in such a way that Jack began to have perverted ideas just looking at her. She would be a lot of fun, he thought. Come to think of it, all of Jenny's friends here would be fun in their own way - Marie was tall and slim, wearing a very tight top that hugged her small breasts and short denim shorts that didn't leave much to the imagination. Her long, bare legs were very appealing - Jack imagined himself running his hands up and down those legs, getting closer and closer to her shorts. Then in the front, although he couldn't see her very well through the seat, was Lisa. She was dressed a little more conservatively in a loose dress, but Jack still pictured himself getting under it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hey Lilith,</i>\" Jack asked, in his head. \"<i>What can we do here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I did mention a few things earlier, Master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I possess more than one person at a time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately no, Master. Your one soul can only be in one body at a time. There are two of us, so I could be possessing someone different than you, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an idea. And you also mentioned mind control? How does that work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a bit more complicated, Master. I can show you a bit later if you...\"</i> Lilith was cut off by the other girls talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Earth to Jenny! Wake up!\" Amelia was playfully shoving Jack in the shoulder. \"You're super zoned out, girl, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing. Just thinking, that's all\". Jack replied, mentally asking Lilith if she could 'deal with' Amelia for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what? C'mon, we're going to a sweet party. Get drunk, dance and maybe take a cute guy home.\" Amelia protested. Jack figured she would be into that - she was dressed rather provocatively. Why not use it to have fun? <i>And why couldn't Jack use her to have fun?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith seemed to understand where his thought process was going, and took control for a second. Jack felt his hand move, gripping Amelia's tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heyy...\" Amelia started to say, then went silent, and Jack felt his senses fade. His senses came to, and he found himself sitting in the middle of a backseat. He felt slightly different, too. His clothes were tighter, and he felt the cool air conditioning of the car cover his bare legs and up his... dress? He knew what had happened. Lilith had shoved him into Amelia's body. He looked down at himself and caught sight of Amelia's ample cleavage, barely contained in a white lace bra and her white dress. He gave them a quick squeeze and smiled, letting out a small whisper of pleasure. \"Oh yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, Amelia...\" Marie said from next to Jack, and rolled her eyes. \"Do you have to do that here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just checkin' out the goods, girl\" Jack said, perfectly imitating Amelia's promiscuous tone. He was having a lot more fun as Amelia than he had as Jenny. Plus, her body just felt <i>better</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Thanks Lilith,\"</i> Jack thought. He heard his reply from a bit farther away than before. Lilith, it seemed, was still in Jenny's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You're welcome, Master. I figured you'd appreciate her more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. So can we...\"</i></span></div></div>",

Try out that mind control stuff you mentioned earlier?\"</i> Jack asked, excited to be in such a sexy and awesome feeling body, and getting to explore his new powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<i>\"We can try master, but it will mostly depend on your desired outcome, as well as your energy and power level.\"</i> Lilith responds, while turning her head to catch Jack's eyes. Getting the hint, Jack turns his head slightly, to get a better look at 'Jenny', and feels a sudden spike of lust shoot through his body. Shocked by this sudden feeling, Jack stills, holding in the urge to moan and plant his hands on his body to produce more sensations like he had just felt. Shuddering, and trying not to draw attention to it, Jack looks 'Jenny' in the eye again, and focuses on sending Lilith a query.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<i>\"Would be kind of stupid not to guess this, but that was you causing the sudden lust, wasn't it Lilith? Also, what do you mean about desired outcomes and such,\"</i> Jack asks, subtly readjusting himself in his seat. Smirking, 'Jenny' breaks eye contact, and starts to speak to Lisa in the front seat, while also maintaining there mental chat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<i>\"Of course Master, I figured a simple demonstration of the subject could give you an idea of what mind control entails. To go further into detail, Mind Control can either be subtle, or overt. Both are self-explanatory, but what I just did to you would fall under both technically as well. I desired to control you into getting aroused, in order to facilitate my desire of sex. It's subtle, because if you didn't know that I did it, you would dismiss the idea as overt, and could be guided towards my goal through Pavlovian conditioning, albeit on a small scale. It was overt, because I forced my desire and put power behind it to influence you directly.\"</i> Lilith lectures, all the while chatting about some boys that 'Jenny' had seen acting obnoxious at the mall the other day apparently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Considering what Lilith has said, Jack works out that Mind Control is more than just making someone do what you want, as it can be either robotic, or subtle and leave a person either wanting or believing whatever the end goal as their own. Shocked, and slightly aroused by where these thoughts lead to, Jack shudders again, and then snaps his mind back to the quandary of Mind Control. Breaking it down more, Jack concludes that Lilith meant about energy expending as just that, she spent energy - I really need to ask how that's measured, Jack muses randomly. - The more energy spent, the more power would be behind the control, and the power level would probably indicate either the amount of energy one would have to channel into it, the stronger it could be, but inversely, one who is good at action, could spend less energy more effectively....or maybe he had that wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack is snapped out of his deep speculation by another spike of arousal lancing through his body, starting at his pussy, and shooting throughout his body and ending in his breasts, which suddenly ache with need. Locking up, so as not to give away what is going on, Jack fights to control his reactions, and succeeds, if barely. After calming down from Lilith's latest demonstration, Jack looks over at 'Jenny', who glances back with a sly smirk on her face, and continues her conversation without seeming distracted or stressed. Impressed that she's able to seamlessly mimic Jenny, keep a mental explanation on Mind Control, and give 'demonstrations' all without showing an outward sign, Jack mentally wonders what else she could do if she tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<i>\"Lots of things Master, we'll have to explore that train of thought later though, if you want to finish learning more about mind control.\"</i> Lilith responds to Jack's thought 'might want to add mind reading as well?', and continues on her lecture from before his impromptu self-reflective moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<i>\"As I had been explaining, Mind Control is more complicated depending on what you wish to have as the outcome. You could have all the girls here act out a lewd fantasy against their will, but depending on how one goes about it, it will either look like robots going through the motions, or an erotic act that one can enjoy and appreciate. Right now, you would probably be able to do some subtle manipulations throughout the night, before running out of energy and need to recharge, or maybe one controlled action that would last until tomorrow night at the latest, depending on how you go about it.\"</i> Lilith finishes, ending her conversation with Lisa, and settling down to look out the window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Considering what he's heard so far, Jack wonders if he should have fun with subtlety, or try a major manipulation, especially as it sounds like he'll have to rest before trying anything else if he goes for direct control. Coming to a decision, Jack chooses to ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span><br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

He was excited to experience the perks of Lilith's morphing powers a bit more than he was to simply <i>play</i> with his new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack focused, and felt a light tingle as something covered his chest and crotch. He peeked down into his pants and saw that he was successful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you go just with that, Master?\" Lilith asked, curious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" Jack said, surprised he could make Kelly sound that mischievous, \"you're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack focused again, and watched in the mirror as Kelly's tank top and shorts fade away into nothing. All that was left was a set of black, sheer, lace lingerie. He looked in the mirror, and winked. His reflection, the blonde, sexy lingerie-clad Kelly, winked back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Jack whispered, caressing his body, keeping one eye on the mirror to watch the whole thing as a spectator as well as feeling it out. \"I didn't realize Kelly could be so hot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you didn't realize <i>you</i> could be so hot, Master.\" Lilith chimed in. \"This is <i>your</i> body right now, not Kelly's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus,\" Lilith continued, and Jack felt his hands move up to and cup his breasts, and a long, erotic moan escape his mouth. He didn't do it, and found that he couldn't quite control his body anymore. \"I don't think <i>Kelly</i> has tits like this. Alright, back to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack found he had control of his body again, and, since his hands were already there, decided to squeeze his breasts for good measure. Then he looked in the mirror again. The lingerie was sexy, but he wanted more. So he focused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lingerie shrunk slightly, and soon Jack found himself staring at a reflection of Kelly wearing a small black bikini. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we go swimming?\" Jack said innocently, posing. His reflection - slim, short, pale, blonde haired, blue eyed Kelly - mirrored his movement. \"Hmm, that''s an idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing again, he felt a tingle move through his legs. He watched his reflection as Kelly's legs stretched out, becoming longer while keeping their already sexy tone. He now stood a couple of inches taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else can I do... I'm tall, have an awesome rack...\" Jack spoke in Kelly's voice, admiring his - Kelly's - figure in the mirror. Long, slim, sexy legs ... \"That's it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack admired himself again in the mirror, watching as Kelly's hips slightly widened and her ass tightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better!\" Jack exclaimed, checking out his new ass in the mirror. It helped that he was only wearing that tiny bikini. \"But what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe actually go swimming with that hot new body of yours, Master?\" Lilith suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But won't people recognize me as Kelly?\" Jack asked. Lilith sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're serious. You just made all those changes to yourself and you're concerned people will recognize you as Kelly.\" Lilith responded flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Right. Umm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good idea, Jack thought. Take this body to the pool, have some fun... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr he could keep doing what he was doing before. He never thought he'd like this kind of thing, but having the ultimate game of dress-up, with himself <i>as whoever he wanted</i> was ridiculously entertaining. And sexy, he thought, looking at the mirror at the taller, ultra-feminized Kelly he had transformed himself into.</span></div></div>",

I'm having so much fun.\" Jack said, enjoying Kelly's voice, and glancing at himself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what's next, Master?\" Lilith inquired. \"Trying on more outfits? Or do you want to have some <i>real</i> fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack focused, and watched in the mirror as knee-high white socks appeared over Kelly's - his -  legs. The bikini bottom he was wearing became a ruffled blue and white miniskirt, and the bikini top became a tight-fitting tank top that exposed a large amount of midriff. His hair, previously shoulder-length and free-flowing, grew out and split into twin ponytails. Jack had \"put on\" a cheerleader outfit, and boy did it look hot on Kelly's improved body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this a fantasy of yours, Master?\" asked Lilith, very slight hint of annoyance in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just experimenting.\" Jack replied, moving about and admiring how the clothes moved and accentuated Kelly's long, toned, sexy legs. He kicked up a leg, and was impressed that he managed to almost reach his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also noticed, as he saw a tight, clean-shaven pussy in the mirror, that he had again forgotten to morph any kind of underwear. He focused quickly, and remedied the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I'm so flexible...\" Jack whispered in Kelly's soft voice, and did the splits. \"I've never been able to do that before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of the perks of being a shapeshifter. Normal body limitations don't really exist...\" Lilith said pointedly. \"Know what else is fun about being a shapeshifter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going out becomes so much more fun?\" Jack asked, quickly morphing his clothes again. Now, his reflection showed the modified Kelly, hair still long but not tied up anymore, in a small dress that hugged her curvy, sexy form. The dress was low-cut, exposing a healthy amount of cleavage, tucked sharp under her breasts to emphasize her slim, toned stomach and curvy hips. It ended at mid-calf, sticking right to her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack walked, barefoot again, shaking his hips slightly as he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel so <i>sexy</i>!\" he exclaimed. Then he stopped walking. But he wasn't in control anymore. It seemed Lilith had taken control of her body from Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Master, but I have to do this.\" she said. \"It's for your own good, and I promise you'll enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do what, exactly?\" Jack thought, since he no longer had control over Kelly's vocal chords. He heard his own voice for the first time in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give you some <i>pleasure</i>, Master.\" Lilith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I was getting to that...\" Jack complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too slowly. Plus you <i>have</i> to try this...\" Lilith continued. \"After that, I'll give you back control of my body and you can do whatever it was you were having so much fun with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack considered that. Maybe it would be fun. Or maybe it would be weird. And then another thing. This was Lilith's body he had been in. Where was his?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack felt his hand begin to move. It moved from his hips, caressing the sexy body he was in. He saw that he was now facing the mirror, and was watching the whole thing. It was strangely, and extremely, arousing. He was a passenger in the body of an incredibly sexy woman, and she was feeling herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was he thinking about his body again? Oh yeah. If this was Lilith's body, then his was still around. What if he were to... use his body to get to know this one?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack felt a moan escape his mouth as his hands reached his breasts and squeezed. That hadn't felt that good before... had it?</span></div></div>",

Are you enjoying my playtime?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering if you could put me back in my body for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Lilith paused, disappointed. Then spoke again in Kelly's voice. \"But don't you want to experience what my body can do...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What it can do <i>to me</i>, yeah.\" Jack replied, an idea forming in his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's not the same...\" Lilith complained, still speaking out loud. \"But at least it's on the right track, Master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please?

Alright, we have a deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack felt himself get a bit dizzy as his eyesight blurred. The last thing he felt was one last squeeze on his breasts, then he blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe awoke seconds later on his bed, in his original body. He looked up to see the foggy mirror was still there, and that Lilith was still standing there, still in Kelly's body. She was squeezing her breasts and looked very content with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Master.\" Kelly said, and walked up to Jack and leaned over. \"Do you <i>want</i> me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack gulped. He had not expected such a blatant approach so quickly. He felt his cock hardening as Kelly grabbed him by the shoulders and lifted him from the bed onto his feet. Then, she let him go and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take the dress off.\" Kelly commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack, not really in a mood to disagree, reached to the zipper. He pulled it down, revealing perfectly toned, slim shoulder blades and - Jack noted - no bra strap. He carefully pulled the dress down around Kelly's arms, touching his nose to her back and cupping her breasts in his hands. It was the first time he had felt them from outside her body, Jack realized. They were very firm, despite their size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, don't get distracted...\" Kelly teased and pulled her dress down all the way, stepping out of it. Jack beheld her perfectly shaped ass in full naked glory as she bent over, and slapped it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, someone's being naughty...\" Kelly said. \"I like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around, facing Jack. He just stared at her breasts, then finally noticing the hungry look in her eyes, quickly discarded his shirt and pants, pulling both pants and underwear off in one fell swoop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, how do you want me...\" Kelly asked seductively, hands on hips as she flaunted her perfect body. Jack gulped again. He was getting increasingly turned on, his cock now rock hard and at full attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly walked up to the bed, hips swaying in a confident manner that only the hottest of women can pull off, and bent over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, come to me...\" she said, legs spread and ass pointing upward. Her back arched in such a way that her head was still facing forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack, eager to comply, ran up to her, grabbed her by the hips, and thrust his pulsing member deep into her waiting pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling was indescribable. He had never had sex before, but he had masturbated before. Multiple times even to Kelly. But he just hadn't expected the warmth. The all-encompassing warmth he felt as he thrust over and over and over again. He felt the pressure build in his cock as Kelly moaned. He felt the warmth spread from his crotch to his legs and arms, a tingling sensation that kept building until the pleasure was almost unbearable. In one final burst of pure ecstasy, he felt himself come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck, yes!\" Kelly screamed. Jack, spent, flops over onto Kelly's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he hears Lilith's voice. \"You happy, Master? That was quite amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Jack panted, not able to form words properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, do you remember our deal?\" Lilith asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Ahh.\" Jack panted again, and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's have some more fun now then, shall we?\" Lilith said in a mischievous tone.</span></div></div>",

He didn't get to finish his sentence as he fell right into Lilith. Her body - now a little transparent - enveloped Jack, and he felt himself losing control of his body. It didn't really last too long, and soon his felt his face smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On?\" he felt and heard his voice finish. Then Lilith's voice echoed in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Master, I'm going to be running the show for a little bit. Don't worry, I won't do anything bad or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean\"?

This is, after all, supposed to be a learning experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat could be interesting, thought Jack. What would she show him, though?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But first, Master, let's go to bed. It is late.\" Lilith said. With that, Lilith moved Jack's body, turned out his light and went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Lilith followed Jack's normal morning routine pretty much perfectly. Got up, showered, got dressed, had breakfast, exchanged pleasantries with his family, and got on the bus to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing yet?\" Jack asked, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, I have something more fun in mind.\" Lilith responded. \"See, I got a good read on your memories and personality while we slept. It'll be an interesting day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith continued to pilot Jack throughout the school day, still following everything as normal. The only difference that Jack noticed was that he was getting more glances than usual from the female population of the school. Or maybe he was just more aware since he didn't actually have to pay attention to anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole day passed more or less uneventfully, until he was heading back to his bus stop. He heard a voice calling him. A girl's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around and saw one of the girls in his year level, walking up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it?</span></div></div>",

Or rather, Lilith said, as she was still in control. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked a lot more tired than she should have, but still pretty. Even in school uniform, she was still hot. Tall, slim and fit, with a tight ass and relatively small breasts, she was every inch head cheerleader. Her blonde hair was tied back in a simple ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you... \" Melissa said, fidgeting slightly. \"I mean, can you help me out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(With what?) Jack thought. She had never spoken to him before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! What do you need?\" Lilith answered for Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... come with me.\" Melissa said, still acting a bit strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What's up with her?) Jack asked, reaching out to Lilith. (Did you do anything to her?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Nope, I didn't do anything to her, Master). Then, in a more mischievous tone, (Not yet, anyway)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack decided to just leave it be as he, under Lilith's direction, followed Melissa a few blocks away from the school and up to the front door of a house. Melissa pulled out some keys from her bag, opened the door, and ushered Jack inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't just stand there!\" she whispered, as he stepped inside. Then, she slammed the door shut. \"But try to be quiet, my brother is home. But he's probably just playing games anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe proceeded to drag Jack and Lilith up to what Jack figured was her room, and then shut that door too. Then she started talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I broke up with Shaun last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat explains why she looked tired, Jack thought. But not what he was doing here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Oh really, Master, are you that dense?) Lilith said. (Shaun Gregory. Star of the football team. Also happens to dislike you.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack started putting two and two together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(His now-ex girlfriend suddenly finds you a lot hotter, then remembers how much he hated you. So she brings you up here.) Lilith continued. (And yes, that is related to me but it's because of the power of the book. I didn't actually do anything to her.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(So - and this is sounding more and more like a porno) Jack said. (I'm here for rebound sex? She wants to get back at Shaun by fucking the guy he picks whenever he can?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Bingo, Master).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack felt himself walking towards Melissa and giving her a hug. A hug that she quickly pulled out of. Then, she grabbed him by the collar and pulled him into a passionate kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack enjoyed the feeling as his hands, piloted by the experienced mind of Lilith, started caressing Melissa's body. As she began to pull off Jack's shirt, he heard Lilith's cheerful voice in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(And now for the fun part!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's vision began to swim, but it didn't seem to affect Lilith at all. His shirt came off, and he felt a numbness spread throughout his entire body. Then it stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing Jack saw was... himself, topless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha... \" he said, and noticed that first of all, he had control of his body again. Second, that his voice wasn't his own. And third, that his <i>body</i> wasn't his own. \"What the fuck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was in Melissa's body, still in school uniform, and feeling rather horny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bit of a shock?\" he heard his own voice ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bit?\" he asked, startled. \"Understatement of the fucking century.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if it's a <i>fucking</i> century you want, <i>Melissa</i>, then you certainly won't be disappointed...\" Lilith replied from Jack's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack felt an increasingly warm feeling from his crotch. Melissa must have been quite horny before he got dropped in her body. Adding his excitement after realizing he was about to fuck her, he was kind of sharing the sentiment. But this was just weird. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at himself, and saw Melissa's button-up school shirt covering her small breasts, an almost-knee-high skirt, and black stockings. Even from this angle, her legs were damn fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get you out of that uniform, it'll be more comfortable.\" he heard his own body say, as Lilith walked up and began unbuttoning his shirt. He didn't oppose, but instead found himself staring at the bulge forming in Lilith's - his old - pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shirt dropped to the ground, and he saw a simple black bra encasing Melissa's breasts. Jack, of course, brought his hands up to grab a feel. They were very firm, and the nipples were quite sensitive. Meanwhile, Lilith undid the clasp, and Jack soon found himself discarding the bra and looking at Melissa Robinson, head cheerleader, topless in her full-length mirror. He noted the confused look in her reflection, and tried to smile. It didn't turn out any less confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith quickly unclipped his skirt, leaving him in Melissa's body wearing only full-length black stockings and panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll leave those to you...\" Lilith said as she started removing what remained of the clothes Jack's body was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack, getting more and more turned on, pulled off his stockings and panties, getting a good look at the pussy of the head cheerleader. The pussy that was currently <i>between his own legs</i>. He reached down and drew a line across it with his index finger, letting out a surprised moan from the pleasure he felt. His body was <i>really</i> horny right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up and saw his original body, fully naked, cock erect, and felt a tingle run through his entire body. He couldn't take it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck me.\" he whispered, jumping onto the bed and spreading his legs. \"Fuck me now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was weird, being in Melissa's body and letting her urges direct his actions... but it was sure to be fun. Melissa's body was definitely in the mood for it, and Jack couldn't hold her desires at bay any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he watched Lilith slowly walking toward him, naked, in his own body, his breathing quickened. The anticipation was too much to take - if Lilith took any longer, he would have to go and jump on his own body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoa. Jack never expected that kind of thought to come to him. But at this point he didn't care, his concerns completely discarded as Lilith finally - finally - reached him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith brought Jack's body over Melissa's, bare skin caressing bare skin, and brought his lips to Melissa's neck. A shiver went down Jack's borrowed spine as he felt a surge of new sensations go through his body. He felt his nipples stand on end, Melissa's breasts now held down by Jack's own torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen... it happened. Lilith pulled herself up to look him in the eyes, and pushed in something else - something Jack and his current body had been longing for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my fucking god...\" Jack moaned in Melissa's sexy voice as he felt something long and hard pound the cheerleader's nethers, overwhelming pleasure echoing through his entire being. His eyes began to water and his vision swam as Lilith kept on driving into him. Jack lost all sense of time as his head began to spin with the feeling of it - pure pleasure emanating from his loins as Lilith continued her act. Jack continued to moan as he felt his body orgasm - yet Lilith continued, and the pleasure did not cease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Lilith stood, and Jack, head still spinning from multiple orgasms, looked up at her with a stupid grin on his face. All he could do was pant as Lilith smiled knowingly at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... \" Jack said in a whisper. Then, he added. \"Damn, Jack, if I'd known you were that good I wouldn't have been banging Shaun in the first place...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What?) Jack thought to himself. Those weren't his words. Then, he felt his body sit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could definitely make a habit of this...\" he felt his body - Melissa's body, say to Lilith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure... just let me know.\" Lilith replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Lilith?) Jack called, trying to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Yes, Master?) she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What's going on?) Jack asked again. Melissa was saying something else and slowly putting on some clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Not sure what you mean...) Lilith replied with a hint of laughter. She too began getting dressed, and started to walk with Melissa to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(I'm not in control...) Jack complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(I figured that. Don't worry, it'll probably fix itself up soon. You're just drained.) she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(So it wasn't something you did?) Jack asked, just to be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(No, Master. But if tomorrow at school you're still not in control, I'll get you out. It'll be fine. For now, just enjoy yourself.) As Lilith said that, she said her goodbyes to Melissa, and walked out the door. Leaving Jack a passenger in Melissa's body, unable to do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa walked back up to her room, got out her phone, and planted herself on the bed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While slightly worried, and kinda surprised about how his 'night' as a passenger had gone, he could honestly not wait till he met up with Lilith. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa had texted a few friends, updated her status on one of the various communities she apparently was a part of, and then decided to get something to eat for dinner. Nothing surprising, till about an hour after eating, she decided to start exercising. Again, nothing unusual, till half way through, where she pulled a small box labeled \"fun\". Inside were quite a few toys, some Jack couldn't even guess the function of, and then Melissa had pulled out something that stopped Jack's metaphorical heart for a good few seconds. An, at least from what jack could tell, 10-inch black dildo with studs, was pulled out of the box, and set aside, along with what appeared to be a smaller dildo (was that 4-inches, or more, jack wondered at the time). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter pulling the two items out, as well as a bottle of some liquid, Melissa continued doing some stretches for another few minutes, especially working on squats and even some splits. Stopping again, Melissa, pulled first the smaller dildo from where it had been, and then poured some of the liquid onto it, slowly massaging it onto the false phallus. Finally pleased with the job, Melissa starts to slowly strip, doing a sensual dance, while slowly humming to herself. After finishing stripping, she reaches for the small dildo, and bends around and stretches enough to face her ass. Jack, wondering if he should be impressed with her flexibility, or worried that something like that is going in 'his' ass, he only watches on ....especially considering he's still unable to do anything. What feels slowly cold and odd at first, to Jack at least, slowly starts to turn into pleasure, and he is shocked that not only does it go in easier than he thought it would, but that it took less time than he assumed it would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, after getting comfortable with her new addition, Melissa starts to tweak her nipples, and gently pull on her breasts - which in turn starts to affect Jack. Feeling, in a detached sense, 'his' pussy start to heat up, he's more than eager for Melissa to continue, when she suddenly stops, and heads back to the \"fun\" box. Digging through again, Jack, slightly annoyed that Melissa got worked up, and in this case, got him worked up, then stopped, was confused as to what she had forgotten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha, found you, can;t believe i forgot you again,\" Melissa states, while pulling out what appears to be some kind of device. Putting said device on the bed, Melissa begins to play with her breasts again, while running a hand occasionally up and down her sides, ever slowly inching closer to her nether regions. Jack, while fascinated with the experience, is also getting impatient, since some of the sensations feel similar to a dulled effect, akin to a limb (or in this case, a whole body) being 'asleep'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'God, i wish she would get to the main event,' Jack shouted mentally! Consequentially he also apparently spending whatever little energy he had gathered on influencing Melissa, since instead of continuing to play with herself, she stopped, walked over to the black dildo, and proceeded to plunge it into her pussy. The sudden intrusion made Melissa moan out, and Jack did as well, but he also felt some 'pain' as well, since apparently Melissa was only half way to being \"ready\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile dwelling on the pain, Jack failed to notice Melissa reach for the device, and push some buttons on it. Melissa, and in this case Jack, were subjected to sudden vibrations in both the pussy and ass, and not regular low level vibrations, but max power apparently. 'Maybe i shouldn't have been impatient,' was Jack's last coherent thought before blacking out from the sudden and intense euphoric flood of feelings he got from the near instant orgasm.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing around from his impromptu black out, Jack wonders how long he was out, and notices it's still pitch black. <br>\r\n'Wonder if its because Melissa is asleep, or just that her eyes are closed. Or, it could even be that it is something else,' Jack ponders, while wondering if he can contact Lilith now, or if he should wait like she suggested. Thinking on it, Jack decides to try to go to sleep, since he cant exactly do anything in the dark, and bugging Lilith at the moment might cause her to be even more mischievous (especially since he was stuck, and while bound to him, doesn't stop her from messing with him, especially since this was part of a lesson apparently!).<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nStepping off the bus, Melissa went straight towards her clique, ignoring everyone else along the way, and while Jack could see all the she saw, did not see Lilith anywhere. Calling out mentally, hoping it would work, Jack asked 'Lilith, are you at school yet? I'm still kinda stuck'</span></div></div>",

'Though, we both were having fun, and I did learn the female perspective....not the point though,' Jack thinks to himself silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[True enough Master.

You could simply retake Melissa again, and go through her day, you could take back your body, or you could even possess another student....maybe even a teacher or two?] Lilith says, sounding slightly chastised by Jack's statement, but also curious about what her Master had planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jack's mind stalled after Lilith's question, as her options of what he could do hadn't even occurred to him, since he had been solely focused on regaining mobility. A loud slam breaks Jack from his mental musings, and notices that Melissa (and himself) had apparently passed through the gym, and into the girls changing room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Multiple females in varying states of undress filled Jack's current view, and he momentarily wondered if he should ask Lilith to hold off on helping him for a few minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[As you wish Master, I'll wait until you call, but in this case, to avoid any 'suspicion' on me, I'll be heading towards your first class of the day. I hope you enjoy whatever you have gotten yourself into.] Lilith responds, sounding as if she's getting slightly further away as she 'talks'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[Dammit Lilith, it was a stray thought, that I bet even you might have had if you walked into a room full of half-dressed women!] Jack mentally shouts in exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The sounds of girls chatting about various topics, the opening and closing of lockers, and the occasional shriek of some girl out of view was Jack's only response to his last plea. Momentarily lamenting to himself about being so close to being able to move under his own control, Jack quickly rebounds. 'While I may be stuck like this for a bit longer, I can still enjoy the sight before me,' Jack mentally crows, seeing many hot women in the process of changing, and one or two showering, that many guys he knew would pay to see in this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0'Holy shit, is that really Nikki and Janet in the showers over there? Damn, Adrienne has an awesome rack, and a decent ass. Hell, even that blonde Stephanie on junior Varsity looks stunning in just her underclothes.' Jack comments to himself, seeing many of the ladies he honestly wouldn't mind hooking up with, and seeing how they would look if things got as far as most guys would want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Hey Sarah, what are you and the others of the Volleyball team doing here this early? I thought the coach had scheduled you guys for 2nd period, to give you all time to wake up instead of playing like zombies first thing in the morning,\" Melissa says, drawing Jack's attention from his mental musings, to seeing his crush, Sarah, in just her bra and panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, that is still on the schedule, but alot of us felt we should show up early, and start warm-ups, that way we aren't zombie-like as you mentioned. We need the extra practice, as last night they alerted us to a sudden match scheduled for this afternoon,\" Sarah responds, unclipping her bra, and pulling off her panties to put on her gym set clothing. Jack nearly mind orgasmed at the sight of a naked Sarah, something he had fantasized about alot lately.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah, well that explains why we were told to talk to our 4th period teachers before lunch, I guess were supposed to get an exemption from class, which is odd, since normally they don't want us cheering for you gals. Whatever, not my problem, in any case, good luck out there today,\" Melissa says, finishing up her changing of clothing, and closing her locker, before turning towards the gym doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mentally complaining about his view of Sarah being taken away, Jack mentally sighs, and settles in for apparently cheer leading practice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Forty-five minutes into practice, Jack notices that he's feeling a bit more solid, as if he is slowly regaining control over Melissa. Realizing that he must have regained enough energy to possibly take control, Jack is about to do so, when a sudden thought stops him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Wait, I have no knowledge on how to do any cheer leading stuff, nor do I know Melissa well enough to fake being her. Fuck, and I have no idea how long it is until I'm forced into the driver's seat.....shit, I'll have to hope I last until after cheer practice.' Jack monologues, praying that his luck actually goes his way for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Vision fading out, it snaps back and Jack wonders where he is now, since he can tell it's not his bedroom from before his fading. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of Jacks vision is a non-descript looking building, with empty lots on either side. Trying to turn his head, Jack finally notices that he's unable to move....and then recalls that his part of the deal was to be in Lilith's body, with her in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"That's right Master, I'm in control for the time being, and it's time for a new lesson, but I'll be nice and let you pick between the two, but if you take too long, I'll simply pick something even more interesting!\" Lilith responds to Jack's realization of his situation. Upon hearing this, Jack is both slightly scared, and also somewhat more partially excited by the prospect of Lilith's possible lesson choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Now, your options are simple Master. I can either keep you in me, and do a bunch of fun, naughty things to us. I can drop you inside a random person in a club, while filled with extreme lust, and must exit within an allotted time. Or, we can go with the mystery experience, which while very fun, may be a bit much for a budding warlock to start off with.\" Lilith lists off, all the while massaging random parts of her body, giving no outward sign of being affected, but causing Jack to let out low moans mentally.</span></div></div>",

Shame, Master, it was going to be exciting.\" Lilith replied with a disappointed tinge to her voice. \"So then the club? Or this body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...\" Jack stuttered, not knowing what to pick. He didn't fancy being a passenger in a body... that left one option. \"The club, I guess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith nodded, and Jack felt their shared eyes close. They appeared in a busy area of the city, with several nightclubs with loud music playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we don't need to wait in any lines...\" Lilith said as she simply phased through the wall into a dark corner of the club. \"Now to find you a body...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvidently having solidified and been made visible, Lilith strolled through the bar area confidently, examining the crowd. She drew many looks with her augmented body - quite a few hungry guys wanting a piece of her ass. Lilith barely noticed - or at least didn't seem in the least bit uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!\" Lilith found a trio of girls on the dancefloor, all looking rather drunk. Two were blondes, and one was a redhead. All wore similarly tight dresses that went halfway to their knees. All three were attractive, in Jack's eyes. Lilith walked closer to them, made a sharp pushing motion with her hands and snapped her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack felt himself fly out of Lilith's body and collided with the three girls... he opened his eyes to a barrage of new feelings. A tight dress constricting his hips, legs and chest. Some fun jiggling on his chest as he swayed. A dizziness at the back of his head, having been suddenly dropped in the body of someone who had been drinking. Hands on his bare shoulders... and red hair in his eyes. So he had been dropped in the redhead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother foreign feeling graced him seconds later. A pleasant warmth from his nethers, something he hadn't felt before. This was met with a slightly urgent feeling of lust. Not being in much of a state of mind to fight it, Jack grabbed the nearest girl, one of the blondes, and sunk his lips right into hers. She didn't resist, returning the kiss passionately and causing the warmth in Jack's borrowed loins to swell. Jack felt his thighs rub together, highlighting the absense of his usual gear there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued to kiss the other girl as her hand found her way to Jack's ass. He opened his eyes to see Lilith standing behind that girl, a slight echo of red in her eyes. Had she bewitched the blonde to be more agreeable? He wouldn't put it past her - nor was he complaining when he felt himself being dragged by the hand away from the dancefloor and to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door slammed as he was pushed into a cubicle by the blonde. That too was slammed and locked, as the blonde pushed herself onto Jack. He felt hands reaching all around his body, and heard an unzipping. The dress that was on his body fell to his waist, revealing the decent rack of his current body. The blonde pulled the bra upwards, causing a breast to spill out underneath, and smashed her face into it. All the while a hand reached into the now compromised dress and into the panties of the redhead Jack was inhabiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack let out a moan from his borrowed lips as he felt the girl's nipple caressed by the tongue of her horny friend, and her clit so expertly teased by a wayward hand. All he could do was gasp as new feelings overwhelmed his body, and he sank down against the wall, satisfied. The blonde withdrew her head, and turned around towards the cubicle door as if something had caught her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was it?</span></div></div>",

Calming momentarily, Jack waits to see if Lilith is going to do something, or if the Allie will react. 'Wait, who's Allie? Is that the blonde's name? How did I know that?' Jack started pondering, distracted from his wonder of Lilith's current actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Jack's attention is quickly reoriented on Lilith, as she starts chanting lowly, and the room seems to sway momentarily. Confused and curious, Jack tilts his head, and suddenly notices that Allie's actions have been stopped for a while, and she hasn't moved at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Finally noticed that Mistress? It's not really time being stopped, but merely your perception, as well as Allie's, that has been slowed enough. I figured I would give you your deadline and also an incentive, though whether it will help spur you on to winning or losing, that is a matter of perspective,\" Lilith says, finishing with a vicious grin forming on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wondering what Lilith means, Jack looks around, and notices that Allie's purse is somehow emitting a light, as if something inside is glowing a bright reddish-purple. Knowing that Lilith has just cause him even more mischief, but finding it hard to be annoyed or angry, as his lust is slowly increasing, and the sensations, that he's now noticed after finally considering Lilith's explanation, seem to be dragging on in an agonizingly pleasant tease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Drawn yet again out of his thoughts, Jack's attention is drawn back to Lilith, who has continued talking, not pausing to make sure Jack was paying attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"- will be the longest you can last before hitting your first penalty. If you end up staying twice as long, you'll end up stuck in that body as another penalty. The final penalty will be  -\" and Jack zones out, freaking out about not knowing how long he has to escape the club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"- not permanent, unless you really want it to be. That being said, I do hope you enjoy your time with your new experience Mistress. And do remember, that while I will endeavor to not get you killed or permanently harmed, this is supposed to be a teaching lesson,\" Lilith finishes, grinning like the Cheshire cat, and slowly backing away from both Jack and Allie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0As Lilith backs away, Jack notices that 'time' is slowly getting faster, and that Allie seems to be turning back around towards Jack. Completing her turn back, Jack notices that Allie's eyes are currently pink, which as far as he knew wasn't a natural color. 'Could Lilith have spelled her to make this challenge more difficult?' Jack wonders, before his attention is drawn the the reasserted lips that greedily attack his, fighting to dominate his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Momentarily shocked by the increased pace, Jack is stunned, and nearly orgasms as Allie picks up where she left off before Lilith's interruption, the only change being one hand replacing Allie's mouth on her nipple, and her finger massaging his clit, as well as gently rubbing his slit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Shuddering from the increased sensations after the brief pause, Jack's attention, or what is left available to him while trying not to turn into a puddle or orgasmic feelings, is drawn to the still glowing object in Allie's purse. Allie breaks the kiss after noticing that Jack isn't reciprocating, and turns to follow 'his' gaze. Seeing it focused on her purse, she turns back to Jack, and grins widely, while teasingly tweaking Jacks nipple to get 'his' attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It seems I'm not enough to hold your attention without some help, <i>'Stacy'</i>. If you wanted to pick up the pace, all you had to do was say so, instead of let me waste time trying to warm you up,\" Allie says teasingly, while withdrawing her hand from Jacks pussy, and reaching it towards her purse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moments of fumbling one-handedly with it, and Allie is successful at opening it while still playing with Jacks nipple. Reaching inside the purse, Jack sees her unerringly grab the, to his vision, glowing object from within, and slowly pull it out. Jack's body shudders, shocking him as it was unintentional, and his arousal seems to jump dramatically as he finally sees what Allie is withdrawing. A large purple double-headed dildo, covered with realistic veins as well as random spots that look like disguised studs. Unconsciously letting out a moan (in either excitement or horror, Jack cannot tell) Allie continues to pull the toy out, admiring it, and enjoying the still continuing shudders Jack's body seems to be producing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Hmm, if I didn't know better, I would think you're looking forward to this, especially since anyone could walk in and interrupt us, or even join us,\" Allie says, sending an even larger jolt of arousal lancing through Jack's body. Shocked at how his body keeps reacting, Jack starts to wonder if he can even successfully escape the club, or just give in to his current body's desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Just as he has that thought, things slow down for Jack again, and he hears a voice he didn't expect to pop up, especially not from Allie's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"By the way Mistress, since I noticed you were only half paying attention, I feel it's only fair to warn you that the sex toy is heavily enchanted, enough to be considered a minor transformation into a real thing. Which means that you'll get many extra experiences if you don't hurry up. Also, don't bother asking any questions at this moment, as this is only a pre-recorded message left via hypnotism. Good luck!\" Allie says in Lilith's voice, perfect inflection, tone, and head motions throughout the entire time of talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amazed by something that sounds so simple, Jack's attention to the present is drawn back to things resuming at a normal pace, and seeing Allie start to hike up her dress and pull her panties down. Seeing this, Jack realizes that he has only moments to either try to escape and succeed in this lesson, or give in to the rampant lust and pleasurable feelings flooding his borrowed body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0While giving in sounded easy, Jack also needed to remember that Lilith said something about penalties, and as this was supposed to be a lesson, Jack as wary of invoking penalties from a being that was a mischievous as Lilith. Taking a deep breath, Jack decided...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

Sure enough, Lena's reflection was still there. Long, wavy red hair running down her shoulders and framing her heart-shaped face. Bright green eyes, maroon painted lips, wearing an expensive-looking beige dress that went to her knees - she was stunning. And currently, staring back at Jack through the mirror, stunned look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack took a step back from the mirror. The Lena in the reflection did the same. Jack looked down at his own body, and sure enough - red hair, breasts, beige dress... definitely Lena. How could he have not noticed? Then again, he didn't really feel any different. That is, until he reached down with his hands - delicate, with immaculately manicured nails - and grabbed his breasts. They were definitely real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck...\" he whispered, this time completing the sentence.

He still didn't feel any different, despite what his eyes told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving as fast as he could on the heels he was now wearing - or thought he was, anyway - he runs down the hall as he heard his mother open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ended up...</span></div></div>",

Resting against the door, eyes closed, Jack doesn't see anyone in his room, but is made aware when a voice makes itself known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"I have to say, even if it's in a different state, the heaving of a sexy woman's breasts is a nice view to behold,\" says a voice that sounds familiar to Jack, but doesn't recognize it until he looks up and around his room. Seeing Lilith, who he had previously been thinking was a delusion of his possibly over-stressed mind, Jack begins to realize that maybe she, and the Book, were real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Why, of course I'm real, just as you are currently Lena Serlinkov, sexy Russian immigrant, currently inhabited by my Master's, or should that be Mistress', soul,\" Lilith giggles, responding to Jacks thoughts, shocking him even more. Seeing the surprise, and somewhat fear cross Jack's face, Lilith calms down, before sighing and gently patting the bed she was sitting on. Taking the hint, Jack forcibly calms himself with some success, then stumbles over towards the bed, still trying to get used to the heels he currently was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Don't worry Mistress, I'm not going to harm you...unless your into that kind of thing. As to how you are now Lena, well that is the result of a couple of spells. I figured you would be more accepting of your new power, if you saw the results in such a way that you could not immediately dismiss them.\" Lilith says soothingly, while gently rubbing Jacks back, slowly calming him down even more, and helping him focus on her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Ok, I believe now that both you and the Book are real, and that I'm currently Lena, but why, and also, can I go back to being Jack? I appreciate you proving your point, but I don't exactly know what to do as her, \" Jack calmly says, after getting himself under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, that answer is somewhat odd to most people, but the short answer is the Book. As we're both bound to it, and each other through it, it allows a two-way connection between us. In this case, to get a better understanding of my, at the time, Master, I decided to see what would be the quickest way to get you to accept your new abilities, while also opening your mind to the possibilities said abilities allow you.\" Lilith explains, still gently rubbing Jack's back, but also ranging slightly lower every few minutes, not that Jack had noticed yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"As to being Jack, you are still essentially him, but currently are inhabiting Lena's body, while she is currently hypnotized to think she's you, but at her current residence. Seeing as its Friday night, I felt that you could possibly explore your powers, while also experiencing something new, like the body of the hot Russian that has been on your mind recently. So in short, yes, you could be switched back to 'Jack', but that would be boring at this moment,\" Lilith continues, and as she finishes her answer, starts to rub Jack's ass sensually, causing him to slightly jump up, but not enough to get off the bed. With not enough momentum, Jack falls back towards the bed, landing on Lilith's hand, which continues it's gentle rubbing, much to Jack's slight discomfort, but also, to his horror, his slowly rising pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"If you wanted me to change positions on where i was rubbing, all you had to do was say so mistress,\" Lilith says cheekily, winking after getting Jack to look her in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stammering out silent denials, Jack tries to find the words to his current situation, frightened by the sudden pleasant warmth that is pooling above his stomach and chest. Shuddering, Jack leaps up, successfully clearing the bed, but then begins to stumble as he landed on his heels wrong, nearly twisting his ankle on the landing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chuckling, Lilith moves faster than Jack thought, and catches him gently by his shoulders, stopping her light teasing for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"In all honesty Mistress, you currently have the opportunity to live out your fantasies, any and all of them, and experience things that most would only find on the internet, or in the minds of fanfiction writers. Don't let your former boundaries keep you penned in, explore the new, and enjoy everything you wish to,\" Lilith states passionately, eyes staring deeply into Jack's, her gaze not wavering nor breaking the current lock between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Long moments pass, while Jack turns Lilith's words over in his head, actually considering what she has said, and also thinking about the possibilities now available. Every question he's had or heard others mention, he could actually learn, if not experience, every dark fantasy, every strange thing he'd ever read on the internet. All would be available, if he was willing to step outside his normal boundaries of comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shuddering at the thought of all he could do, Jack slowly leans forward, keeping eye contact with Lilith, and chastely putting his lips on hers. A smile slowly forms on Lilith's lips, where she gently returns Jack's kiss, letting him set the pace for the moment. A long few minutes of gentle kissing goes on, before Jack finally breaks it off, and steps back slowly. Taking a deep breath to center his thoughts, Jack looks up at Lilith, who seems to be staring at him in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"You're right Lilith, I do have an opportunity to explore new possibilities with the powers I now have available, and I do thank you for opening my eyes to that. That being said, I would appreciate it in the future if you would at least warn me before springing such situations on me,\" Jack says calmly, but with a hint of excitement tinging his tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Hearing this, Lilith grins widely, before pausing in what Jack assumed was going to be a renewed attempt on seducing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"That is understandable Mistress, and I cannot promise completely to not drop you in random situations, as that is one of the best ways to learn some things, but i will endeavor to give you some warning,\" Lilith says, pausing and adopting an impish smile. \"Now, are you ready to learn how a woman can pleasure a woman, or would you like to do something else?\" Lilith asks, slowly moving closer to Jack, hips swaying seductively as she licked her lips in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hearing her response, Jack shakes his head as he decides...<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

He watched with interest as her clothes seemed to melt and her hair began to twist, lightening in color. Moments later, the rippling ceased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\" Lilith said. Jack's jaw dropped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow standing in front of him was the kind of woman that only existed on the front cover of a magazine. Barefoot, with long, toned, slender legs leading up to wide hips, a firm and curvy ass, a slim waist and torso, large - but not too large - breasts, all in perfect proportion. She was wearing only a small yellow two-piece bikini that really didn't leave anything to the imagination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked up at her face to see lovely soft features, bright green eyes, round, slightly pouty lips, and a wave of mostly straight golden-blonde hair that went past her shoulders. \"Wow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image of feminine perfection slowly made her way towards Jack, hips swaying, legs staying one in front of the other. She rested a dainty hand on Jack's chest, and Jack went red in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Master...\" the woman said, \"What shall we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack gulped. Lilith had transformed into that? She had already been well off the charts in attractiveness, but this was just... wow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you're at a loss for words... tell me. What do you want to do?\" Lilith asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... uhh...\" Jack mumbled, still not able to comprehend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what. While you regain your composure, let's have some... innocent fun.\" Lilith smirked, hardly seeming innocent despite her bright eyes. \"Is there a pool nearby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack snapped out of it, if not for a moment. \"Well there's a public pool not far, but it'd be closed by now. There's an indoor one at the gym.. but that's pretty far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect. Shall we go?\" Lilith asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... now? Isn't it a bit late?\" Jack countered. \"And what does a succubus want at a swimming pool, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to show off my powers... So we can have <i>fun</i>!\" Lilith exclaimed, her body making Jack pleasantly uncomfortable. \"Besides, no one will even know you're gone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...\" Jack started as Lilith pushed him. He stumbled backward and fell on the floor. \"Hey... what the holy shit!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack saw himself standing in front of him, Lilith's hand still on his chest. But he was... on the floor? And he was transparent...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This'll be quicker. We won't have to drive, and your body won't leave the room.\" Lilith explained, and with a wink, blew a kiss at Jack's inert body. It jerked to life, and made its way peacefully over to the bed. Jack stared, unable to believe any of what was happening. Today had started out so normally... and now he was a ghost, sharing a room with a super-sexy succubus in a bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Jack inquired, and instead of answering, Lilith walked up, grabbed his ghostly arm, and pulled him to her. Jack's world spun, and he found himself standing in a very large tiled room, one wall covered in mirrors. They had somehow teleported to the changerooms in the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This way, right?\" Lilith pulled Jack out of the changerooms and towards the pool. They approached and Jack noticed that despite the relatively late hour, there were still a few people there. A middle-aged man, a guy in his late teens, and a woman who looked to be in her late 20s were in the main pool, while the hot tub was occupied by a single asian girl who looked to be in her early 20s. Checking out the asian girl, Jack thought she wasn't too bad looking. Medium height, with jet black hair plastered to her head, she was wearing a one-piece swimsuit and looked rather comfortable lounging in the hot tub. Lilith also took in the view of the people there, and whispered. \"Perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eyes turned to look at the newcomers. No one seemed overly shocked, but the guys were <i>clearly</i> very interested in what they were looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... they can see us?\" Jack asked, worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They can see me, but only because I want them to. No fun otherwise.\" Lilith answered. \"They can't see you though. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith made her way slowly over to the pool, hips swaying as before, and slowly made her way down the ladder to the deep end. The guys were staring, mouths half open, while the woman in the pool was shaking her head. The girl in the tub had closed her eyes and stopped paying attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>love</i> this attention...\" Lilith purred. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do I do?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can either watch me mess with these poor boys, or you can join in the fun as well.\" Lilith's voice echoed in Jack's head, and he didn't see her lips move at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Join in... what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I know it's your first day and all, but come on. Haven't you ever seen a ghost movie?\" Lilith said again, exasperated. \"You can possess one of these fine people here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possess... as in take over?\" Jack asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Master, take over. It'll be as if their body is yours, and you'll be in full control...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvidently sick of explaining, Lilith slowly (and with obviously exaggerated motions which showed off her assets as much as possible) made her way over to the swimmers. Which left Jack with a choice to make.</span></div></div>",

He didn't know if he could possess someone - sure, he was a ghost and that's what ghosts generally do... but still. So, he decided to follow Lilith and see what she would do. In any case, she was hot and he would be happy just staring at her for a bit. Not that she minded...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing that he was still grounded, so to speak, Jack made his way over to the pool. Lilith had just entered, and was approaching the three people in the main pool. All of them had stopped to look, as if frozen by her presence. Jack could understand that, seeing as he had reacted similarly when Lilith had first taken that form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith approached the young guy first, whispering something in his ear. As she did, his expression grew slack and he stopped moving, as if in a trance. He looked at Jack with a blank expression on his face, which Jack found to be a little creepy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, she approached the woman. She was moderately attractive, Jack thought, with long straight black hair, reasonably sized breasts sitting on a well-proportioned figure, and wearing a black 2-piece bikini. Also seemingly entranced, she didn't move as Lilith tapped her on the forehead, causing her eyes to close and her shoulders to slump. Jack looked closer to see some pale blue mist trailing behind Lilith's fingers as she approached the older man - greying hair, shamelessly staring at Lilith's chest. At least, he was before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith tapped the man on the forehead as well, causing a small burst of the same blue mist Jack had seen earlier. The man's eyes lost focus. Lilith turned to Jack and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interested in what I've been doing?\" she asked, grinning. \"Have a look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she snapped her fingers. The older man and the woman shook their heads in unison before snapping back into reality. The teenager continued to stand still, staring at Lilith. Jack's attention was drawn to the woman, who had begun... feeling herself up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the woman had grabbed her breasts, and was muttering to herself. Jack walked up to her, passing through the water like it was nothing, and listened to what she was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..fucking boobs? How?\" the woman was asking herself. \"It's gotta be some kind of trick... but hey, even if it is, I'm gonna enjoy myself while I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck are you doing with my body?\" screamed the man, rushing over to the woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty sure it's my body right now...\" the woman said, smiling. \"I dunno what happened, but either way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man ran towards the woman, trying to stop her from doing what she was doing. She had reached behind her back, and after a second of fiddling, threw her bikini top to the side. Jack watched, entertained, as the topless woman ran in circles, hands on her breasts, with the man chasing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying the show?\" Lilith asked, appearing behind Jack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep... their bodies got swapped?\" Jack asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. You know...\" Lilith said, \"you could be having the same kind of fun that man is right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith pointed her finger at the woman, who had climbed out of the pool and was rushing into the changerooms. The man followed behind her, but met with a door slamming in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out of there, you pervert!\" the man screamed, as laughter echoed from inside the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm going to have fun with this young man now...\" Lilith said, summoning the younger man she had enthralled. He knelt at her feet, and began to pull down her bikini bottom. \"What you do is... up to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger man began to slowly massage Lilith's nethers with his tongue, and Lilith closed her eyes and let out a content sigh. Jack looked around. The older man was still banging on the door of the changeroom, and the asian girl was still sitting in the hot tub, seemingly oblivious to the chaos around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do? Jack wasn't just going to stand here.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking around the room, Jack was amazed by how much Lilith had been able to accomplish with such little effort. The older man, who was now in control the woman's body was no doubt having the time of his life in the changing room, while the woman that was now occupying his original body was about to break down in tears. Jack thought about all of the fun that the man must be having right now as he shifted his attention to the Asian girl in the hot tub. <i>I can be having that kind of fun too...</i> he thought to himself as he slowly made his way towards the tub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe closer Jack got to the girl, the more interested he became. The girl was definitely good looking with her slim, yet athletically toned figure and shoulder length black hair that was currently tied in a pony tail. Jack couldn't quite tell how old she was, but there was no way she was older than her early 20s. <i>She's pretty hot...</i> Jack thought to himself, moving just a little faster now. <i>All I need to do is possess her body, and she'll be mine.</i> Jack grinned as he finally reached the pool and stepped in, feeling a combination of excitement and nervousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was taken aback by the fact that the sensation of walking into a hot tub didn't register. He looked down to see the water frothing and bubbling inside the tub, around his legs...or rather, through his legs. <i>Damn being a ghost is weird. I can't feel a thing. Not the water, not the bubbles...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack gulped as he made his way closer to the unsuspecting girl. Was he really about to do this? Was he really willing to temporarily steal a random hot girl's life, just for fun? Than again, if he did this and it worked as Lilith said, Jack would be able to tick off a lot of firsts. First time being Asian, first time wearing a one-piece swimsuit, first time being a girl...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here it does. It's now or never...\" Jack said to no one in particular as he took one more step forward. As soon as Jack's foot came into contact with the girl's, he was pulled towards her with quite a bit of force. At the moment when Jack would have landed right on top of the girl, his vision went black and he felt a shudder go through his entire body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs sensation returned, Jack realized that he was sitting in a hot tub with his eyes closed, feeling the warm bubbling water over his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...\" he whispered as he opened his eyes, seeing that there was no one else in the tub. Jack quickly looked down at himself and grinned, seeing generous breasts, covered by a form fitting one piece swimsuit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, It worked!\" Jack exclaimed as he grabbed at the two lovely mounds with his hands. They felt firm, and Jack also noticed the feeling of having his own breasts squeezed. Another first to add to his ever-growing list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... if I have those, that must mean...\" Jack wondered out loud, noticing his new, high pitched voice for the first time. He took one of his hands, and plunged it into the water he was sitting in. Tracing a path along the swimsuit he was now wearing, he stumbled upon a nothingness between his legs that he wasn't used to. \"Yep. I'm officially a girl\" he said with a mischievous grin. \"I wonder who I am...\" he said as memories suddenly flooded his head. Immediately Jack knew that he was in the body of Christina Yu, a 22 year old studying genetics at a local university. \"This is so cool!\" he exclaimed, suddenly knowing everything that there was to know about his stolen body. He also knew that her car was parked outside and that Christina had a smoking hot roommate that Lilith would be sure to enjoy. Licking his new lips, Jack decided to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack could barely contain a mischievous grin as he thought about the fun he and Lilith could have with Christina's - his, now - roommate. She was tall, fit, slim, with a gorgeous face and small but very tight-looking curves. Her name was Dana, and she was studying bio-engineering. Lots of classes in common with Christina for now. In any case, she was stunning and Jack definitely wanted to have some fun with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe idly rubbed between his legs, enjoying the unfamiliar feeling of having nothing there. But, he would be able to do that whenever he wanted, and maybe even with some help. Deciding to get up, Jack stood, squeezed his newly acquired breasts for good measure, then stepped out of the hot tub. The cool air in the room assaulted his bare legs, briefly causing him to reconsider and get back in the tub. Instead, he walked over to the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith was exactly where she was before, eyes closed, while the teenager she had enthralled continued to pleasure her. The woman who Lilith had put in the man's body was silent, sitting on a bench in a slump. The man in her body was presumably still in the changeroom exploring his new body. Jack cautiously stepped into the pool - now that he could actually feel things, he noticed it was a pleasant temperature - not as warm as the hot tub, but not as cold as the air. He slowly descended down the ladder about halfway up the length of the pool, noticing his new thighs rubbing together and further highlighting the lack of any parts between them. Half-walking, half-swimming over to Lilith, Jack savored the feeling of the water rushing over his borrowed breasts - it felt nice, even covered in the swimsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, decided to join us?\" Lilith opened her eyes and asked, smile on her face. Then, gesturing to her enthralled subject on his knees in front of her, \"Do you want a turn too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually...\" Jack explained the situation with Christina, her roommate, and what he wanted to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm, that does sound fun.\" Lilith agreed. She snapped her fingers and the teen stopped what he was doing. \"Alright, let's go then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith began to walk towards the exit. Jack gathered Christina's things. He patted himself dry with a towel, pulled a loose t-shirt and shorts over his swimsuit, and followed Lilith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lilith,\" Jack asked, noticing the distinctly feminine sound of his voice, \"What happens to these people now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing. Once we're far enough away they'll all just go back to normal. My magic only really works if someone's around to power it.\" Lilith explained. \"Like a battery, I guess. While one of us is around, they'll stay as they are until we change something. Since we're both going to leave, they'll just get snapped back to their normal selves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ok, good.\" Jack said, and continued to Christina's car. As they left the gym, Jack noticed no one was paying any attention to Lilith, who was still in her jaw-droppingly sexy blonde body, wearing only a bikini. She had probably gone invisible again to not waste any time. They got in the car, and Jack drove to Christina's apartment. He didn't need to think, he just knew. They arrived, and Jack lead them to the apartment, again not needing to think, and let them in. He knew Dana was around here somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around and noticed that Lilith had disappeared. Then, Jack heard a door open, as well as the sound of a shower running. A couple of seconds later, Dana walked out of her room, completely naked, still dripping from the shower. Jack stared - she was very attractive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, Chris\", Dana said, not even caring that she was naked or that 'Chris' was staring at her. \"How was the gym?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, not bad. Just relaxed today.\" Jack answered, running on autopilot. It was a lot easier than he thought it would be - it was second nature, as if he had been Christina forever. He still was very much aware of his anatomy, as the sight of his body's roommate, completely naked, elicited an interesting sensation in his crotch. Yet, he knew Christina was very much into guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. Well, I'm gonna go finish my shower.\" Dana said, winked at him, then slowly turned around, hips swaying as she disappeared back into her room. Lilith had wasted no time, and had clearly jumped right into Dana as they walked into the apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack pondered what he was going to do now.</span></div></div>",

His attention is drawn the the 'surprised' gasp that comes from the frosted glass cubicle the shower resides in.

You don't have a problem with that, do you Dana?\" Jack asks, sliding into character perfectly, even mimicking the tone inflection and poses that Christina normally uses while talking to Dana. Minutely shuddering at the thrill of watching 'Dana' silently orgasm, as she opened her mouth to apparently say something, and merely paused before it grows into a large \"O\", as well as the fun of the little act that both he and Lilith were putting on, was almost enough to have Jack ignore the rest of the game, and pounce on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, when you put it that way, I guess there's no problem. I was mostly just surprised, as you seemed very against us sharing showers, and even having to wear clothing while lounging around the house. You should introduce me to this new friend of yours, so I can give my appreciation for talking with you,\" 'Dana says pantingly, regaining her breath, as well as adding another wink at the mention of 'friend'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Silently chuckling, Jack decides enough talking had gone on, and moves towards the shower, gracefully opening the door, and stepping onto the slick floor without slipping, Dana moving over somewhat to give room. Closing the door, Jack sees that while not spacious, there is enough room for both him and 'Dana' to shower comfortably without feeling claustrophobic, nor any danger of accidentally colliding with one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0A torrent of water covering his head, and then cascading down his body, shocks Jack out of his internal musings, as 'Dana' decided to start the process of 'helping' Christina with their shower. Smirking about her antics, and deciding  to have some fun with it, Jack reaches over to the secondary shower head, that sees less use, and turns it on, letting it warm up momentarily before turning it on 'Dana'. Shrieks fill the air at the surprise attack, and both 'ladies' turn it into a mini soak fight, both laughing at the simple interaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Minutes after getting his 'revenge' as well as the simple fun of a water fight, Jack turns his shower head off, and puts it back in its receptacle. Grabbing a bar of soap, he starts to lather up his hands, as well as his chest. Seeing this, Dana puts her shower head in its perch above them, but not directly hitting either 'lady'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Let me help soap you up 'Dana', there must be some spots that are hard for you to get alone, and it seems you are without your loofah tonight,\" Jack says, still amazed at the little details that help keep the act together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Smirking, 'Dana' nods, and turns around grabbing her own bar of soap, and lathering her own hands up and starting on her front. Taking his cue, Jack starts running his hands up and down 'Dana', making sure to actually get her shoulders and neck, but then slowing down to massage her back, as well as her hips. Hearing a low moan, as well a slight growl, Jack smiles mischievously, before moving closer, and hugging his body to 'Dana's'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Wh-what? What are you doing Chris? You usually seem repulsed by hugs and such from other women?\" 'Dana' asks, seeming confused, if not for the look of pure lust and desire plastered on her face as she turns her head enough to look at 'Chris'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, I feel bad about that, and figured that since you don't have your loofah, i could fill in for it tonight, especially to show my appreciation for not being the best of roommates at times,\" Jack responded, fighting the urge to just drop the act and give into his rampant arousal demanding he mount 'Dana'. Deciding to somewhat 'feed the beast', and not waiting for a response, Jack starts to slowly rise up on to his toes, then lower, then rise again, in a repeating pattern, his boobs massaging 'Dana's back, and soaping it up nicely, as well as earning a moan of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"I-if you ins-insist, though I really do wish to meet your new friend,\" 'Dana' stutters out, before moaning loudly, as apparently she had just had another orgasm. Deciding to pick up his pace, Jack moves his arms and hands away from the hug, and places them on 'Dana's' breasts, slowly massaging and fondling them, occasionally running a finger over her crinkled nipples, eliciting loud hisses followed by full body shudders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Keeping up with the motions for a few minutes, and about to change tactics, Jack is surprised by the sudden change of events, as one moment his feet are just coming back down flat to the floor, and the next he's pushed up roughly against the tiled wall, with 'Dana' roughly kissing him. The sudden cool sensation of the tiles on his back causes Jack to gasp, opening his mouth, and allowing 'Dana' to invade it, and start dominating it with her tongue, all the while rubbing her chest against Jack's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Completely stunned at the reversal of positions, as well as the aggressiveness of 'Dana', Jack's body feels on fire, as the heat of his arousal, as well as his new memories, strike enough points to cause him to orgasm, screaming into 'Dana's mouth, and nearly falling boneless to the floor, the only thing keeping him up is 'Dana' pinning him to the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Just as he starts to think he'll pass out from lack of air, as well as from all the stimulation, 'Dana' breaks the kiss, moving her head back minutely while panting, a shit-eating grin plastered on her face. Catching his breath, Jack realizes that he has a matching grin, and merely decides to let Lilith set the pace, as apparently the act is over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Seeing the acceptance in Jack's eyes, 'Dana' moves, massaging Jack's body in various places, eliciting moans and squeaks of pleasure, which promptly turn into one continuous sound as she finds the most sensitive spots, and starts working on them, while kissing Jack's neck and collarbone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Jack, feeling that he should at least return some of the fun, starts trying to touch and please 'Dana', but find that he really doesn't know anywhere to attempt, aside from the obvious boobs and pussy, and feels that would be boring. His decision is taken out of his hands, as 'Dana' suddenly grabs one of his outstretched idle hands, and plants it firmly on her pussy, pushing two fingers in, while gasping lightly, not even moving her attention from her kissing. Surprised, but taking the hint, Jack starts to experiment, finding some idea of how this can work from Christina's memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0The sound of that bathroom for many minutes is filled with shrieks of pleasure, interspersed with groans and moans of the same. Finally after both feel sated, they stand from their nearly collapsed positions, and turn the shower off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Shuddering as one last wave of pleasure rips through his body, Jack sinks to the wet floor, not even paying attention to his surroundings. Minutes pass before Jack feels himself lifted off the ground, and gently carried from the bathroom towards 'his' room. Long moments pass after he's deposited on a bed before he finally becomes cognizant of his changed location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Ahh, finally back Mistress? I hope you had fun, as I know I sure did,\" 'Dana' says, a look of smugness covering her normally polite features. Confused momentarily, as 'Jack' couldn't remember why Dana would call him 'Mistress', nor why he had had sex with his roommate in the bathroom, he's brought back to himself after a sharp pain lances through his body. Looking down, Jack sees 'Dana's' fingers roughly pinching his nipple, pulling roughly away from his body. This jolted his mind to register the fact that he almost lost himself inside Christina's memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes Mistress, you almost did. I didn't think you would have such an issue, but you syncing with her so fast probably should have been an indicator of such an issue possibly arising. I apologize for not considering it.\" Lilith says, answering his unvoiced concern, as well as retracting her fingers from Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"No, it's not your fault Lilith, I can't believe or assume that you would be able to anticipate or know everything that deals with magic. Saying that, now what?\" Jack responds, feeling better as more of his core personality took hold, as Christina's faded back to the edges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"That's up to you Mistress. Currently we can have more fun as these two, we could go find something else to do, or we could return to your home and plan from there.\" Lilith answers, giving no indication on her preferences, but seeming pleased that Jack didn't blame her.<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

It's fun...\" Jack breathed, still reeling from the sensations he got from Christina's body in the shower. \"Besides, what's the rush?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like the way you think, Mistress\". Lilith replied. \"You do have all the time in the world, so why not relax and enjoy yourself? Or someone else, in this case.\" Lilith winked, caressing Jack's breast with a petite hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" Jack started. \"I am a bit scared of how fast I'm syncing with Christine.\" He admitted. It was true, he had at least twice nearly lost himself in her mind. What an embarrassing end that would be. Plus, ever since he had laid eyes on Dana, he had wanted her. Now that the realm of body swapping was wide open to him, Jack's lust expanded to a new level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Mistress. Shall we swap, then?\" Lilith offered with a wink, casually feeling herself up. It was as if she knew exactly what he was thinking. Of course she did, she was practically in his head. Nonetheless, Jack played innocent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, sure!\" He perked up and admired the body that would soon be his. While Christina wasn't unattractive, she wasn't quite in the same league as Dana. Dana was tall, slim, fit, with a perfectly proportioned pair of perky tits. It made him wet just imagining what he could do in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith lifted a hand and reached out. \"Hey Chris, are you ready?\" She fell seamlessly back into Dana's mannerisms as she did so. \"You sure about this? You know you'll have to give up junk food if you want to be me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sure I'll manage, Dana.\" Jack smiled sweetly. \"Besides, think about the fact that you'll get to raid my stash!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith winked again as Jack reached out a hand. As he held Lilith's hand, he felt a jolt of electricity arc through his entire body, causing small waves of pleasure to strike all over. His vision began to fade. As he regained his senses, he noticed he was standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woowwww...\" he muttered, grabbing his head. He had a slight headache, which slowly dissipated and gave rise to a faint throb of pleasure from his nethers. He looked down to see Christina with a grin on her face, looking at him. One of her hands was already putting in effort between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unghh... Chris, I don't know why you'd want to give this up, your body feels amazing...\" she moaned shamelessly. You watched as Christina spread her legs and plunged her fingers into her pussy, releasing another moan. \"Ahh... ahh... aren't you going to...\" she began before letting out a loud scream of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour own arousal had been building, and one of your hands had been unconsciously caressing your new form. Dana's skin was soft like silk - it felt amazing. You let out a gasp as a finger grazes your new pussy. So much more sensitive than Christina - but that might just be Lilith's work. As you're about to explore more of your new body, you feel a hand on yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well, being a ghost is kind of cool, but...\" Jack thought.  \"Maybe I will try to possess someone, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the four people in the room. In the hot tub was the cute asian girl. In the lap pool there were three - a middle-aged man and a teenage guy, both of whom were practically drooling over Lilith as she slowly approached them, and a woman who looked almost 30.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now... do I go for something familiar...?\" Jack considered. After all this weirdness, something more normal did seem pretty good. Having decided, he made his way over to the lap pool. He was about to jump in when Lilith stopped him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming for a closer look, Master?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I was thinking I'd go back to being a teenager. \" replied Jack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's not <i>fun</i>...\" Lilith complained. \"You've been a teenage guy for what, 5 years now? And you'll grow up eventually... Why not try something different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...\" Jack stuttered. She seriously wanted him to possess one of the women? That would certainly be different, and Jack felt a bit uncomfortable at the thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides,\" Lilith continued, \"I have plans for these three...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack sighed, and turned to face the hot tub. The asian girl was still sitting there, eyes closed. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad. She looked only a little older than him, and she wasn't bad-looking. Besides, at least he wouldn't be a ghost anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned back to look at the pool, where Lilith had walked up to the woman. All three people in the pool were completely still with blank expressions on their faces. What had Lilith done to them? It didn't matter. He had more pressing issues at hand. He walked over to the hot tub and stepped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack could see the water frothing and bubbling inside the tub, around and <i>through</i> his legs - being a ghost was weird - but he couldn't feel anything. No warmth, no bubbles, no massage jets. He was standing in the tub at least, and didn't fall through it. Edging closer to the girl, he gulped. Was he really about to do this? If this worked as Lilith said, he was about to tick off a lot of firsts. First time being asian. First time wearing a one-piece swimsuit. First time being a <i>girl</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now or never...\" Jack said to no one in particular, and took one more step. His feet must have touched the girl's, as he was pulled very suddenly towards her. He landed right on top of her. Or he would have, if he hadn't been a ghost. Instead, he felt a shudder go through his entire body... and found himself sitting in a relaxing, warm pool of bubbling water, eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...\" he whispered, opening his eyes. He looked around, and there was no one else in the tub. It was just him. And that had to mean... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked down at himself and sure enough, he saw breasts, covered by the girl's swimsuit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked...\" he whispered, and grabbed at them with his hands. They felt firm, and Jack also noticed the feeling of having his own breasts squeezed. Another first to add to his ever-growing list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... if I have those... does that mean...\" Jack wondered out loud, noticing his new voice for the first time. He took one of his hands, and plunged it into the water he was sitting in. Tracing a path along the swimsuit he was now wearing, he stumbled upon a nothingness between his legs that he wasn't used to. \"Yep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over at Lilith, who seemed preoccupied looking at the teenager he had originally wanted to possess. He was completely zoned out. Maybe Lilith was right, he would probably have a more... <i>interesting</i> experience, at least, as this girl. The woman, however, had grabbed her own breasts and was staring down at her body as if she had never seen it before. The older man looked positively terrified, and was making his way over to the woman in a much less than quiet manner. Jack was surprised he hadn't heard all the splashing... but then again he was very distracted. It isn't every day you find yourself suddenly becoming an asian girl, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was mildly curious about what Lilith had done and was going to do, but the tub was so nice and warm, and the air was actually pretty cold. He didn't really want to move. Maybe he could call her over here? Or... he found himself thinking, a devilish grin forming on his face. Here he was, completely alone - seeing that everyone else was preoccupied with more pressing concerns - and in a new body <i>very</i> different from what he usually walked around in. A body that offered an entirely unique set of feelings and sensations. And the best part? It was a body that he wouldn't have refused, had he still been himself. <i>And it was all his...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack decided to go and see what Lilith had been doing while he was 'dropping in' on the young girl who he currently was. Reluctantly leaving the warmth of the hot tub, he raised his new body and slowly walked over to the larger pool. where Lilith was still standing in front of the completely zoned out teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a weird feeling, walking as he was now. His center of balance was slightly shifted, he was shorter, and there was a strange lack of usual equipment between his legs. All of this new stuff being wrapped in a tight one-piece swimsuit didn't make it any less obvious how different his current form was to what he was used to. But, that was the point of it all, right? New experiences? He wasn't sure what Lilith's motives were, but so far they seemed centered on just having fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving made his way over to the pool. Jack slowly lowered his new body in. It wasn't as cold as he had been expecting, but it was definitely not warm. Lilith noticed his approach, and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Master, how do you feel?\" she asked in a sweet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... not too sure.\" Jack replied, hearing his voice for the first time. He was surprised that the girl's voice came out without an accent. \"Fine, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine? Is that it?\" Lilith asked with a raised eyebrow. \"Aren't you at all curious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... well yeah, but...\" Jack mumbled. He <i>was</i> curious about his body, but he was still a bit nervous as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. I'll get back to MY fun then.\" Lilith turned back around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack brought his attention back to the other people in the pool. The older man was chasing the woman around, angrily yelling something Jack couldn't quite make out - they were on the other side of the pool. He did notice that the woman's bikini top was floating somewhere and most definitely not attached to where it was intended to be. The teenager was still standing still, completely dumbstruck, as Lilith walked back over to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to them anyway?\" Jack asked, curious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much, switched those two...\" Lilith said casually. \"Kind of enthralled this guy though. He'll be fine in a while, but for now he's my personal little puppet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was stunned. She could do that, so quickly? Then again, she did pull him out of his own body and teleport them over to the gym...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway. You're being boring.\" Lilith said with a bit of a laugh. \"Want me to make things more <i>interesting</i> for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that? I mean I did do what you asked, right?\" Jack complained. \"And what do you mean by more interesting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok yes, you did go and jump into the asian girl, but what have you done after that? Nothing. That's boring.\" Lilith explained. \"And as for more interesting... here's a small sample.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith turned around and blew a kiss at Jack. The kiss... well, a small pulse of something red... floated over to Jack and collided with his face. He began to feel a tingling sensation start from his face, which quickly spread over his body. He felt a very pleasant sensation begin to build in his nethers, and a tickling feeling build up on his body's breasts. The sensations built up, causing Jack to moan slightly. Then, they vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was... \" Jack breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...A sample of what you <i>could </i>be feeling right now if you weren't being <i>boring</i>.\" Lilith finished his sentence. Then, she approached the teen, who walked with her slowly over to the shallow end of the pool. They stopped, and he knelt down on his knees. His face made its way close to Lilith's bikini bottom, and he began pleasuring her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith exhaled. \"Ahh... Or you could get in on this action, I'm sure the kid wouldn't object getting you acquainted with your new body...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack thought about his options.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After considering what Lilith has offered, Jack chooses, but adds in a question about something he's heard about in myth about magic. <br>\r\n\"I'll do some something by myself, but i was curious about a type of spell I've heard mentioned in myths Lilith. Something to link the senses and feeling between two people to feel what the other feels,\" Jack asks, while trying to subtly rub his thighs together, it seems Lilith's little sample is slowly ramping up, but holding off without any kind of physical stimulation. <br>\r\nCocking an eye while moaning, and slowly playing with her breasts, Lilith looks at Jack more approvingly than before, and responds, \"Well, well, Master....or is it Mistress now? There is indeed a spell like that, and something that i have rarely been asked about in all my time serving others. If you would like, I can link your senses to anyone else's here, even mine, or i could link the other peoples here to anyone you want. Maybe later i could teach you the spell as well\" Finishing her answer, she directs her current thrall to move a bit deeper and then starts to pull on her nipples and moans out loud after a few seconds, apparently thrall boy hit a particularly good spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking it over, Jack decides to jump in with this possible extra help, and explains what he wants Lilith to do. \"I thank you for the explanation Lilith, and will take you up on your offer. I would like you to link your current sense to mine, after I give u the go ahead, and I would love to learn the spell later if your still willing.\" Giving up on the subtle attempts at quelling the deep arousal building in Jack's nethers, he starts to slowly caress his body while making his way over to the hot tub area, but not before turning the gets and bubbles on, then getting in. Looking over to Lilith, who apparently has been watching you with interest, and hasn't stopped her ministrations on herself, or her thrall on her, Jack looks her in the eye, and firmly nods after sitting down in the hot tub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing what to expect, Jack lets out a sudden surprised gasp when the sensations he had felt since Lilith's sample, suddenly quadrupled in strength, as well as the feeling of phantom hands caressing 'her' body, and a phantom mouth currently plowing away at 'her' pussy. This sudden change made Jack lose 'her' footing, and accidentally slides over one of the jets in the hot tub, further pushing 'her' closer to the edge of an orgasm. A sudden ceasing of those phantom sensations makes Jack pause for a second, and start to look up from where 'she' is currently sitting, when suddenly it feels like a large intrusion has just entered 'her' pussy, and 'her' clit feels like it just got pinched at that same moment. The sensations, all at once, made Jack black out momentarily, but as 'she' comes back, 'she' starts moaning, and trying to take off 'her' swimsuit to get better access to 'her' super aroused and sensitive body. All the while, the sensation of pounding has not ceased, it has apparently increased in tempo, causing Jack to start moaning long and loud, all the while the phantom sensation of hands on 'her' breasts, as well as extra hands caressing 'her' body all the while, prompts Jack to start rubbing his pussy while straining not to fall over from over-stimulation.<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith, seeing how affected Jack is currently, apparently whispers a spell at her thrall, and hears in satisfaction another loud moan, and then unblocks the arousal she has kept bottled up while directing her thrall to give her master extra stimulation. The 'uncorking' of arousal, sends her over the edge, causing her to orgasm, and looks over to see Jack locked up sitting in the hot tub, with a giant \"O\" expression, and 'her' eyes rolled up into 'her' head. Pleased that she has given her new 'Mistress' what 'she' wanted, if not how 'she' thought 'she' would, Lilith cuts off the link, and then prompts her thrall to go faster and harder. <br>\r\n-<br>\r\nSlowly waking up, Jack feels warm, and yet, his top half feels slightly chilly, as if he had just gotten out of a shower. Felling a sudden weight on his chest, he looks down, and realizes that he had blacked out. 'Damn, multiple orgasms as a woman seems better than the single I've felt while masturbating,' Jack thinks, while idly playing with 'her' breasts. Considering the amounts of stimulation, Jack has to say that Lilith was right, he was being boring earlier, if anything, he was glad that she pushed him to push  his boundaries. Jack was also extra glad he had recalled that little bit about sense linking, totally worth it, even if it felt weird as hell at first. <br>\r\nFinally noticing that 'she' had started to play with 'herself', Jack stops, stand up from the hot tub after retrieving 'her' swimsuit. After donning it, and moving back over to Lilith, who apparently is still being plowed by the thrall, and moaning in one long continuous go, 'Damn, doesn't she have to breath for it to keep going like that?....wonder how well her blowjobs are if she doesn't have to breathe at all?', Jack thinks, and is suddenly surprised when Lilith responds, while still moaning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I technically don't have to breath if I don't wish to Mistress, but some people do get freaked out when something abnormal is around, so it becomes a conditioned response. As to the blowjobs, well you'll have to find out later, now wont you?' Jack hears inside his head, since he knows she didn't speak aloud, considering 'she' still sees Lilith moaning, while pinching her Thrall's shoulder, and suddenly getting louder in her moaning.<br>\r\n\"Um, Lilith, not to be rude, especially after all the fun you've helped me have, but are you going to finish any time soon?\" Jack asks, while unconsciously starting to caress 'her' body again, and rub 'her' thighs together. Lilith looks Jack in the eyes, and 'she' sees a sudden gleam in them, suddenly feeling slightly worried. Suddenly stopping in the moaning, Lilith answers Jack.<br>\r\n\"Sure Mistress, how about right now?\" Lilith asks, and says a foreign word while looking Jack in the eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, all the sensations from before in the hot tub, pale in comparison to the log that feels suddenly jammed in Jack's Pussy, as well as the sudden cool sensation of moving in water, causing 'her' nipples to harden almost painfully from the combination of chill and instant arousal. The coup' de' ta for this is Lilith suddenly reaching down and pinching her clit, while pulling on a nipple, all the while still staring into Jack's eyes that suddenly roll into 'her' head, from yet another orgasm overload. <br>\r\n- <br>\r\nWatching Mistress fall unconscious again was slightly funny, but 'she' did have a point. Making this thrall go for over 45 mins was a bit much, especially since i could feel him slowly flagging. Pinching his nipple, he suddenly cums, all the while the changes I had put on him slowly reverted back to normal, though he would find that he was a slight bit bigger when he woke up. Dragging him to the steps, and making sure he isn't likely to fall in and drown in the shallow end, Lilith gets out of the pool. Snapping her fingers, the other two occupants of the pool area (the man and woman who were swapped), suddenly collapsed where they were, with a subtle compulsion to think their evening was a dream. Last thing to do was to pick up her Mistress, put the body on one of the benches near the hot tub, make sure nothing was left behind to break the illusion that the human minds would craft for themselves, then prepare to return home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhasing her arm into her mistress, Lilith yanks, grabbing Jacks soul, which looks brighter than before, more vibrant, and then proceeds to teleport back to her Master's home. 'Well, at least i didn't get a boring master like the last few, this one at least was willing to experiment and push boundaries. This will be a fun time it would seem,' were Lilith's last thoughts, before disappearing in a puff of smoke, and shortly thereafter, the people in the gym slowly woke up with very interesting dreams.</span></div></div>",

He gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you mean that was all real?\" He asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every second, Master\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... fuckin' awesome!\" Jack exclaimed. \"Can we go again?\" He had some very vivid memories of the feelings he got from the asian girl's body and Lilith's spell, and wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which part, Master?\" Lilith inquired. \"You possessing a girl? Me casting a spell so you'd have a mindblowing orgasm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah. All of that.\" Jack nodded, now completely awake and sitting upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about some other powers?\" Lilith suggested. \"You know you can also enthrall people, shapeshift...\" she got a weird look on her face. \"Plus as my Master, you could command me to do things to you...\" With a seductive smokiness to her voice, she continued. \"You can make me be any<i>one</i> you want, and do any<i>thing</i> you want...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stared at Lilith. Was she suggesting he have sex with her? She was a succubus, which was both scary and intriguing at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Master, another thing.\" Lilith said, having come up with something. \"I could share my body with you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean like, fuck?\" Jack asked. \"You've already said that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Master.\" Lilith smiled. \"You could possess me, so to speak.

While having sex with you, and all you mentioned, I'm drawn towards possessing you for a bit,\" Jack states, all the while ogling Lilith's body and imagining all the possibilities it offered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a happy grin forming on her face, and a gleam of excitement in her eyes, Lilith bounces up and down while responding. \"Oh Master, you've just made me the happiest succubus in the last hour! Most Masters go the boring route of simple sex until they get bored, then start learning about the spells. You, my most interesting Master, have decided to jump further down the rabbit hole!\" Jack hears all this halfheartedly, mostly because of the interesting motions Lilith's actions have caused to her breasts, drawing his attention like a moth to a flame.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Upon hearing the last part, Jack snaps out of the distraction of Lilith's bouncing, mostly because you notice her suddenly leap towards you in a flying tackle. As she connects, Jack's perception fades out quickly, as if someone shut off the lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The first thing Jack feels upon consciousness returning, is an incredible amount of lust running through him, almost as if he could set things ablaze if he got any more aroused. After regaining focus, Jack realizes he's no longer on his bed, but standing in his room, before a mirror he knows wasn't there before, especially since it's apparently a floating 6' mirror, with intricate designs flowing around it's frame, almost like words are running along it's edges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Master, you're now me, what are you going to do first,\" you hear Lilith's voice, and realize that your mouth was moving without you controlling it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thinking on her question, and trying to remember your previous ideas before this new adventure, you hit a wall. Each time you try to recall what you were planning, your lust seems to rise, almost as if you were not supposed to recall your previous plans, and simply go with your instinct. As soon as this realization is thought out, you notice that while your arousal has not abated, nor lessened, you can somewhat deal with it momentarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Uh, Lilith, is there any reason why I'm currently having trouble remembering any of my previous plans, and how the instant i thought about following instinct, i stopped getting super horny?\" Jack asks, with some trepidation filling his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Ah, that. Well that kinda happens to newbies when possessing instinctual creatures. If anything, I'm surprised that you figured out the trigger before causing yourself to go on a Lust Induced Rampage. Those are always entertaining, but also the quickest way to break a warlock in to the field of Love and Lust.\" Lilith replies, sounding nonchalant, but also slightly bemused about your predecessors apparent learning curve method.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you were hoping that I would fall into such a state Lilith? Why, that seems like a surefire way to make me, if not others, trust you.\" Jack states, sounding somewhat hurt and worried that he could possibly have trusted the wrong creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh Master, it's nothing to do with trust per-sey, merely one of the many lessons that have to be taught to beginning warlocks. Most will just dive in, without thinking things through, and end up either selling their lives away, or over doing their field, and being bound to another in worse constraints than they would wish. You can trust what i said in the beginning though. I cannot try to harm you, kill you intentionally unless you ask me to, nor devour your soul unless ordered to.\" Lilith states in a soothing tone, that slowly morphs into an upbeat cheer as she ends her explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You never explained any of that when we 'first met' Lilith. If anything, starting out with that in the beginning would have probably helped alleviate some of the concerns that have just sprung up here,\" Jack says in a deadpan tone, noticing in the mirror that 'his' expression matches his voice, with a twitching eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking back, and chuckling with their shared voice, Lilith gets back to the start of her memories of today, and then weakly states, \"Oops, sorry master, must have slipped my mind, since i was so excited to find a new warlock with so much potential brimming in them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Considering what she said, and how his day had gone, Jack cant stay upset with Lilith, since if he was in her situation earlier, with all the years of experience she had, he might make such a mistake as well. Taking a deep breath, and noticing the nice effect it had on his new chest, Jack decides to forgive her this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Lilith, I'll believe you this time, but please try to keep me from getting to far into trouble. While I'm all for fun and new experiences, I do not want to end up like my  predecessors, since from the sound of it, they all did stupid things without stopping to think.\" Jack states, and notices his neutral face suddenly spring into a wide beaming grin, with a wink added into the mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Taking a step away from the mirror, and inspecting your room again, you first notice that your body is on the bed, looking peaceful. Glancing next to it, you notice that while it's not too late, you might want to get a move on with whatever your about to do, otherwise you'll have to either wait till tomorrow, or ask Lilith for some spell to help with your absence tomorrow.<br>\r\n\"So Lilith, since I can't actually plan things out, do you have any suggestions of what to do while you, besides having sex?\" Jack asks, while noticing that his hand had somehow started to slowly rub up and down his body slowly, so as to not apparently draw his attention too soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Master, there are plenty of things to do, though some do lead to sex....considering I'm a succubus, and you are temporarily, technically everything i suggest will eventually lead to sex. Good news is that it will be more experience for you, and mind blowing orgasms if nothing else.\" Lilith states, all the while the wandering hand gives up on its subtle ministrations, and moves up to your breasts, slowly massaging one, then the other. Letting out a low moan, you wait for Lilith to continue on, all the while trying to fight the rising arousal that she's trying to induce in you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you could shape shift, and go out into the town, maybe to a bar, the mall, or even a club. You could go to a place where people are, and practice some of your spells on random people. You could even explore the town with the power of flight, or while ghosting around in spirit form. Honestly, the possibilities are endless, if you could plan that is,\" Lilith continues, while moving your unoccupied hand to start sliding into your pants and rub against your pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Biting your lip, and trying not to moan and give in to the storm that your rising arousal has turned into, you attempt to figure out something to do, otherwise Lilith will apparently choose for you, which at the moment seems to be masturbation, or maybe something more. Opening your mouth to answer, your choice comes out completely unexpectedly in a loud scream as Lilith both plunges her fingers in your pussy, pushing down on your g-spot while pinching your nipple hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jack incoherently chose to ...</span></div></div>",

After shifting around, and trying to get more comfortable, they slowly still, finally realizing something was quite different than the norm. The first thing to tip them off was the feel of the bed sheets, which were quite a bit nicer than he was used to, especially as for some reason he felt like he was sleeping nude. Another reason of difference to the rapidly awakening mind of the young Warlock was the fact that the sun that usually hit them around this time in the morning was absent, leaving them only warm where the sheets and blankets covered. The last thing to tip them off to the oddity was the fact that their hair was in their face....which should be impossible as their hair has never been long enough to do that.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>With a jolt, Jack sits up, looking around...and feeling a weight on their chest swing around, almost causing them to fall out of the bed! Looking down, Jack sees a pair of breasts, lightly tanned, and further down, a sheet covering his lower half, but the sheets feeling against his legs shows that he's likely completely naked. <b>'What the hell is going on?'</b> Jack thinks to himself, slowly trying to figure out if this was an odd dream, or did something happen?<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<i><b>'The last thing I recall was . . . the pool? Does that mean it wasn't a dream? I know last night i thought it was all real, but there was always the chance that I had a mental breakdown. . .'</b> Jack thinks to himself, before a voice speaks up on his right.</i> \"Now that's not nice, i'm sure I made it quite fun enough last night that I didn't break your mind 'mistress'~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Looking over at the source of the voice, Jack exclaims \"<b>Lilith</b>\", before gasping, as he recognized the voice that came out of his mouth instantly!</i> \"What the hell is going on?\" <i>Comes the voice of Jenny, Jack's sister...who he somehow seemed to be in the body of!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why 'Mistress', what ever do you mean? You're a healthy young woman who is quite in her right to sleep nude~\" <i>Lilith replies, her tone hinting at knowing exactly what Jack was meaning, as well as the fact that she was going to tease him over this before finally answering directly.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not funny. What the hell are you up to putting me in Jen?!\" <i>Jack asks, not really wanting to play Lilith's game, even if he couldn't really force her without having the book in hand.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, since you're not even willing to play along. Last night, you woke up after such a nice way of passing out, and had commented on wanting to experiment more, but left the choice up to me. Being the best Succubus and ever so thoughtful, took that to mean that you could have fun living as a college student that you knew reasonably well, knew her friends in a basic sense, and were able to keep an eye on your regular life if need be,\" <i>Lilith finally answers, her tone starting out pouting before launching into explaining what she'd done....smirking at the horrified look that appeared the more Jack grasped that it was possible he could have done such - he did know he talked in his sleep . . .</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Taking a deep breath to stop from freaking out, Jack finally starts to try to figure out what else is going on with this 'experiment'.</i> \"Ok, so while I don't claim to know you very well, you've proven to be mischievous, so what aren't you mentioning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Lilith grins widely, whether from Jack seeming to guess there was more to this, or from seeming to guess her character well, was anyone's guess.</i> \"Well, you'll be her for the whole weekend, and part of Monday as well. You're to figure out how to sync with her memories to better play your part, though if you stumble I will try to help. You're also going to go partying tonight, otherwise you're going to be spending the next week as her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" <i>Jack exclaims, wondering how these terms were even set, and if he could override them!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress, this is to help you learn faster, and last night you did have fun, so just think of this as going a bit further than what you are comfortable with - and what kind of 'lesson' would be without any form of 'punishments'~\" <i>Lilith answers, seeming to guess at what was causing Jack to be against this situation.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nT<i>aking a few minutes to think, while unconsciously shifting around as the chill air was affecting his body in unusual (to him) ways. Sighing, as nothing in her argument was really grounds to fight her on this, Jack accepts he's stuck with this 'experiment'.</i> \"Fine.

Her figure disappeared behind this veil, disallowing Jack a view of her transformation. After a few seconds it all blew away, revealing his succubus servant once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had changed considerably; her already moderately sized bosom has swollen further, approaching the size of canteloupes. Her whole body, in fact, seemed to have gotten curvier: her buttocks, thighs, hips, and even belly were rounder than they were before. Both her hair and skin seemed to darken to a more Latin look. Finally, she was now sporting a sexy maid's outift, complete with a extremely low-cut bustier and a skirt that revealed more than it concealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I look?\" Lillith asked, showing of her chubby new form. \"You like girls like this, no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I mean I do, but this seems-\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong?\" Lilith questioned, wrapping her arms around his neck and pressing her bust into his chest.

His jeans tumbled to the floor in a pile, exposing his worn boxers. No longer restrained by the fabric of the jeans, his cock flopped out of the boxer flap. It was hard a steel and thanks to Lilith's proximity was pressed right into her meaty thighs. With a smile she began to gentle tense her thighs, squeezing his member between her soft flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think your dick sees any issue,\" Lilith joked. She squatted, letting his tip run up her chest as she came face-to-face with the thing. She traced its outline, running a finger from shaft to head. It quivered and spurted out small bits of pre-cum. The white goo drizzled onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please, you have to stop,\" Jack moaned. The sexy Latina replied with a mischievous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You keep saying that, but your body betrays you. Master, please, just stand back and let me handle this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith parted her plump lips, allowing her tongue to slip out. Her moist, dexterous appendage slid around his six inch member, wrapping around it like a snake after its prey.  Her lips then engulfed the head, bringing it entirely into her wet cavern. She began a process of sucking and tugging that quickly proved too much for poor Jack. The pleasure overwhelmed him and he quickly blew his load down Lilith's eager throat. He collapsed on the floor as his shriveling member disappeared into his boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, it's been a long time since I've had fresh semen,\" Lilith said, \"though it was really sour. You need to eat more fruit, master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilith, I told you no,\" Jack said between pants. \"Are you supposed to follow my orders?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I follow your wishes, master. Even if you were saying no I could tell what you really wanted. Speaking of which, we need to talk about you cock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My cock?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, your dick,\" she said. \"Five and a half inches maybe be average for you humans, but as a growing sex god, you really need to improve your tools, if you catch my drift. There are spells in the book to improve your appearance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, this is so wrong...\" Jack mumbled as Lilith picked up the book. She shoved it into his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Read up, master. I think it's time you try another spell and hone your abilities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack opened up the book and thumbed through the pages. He indeed found the spell that would increase the size of his dick. He also found other spells. Ones that would let him control the minds of other and change their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ho, do I detect some dark curiosity?\" Lilith said as she pressed her bountiful bosom into Jack's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shush, this is all you fault. You changed me, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, master. I assure you, your interests are entirely your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was skeptical but turned his attention towards the book.

Looking up to Lilith's face, Jack sees confusion and disappointment flit across it, then a wide smirk forms, with mischief beginning to dance in her eyes. Hoping he hadn't just made things possibly worse, Jack watches on, as Lilith retracts her hand, takes a step back, and starts to shimmer, like a heat wave one would see on a scorching day on pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lilith's maid disguise slowly dissipates into a black smoke, that seems to cling to her bust and pelvis only, teasing with the hint of showing something, but granting no true view. Nearly distracted by the phenomenon of her clothing, Jack's attention is recaptured by the sudden fantastical changes that commence. Lilith's height is the first thing to change, shifting from her shorter-than-Jack stature, to being 6'4', as well as the top of her head looking like her hair is reshaping. Her physique changes from being curvy, to being amazonian like, with abs that put most people to shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In contrast, her arms seem to be slim, but strong looking. Her hands reshape to look dainty, but also seem to have pointed digits instead of how fingers normally look. Her bust's sudden increase in size draws Jack's gaze like a magnet, making his eyes widen, as her generous breasts before this alteration were cantaloupes, and now weighed in at a nice pair of honeydews. Black smoke still obscuring the details, Jack lets his gaze roam over Lilith's new shape, thinking it was over, before gasping as new changes occurred, shocking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lilith's hair hadnt been reshaping, but merely being moved out of the way, as two horns seemed to have slowly grown out of her scalp, reaching a decent size of 4 inches, as well as her eye color finally starting to change from normal human colors, to red iris with black sclera. Hearing a stretching-like sound for the first time, Jack leans to his left, to try to see where the sound came from, and notices a set of wings begin to grow from Lilith's back, as well as a long, sinuous prehensile tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After leaning back to sitting straight up, Jack notices that Lilith's hips have reshaped to be more waspish, and her thighs have lost some of the thickness from her previous form. As the last few changes seem to be taking place, Jack is once again surprised, as Lilith's skin tone begins to change from a dark 'Latin' look to a dark violet. Skin tone finishing up, the black smoke begins to form close to Lilith's body, seeming to reshape into a blood red bustier and G-string ensemble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally finished transforming, Lilith smirks wickedly, and strikes a sexy pose, \"So, Master, is this form enough, or should we try one last time?\" Lilith questions, voice full of teasing and a hint of Lust threading her voice, causing Jack to lowly moan unconsciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Jack chooses- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lilith stepped forward and sprawled her massive form atop her master, pinning his body to the bed. She leaned her head in next to his and whispered into his ear a terrifying and arousing message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm yours for life Master, and I will make sure that you have unmatched pleasure for as long as you live\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she pulled herself back upright as she looked down upon her smaller Master, a wicked smile playing across her face as a thought popped in her mind. The wings on her back opened wide, taking up nearly the whole length of the room, as she arced her back to let out a massive moan. In a split second she dove down atop Jack, her wings wrapping down as well to enclose him in darkness. The sudden lung startled Jack and he closed his eyes for a second, as he did though he felt the weight on his body disappear. He opened his eyes again and looked around his room, but the demon was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that really all just a dream?\" Jack thought out loud as he rubbed his head, footsteps sounding outside his room fast approaching his door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later Christine Thompson opened her sons door, and strode over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack are you ok? I heard a scream coming from your room\" She said worriedly as she reached his bed and sat down next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Mom I'm fine, just a nightmare, I'm sorry if I made you worry\" Jack replied as he sat up and scooted to the edge of his bed next to his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad that's all it was, I can't have anything bad happen to my special little man\" Christine said softly as she ruffled his hair and pulled Jack in for a hug. As she reached around him her night gown opened a little to give Jack a peek beneath. She wasn't wearing any underwear under her gown and he was able to see everything. Christine let out a small giggle as she released her hug only to grab her son and pull him in for a kiss. Jack pulled away and looked his mother up and down, finally realizing it wasn't a nightmare and this was not his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to my mother?\" Jack asked Lilith coldly as she got up from the bed and dropped her gown, leaving her butt naked in front of Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did nothing to her Master, I merely took her shape is all. And what a nice shape it is, I can see why you have such nasty thoughts about your mommy Master\" Lilith retorted, giggling as she caressed Christine's body and played with her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack shook his head and tried to not look at Lilith playing with his mother's body in such a manner. A feat he failed at as she began to moan in his mother's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you please stop that, I don't want to see that\" Jack snapped at her, but she just laughed it off and walked back towards him. Lilith climbed back on the bed as before and trapped Jack under her as she inched her face closer to his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a lie Master, and I know it is a lie because I can see all the dirty thoughts, hopes, and dreams floating through your mind. I know you want your mother and I am only offering a way to satisfy your wants.\" She said as her hand cupped the side of Jack's face in a loving way. Her soft blue eyes looking deep into his as she steadied herself, and melted back into her role. \"So please Jack, please make love to mommy\"</span></div></div>",

We have a connection and I can see every little thing that goes on in that head of yours. I can see an image of your mother and change myself into it.\" And with that she changed into a different version of Christine, her hair messy and tied up, wearing a normal shirt and sweat pants much like how she looked when Jack got home. \"You get it? If you've seen it then so have I. You're like my walking data archive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you know about data archives?\" Jack asked before mentally smacking himself. \"Right right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith giggled, \"Ah, but being dressed like this is so drab!\" she exclaimed changing back to the tanktop, jeans, and boots look. \"Much better! Don't I look great?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I guess.\" he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, you don't want to admit your mother can look good, do you? Okay let's try some other looks then.\" With that her look changed as her hair grew a bit and turned brown and her features became much younger. \"How's this?\" Jenny, Jack's older sister, asked while striking a pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... it's nice.\" Jack stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you two got along great.\" Lilith pouted, \"Oh well, how about this then?\" Her hair shortened considerably becoming closer cropped and turned a red/orange as her skin became paler and freckles dotted her face and shoulders. She shrunk, her body got a little thicker, especially around the hips and ass, and glasses appeared on her face and various piercings in her ear. She was now Jenny's roommate Amber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack perked up a bit at that. Amber was attractive in an attainable way and any time she was over with his sister always came off as really cool and really nice to him. She was one of the people, along with Sarah and another, that Jack definitely had crushes on. Lilith seemed to pick up on this and sidled up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like this one, don't you?\" Lilith cooed in his ear, \"You want her. I could give her to you.\" she kissed him on the lips and pulled away with a smile, \"But not right this second. Let's have a bit more fun first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped back and spent a while shifting through a variety of forms. Sarah in her volleyball outfit, Jack's best friend Alex's girlfriend Kelly in a bikini, Mrs. Simmons a pretty teacher at Jack's school, Ana Cruz the sexy young latina mother down the street, Julie Yamada the 15-year-old daughter of his next door neighbors, Melissa Robinson the head cheerleader at his school, Holly Lewis his sister Samantha's best friend, and then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about this one?\" the girl in the jeans and hoodie, her blonde hair hanging in her face a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's heart stopped a bit, \"Samantha...?\" he asked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith nodded, \"It's me, Jack.\" she said in Samantha's voice. \"Hmm but I could stand to look a little better.\" With that she went back to her \"usual\" outfit of the tanktop, jeans, and boots with her hair out of her face. She looked... pretty. \"Do I look better now?\" she asked and it was all Jack could do to nod. Lilith walked over to him and placed a hand on his cheek, \"I told you I could see your thoughts Master. I know how withdrawn Samantha is from you compared to Jenny and you wanted a closer relationship with her.\" She takes the other hand and places it onto his other cheek. \"But this close? My you certainly are full of surprises. Not that things like this are new for me of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she pulled Jack in and kissed him on the lips slowly and deeply. Maybe the link went both ways and you were pulling things from her head because you felt like a master at this. She then pulled away, looked up at him, and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack had always felt protective of Samantha as she had been picked on quite a bit when she was younger. The two of them had been close because of it but as she grew older she seemed to have resented him stepping in for her all the time. And while she had friends they weren't many and thus she always seemed miserable and lonely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was also wrong in that Jack wanted to be close to Samantha in THAT way, he suspected she was using it to mess with him, simply that he'd like to repair his relationship between them. But as she morphed her clothes away, pulled down his pants, and reached into his boxers with one of his sister's slim hands he realized it was too late to stop. And besides this wasn't really Samantha, merely Lilith using her appearance. But... maybe he should tell her to change forms if they were going to do this.</span></div></div>",

Instinctively, you call out, \"Wait, Sam,\" and take a step to go after her. Unfortunately, your brain forgot that your pants were around your ankles, and you tumble onto the floor. A quick pull and button puts you back on your feet and into the hall headed for Sam's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's music playing from her room, and the door is cracked, so you rap lightly and poke your head in. Your sister is swaying to the beat with her back to you and taking her clothes off. Obviously she didn't hear you knock as she pulls off her blouse then slides off the baggy pants she usually wears. You want to pull back and give her privacy, but her lovely figure entrances you with just her bra and panties on. The way she's swaying is so sensuous that you again become excited pushing against the front of your pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea that your fourteen year old little sister had such a sexy figure under her frumpy clothes had never occurred to you. Maybe that's why you continue to watch as her hands come up behind her back to unfasten her bra shaking it off so it drops to the floor. Her bare back is so silky and smooth that you just want to run your hands across it. As she dances on, she slides her panties down kicking them away to reveal a nice, little, firm buttocks not yet swollen into those padded rumps of older women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely naked now, her movements become even more sensual to you. Your mind is spinning on how wrong it is being a voyeur of your own sister, and yet you can't make yourself stop.

What does that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means that if you enjoy something, there's nothing wrong with it. Your mind just has put aside the negative feelings so you can have what you really want. It is the basic first step. It builds your confidence, and you then feel comfortable doing it and even stretching to do more. Let's take an example. Have you ever sneaked out or done something your parents told you not to do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't stop for an answer, and as she continues, your mind is paralleling her words with memories of exactly that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, you have. There's lots of times that you did it. At first you were scared, but then it seemed OK. It never really hurt anyone, it just made you feel good. So the next time and the time after that, you didn't even think twice about doing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense, but how do I get past that first scary time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly. There is no scary times any more, because if you want it, it will happen. You're master of the book, and it has all the knowledge and tricks to make all your fantasies come true. If you want a date with a particular girl, all you do is ask and she will say yes. It's that easy. There's even a way to get rid of those negative feelings so you don't even have them any more. Sort of a shortcut if you are really, really scared of some things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis all sounds great. The main reason you've never asked Sarah out was fear of rejection. Maybe you just need to start letting the book do its job and not questioning your confidence or the result. Although, you're still not sure how to approach her or what would be the best way to ask. She always has some friends around, and that makes you nervous. If only you could meet  alone just long enough to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, maybe using the shortcut is the way. It would eliminate all those negative thoughts and just let you enjoy whatever you wanted. The book will still do its job, but you wouldn't be so nervous about doing anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Master, what shall it be? Do you want to work learn how to speak with confidence and persuasion and train you emotions, or do you want me to show you the page where you can get rid of any emotion that would prevent you from obtaining your desires?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She swiped her right hand and as if there was a huge wind blasting it, the tome flipped open and the pages were rippling over until it suddenly stopped at a particular page. Lilith then gestured you to come over and take a look at it. You then tried to read what's written in the page. However, you cannot read a thing.

It was not that the word changed into English, more like you understand the language now. Apparently, all you have to do was to chant a rather long spell, and a very foreign one to your mouth at that! It seemed like although you could read and understand the language, saying it was something else. After a a good 10 minutes of reading, now you were sure on how to spell the magic words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm ready now,\" you said out loud, more to yourself than to Lilith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but be careful Master.

We could be having fun right here, and even make it more interesting by adding more than just your mother, or sister.

Speaking of, are there spells in the book to make the book invisible to all but you and me?\" you ask, not pausing in looking through his clothing choices, debating about whether to simply buy new clothes at the mall, or ask if you can conjure or transfigure clothing yourself. While pondering, you feel two soft breasts suddenly push against your back, as Lilith embraces you from behind, slowly grinding her body on yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Well yes, there is a way to do so Master, but why would you need such a spell, it's not like other people can read it, only those the book are bound to,\" Lilith murmurs in your ear, slowly reaching down and rubbing against your cock, still attempting to entice you into staying at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Snaking a hand behind yourself, you reach down with unnatural accuracy, and catch Lilith's clit without looking, and pinch it, causing her to let go and collapse to the floor in shock, spasming and moaning from the sudden orgasm you induced. Finishing the choice of clothing, you put on the clothes, deciding that you'll head to the mall first, get some new clothes, and probably experiment while doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0Regaining her breath from the sudden orgasm, Lilith slowly stand up, eyes brimming with untold amounts of Lust. \"While I'm not complaining about surprise or random orgasms Master, was there a reason for that?\" Lilith questions, not moving towards you, but also looking as if she wishes she could pounce on you and ravage you on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, you looked like you wouldn't stop trying to keep me here unless I got your attention, and it's easy to cause you to orgasm, since you seem to always be ready to go,\" you state, turning around to look Lilith in the eye, then picking up the book, again, without even looking at your target. Handing the book over, you simply cross your arms over your chest, and continue to stare at Lilith, who gets the prompt, and opens the book to a page near the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Can you read anything on this page Master,\" Lilith asks, curiosity tinging her tone. Looking at the page she indicated, you can make out one in every four words, not enough that you would want to try guessing at casting whatever the spell is. You say as much to Lilith, who sighs, seeming to have guessed such an outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, that means that your previous spell helped you gain some 'experience', but you need more if you wish to cast this one on your own. In the mean time, I can cast it for you, and possibly walk you through the steps to learning how to cast it without the book's instructions, but that would require you to stay here,\" Lilith explains, while putting the book down, and slowly cupping her breasts and turning into the form of Sarah, pouting while rubbing her thighs together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\"Cute try Lilith, but i'm still going out. How long will the spell last on the book if you cast it?\" You ask, picking the book back up, and putting it under your arm. Looking around, you make sure to grab your keys and cellphone before stepping towards the door, and stopping at it to turn around and look at Lilith, who sighs and finally answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"About 8 hours as long as not too much attention is drawn to it, Master. You still haven't explained the why of you wanting it done Master,\" Lilith states, while moving close enough to run her hands in intricate patterns over the book under your arm. A bright flash of purple fills the room, and you open the door, stepping out, while quietly answering Lilith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Simple, while people would not be able to read the book, it would be kinda obvious to others that it is the key to messing with people, if i'm reading from it, and making gestures, and others see strange things occurring while i'm nearby with it. This way, even if people attribute strange things to me, the book is left out of the equation to others,\" you explain, all the while quietly making his way down the stairs, and out the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0A 10 minute walk later has you at the mall entrance, noticing minor differences, now that your societal filters are turned off. Lots of beautiful children and lust inducing women wander the mall, while also giving you plenty of targets for experimentation... After you get those new clothes that is. Who knows, you might even find someone fun to do while getting said clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\"That's the spirit Master, though hopefully you'll be willing to share,\" Lilith whispers into your ear from behind, after molding herself into your back, rubbing herself against you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

He also noticed that her fingernails had lengthened well past her fingertips, appearing professionally manicured with white tips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally, these are nice,\u201d Lilith said, pointing at the couple of small silver rings through the side of Amber\u2019s ear, \u201cbut I want to expand on it.\u201d A small ring appeared through her left nostril, silver barbells through her nipples, a charm dangling from her navel, and -- Jack gulped when he saw them glinting -- a few rings through her genitalia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what do you think?\u201d asked Lilith, once again posing sexily, with one hand on her hip and her other arm across her chest below the breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh...\u201d Jack didn\u2019t know what to say, although he realized the contents of his boxers were definitely reacting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe porn-star version of Amber finally leaned in and put her arms around his neck. She licked her glossy pink lips, and Jack saw that she had a silver stud through her tongue. \u201cOnce you learn a few things from the book,\u201d she said in a low voice, \u201cyou could transform the real Amber into this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put her hands on Jack\u2019s cheeks and kissed him, more intensely than she had as Samantha, then broke and slowly started moving a hand down Jack\u2019s body. \u201cAre you ready for this <i>now?\u201d</i> she asked.</span></div></div>",

Even though I know that it isn't really her, I can't do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith looked genuinely disappointed. \"But Master...\" she pouted in Samantha's naked body, which to Jack was kind of disturbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok fine, Master, if you wish it.\" Lilith said, and morphed back to her 'usual' clothed state. She still did look a little upset, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lilith,\" Jack asked, \"Can you morph back into someone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, master!\" Lilith perked up. \"Anything you wish...\" she said in a seductive tone, still in Samantha's body. She was definitely doing this just to mess with him, Jack figured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who's the lucky girl I get to be, hmm?\" Lilith said, and began to morph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, she changed back into Jenny, still wearing the same tank top, jeans and boots. \"This one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack just gave her a flat stare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess not...\" Lilith morphed again, turning around and morphing again. She turned full circle, now blonde hair flowing free as her jeans turned into a short blue skirt that fanned out, revealing slim, toned, sexy legs. Her tank top had tightened over her now smaller breasts, and was a similar blue color. She was the head cheerleader, Melissa Robinson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack perked up. Melissa was sexy, and he could definitely stand to have Lilith do things to him in her body. But Lilith still didn't seem satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, don't you like this body?\" she asked in Melissa's voice, slightly pouting, and walked up to him. She straddled him, pushing Melissa's crotch right up against the growing bulge in Jack's boxers. \"Ohh, I feel that, Master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do like that, <i>Melissa</i>,\" Jack started, deciding to finally just ask for who he had <i>really</i> wanted ever since Lilith had morphed into her. \"But I'd prefer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith began to morph again. It was a strange sensation, having her morph while mounting him. Her hair turned brown, face began to slightly reposition itself, and became ever so slightly more tan. Her breasts enlarged just a little bit, and her cheerleader's top seemed to ride up until it exposed a good amount of midriff. Her skirt began to collapse in on itself until it was a small pair of athletic shorts. Jack looked up and saw the girl he had a massive crush on for the last couple of years, with a suggestive look in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Sarah.\" he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi!\" Sarah - Lilith - responded cheerfully. \"Glad we could finally get on the same page.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where were we?\" She asked seductively, exaggerating a hip thrust over Jack's crotch, and standing up. She drew a line across his face with her index finger, ran it down his shirt, and hooked into his boxers. \"I think I remember...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith reached down with Sarah's dainty hands and yanked off Jack's boxers, leaving his erect cock standing, no longer hidden inside his underwear. Sarah's hands moved to stroke Jack's pulsing member, and just as he felt that he was going to blow, they retreated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-uh, Master, can't have that yet, can we?\" Lilith mocked, mimicking Sarah's voice perfectly. The anticipation was almost killing Jack, watching the body of his crush standing over him, teasing him. \"But since you're so eager...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to undress. Jack watched intently - possibly too intently, if there was such a thing - as Lilith moved Sarah's hands gently to her sides and slowly, shaking her hips, removed her shorts. She had morphed some panties onto herself, evidently. She moved her hands to her panties, and began to stroke her pussy through the panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, I want you.\" she moaned, and kept stroking her pussy. Then, she lifted her top over her head, slowly, exposing a thin lace bra through which Jack had a very good view of Sarah's breasts. \"But first, this needs to go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe unhooked Sarah's bra from behind, and threw it onto Jack's face. Jack didn't complain, he was too busy staring at Sarah's now completely exposed, erect nipples. He was exhaling harder, feeling like he was about to burst at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like...?\" Lilith teased in Sarah's voice, and Jack responded with a nod, seemingly lost for words. She stroked Sarah's nipples with her hands, and stepped closer, raising Jack's hands up to her breasts. Jack cupped Sarah's breasts and squeezed. They were very firm, and Lilith moaned in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving had enough of her teasing for the moment, Lilith removed Sarah's panties - <i>finally</i>, thought Jack - and mounted him again. This time, his erect cock slid right into her waiting, moist pussy. It was a feeling like none Jack had ever experienced. It was so warm, so pleasant. And then Lilith began to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thrusted up and down, riding Jack's cock like a mechanical bull, moaning and pushing her breasts into Jack's face as she did. The warmth and pleasant feeling in Jack's cock continued to increase, until he could barely contain it - he curled up his toes, relishing in the pleasure - and then he came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh yes...\" Lilith moaned in Sarah's sexy voice, and continued to ride Jack. He was still hard, and was still enjoying himself, but he was feeling a little tired. But, he thought, how often would he be able to fuck Sarah the way he wanted? He didn't complain, especially since her breasts were still in his face. He was still grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later, he felt the feeling come back to his cock, and he was growing hard again. He was about to go for a second round. Sarah shoved him down onto his bed and twisted around, and within seconds Jack found himself on top of her, with her legs spread around him. He began to do what felt natural, and thrust his cock hard into her waiting pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, yes!\" Sarah shrieked in ecstasy as Jack came for a second time. \"Oh fuck, that was amazing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack, completely spent, collapsed onto Sarah's chest, and lay there, panting. It certainly was an amazing experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah sat up, and began to morph. Lilith, back in her tank top, jeans and boots, legs casually hanging off the side of Jack's bed, sat next to Jack with a huge grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you like that, Master?\" she asked, but she already knew the answer. Jack only smiled weakly, still exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what can revitalize you, Master...\" Lilith casually mentioned, standing up and facing Jack. \"How about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh, I know! How about I show you a different perspective...\" Lilith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... what do you mean?\" Jack asked, not being entirely sure of what she meant. He had just gotten a taste of what Lilith could do, and had enjoyed almost every second of it. However, when dealing with a succubus, Jack figured that he should at least find out what he was getting himself into first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, I know you're tired, but <i>come on</i>! A different perspective... see through someone else's eyes... be someone else for a bit.\" Lilith explained, although Jack felt she could have been a bit more patient with him. He was, after all, new to this whole sex demon thing she had going. Although he was intrigued by what she had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. And how will this revitalize me?\" Jack asked, although he felt that he already knew the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's easy. Right now, both your body and soul are worn out. Your soul, though, recovers a lot faster. If we put it into a different body, you'll feel good as new!\" said Lilith. So, Jack was close on his guess - he didn't know about the whole soul thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, umm... who am I gonna be?\" Jack asks carefully. He had never thought about this kind of thing before, but the idea did interest him. Trying out someone else's life might be fun. Then, he had an idea. Kelly, his friend Alex's girlfriend, was quite hot. If he were... \"What about Alex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Master, that's so boring!\" Lilith complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides\", she said, casually morphing herself into Kelly, wearing nothing but a tiny black bikini. She was shorter than average, and had shoulder-length blonde hair that was not tied back. In Kelly's voice, she continued, \"If you want me, you can have me. In a way not even Alex can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last part was said with a mischievous tone, as Lilith walked over to Jack. Exaggerating her movements to shake her (although small) breasts and hips, she sat on Jack's lap and gave him a quick kiss. Jack, still exhausted, only halfheartedly responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we'll save this one for later,\" Lilith said, morphing back, but keeping the bikini. Her much larger breasts were pushing it to its limits, but it held. \"Although I could put you <i>in</i> Kelly, and give you some alone time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that was something Jack hadn't even considered. Being a girl? Being Kelly? He wasn't sure. Wouldn't it be weird? Jack remained silent, not sure at all what to make of the situation. Next thing he knew, Lilith grabbed his shoulder, and pulled. It was a very strange sensation - almost like his shoulder had gone numb. Then his whole arm, then his chest... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Jack said, startled, as he was pulled up into a sitting position, looking back at <i>himself </i>still lying on the bed, eyes closed. \"What happened? Why am I there? Am I... dead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Master, you're not dead.\" Lilith reassured him. \"Remember what I said about your soul? I've just temporarily separated it from your body. You aren't experienced enough to do it yourself yet, but that will come with time. Now let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith pulled Jack up into the air and stood up next to him, still wearing the bikini that was several sizes too small in the chest department. Then she vanished, and Jack's world went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack woke up - if he could call that waking up. He was still a ghost, Lilith was still standing next to him, except he wasn't in his room. He didn't recognize where he was, and the lights were out so he couldn't really see properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nifty, isn't it, Master? I can't teleport physical matter, but your soul isn't physical, and neither really am I. Now, where were we?\" Lilith said, as if reading his mind. He heard a door creak open, and a sliver of light enter the room. \"Oh, looks like you're up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith threw him towards the opening door, and he stumbled forward. Jack found himself somehow facing the inside of the room again - that was odd - and felt a little different. He felt more solid. Almost as if he was back in his body. He fumbled for a light switch on the wall, finding one after a couple of seconds. What he saw shocked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was standing in a girl's bedroom. The main giveaway was the wardrobe. It was open, and Jack could see dresses of varying lengths and colors hanging inside. He carefully made his way closer to the wardrobe, hoping to find a mirror. Of course, there was a mirror. He caught sight of his reflection and gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring back at him, shocked expression on her face, was Kelly. She was wearing a loose-fitting white t-shirt over tight jeans, and was wearing lime green ankle socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\" Jack muttered, seeing Kelly's reflection do the same. He shook his head, and blonde hair seemed to go everywhere. \"Oh, right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying yourself?\" Lilith asked. Jack had almost forgotten she was here. \"Now, I'll make sure no one bothers you until tomorrow morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? What do you mean?\" Jack asked, noticing his voice for the first time. Definitely Kelly's voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly that. Be a good girl now, <i>Kelly</i>...\" Lilith seemed to place particular emphasis on the last phrase, and disappeared in a puff of red smoke, leaving Jack completely alone in Kelly's room. And, he remembered, in her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.\" Jack thought, aloud. \"What am I going to do with myself now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was already enjoying himself in Kelly's body, just hearing her voice come out of his mouth was remarkably entertaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi! I'm Kelly, and I'm hot!\" Jack said, pushing his hip to the side, and raising his finger to his lips. Kelly's reflection mimicked him. \"Shhhh. Don't tell anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack ran his hands around the edge of his jeans - well, Kelly's jeans - and reached into her pocket, pulling out a phone. The jeans were really tight, he noted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what to do...\" Jack said, eyeing Kelly's reflection. He always did have a bit of a thing for her, but she was dating his best friend and was forever out of his reach. Until now. On the other hand, Jack thought, eyeing the phone still in his hand, he could totally screw with Alex's head right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what was it going to be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So, he threw Kelly's phone on her bed, and faced the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... Kelly sure is cute,\" Jack thought. Kelly's short, blonde figure stared back at him in the mirror, copying his every movement. The white t-shirt billowed slightly as Jack moved, rarely giving Jack a quick glimpse of Kelly's midriff. He found himself moving slightly more, hips swaying slightly, just to get a bit more of a look. Her legs and ass - and the tight blue denim that covered them - also had his attention. Kelly was pretty thin, with very shapely legs and a small, pert ass. Jack smiled at himself, and saw Kelly's reflection return the favor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could do this for a while... \" Jack said, continuing to half dance around Kelly's room, eyes glued to the mirror. After one particularly enthusiastic move, he felt a bit of a pull on his chest. That drew his attention down, to his own body. Kelly's body - and what was under her baggy white shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had never thought anything special of Kelly's chest - she was pretty flat in that department. Looking down through her own eyes, Jack didn't change his mind at all. He did get interested, though. One quick motion later, and Kelly's white shirt flew off and joined her phone on her empty bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked at his reflection in the mirror again - now, the Kelly staring back at him was wearing only a thin white bra on her torso, covering her breasts. He stepped up close, nearly touching the mirror. He admired his reflection, noting that he could see Kelly's nipples through her bra. Unable to resist, he caressed them through the bra, getting a pleasant tickling feeling from them. He also noticed a curious sensation coming from his crotch - it felt a little bit moist, and almost nagging a little. That was new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly's hands, under Jack's careful direction, moved down Kelly's exposed stomach, and made their way to her jeans. Jack caressed his thighs, and squeezed his ass. The feeling in his crotch was growing. He began to blush slightly, and looked up to see a slightly red-faced Kelly, half squatting half leaning, hands on her legs. He grinned again. This was too much fun. Jack stood and stretched, feeling a rush just from being inside Kelly's small, fit body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped onto the bed and laid down - it was very plush and comfortable. A lot more than his own, at least. In front of him, giving him a perfect view of himself, was the mirror. </span></div></div>",

This time around, Jack accidentally releases a succubus from an age old book of dark magic.<br>\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br>\r\nReally no limits on what to add, but please try to keep chapters over a few words. It's not entertaining to constantly sift through one or two sentence chapters. Also, please try to keep chapters grammatically acceptable so that the flow of the story is not broken. Other than that the only other rule (guideline, really) is try to keep gay material to a minimum. I reserve the right to remove chapters that I believe detract from the story as a whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Thompsons:<br>\r\nJack Thompson (18): A high school student (lakewood high), in the second month of his senior year. He has brown hair, brown eyes, and a large build. 6' tall, He isn't fat by any stretch of the imagination, but he isnt too muscular either. He is a smart kid, he just doesnt apply himself, and therefore gets good but not great grades. Overall an average person in almost every other aspect (social life, sports etc.).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark Thompson(44): Jack's dad, a semi-wealthy businessman. He provided a middle class lifestyle for his family, and owns his own firm as a financial advisor. Because of this, he often has to work long hours. Looks and acts a lot like Jack, although he is slightly more serious due to his profession. A family man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine Thompson(43): Jack's mom. She is a stay at home mom, since Mark's business does pretty well. She is blonde with blue eyes, and a good figure for her age. She likes to stay in shape, and try to eat healthy (because that's the craze nowadays), but is a pretty relaxed person. For her, family has always come first, and she is always concerned about her kids and husband. She has an average intelligence, and has a bubbly personality, which makes her a good people person, and always tries to be an optimist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny Thompson(19): Jack's older sister. She has brown hair and brown eyes, and more of her mom's personality and looks. She and Jack often get along, but can fight just as much (as any siblings do). She goes to the nearby college, and will come home and visit on the weekends, or come over for dinner when she has time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha Thompson (14): Jack's younger sister. A freshman in highschool, and an average student. She could get her mom's looks one day, but for now she is just an average teenage girl. She is almost always texting, or hanging out with friends but doesnt mind spending time with the family. She and Jack are more extreme in regards to their relationship than Jack and Jenny. They can very well be the best of friends; the closest siblings in the world. If he catches her on a bad day though, she can be a bitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex (17): Jack's best friend since the beginning of middle school. 6' and skinny, he has blonde hair blue eyes. Him and Jack are almost always on the same page, or trying to crack jokes at whatever is going on. He is a hard worker, but loves to hang out with friends. Not an unpopular guy, but he doesn't make an effort to be popular. Good student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly (16): Alex's girlfriend of a year. She is always hanging out with Alex, and the two have a strong relationship. Her and Jack get along too, but don't really have too much in common. She is a grade lower than the two, although she has known them since she started high school. Blonde with blue eyes. A good figure and somewhat athletic, but she is a bit flatter chested. A nice personality, and smart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah (17): Jack's crush. She is a varsity vollyball player in his American history course. She has brown hair, brown eyes, and a killer figure. She is nice, and smart, but her popularity keeps her busy. She and Jack have been friends for a few months, and have hung out once or twice, but as he isn't one of her main friends she and him don't talk too much. She does well in school, but not great. She doesn't have a boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith: The succubus. She is bound to the book and Jack, as he is the owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that's enough backstory. Feel free to add characters as we go, just be sure to give some description. Let's get going!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun, and enjoy!</td>",
