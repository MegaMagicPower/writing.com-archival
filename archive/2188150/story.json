            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After school on a Friday, you head in to the lab where you and a few friends are working on a device that can shrink or grow things. You are the only one there, so you decide to just go over the specs and view some of the info from prior test runs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine works rather well, but has given the occasional glitch, so before you roll it out as completed, you and your friends have decided to clear as many bugs as possible. While casually scrolling away through the pages upon pages of info, you hear someone walk in and close the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this is where you go every night, huh?\u201d You turn around to see Caiden standing there. He has his black tank top on with his jeans and black vans. His backpack is slung over his back by one strap. He looked like the typical skater guy, even though he didn\u2019t skateboard. \u201cPretty much, yeah. We finally have it working well, the machine that is.\u201d You reply back, Caiden walks over, sits down in a chair across from the table the machine is on and stares at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo whats this thing do again?\u201d He asks. \u201cIt can grow or shrink any object. We even found a way for it to make things softer or harder. By soft, I mean, almost like a rubber, clay style soft.\u201d You reply, Caiden visibly puzzled just smiles and nods his head. \u201cHere, i\u2019ll give you a demonstration. You grab the remote to control the machine and set a wood pencil on the desk. After setting the machine up, you set the pencil as the target, and press fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the machine lit up, aiming itself at the pencil. It starts to make a light whirring sound and then it shoots a bright light out, the pencil on the desk started to grow rapidly, about three times its original size in fact. You grab it and show him what the \u201csoftener\u201d feature does by bending and molding the pencil. It doesn\u2019t break and just acts like putty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty cool, huh?\u201d You say excitedly. You look up at Caiden and he just chuckled while shaking his head. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s cool and all, but really? Whats this thing even good for?\u201d You set the pencil down and roll your eyes. \u201cIt can be used to grow food and make more for people to eat, or shrinking a couch to move it easily. Thats why the machine is only the size of a small lamp. Ease of use.\u201d You and your friends have put hours, days, weeks even of your time into this project, it kinda stings that Caiden shows little to no interest. \u201cCan it shrink people? Or grow them?\u201d Caiden suddenly says, you cock your head a bit and raise an eyebrow. \u201cWhy would that matter?\u201d You ask, puzzled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t, but don\u2019t you think it\u2019d be cool? Be able to shrink down and run under doors, and get close to smaller things we normally ant see small.\u201d Caiden replies back quickly. \u201cWell, we haven\u2019t tested it on a living organism. It never was really designed for it.\u201d You set the remote down and stand next to the machine. \u201cMight be worth checking out though. Might have some uses.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaiden set his backpack down on the table, when he did, the strap on the one side slapped down on the remote tablet that controls the machine, hitting the shrink button that was displayed. Caiden hadn\u2019t noticed yet, but the machine was pointing right at you, and when he reached in his bag, the strap hit the fire button. In almost an instant, a bright flash and a loud buzz. Caiden shielded his eyes, and when the light went away, you were gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of him, he saw the tablet flashing \u201cProcess complete, proceed to menu?\u201d He was unsure what just happened, the last he saw you, you were by the table. He thought maybe you walked outside without him noticing. So he pressed the ok button on the tablet, and grabbed his bag and started to walk away. \u201cMaybe he won\u2019t know I messed it up? What did I do anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n______________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoices:<br>\r\n1. At 1-2 inches tall, you appear to be nothing more than a bug Caiden won\u2019t know where you went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. 3-5 inches tall, Caiden might notice you while he leaves the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The blinding light of the machine basically immobilized you. You lay on the floor, waiting for your vision to clear, when it finally does, you notice your ears are ringing. You look around, everything is huge! <i>Shit, the machine shrunk me. I wonder if Caiden is still here, maybe he saw me shrink? Did the machine actually shrink me? Damn. This is crazy.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n Your thoughts were cut off when you heard a boom from around the corner, your ears still slightly ringing, you figured it must have been Caiden, you venture out in the middle of the aisle between the two tables. You see Caiden walk out from the other side. Coming straight for you, you start to jump, trying to gain his attention. But he isn\u2019t looking down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Does he not know I shrunk? Shit, I need to get out of his way!</i> By the time you think of this you see the sole of Caidens Vans, the waffle pattern is coming down on you, everything feels like it\u2019s in slow motion.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your reaction time wasn\u2019t quite quick enough. Then again, I doubt it would matter, his sole came down like a falling building. All you heard was a loud bang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaidens sole made contact with the ground, as he took his step, he unknowingly just smashed his friend into the waffle pattern of his Vans. The now shrunk Brian is pasted to the sole of his friends shoe, much like how gum looks when stepped on. Caiden lifted his foot and kept walking, he didn\u2019t think much of the slight squelch and stick from his shoe sole, and the floors in the school seem to do that when he wears these shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the sole of the sneaker, Brian has realized he isn\u2019t dead, surprisingly. <i>Wait, how? Did the machine also make my body soft? I didn\u2019t think it could do this stuff to a human...</i> He realized too that he didn\u2019t feel much from getting smashed. It feels like hes getting a light slap, except it\u2019s all over his body. With each step Caiden takes, Brian can feel the momentum. His gooey body collects dirt and debris from the floor. When he got smashed, after the first few steps Brians clothes basically tore off his body. If someone saw Caidens sole, it would look like he stepped on a 2 inch chunk of skin colored Play-Doh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaiden proceeded to walk out of the school and start heading home. Little did he realize the torment he\u2019s putting his friend through right now. Caiden took the normal route he took home. He walked down the sidewalk most of the way, then cut through the dirt path near the playground and then into his backyard. On the sole of his Vans, the little brian now looked like a black clump of dirt. Completely flattened into the groove of the sole. Caiden walked inside, kicked his shoes off at the door and walked to his bedroom. Leaving the poor shrunken Brian stuck to the Vans downstairs. The shoe Brian was on laid flat on the ground, not allowing him to even try to un stick him self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrians mind was racing. He didn\u2019t know what to think. His brain was basically scrambled. He was just glad he didn\u2019t have the pressure of Caidens weight on him anymore. Now, he just wanted to get off this shoes sole.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After what felt like years, you hear someone approaching. It was really about an hour since Caiden got home, but it felt like years to you. You suddenly feel the sneaker you\u2019re stuck to lifting up. The sole was held backwards so you just saw behind whoever was holding the shoe. Was this Caiden? Why did he come grab his shoes randomly? At the top of the stairs you noticed whoever had the shoes in their grasp turned left, Caidens room was down the right hall. That must mean, this is his brother, Joey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut why did he grab Caidens shoes? Did he confuse them for his? No... Maybe he could find you on the sole and take you to Caiden. Then suddenly the shoes were dropped to the floor, the sole you were on facing the ceiling, you can see, it is definitely Joeys room. You could hear him above you, mumbling to himself on his bed. <i>what is this boy up to?</i> you think, then suddenly, he leans his arm over the side and grabs the shoe you were stuck to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then realize, to your horror, the real reason he grabbed his brothers shoes. He had his tablet set up against the wall so he could watch the porn that was up, as he was jerking himself watching, he started to rub the sneakers sole on his dick. You felt the friction, the young boys cock rubbing up the shoe sole, and rubbing on you. You were disgusted. Or so you thought, you could feel your own flattened penis trying to rise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, why is this turning me on, stop...</i> The boy started to speed up his rhythm. You felt erect penis pop up on one of the strokes, then get flattened against your body when he came back, then Joey pumped again, sliding your penis back and getting it smashed between his cock and the shoe sole. This boys penis wasn\u2019t all that big, but it wasn\u2019t small either, especially for his age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Joey neared completion, he laid the shoe flat on his stomach and finished rubbing himself with his hand, and blew his load all over the sole of the sneaker, some even got passed the shoes sole and onto his chest. Joey was panting and wiped the dribble from his chest with his finger and licked it, he then took the shoe and raised it to his face, and started to lick the semen from its sole, running his tongue along it, he catches something weird, and looks down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of him, is what looks like a black chunk of dirt, but it\u2019s shaped weird. Almost, like a tiny human? Thats when he starts to peel you off, and he sees your scuffed up, dirty penis, and your body starts to reform its shape now that it\u2019s detached from the shoe. Joey, while absolutely confused, smiles with an evil look. He spits on your body and wipes it on the floor, cleaning some of the dirt from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, well, well. What do we have here? How\u2019d Brian wind up on Caidens big sneaker sole? Did you like my cock rubbing your body? I see that little chub you got.\u201d Joey mockingly said to you. \u201cYou need to take me to Caiden, Joey, he can get me grown back to full size.\u201d You plead to the giant boy in front of you. You try not to respond to his mocking questions, you don\u2019t want to think about wat just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy should I? The way I see it, with you shrunk like this, you can\u2019t take Caiden from me. I think a better plan for you would be to just get accustomed to being my little play thing.\u201d The words he just said to you sent shivers down your back, did he really just say that? You\u2019re not a play thing, you\u2019re a person, given a small person, but that\u2019s not relevant. \u201cJoey, this isn\u2019t a joke, ple-\u201c Right in the middle of you talking Joey flicked your body with his free hand. \u201cDon\u2019t call me Joey, i\u2019m master now. Understand?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flick hurt, but not much. It felt more like pain than being flattened under sole. You knew there wasn\u2019t much of a choice here, but maybe this is just a sick game? Should you give in, or resist Joey?</span></div></div>",

Your mechanical knowledge paired with a few science type students turned out a machine that can grow or shrink objects. Originally designed to make moving large items easier or making food larger to sustain more people, it was never meant to be used on people. But one day when in the lab, something goes wrong, and you wind up shrunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian (You): 18, He is average in about every way, originally 6\u2019 1\u201d and has a slightly muscular build.
