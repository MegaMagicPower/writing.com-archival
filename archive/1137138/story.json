Called his girl friend, and went off to work. He hated his job, but he needed the cash. He worked at a fast food place, he thought it was so degrading. When he got there he did his best, but to the boss that wasn\u2019t good enough, he kept yelling at him, even if he did nothing wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter working till his shift was over he went back to his house, \u201cYo\u2026 Ash\u2026 I\u2019m home\u2026\u201d he yelled coming in.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Something came for you\u2026 a package\u2026 it\u2019s in your room\u2026\u201d A'shter said coming into the room, John and A'shter where good friends, even though many people didn\u2019t think a lion anthro and Naga could get along, they did. <br>\r\n\u201cThanks\u2026\u201d John said going up the stairs\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there on his bed like A'shter had said, was a package. John looked at it and went up to it and opened it looking at what was inside. There was a weird looking gun, with grow and shrink on it. There were also some other buttons, but John just looked back in the box it came in to see a card, on it is said \u2018From Shub\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShub?\u201d John thought, \u201cWho the hell is Shub?\u201d then he remembered some old wife\u2019s tail about the most powerful and first God of our Galaxy or something was called Shub. John shrugged it of and looked back at the gun\u2026 \u201cI wonder if it works\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A light came from it and hit John, a strange feeling came over him, quickly followed by pain as he saw his clothes where getting smaller, but looking around the room it was he that was getting bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tear ran down his face as his pants started getting too tight. His shirt was first to go, being ripped to shreds. The rest didn\u2019t last long after that. John looked around at what was happening. Then the feeling went. He stopped growing.

A'shter never rubbed it in, but John did feel weaker than him. But now John was bigger. John smiled, and went and opened the door and almost got stuck going through it, he went down stairs almost hitting his head on the lights and roof several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got to the living room he looked around then sighed seeing that A'shter wasn\u2019t there.

When it had fully passed and finished, he looked down at black feet, black hands a slightly white belly and orange everywhere else besides his black ear tips. Another look around showed he'd also lost some height, to now stand at 8 ft tall rather than the 10 he was earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel too, was a fox. The difference of their species had always been a problem, but not now! The question was, would she even recognize him? There really seemed only one way to find out, go see her. She wouldn't believe a random fox to be her boyfriend though, so he'd grow more and go over as the giant, random fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another though, John turned to Ash and blasted him back to normal size, saying, \"we can have fun later, I gotta run.\" And run was the truth, Rachel lived way off and away, he'd have to run even as a giant. With the ray aimed at him, the no-longer-lion-now-fox blasted himself skyward to easily stand above the trees at 315 feet tall, leaving the trees perhaps a foot long and therfore not even as big as his tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below, Ash ran to the house as the fox's feet expanded to in the end shoot over him 15 ft tall, the pads under them left huge holes in the ground. He grumbled about the wrecked yard and how he'd be fixing it without ever having any fun from it. The drops now going from 3 to 5 feet deep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later, John was gone, covering miles in seconds rather than the two or three minutes of a track runner. The neighborhood and surrounding area was just a toy-land to him. Luckily for most of the people, he was sticking to roads rather than backyards and anyone with any brains driving on the road would see the 15 foot tall toes and get out of their way. LIke that, the roads were shredded across the area by a gigantic fox.</span></div></div>",

I've got something amazing to show you! I'll let you go, just don't scream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enormous fox takes his foot away and leaves a quick few steps going down the road before blasting himself to normal and running up. He quickly gets her in the house and says, \"I can change soo much stuff, but listen, there's police coming, I need to hide. They'll think any fox with colors like mine is the 'giant' and they're probably gonna search here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing\" Rachel says at first, then goes about fixing the problem, \"can you get any smaller? You could hide in my fur.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have the smallest boyfriend in the world, but that works\" John said and then once more blasted himself, glad for the hardwood floors in this part of the house. He went from being a whole head taller than the girl to an inch tall. There she interupted and pinned him as he had her, coating him in a layer of sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a piece of payback\" the giantess said before releasing him. He white hand comes down and picks up her tiny boyfriend to drop him on her shoulder amidst a field of fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a good perch, John blasts himself again, even an inch tall he'd stood out on the shoulder, but now he was far, far, far smaller than a flea. The drop down from here was miles as now even the fox's fur was 1000 feet tall, it'd take a very good microscope or magnifying glass to find him now.</span></div></div>",

There was enough probable cause that a warrant wasn't needed and had it been, they'd recieve it in minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting there, John quickly became bored and he could see little of the world beyond to give him any sort of entertainment. In the end he decided he had to see it and to do that he'd actually have to get smaller. In front of him fur ran forward over Rachel's front like bridges going nowhere. One was sitting under the fox's foot and every few seconds slipped between a toe, it was a rope right now. It'd hold his weight easily but holding on for dear life was not an appealing idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the gun out again, the fox gave himself another shot and ultimately was so small that even a 64'th of an inch was enormous to him. The strand of fur in front of him however, was more than wide enough now to walk on, at least as big as a six lane highway, three going one way, three the other. He had no other way to measure by but what he'd been before, which left him to guess he was a 16th to a 64th of an inch to what he was, which meant in the worst case, Rachel had a boyfriend 1/4100  as tall as her fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn walked out onto what he could now only call an enormous bridge. The farther out he went it just got windier and windier and the girl wasn't even moving. He quickly was hugging the ground to avoid a flight off, but that too failed quickly. Over the edge went the fox past at least a few hundred miles of girlfriend, he survived and somehow landed at the very bottom, on her right foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, the fox realized where he was. He had thirty or forty miles of walking to do just to get near the end of the foot and then climb up to the ankle and legs. Looking down between splayed toes, all he saw as a dark abyss. Meanwhile from overhead he heard the clanging and booms of the search. The shortest officer, a smaller desert creature of some kind was only 2 feet tall and the closest to anyone's toes, but this small, John could walk all over him and never be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the past, the micro-fox had teased his girlfriend about having little feet, little no longer a toe dwarfed a city by all forms of measurement. Earlier there'd also been payback for him stepping on her, this and her attack earlier more than made up for that...</span></div></div>",

He heard numerous booms from talking and walking, and at last a great one and some wind from the door closing. One more comes, presumably being told its all clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for the micro fox, Rachel think's he's up top. He turns to look for an edge to jump off and sees five pads from her other foot coming in to scratch this one. They're of course, huge, at least 2 miles long each and the center one, that was just beyond scaling right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly John ran, as fast as his tiny fox body would carry him. He reached a gap between the toes, leapt and fell into the abyss, but was blasting himself skyward the whole time. As he grew his momentum picked up and shot him free, he landed on his feet long before he should've hit the ground at that small size and continued to expand from what had been a half inch tall. Soon he's standing at his normal height over his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you doing down there?\" Rachel asks after having spotted where the growth came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't move so much, I fell off here\" John replied, pointing to the point on her shoulder where he had been, \"wound up down there and having to be a lot smaller to avoid dieing and nearly got drowned under your sweaty pads. Big foot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look whose talking\" Rachel said and pointed to John's paws, now quite a deal larger than hers, difference between guys and girls after all. Men of most species grew bigger. After a few seconds, the argument became playful, John..</span></div></div>",

Police cars are following him and going as fast as they can, running around his footprints and trying to catch him. To him, the cars aren't even an inch tall, they cannot keep up but they'd find Rachel when he stops there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting was not a good idea and so far no one had seen his face anyway, which would make ID'ing him all the harder. Still, John had to get away from them and more speed wasn't all of the solution. Thinking of what all may be done to him, he put on a burst of speed going into an all out sprint, which put some distance between him and the police, in fact quite a few miles. At the sixty miles or so an hour that the cars went, he had about three minutes to disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tracks ran a few miles down the road farther, he backtracked and quickly fired the ray, shrinking himself. Around him everything grew outwards, soon he was climbing out of his own footprint. The flashing lights and sirens were closing in, he leapt up and ran to a near-by lot/playground, in front of him there was a huge tree surrounded by all the grey dirt of the parking area, open to the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost flying, the fox shot up the tree and standing with one foot in front of the other for balance, blasted himself again. Seconds later he was sitting in a groove from the bark fox feet dangling over the side. He was now so small that little toy cars wouldn't see him as a road-way threat, but rather dwarfed him by far, as did even fleas. Hard to belive those were his footprints in the roadway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute or two later when the police cars came, John had to cover his ears, the tiny structures and skyscraper tall siren box's were built for two different levels of sound.

A few times he wandered out onto a leaf and it didn't move the slightest under his weight, which in the real world was the near non-existent five-thousandths of a pound compared to his former 180 to perhaps 240 or 280 as a lion.

His titanic toes were splayed around the branch, his feet too big to just stick on top, same as the fox when he first climbed the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan and his friends had gotten together just to goof off and play as kids do.

Small objects needed almost completely smooth surfaces to be crushed, else like sand they found a gap to survive in. He quickly  turned the ray on himself and was a speck beyond site once again.

The vibrations stopped and John slowly opened his eyes.  He let off the trigger and breathed a sigh of relief.  He was alive, and the wolf cub was nowhere in sight.  Quickly, another thought entered his mind.  Where was the cub?  Getting down on his hands and knees, he began to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dan rushed madly at the beam.  However, the more he ran, the larger the beam and bark around him grew.  By the time he reached the source of the beam, he saw it was an older fox holding a gun (the actual source of the beam) and tightly shutting his eyes.  This might have been the giant fox from earlier.  In fact, Dan believed it was!  But there was a problem; he was 10 feet away from the fox and was now only half its height.  He tried yelling at the fox, but the beam must have prevented him because Dan couldn't speak.  He couldn't escape the beam either because it was now wider than a house. The smaller Dan became, the faster he shrank.  Finally, he sat down in defeat and waited for it to stop.  The beam shut off seconds later and Dan could see again.  Seeing the fox from this perspective, Dan knew it was the one he'd seen earlier.  Quickly, he put two and two together, realizing that it was the gun the fox was holding that was the cause of all this.  The fox had now opened his eyes and breathed a big sigh of relief.  The calm didn't last long.  The fox muttered something to itself and got down on its hands and knees, presumably looking for the puny wolf.  It was shocking to the little wolf to see something so large.  The fox's enormous hand landed just a few feet from Dan.  Staring at the trash truck sized claw on the middle finger was bad enough, but seeing the actual size of the finger and the hand beyond it were mindboggling.  How was he going to survive this?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unsure of what he could do now, John raced forward, and began climbing the growing mass of A'shtar's body, trying to work at compensating for the growing plan of his serpent hide as it grew against him, the distance getting longer and longer; plus, the lion had to admit, this all was as horribly wonderful as it was stunning and dangerous...</span></div></div>",

Or all of it!\" John roared, though compared to A'sther's body, it was more like if an ant could scream. Sure, that was unlikely enough, but in all fairness, the 1,300-foot tall tower of dragonish naga-bulk pulsing with raw energy over the entire neighborhood was pretty much on the same list. To his stunned horror, things went past bad, skipped worse, and went nuclear, as he watched the reptile's monstrously big, thick arm raise up, the hand opening into a humongously wide palm; in a fluid, slow-motion movement, A'sther brought his hand crashing down into his pecs, making them bulge so big and thick that the impact vibrated up and down his torso, making John's teeth chatter as the force of it sent the teeny gun spinning up into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, crumbles, man, don't swallow it.\" John muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swallowed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get you a new god-gun,\" A'sther chuckled, flicking his tongue in and out cutely. \"I can totally feel you down there, so I imagine you can hear just fine! Now, hang on, John--you're about to get more of me than you'll know what to do with!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's already plenty of you for--\" John began meekly, before the tingling racing through the dragonaga got bad enough to make him wobble and fall back onto A'sther's colossally thick hide. With a crescendoing roar that dropped lower and lower in his thick throat, A'sther began to quake all over, before bulging out violently, his already impossible musculature erupting with raw power, biceps blowing up so big that they momentarily reached his collarbone, before his chest and neck blew up bigger still, proportions going in and out of 'normal' as he grew and grew, rippling, roaring and rumbling beyond 1,500 feet...2,000 feet...2,600 feet...over half a mile in size, he wiggled his growing lower body all around, grinding away at the more or less empty homes; this would be the one day everyone wouldn't be sorry they went to work!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pectorals pussshed out, throbbing with pulsing waves of growth, his back muscles and lats raging so big they almost seemed to dwarf his front, before his abs and arms boomed out to match, over 3,000 feet of scaly, hot brawn shuddering up and up over the streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesssssss,\" the reptile hissed giddily, his tail thump-thudding destructively over across several blocks, dashing the local park into powder and grit; he groped his own meaty pecs tight, and buried his own gargantuan muzzle deep within them, flicker-licking the bulging mass ticklingly, and giggling heavily at how sweet it all felt, as he shivered harder, and blew up yet again. By this point, John had scaled far up enough to reach the towering curve of his bicep, sliding down off of it and flumping gracelessly along the slope of his right pectoral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, A'sther, cut it out already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA head so big he couldn't quite see all of it anymore turned curiously to him; the reptilian demigod smiled so wide and warm, giving a lovey snort down to John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No refunds, no returns! You're all just going to have to indulge me awhile, sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it was you in my place--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it was, I would be rock hard and ready to roll in your pectoral cleavage, like no one's business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn crossed his legs defensively, knowing the first part of that prediction was plenty true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides,\" the swelling serpent continued, \"there's all that city right there, and I've never really had the chance to get intimate with it.\" He flicked his tongue as he rumbled and shot up to 4,000 feet, even, muscles flaring out even more massively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please tell me you mean that figuratively!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's find out!\" he roared happily, moving with heavy, grinding strides across row after row after row of project houses, abandoned long ago at this end of the city. There were no towers, no skyscrapers that could compete with A'sther now, though several came up to his lower chest; he puffed and mock-shook his fist at them, feigning goofy anger:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Challenge me with your height, will you, Steeple Loans building!? I'll teach you to exist!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he laughed, and slooowly pressed his titanic body against the mighty skyscraper; all he did was stay put, letting his chest grooooow out hungrily, pushing, plumping and pulsing bigger still, until the skyscraper began to wedge deep in between said pecs; by that time, A'sther had sportingly been bending further and further in to accomodate it, or just let it think it had more of a chance than it really did; he straightened up, and ripped the entire thing off at the foundation, letting his pectorals nom it up as he trembled again, and shot up to over 1.5 miles in size, then 2 miles, panting with untold pleasure, and looking this way and that. He spied thousands of littles scurrying every-which-way but his, and he cocked his head, just watching them for a moment as they and the cityscape shrunk lower and lower, tinier and tinier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incooooomiiiing!\" he bellowed, playfully letting his erection bob up high, the tip kissing up along the underside of his chest, pressing his abs tight, before he let it just come crashing down, impacting the uptown district hard, making half the city shake violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was pretty much facepalming at a professional level, desperately ignoring the throbbing mass between his own legs. This was so wrong. And so hot. And he was so cute...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 miles surged meanly to 5, as A'sther's eyes fluttered adorably, the muscled colossus gasping openly, as the topsides of entire buildings tapped, rubbed and dragged along his shaft. As John wondered if the arousal would add to the flame, he felt that telltale tingle return, sighed, and got up on his feet, easily able to walk on the sheer plane of the serpent's collarbone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, painfully hot or not, I gotta do something.\" He scaled the scales one by one, feeling the smooth contours grow wider still as he worked up the neck, and towards the mouth. He'd go in there after the ray gun, if he had to! Though hurrying would be important, as the shaking tremble racing through A'sther was getting worse and worse...</span></div></div>",

Stopping A'sther at this point would be like plugging up a crater with his goods...which A'sther could certainly have done. Crud, the hotness of his reptilian lover's growth was even interfering with his analogies!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you pretend to not hear me!\" John roared, making a teeny little mite-like squeak.The edges of the dragonaga's mouth currrrled even more, as his grin grew and grew. He heard him. But A'sther just flickered a massive tongue coyly, grunted, and let John watch, as his muzzle stretched out over more of the sky, consuming it from his strange vantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA'sther must have easily been pushing 10 miles in size now, from head to tail-tip, almost half of that towering up into the heavens. His bulky brawn slithered and swelled, weighing like an increasingly-heavy sheet, a blanket of scaled, heated mass shuddering in euphoric lust. A penis over half his length was straining as it bobbed and thumped over everything, two ballooning balls rumbling and rolling over what was left of the city. John's protests, at last, fell shy of even the great naga's hearing, as his scaly body shook, tensed, tightened, and blew up even larger, and larger, and larger, 13 miles booming up to 18...25...38! Over half of all that mass rose up through the clouds, the remainder surging disproportionately wider across the hills and inroads and highways and forests and truck stops and billboards and skyscrapers and stadiums--and that was in the neighboring city, mind you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom afar (and a-near) the sight of the ever-growing reptile more or less put the pause button on the remote of everyday life for he entire state, then the bordering ones and on, then across the pond, as cameras from all about caught sight of the huffing, horny titan. The bigger he would bulge, the more each bit of footage on live TV showed the whrr and motion of the zoom button, every photographer trying hard to keep capturing all of him as he grew and grew. Helicopters had trouble keeping enough of a safety berth as A'sther suddenly hiccuped, trembled, and tripled in size!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lookout!\" the TV stations dubbed in, covering the obvious profanities employed by those who were trying to avoid the dragonaga's unstoppable, rolling girth. The footage showed as his bulging sides hungrily covered one city to the West, and another in the Southeast, simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haaah,\" A'sther panted, a great, happy tone in his booming voice. \"So good!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pectorals pushed out furiously, growing out as far as he could reach, as his biceps and triceps, his shoulders and forearms all boomed bigger, then even bigger than that, his 210-mile body twitching with an overabundance of gigamuscle and sexual godhood. His balls were the span of entire cities--no, larger, even! They bobbled his shaft cutely as they grew at random, making A'sther's eyes roll adorably back, the serpent feeling every motion of his overgrown, throbbing pillar. It was just impossible, he had to go for it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no...no, no!\" John cried uselessly, as A'sther's neck grew over half the width of his entire torso, blocking all possible sight of the clouds or sky for him. Now, A'sther was all there was! His great, mammoth hands stroked circles over his pulsing tip, the incredibly-aroused, 400-mile naga tickling, teasing, and generally loving tenderly on himself as the world watched on. With every touch and stroke, the erection inflated rapidly, swelling even more fantastically in his hands, and the musclebound monster heaved up another 50 miles, then another 80...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So good!!\" he bellowed, shaking the continent, as he hiccuped mid-stroke, and tripled in size again, starting to pour bigger over and across the country itself...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>John couldn't even think. This was completely outside the realm of reality. It had to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, there was A'shter's face, on an anthro dragon body comparable to a deity, with a massive raygun in one hand and a smug expression on his face as he peered down at him. If he wasn't moving slightly and the pecs on his chest weren't stretching and contracting every time he breathed, he would've almost believed it was some massive statue dedicated in his friend's image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't. His friend had turned into a living mountain of muscle and scales. John's mind reeled, just absorbing that the person he was lording it over as he was down by his chest moments ago was now so big he could smother him with a single step- and he was ten feet tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JOHN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe behemoth's voice snapped John out of his trance as he held his ears reflexively from the loud noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just who I was looking for. Can you hold still for a second?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn watched as A'shter bent over, blocking out the sun with his massive frame, and knew what was about to happen. He stumbled backward, considering running for it, he tripped- Ash's massive hand had been laid behind him and he'd fallen into the palm. He wasn't even as tall as it was wide, he noticed, as he was raised past the legs taller than the houses around them, the humblingly large dick which poked out of his slit, and the abs which looked like something chiseled into the side of a cliff. His hand-platform stopped at Ash's pecs, each bigger than moon-bounces. John looked up, defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... you used the gun,\" He said weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A LOT MORE THAN YOU, APPARENTLY,\" Ash laughed, booming back down to his tiny pal. John winced- the closer distance apparently magnified his voice that much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're HUGE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO, MAN, YOU'RE TINY. I MEAN, NOT-EVEN-THREE-INCHES-TALL, TINY.\" John looked around him, surrounded by Ash's fingers. The pinky was about his size, if you didn't include the claw at the end. \"That's... pretty cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH, YEAH.\" Just then, a massive push came up from beneath John. Before he realized it, he was in the air. John yelled as his limbs flailed, looking for solid ground. Just as soon as it started, John hit the smoothed solid ground again, gravity returning to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had just been tossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't DO that!\" John yelled as Ash chuckled deeply and throatily, and that's when he realized- this godlike titan had total control over him. The very ground he stood on, the very terrain around him, the fingers on which he was now leaning for support, WERE Ash. The smallest of his movements had completely jumbled his very perceptions of up and down. The only thing that kept him from plunging hundreds of feet below was Ash, who probably was too busy enjoying himself to realize such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was hardly a small or weak anthro compared with others, due to his own short experience with the gun, but he had to sit down at this realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, can you set me down now? I don't like being up this high!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IN A SECOND, DUDE.\" John's stomach dropped a little bit more at hearing this. \"I JUST WANT TO TEST SOMETHING OUT. I THINK I KNOW WHAT MOST OF THESE BUTTONS DO, BUT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS ONE. HOLD STILL, WOULD YOU?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash, NO! I'm not your guinea pi-\" John didn't even get to finish his sentence as he was blasted with the \"?\" function of the gun next to him. He squinted at the bright light, then felt a shaking sensation in his head, between his ears. \"What the...\" he started, and then trailed off as a set of somewhat short gazelle antlers shot out. As he felt around on the top of his head, studying by touch his new appendages, Ash smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH, <i>TOO COOL</i>! IT'S A RANDOM FUNCTION!\" John cried out again, \"STOP THIS!\" But to no avail- Ash fired again. This time the trembling happened behind him, and John suddenly felt a great deal more length to his shoulder-blade's movements. He'd sprouted a set of large swan wings, luckily not replacing his arms. They actually matched his horns and mane surprisingly well, though he had no way of knowing. He took the wings in instantly, his attention still focused on Ash, who was laughing and charging up looking full well like he was about to go for a third blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn didn't wait. \"I SAID <b>STOP</b>!\" He ran off the edge of the palm and jumped, just as the blast went off. \"WHA- HEY!\" Ash yelled, as the blast went through where John had been seconds ago and hit his hand. John fell for only a moment- his wings felt amazingly natural, and picked him up instantly. He heard a massive crackling, shifting sound behind him, but he didn't turn to look- he was flapping his wings as much as he could, trying to get away from the abundance of dragon behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't make it far. A massive structure appeared in front of him, and he crashed into it before he could react.<br>\r\n----<br>\r\nHe groaned as he woke up in his own warm wings, recognizing Ash by the smooth scale of his palm before he could identify the fingers towering around him. A figure prodded his back more forcefully than he would have liked, as another one... stroked his mane? And a third poked his gut? What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolled over, prepared to look up at Ash... and his jaw dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"?\" function had apparently given him a new set of limbs, as two new arm-like appendages completely identical to his original sprouted out at his sides. John was sitting on the palm of the one on A'shter's lower right. Ash himself was now sitting down in the remains of John's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH, COOL, YOU'RE AWAKE!\" He boomed out, again causing John to wince. Two massive hands approached from either side, pinched his arms, and pulled John to a standing position.</span></div></div>",

The two 'leaders' are really having fun, the big wolf throwing his 'bit' brother in the air and catching him, the brother doing stunts as he flew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan was having the time of his life, he was spread out on the beach digging his feet in underground and propped up on a sand dune. In his hands he held Jack, his formerly big brother. He tossed the tiny wolf into the air, he'd do tricks and either be caught or land in the forest of fur on a soft and enormous stomach. This was just too cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was in the air and coming down, he'd just done a series of flips and twists and now had to land. Dan's gigantic hands missed him. Pushing his feet down he fell into a forest of fur and pushed the huge belly down four feet, almost as far down as he was tall. He came out and walked across the enormous moving surface, the warmth on his pads feeling more like a spongy-heated stone than skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere, Jim and Matt were sitting foot to foot, pad to pad and formed a huge obstacle course for Mike and Will, their 'big' brothers. Fur, dirt and whatever else they could come up with blocked the half-inch tall cat's way down the slopes. At the feet it took all they to shoot up and jump at the toes. Then again, that was also a few hundred foot long ramp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other boy pair in the group was out at sea. Rick, the giant fox floated like an ocean platform and had all sorts of fun. he was a diving board, a sea-monster and more. Best of all for him though, was that he was bigger than Nate, his brother, could dive down! When the bigger fox went down, he went to the bottom and could've made it farther. The little fox fought a sea-beast, got huge waves and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast of the group were the girls. Kate the enormous white cat and Jane the little blonde feline. They both knew how to party like no tomorrow but were just as good at relaxing. Kate was stretched out soaking up the sun, despite her white fur doing its best to stave off the heat. Next to her on a mountain of skates, Jane was stretched out catching the light her sister reflected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they played, John crept in slow and silently. He was taking aim one at a time, changing everyone to see if they could be just as friendly under different conditions...</span></div></div>",

They climbed upward while the 'big' kids stayed just where they were. The beach became crowded for the giants now, they had to spread out some as now the 'little' siblings were far larger than the beach, if they laid parallel to the peers, their backs were in the water with their now being a half mile of beach and two miles of kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Jack when he came down from the last toss, the forest he landed in was bigger than any he'd ever seen. The fur went 300 feet overhead, he had to wonder how he'd be found as even fleas would dwarf him. He wandered aimlessly through the jungle of his brother. Dan didn't notice anything untilhe stopped feeling his brother on his gut or hin his hands...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins perhaps had it worst. The giants were pushed back with their growth and for a second moved. When the older brothers made the jump at the feet, both landed between a thousand feet of toes. The gigantic twins just stayed put, not knowing and thinking the little people were still at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt sea, Nate was nearly eaten by Rick. The smaller one got in the gigantic mouth and came close, but lived through it by sheer luck.He was spat out onto a palm pad and from there taken ashore. There wasn't any more to do at sea as the gigantic fox really was an island now and could easily kill the little one, not to mention he had to go so much farther out to  not touch bottom now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, the girls, really were not effected. Kate got her feet soaked and dripped a bit on Jane, but that was minor and they really weren't doing anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new activity was needed...</span></div></div>",

It didn't take long for them to come ashore. When they did, they saw right away the changes. Nate bent down to examine his tiny friends while all the others looked up at the enormous Rick behind him. The 'little' kids knew how their siblings felt about the size in a way and the big ones got soaked by a giant friend and saw the biggest thing of their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, another bolt caught Nate and he joined the 'big' kids in looking up at Rick. The gigantic fox couldn't see them now, though so him, or at least his titanous toes towering which were 30 feet tall to normal people and to the little teens were around the 4 and 5 mile tall mark. It didn't make them feel any better to be swimming in Nate's footprint, specifically the toes thanks to all the water he dumped on them, washed down--hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA beam at last lances Rick and takes him back to normal and he too climbs out of his swimming pool of a pawprint. As one they come on their now tinier 'big' siblings and are all standing around the pawprint holding them.

After that fright they were dumped in the gigantic triangles on a head, the only place they could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below, Nate and Rick were actually forgotten, no one thought to grab either of them. Rick, who'd misjudged his height and was more so 40 feet tall to the tiny teens, grabbed Nate with ease and quickly chased after his yet immobile friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight ahead, the twins were getting ready to head out. Matt's toes towered into the sky but they had to get up someone before they left. Quickly the fox jumped, shooting up as fast as he could with hits little load. As he moved, the foot picked up off the sand dunes, a second later he fell to darkness as the giant put his skate on and trapped the micro creatures inside. The space quickly heated up after he got going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for the titans to be ready to go. They had their siblings, their stuff on and one grabbed Rick's skateboard.

And the lion knew that all for fact as he was right in the middle of the giants as they stepped away from each other, having grown so close they were practically standing on each other's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giants spread out and all kinds of thoughts filled their minds, 'what happened' wasn't really much of one, but more so 'woo!

He took aim at the whole group and fired. They rapidly shriveled away to specks but didn't even notice, they were that bent on speed. The board's under them were 400 feet wide but all they thought about was going forward, faster, even if they were anything but.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough most of the boardwalk didn't notice the tiny teens, Dan, the younger kid's effective leader, did. He swerved right to go around the 'big' kids and stopped a foot in front of them, a foot flat on the board they were 'shooting' along to completely bar their way. The gaps in the boards would in theory be too large to cross, and even so its not like they were going anywhere fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the twins came along next, Matt. After a few seconds of seeing Dan look down, things came together. Approaching from the back the cat was a foot away from the 'big' kids when he slammed a paw down to bar escape to the back. His discarded skateboard rolled along to the side and stopped. Remarkably the little creatures had yet to notice what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext along was their fox, Rick. He skated to a stop and quickly took the skates off, they were Matt's and he now knew he hated skates. As he fought with the inline blades, not meant for fox feet, Jim and Kate skated up to the other side,not knowing what was going on, but filling in their loose circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that one board, the 'big' siblings were still racing forward. A second later two enormous objects sail through the sky overhead and a black wall slams right in front of them. The whole group freezes and looks around, now realizing what happened. In front Rick's leg barred their path for a second or two before he realized things himself and moved it. Beyond that, Dan's toes reached 300 feet into the sky and to the back a cat blocked them as to the side two skates skeemed to go forever into the sky with the world's biggest wheels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a safe spot, John watched all of this, wondering just what would happen...

He pulled the trigger, holding it down as a blue beam lanced out across and down he road. It struck the little lupine square in the chest. Nothing happened and you gave up but held the trigger thinking that maybe it was just a first-time use sorta thing. That was always it with computer, turn it on for its first boot and get a nice long wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds the boy grew. He doubled from 45 inches to ninety, towering clear over you but he was too far away for that to matter yet. Jim kept growing, looking around at the ever shrinking world. Trees that had towered over him dwindled, giving him a clear view into the park on his left. Houses quickly fell to the same condition. He even had to step off th sidewalk as his barefeet no longer fit on it, though by that point it didn't matter, the masive weight of a single paw had caved in the cement walkway under it. The road followed as the right foot came down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe by comparison, little lion looked up as he released the trigger.

Behind him, a tail stretched 140 feet long and twitched in the air. Luckily, the kid's clothes had grown too or things could be embarrasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn however was not all that worried, his new gun worked!

Shrink especially right now or whatever was grown would always be a threat unless the little lion grew too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill unnoticed and behind cover, John put the gun on shrink and took aim, hoping that he'd be able to take the eight year old down to size. Before the wolf moved, the trigger was pulled and a blue lance struck out from the bush, except this time the lupine could see where it came from with ease, this time it was a step or two away for him. This had to work or it may not end well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beam hit one of Jim's toes and went unnoticed for several minutes. It may never have gained attention except that the wolf began to shrink. At first it was slow, probably a few normal inches, but then it picked up on an exponential scale. He rapidly lost ground to the environment. Where the trees once struggled to poke over his toes they were reaching his knees and very soon afterward his chest and shoulders. At ten feet tall the titan stepped back on the sidewalk, and soon had gone from a 686400 pound giant to a 57.2 pound little wolf. The impressions from his footprints were deep enough that he had to climb in and was down up to his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn kept up on the trigger however. The beam was now in the wolf's chest as it was at the growth shot. Bit by bit the lupine became a very little lupine compared to his former self with a towering height of 45 inches. Even with the small scope on the gun, the lion eventually could no longer see his mark. Jim had gone from being normal, as tall as the craters to being of large toddler type heights and then to wading in fields of short grass to using pebbles for housing and then it was nearly impossible to see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver on the sidewalk, Jim is smaller than most bugs with a height of less than 1/32nd of an inch tall. One minute his toes dwarfed houses, trees and just about everything else, he was in a toy-world. The next he's normal and then, the smallest of toys would see him for a toy and a real person could have trouble seeing him while a bug could pass him by rather than have a crumb for desert. Suddenly there's a huge bass-sound, he looks up to see a stick he'd been holding and dropped bouncing in the air. It was the biggest thing he'd ever seen, as thick as a football field was long and he wasn't all that sure how long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the little lupine looks at the massive wooden behomoth, he has to cover his ears as there's another booming far louder. He looks up to see a cat approaching, maybe a lynx girl. While people said the cats were light on their feet, she was anything but, every step hammering down hundreds of tons in force. As she'd approached, her enormous pink-painted claws slammed into the ground to send out a resounding clang as bad as the steps. Her titan toes stretched a thousand feet into the skies overhead, formerly a space that was barely touched by his ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff in the bushes, John watches Katie approach the little lupine he can only imagine what its like, having a girl standing over you in distances measured in miles. He considers what to do...</span></div></div>",

It would reduce the possible side effects of his experiments and he could come up with more ways to test the guns numerous other functions. Perhaps it could make two cats or two dogs of them if they proved to be a couple, or turn the tables on them and more. He'd have to watch though to make the best use of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie had just seen a boy wolf become a giant and then something under a bug. She wanted to know how and talk to him. After seeing him shrink she had come over and crouched down looking, eventually she found him, a speck on the ground compared to the world. Her ears, sensitive to find distant preys had been just sensitive enough to hear the little lupine. She sat down with her feet wrapped around as if to cage in and protect the tiny creature. The force of the movement had launched him into the air but on the whole he was fine. The next scale challenge was quieting her voice as best as possible, she had fair sucess there and in not destroying the wolf's ears. He heard her loud and clear and she sat concentrating to hear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim yelled up answers to the girl's every question, hoping for help in getting back to normal and that he wouldn't become another bug underfoot. From here he could see numerous blood stains and bug guts against her pads and detect numerous other subtle things to a normal sized person. She had mud around the in-between spaces of her toes, she'd been out in the mud but quickly cleaned and missed a spot. She was dripping sweat on her pads like no tomorrow as well, excitement and adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the bush, John could discern nothing except that the cat was sitting somewhere near the little lupine. Sensitive though his ears were, he could not hear from here. It seemed he'd have to either get closer un-detected by becoming smaller or stay here and wait it out... Maybe just take action against the girl...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sitting there, John couldn't stand his not knowing what was going on. That left one option, get close enough to hear, but that in itself created another problem, despite the stealth of cats, he couldn't get that close and not be heard with someone straining their ears so much. If he were smaller however, spying on that conversation would be quite possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, the lion moved slowly to the park, crossing down the street from his targets. He stayed behind a tree around a block away and after checking that they were there yet, blasted himself. He tingled as the world grew, making the mighty lion a midget to even his tiniest prey. Standing there he watched his gradual reduction in size, every minute the grass at his feet leaping many scales closer. It felt weird that he could no longer feel grass under his feet and then when he was looking up to see the grass spires around him. He was a fourth of an inch tall when he stopped and encountered the last immediately weird thing, he was standing in a single toe-pad of his foot print, a half inch below the ground's surface. It was at least his height to get away from the pad and again as far to level ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn ran up to the sidewalk's edge and ran along it in the dirt, in part looking  for a way up and keeping up his pace. The sidewalk was normally two inches off the dirt, something like 70 feet over the little lion's head. Every few minutes, he almost stumbled when he saw a bug dwarf him, at one point a squirrel scared him out of his wits, it was absolutely enormous to him, a monster who could crush him underfoot rather than the other way around. He reguardless, kept going on and a few miles later, found a way up but it was nearly microscopic and he was already tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, he brought the gun on himself again and fired until the pathway in the sidewalk as wide enough to climb on. He looked up at the grass breaking clear of the 1000 foot barrier, in fact they broke it with their first inch! John then pushed on and began the climb up the sidewalk, ascending nearly a half mile until he reached the top. There, he felt truely small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie's foot was the first thing John saw, and what's worse, he saw a single pad and thought it was her whole foot, until he looked up. A single toe pad stretched over 2000 feet long, just under 1000 wide and quite deep until they touched skin. Each pad dumped sweat in the millions and billions of gallons, a small lake there dropping downward and this was just a ten year old girl, measured in miles more often than feet. Even the stuff stuck to her foot and between her toes were enormous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the monster's fur, the lion saw the wolf, and he was barely at the lupine's knees. A shrunken wolf cub was dwarfing him by far in size. The worst part now, was that the being's around him were too loud for him to understand. The cat's normally high pitched voice was nothing but booms and the wolf sounded like a continual series of sonic booms from his yelling. It wasn't a pleasant thought to try and picture the rest of the girl, from here by her foot and just under a leg he saw more than he wanted.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The talks between Jim and Katie go on for a few more minutes, all of it is lost on the little lion. He looks down for a second and when his vision is up again, the wolf is gone! Things get worse next as the massive structure around him, that had seemed more like building than person begin to move. Miles of flesh and fur drag along the ground as John tries to run from the monstrosity getting ready to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titaness's toes shake and splay as they strike the ground and have weight come down on them. Its a force like none other in all of existence. John luckily passes through the half kilometer gap between the splaying toes. The canyon stops around him as the girl gets to her feet. The pads slam down as all the weight finally comes on them, a normal force of 70 pounds now several hundred thousand. John flies into the air from the Earthquake to stop in some mud around the top of the toes. Here the little lion gets his first look at the full size of this monster, around 26000 feet before figuring in her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie held the little wolf on her hand, on the flesh safe from the sweaty pad. She could just make out his movements in her fur, but really couldn't see him all that well. Then, she set out for her house to see if a way could be found to help her tiny friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below, John held on to whatever he could and ducked whenever he saw a flea roam by.This girl's fleas were bigger than the wolf and the wolf had been enormous. The titan shot into mud puddles on the way to wherever she was going, the enormous toes went miles under, it nearly drowned the lion. Hard to believe this 'puddles' were true oceans to him.  He looked for a way to move up, but the girl was simply too large, and too fast to think about that right now. He thought about her monumental-scaled claws, not as big as the toes but a great distance away, and he thought the pink polish might yet be wet or flake and crush him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Katie's hand, Jim held onto a strand of fur, he was now smaller than the girl's fleas, but at least big enough to fight them off and hold onto the forest around him. He'd never imagined he'd be around a girl like this, a bug smaller than her and anything else's pads and fleas.There could be a great deal to get used to...</span></div></div>",

She had a big family and well, they needed  big house, which only fit in a great distance from the main areas of town. The house was huge, a small mansion of brick and wood with enormous fields stretching all around it. Inside the foyer was wide and open with the grand staircase leading straight to the second floor, a hallway between the two huge curved sets of stairs and doors to either side, one going to a kitchen and the other to a mud room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was oblivious of most of this except that the amounts of mud pouring on him had pretty much come to zilch, aside from of course the stuff already around him. He could just make out the world beyond, but the distances caused much of it to fall out of focus and blur to the point he had only vague ideas of the shapes he saw. Still, that was enough to put the message across to him, big cat and really big house. Just as he was piecing things together, his ears heard an enormous roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom off to her left, a huge chunk of Katie's siblings stormed down the stairs and out from the kitchen, shooting over and tackling her in a huge pile. \"We've missed you\" and \"what took so long\" among other things were generally what they said. The parents were away for a while and there were only a few older kids, Katie among them and usually the entertainer while others kept the house going. The whole mass of lynxes just rolled all over the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim held on for all he was worth to the tower of fur in front of him. His current residence, an enormous hand was flailing and sailing about, threatening to hurl him miles off and into the distance. If he got separated from his titaness friend, well it may not end well. He already had to fight fleas to live, it was very much to his doubt that any bugs were out there smaller but many bigger and beyond his ability to fight. To say nothing of the kids who would stand a great chance of killing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar below and far smaller, John was in worse shape. One of the cubs had gotten something between their sister's toes in the tumble, be it one of their own, a finger or perhaps a tail. Whatever had done it, succeeded in raming and capturing the little lion, albeit he was now somewhere else, it was like being catapulted by a planet. The object hit him and then launched him free. When he got a good look around, he found he was on a kid's arm, the muscles under him ran for miles in any direction. Next he was on the floor, swimming in an ocean of sweat from all the pads that were storming around, and in the end he found himself on the ten year old giantess again, though where he wasn't so sure about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie at last succeeded in pushing her brothers and sisters off, finding her tiny wolf friend and then made a b-line for her room....</span></div></div>",

There seemed only one way to get him somewhere she could find him, and that was to locate a large flat, open area, and shake him off. Standing over a huge piece of paper, five foot across, she was as ready as ever to find her little friend. Something that small would have to stand out, at least against that much white paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok little guy, I don't know where you are, but I'm gonna shake and drop you onto the paper\" Katie said and then shook her arms and upper body over the paper with the hopes it would get her friend lose of her comparatively massive body. The movement was somewhere between gentle and crazy as she wordied about the micro-wolf, or maybe even nano.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was just above Jim, trying to hold on and avoid detection but that seemed impossible. His only solution would be to make himself too small for the wolf to see, which would make even the cat cubs from earlier enormous in his eyes. In the end, that was not a pleasant thought but the only way to avoid detection right now as otherwise he'd assuredly give himself away. Right now, that would not be a good thing. Pulling out the ray and then jumping, the lion blasted himself, the twenty foot reach of the large lupine's arms grew into miles as the cat reached a 32nd of a 32nd of an inch tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim held onto his enormous friend's fur for all he was worth, he turned his head around to look below and did not like what he saw. The plan was to drop when he got close enough, this did not seem close enough. When the enormous arms were lower, he'd take his shot at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little lion missed his target in the free-fall. He'd aimed for the lupine's head but that quick turn had ruined his shot. John shot down and got a look at miles of chest and muscles, trying to fix his spot to land. The eight year old, shrunken wolf cub's chest stretched for miles, the distance before the shrink would've been like a continent as it was with the cat. Suddenly, the wolf turned and made to jump. John, smaller than any flea of any scale right now, landed on the large lupine's toes, the top in the end as he sailed through them while still splayed and as he was upside down in freefall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJIm landed, it was hard but he made it. He had one leg sitting straight up and the other laying flat on the ground after he landed and managed to sit down. He had himself leaned up on an arm to looked up at Katie, now that he was safe where she could find him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the wolf cub, John had escaped one titan's towering toes and prison to find himself on another and even smaller. He could only figure the size of real things now by math and guess work. The cat beyond was measured in hundreds of miles just to get an inch.</span></div></div>",

He was grabbing at both his feet going for an unseen scratch. The toes splaying and wiggling was bad enough, but there were miles of hands combing and dredging through the fur. It was making a clean shot nearly impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, an enormous white glove-like hand, the wolf's white going on to all his digits was coming right at the lion.

John saw what was a few feet become hundreds of miles, everything just became huge compared to what it had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim looked around in astonishement as he grew and grew and grew. Katie's towering form had been sitting in a similar way he had been, when the growth started he stood and watched in wonder. The enormous feet to either side of him became less and less towering titan toes. He was first as big as a pad, then the length of a toe and then as big as a whole foot and it kept going. Soon he was bigger than Katie and stopped there at his normal size. He looked down at his feet and thought of how tiny he'd been, all the miles he now covered compared to earlier. He was a normal wolf but felt like a giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cub however quicklyed brought his foot up to scratch his irritating itch from earlier. There area it covered was the same to him but covered an exponentially greater area in reality. He was however, having no better luck in getting it and handling the itch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the enormous foot, John was staring in awe at the enormous creature. A single foot dwarfed most states and then there was the enormous wall of white coming at him! Hundreds of miles of muscle in a finger about to fling him off or crush him under it!

He walked through the mall at a brisk pace, arriving at the food court in less than ten minutes. The dinner rush had started to die down, but most of the tables still had groups seated at them. \"Hmm, picking someone to test this gun on would be a little difficult, but after a few minutes of staring, he had narrowed it down to three groups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was a pair of young teenage boys who were sitting at a table towards the back corner. One was a meerkat, very slender with shaggy dark-brown hair and deep brown eyes, who couldn't have been more than fourteen years old. He wore a tight-fitting teal t-shirt with a large pink diagonal stripe and even tighter brown corduroy pants. Across from him was a lynx with greyish-blue fur, slightly taller and more built than the meerkat, perhaps a year or two older, wearing a wire-frame pair of glasses and a form-fitting black polo shirt with jeans. After observing the pair for a minute, seeing the way they looked into each other's eyes and gently brushed each other's hands, John came to the conclusion that they were probably boyfriends, or at least on a date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second group John saw was a group of four college-aged furs, two guys and two girls. John couldn't quite tell if they were on a double date or just hanging out as friends, but they all seemed to be having a good time. One of the guys was a tall, charismatic kangaroo with a wide smile and a loud laugh, while the other one was a shorter and slightly less outgoing rabbit, who seemed to let his bigger friend drive most of the conversation with the group. Across from them sat the two girls, one a vixen wearing a tube top and a rather revealing skirt, and the other a more sensibly-dressed ferretess. This group seemed to get along well with each other, and would comment on other furs as they passed by, cracking each other up with jokes and observations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final furs that John had his eye on was a pair of tiger cubs, both around 8 or 9 years old, who were running around chasing each other while their mother sat at a nearby table chatting with a friend. These two looked nearly identical to each other, and John guessed that they were twins. Watching them for several minutes, John was surprised by the level of energy they were able to keep up, and guessed that they must be a handful for their mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking for a moment, John finally makes his decision, walking up to and aiming his gun at...</span></div></div>",

When his vision cleared he couldn't fathom what had just happened. Ash was now a titan about 60ft in comparison. John looked at himself then at the gun that was in his hand. \"Oh... shit...\" he said. John was awestruck. Ash was barely able to keep from chuckling out loud and plucked John off the floor and rolled him around in his palm. \"Man... you're so small.\" Ash said looking at him. \"What to do... what to do...\"</span></div></div>",

It took some convincing, but Ash dialed the phone and had her on the way over for a 'surprise.' While they waited, John was placed on the floor and the snake began to hide. This way, the snake and Lion would have fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Ash, that wasn't quite how it was to be. The second he'd turned to walk away, John blasted him with the gun. At first, the aim was off, hitting a fake diamon stud in the giant's clothes. Blue lightning went into him and came back the way it had come. They both shrank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it happened, John bumped the odd question mark button, more a response of shock than anything else. His body began to change and that was at last the shock that broke his shot on the stud and hit just the dragon. When their vision had cleared, the two were well under a 32nd of an inch tall and had been made into foxes, no doubt from John's thoughts of his foxy-friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few minutes, the Lion had trouble moving, now in a completely new type of body, but he eventually got it. Ash took longer, as he wasn't even a mammal before, but was getting the hang of it. Just as they would have strangled each other, there was an immense booming, the door knob turned and then a huge, bass creak filled the room as the door swung open. The floor shook and boombed as a gigantic fox walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok John\" Rachel announced to the room, \"where's my surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below, Ash and John began to yell, bounce and wave their arms to get attention. At one point, the former snake launched his friend 8 feet into the air, but the giantess never saw or heard the tiny creatures. She stepped forward and they intensified their movements as her titanous towering toes  landed directly in front of them. The gap between the splayed mountains seemed like a valley or the walls made by skyscrapers, with the toes clearing a thousand feet and challenging most skyscrapers in a contest of heights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the tiny's perhaps most insulting to them was that the immense black pads in front of them rose far overhead and their jumping never seemed to remotely compare. Once in this, Ash came down on John's tail and for a second they argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey watch it!\" John yelled, grabbing his tail after the jolt of fire that had lept up from its tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You watch it\" Ash shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I were normal sized, I'd show you\" John spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How, you wouldn't even see me!\" Ash screamed, but that was the last of that as the fox made another move...</span></div></div>",

They frantically began to jump up and down to catch her attention, and she suddenly leaned forward, reaching out her hand. Both their hearts stopped as the giant paw came closer, and closer, and closer to them, before finally...grabbing an object next to them. \"What is...\" John murmured, as Rachael lifted the object to her face. It became clear, quickly, what it was. \"YOU DROPPED THE GUN?!\" screamed Ash, hitting John in the gut. \"I-I didn't think-\" \"Ooh, what's this thing? Some kind of toy?\" said Rachael, interrupting their little fight. She examined it closely. It had several buttons, of course; A dumb-bell, two scales, a male and female symbol, and a question mark. Rachael twiddled the object in her fingers, before finally aiming it at herself and hitting a button. Both boys screamed as a beam of white light flew out and hit Rachael, sending her backwards. She landed on the carpet with a thud, her feet still mere inches from John and Ash. As she leaned her head up to figure out what happened, John and Ash had no idea what button she'd pushed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Rachael push?</span></div></div>",

Damn snake got him and got him good. A glance to his side revealed Rachel's feet, flat against the bed and with her knees high in the air. Her toes, normally about 3 inches tall now soared towards 1500 feet overhead, big enough to shoot by most skyscrapers, only two or three were any larger. He was actually smaller than a flea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel just layed there, thinking that her boyfriend had just fallen silent for a bit. Had someone told her she had a boyfriend 1/550th her size she'd never have believed them. If they told John she was that big, he'd believe them in a heartbeat.</span></div></div>",

He twiddled the gun in his fingers as he thought about what the 'responsible' thing to do was. The responsible thing to do would be to resize John before Rachel pulverised him instantly by merely twitching with her gigantic paw...but there was another solution to that. Setting the gun back on 'Shrink', he took aim at Rachel, and hoped that they'd shrink to around the same size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel's ears perked up when she felt something sting her. \"John?\" She glanced around. Where had John gone? As she was preparing to get up and go look for him, she gasped as the world began to rapidly spin around her. What was happening? Everything was a blur and seemed to woosh past the Fox woman, and she as she watched the world expanding she realized what was happening. She was shrinking! She let out a yell, but she was already under a foot in height and dropping fast; her voice didn't carry far...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but down below, John was struggling to climb up the side of the smallest toe on her paw when he felt something happening.

At first Rachel was confused, but her eyes widened in realization. \"J-John?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel! It's me!\" he yelled as loud as he could, his body only an inch tall compared to Rachel. Before her shrinking had even finished, she picked up John, and watched him 'grow'. \"John...why is this happening? Why are we so small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because\" he said, finding it easier to speak at around 2-3 inches tall, \"I recieved a magic gun in the mail, and A'shter took it.\" It took Rachel a few seconds to process that. \"What?

Turning her head, she finally realized that John wasn't even there at all. When did he leave? \"John? Where'd you go?\" she asked, unable to hear John screaming that he's \"Down here!\" as she stood up, forcing John to hold on to a strand of leg fur for dear life as she began to look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe checked the bathroom, under the bed, in the closet...where had he gone?

A'shter watched in awe as the world exploded outwards, the bed becoming terrifyingly large underneat his tail. After a few moments, everything settles down...compared to Rachel, A'shter was now about 1/700th of her size, only he didn't realize it immedietly. He just knew that he had to find John. Turning around, his jaw hit the floor as he saw what a grand mistake he'd made. The gun didn't shrink with him! It now towered above him, like a monolith, reminding him of what a poor set of decisions he'd made. Groaning, he set off to find John...maybe they could work together to fix this.</span></div></div>",

With a pull on the trigger, blue lightning lanced across the evening going on night to strike the target, and RETURN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no chance to yell as lightning shot through John and at first he held the trigger thinking it came from the target, when he released the trigger, he realized it was his own fire. At first nothing happened, giving him enough time to see the target was indeed the little wolf boy and that he was carrying strange mirror, like those used to start a fire by amplifying sunlight. Things next when bad, very bad indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn wandered free of cover when he thought all was clear, and then in plain view of Katie, Jim and perhaps even the younger wolf, he began to shrink, and fast. Beneath him, the grass came out from under his feet as he shrank down to the point it didn't fit under him. While still above the grass, he sees the titans coming his way and then stalks of plant life shoot over him into a forest. He finds himself standing in his right foot print, in the center of the print from the formerly enormous pad. He's still shrinking the whole time and it only makes him fell worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the rim of the foot print, John sees a few of his fleas, those who'd jumped off and they were bigger than him. The shrink finally stops when he's around 300 feet from the surface of the ground. His inch-deep foot print was now 300 feet, it lost a half inch to the pad print an then the rest from his whole foot. He stood in sweat up to his ankles from the pad that had been here minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext the little lion hears enormous booms from the distance, he looks up and regrets it. The cat and wolf stand on the sidewalk, which itself is a few hundred feet tall and tower over him. They're looking down in search of, presumably, him. The wolf steps into the yard and passes over the tiny creature, who see the 'little' lupine's foot measures around a thousand feet long in the least, the cat steps up but doesn't come in, her foot is a mile long. Height is something that he doesn't worry about yet, these things are too big for that. He struggles to lift a little rock and they move a mile of them with a foot.

As small as he is, he often ran when they came near, of course that was nowhere near sufficient to outrun them, he could sprint and even shuffling along they'd beat him to the destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the end, Jim just stood in the grass looking down as if something might spring out in the last minute. Next to him, Katie was examining a tree branch, thinking if she were o shrink that'd be her first destination. It would be a much greater distance but she'd not have to worry about being crushed. There it would also be more possible to be spotted and helped or perhaps hitch a ride and acquire help. Of course, she didn't realize just what scale was at hand or the miles it involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the ground, John was right in front of the titans and more specifically the wolf's white titan towering toes. It was the right foot and he was just far enough away to see the titaness's pink claws off to the side. Unfortunately, that wasn't quite far enough, the view ahead was of the actually underside of the foot, supported by the pads and it was not at all pleasant. It looked like a catacombs of stringy material, the fur of course, dirt, mud and much more. Splatters of mud were on the fur around the toes and made the little lion think of just what his stain would be, a dot against the mud. Most imposing of all were the claws, thousand foot tall structures reaching our from the splayed mountains and digging deep into the ground as blunt crushing objects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBored and giving up, Jim looked down and imagined hecould dig up his target or scare it out. He rocked forward all the way onto his toes, back, wiggled them a bit and more. The second Katie saw it she stopped and made him stop, saying he could kill the thing they were looking for, of course her bigger foot could've done just as good and a better job of that. As a last act of defiant, the large lupine pushed his foot in under the dirt, still wiggling his little toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below, John was terrified, too terrified to think. The mountains surged forward, went under thousands of feet of ground and came up like a massive strainer. He fell down through the dirt and clung to a strand of fur between the toes. All around was a mix of white and brown. The trees he clung to were white but the destruction and results of flying dirt were brown and even black.</span></div></div>",
