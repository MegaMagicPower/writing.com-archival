When Minato had joined S.E.E.S and become its field leader, all the money Minato earned had to go somewhere which eventually went towards food. This led to Minato gaining weight at a much quicker pace. Minato now sported a chubby face that was verging on gaining a second chin, which was accompanied by two pinchable cheeks. Minato's arms were slowly growing from the increased weight which sightly stretched out his highschool uniform; Minato's legs were in the same predicament, with two thighs that grew to slowly get closer to one another. Minato's stomach was small, but was now gaining traction. It would push his uniform shirt to its limit, to the point where his shirt showed every curve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato couldn't care for his increased weight; in fact, he relished in it, and so did the rest of S.E.E.S. Minato actually enjoyed gaining weight and wished to gain more as shown by his current predicament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato had made his way downstairs to grab a \"snack\". This was a common occurrence. Minato was currently in some too small pajama pants that hugged his shapely legs and ass plus an ill fitting shirt that constantly rose up after a couple steps. Minato was stuffing himself with some pasta he had lazily cooked, when he heard footsteps coming from the stairs. When Minato looked over he saw...</span></div></div>",

The brunette had come down for a little snack herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It tastes fine.\" Minato flatly stated. \"And didn't you burn something so badly not even Koromaru ate it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I've gotten a lot better at cooking since then. Why don't I cook us something and prove it you?\" The archer suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, go ahead.\" Minato said before eat some more of his pasta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still going to finish that, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari wasn't surprised, her friend was truly a glutton. On more then one occasion she had been truly astounded by how much Minato in one sitting, and how big his stuffed gut would get as a result. It was no wonder that he had gotten so fat lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yukari cooked the pasta, she couldn't help but think about her friend's big belly. When they first met, it was only a little chubby, not enough to catch Yukari's attention. But now it was a soft ball of fat that would jiggle with every step. Yukari would often find herself staring at the sphere of jiggly fat. Even while exploring Tartarus she would sometimes sneak a peak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette imagined herself in her room rubbing an obese Minato's massive stuffed belly as he let out gigantic belches, the archer having just finished stuffing him to the brim with a massive meal.. Minato has a nice, big jiggly belly, huge man boobs that rested on his gut, very chubby legs that rubbed together, chunky arms connected to meaty hands, a big bubblebutt that had broken chairs, and an adorable fat face with chubby cheeks and a double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis bloated gut had snapped his belt in half and popped off the button on his pants. The resulting avalanche of belly fat that came out forced his zipper all the way down, exposing some of his underwear. Minato's big belly had forced his shirt to ride up to just below his flabby chest,<br>\r\nleaving his massive gut completely exposed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari then imagined Minato letting out a burp so massive that it caused the many empty plates once filled with food and even the room itself to shake. Minato's belly even jiggled from the force of his belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well excuse you!\" Yukari playfully said as she gave Minato's belly a few affectionate pats before she resumed rubbing the giant orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a little too -URP- late for that. UUUURRRP!\" Minato remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari snapped herself out of her thoughts. She immediately decided she would just write it off as some weird dream and resolved to forget about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giant belch Minato released caught Yukari's attention. Yukari looked over at him to see that he had just finished the bowl of pasta he made. The chubby bluenette was leaning back in his seat, resting a hand on his slightly bigger stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well excuse you!\" Yukari playfully said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari finished cooking their pasta shortly after. She had made enough to fill up two huge bowls, one for each of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go.\" Yukari said as she placed the bowls on the table in front of the couch and then sat next to Minato. \"Let's dig in.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Minato moaned, finishing another slice of delicious cake even as his aching stomach begged him to stop. He really did want to stop and let his belly rest but he just couldn't turn down any of Aigis' cooking after she had gone to the trouble of baking them for him. Plus they tasted really good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bluenette and Aigis were in the former's room, Aigis had baked a huge feast for Minato. This was a common thing for them now. Aigis had grown interested in cooking once she learned about how cooking for someone was considered a sign of friendship or even love. Hoping this would help her understand humans more, Aigis started to learn how to cook, with Minato being her taste tester. It didn't take too long for the android to become a skilled cook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Aigis did not know what the size of an average meal was for someone like Minato. Her meals initially started out small, as she knew to start with simple and small stuff, but as she grew more skilled and comfortable with cooking, the portions greatly increased. Of course, eating so much caused Minato to balloon up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato has a large belly that always strained the buttons on his school uniform shirt when it wasn't popping them, which often happened during a good meal. The big ball of fat was very soft, which was why Aigis loved feeling it so much. This also meant that it could serve as a nice spot to rest one's head. Minato's big belly hung down and was very jiggly, bobbing and bouncing with every step like it was made of jello, a sight the female members of S.E.E.S. found distracting for reasons they couldn't really explain. His gut would get especially jiggly during gym class or when he was fighting shadows. Love handles and rolls had formed on the sides of his dome of a middle and were deep enough to fit some small objects in. His bellybutton had grown so deep that it looked like a dark cave and was often visible when he binged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blunette's chest had turned into a pair of flabby moobs, they were big enough that the bluenette could cup them in his hands. Minato could even fill up a bra with his moobs. Having such big moobs would sometimes cause Minato to be mistaken for a girl. Just like his big tummy, Minato's chest was very jiggly and soft. Yukari had taken to teasing Minato about his chest by calling them his breasts, much to his chagrin. It was because of Minato growing such a flabby chest that Aigis learned what moobs were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe persona user's ass was humongous, each cheek was a malleable sphere the size of a volleyball. It strained his pants, not just because of the size but also because all the jiggling his butt did when he ran had caused many rips in many pairs of pants. His ass lifted him up by a full inch whenever he sat down and left a noticeable imprint on the dorm's couches when he sat down on one, which he always did when he came home after school, unless of course he didn't go straight to his room to play a video game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis legs were meaty and wide, rubbing together whenever he walked or sat down, with barely any separation otherwise. All the jostling and wobbling the bluenette's legs did when he walked highlighted how badly out of shape Minato had become. He was never a fan of all the walking and running he had to do in Tartarus but getting so out of shape made the experience even more unbearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato's face was much more round and chubby. His face had pretty much no angles to it, with cute chubby cheeks and a double chin. All this new found fat caused Minato to appear much more friendly, a stark contrast to how quiet and uninterested he used to usually look. This led to some friendly teasing from Yukari, which she sometimes liked to emphasize by pinching his round cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURRP! Excuse me. Sorry about that, Aigis.\" Minato said to his friend after he finished his slice of cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no need to apologize, belching helps your stomach feel better.\" Aigis replied, already cutting Minato another slice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so.\" Aigis had already told Minato that he should belch a few times throughout the course of their many taste testing sessions, though Minato would still sometimes instinctively apologize for his bursts of gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato looked down at his big belly, the large mass was taking up most of his vision as he did so. He had been fat for a while now yet there was still some times where he would look at his belly and be surprised by how massive it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it's only going to get bigger and bigger for now.\" Minato thought as he dug in to the new slice of cake Aigis gave him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato unleashed a massive belch when he finally finished eating the many sweets Aigis had prepared for him that night, a fitting way to signal the end of his feast. His gut was an even massive sphere of fat now and completely took up his lap, even going a little past it. He had to undo the buttons on his shirt and pants, as well as his belt and zipper to make room for the gigantic orb, lest it just force them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again -UUURRRAP- for the meal, Aigis.\" Minato burped out. \"It was great like al -URP- ways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I am glad you enjoy it so much.\" Aigis replied. \"Would you like me to engage in rubbing your belly again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, -UUUUURP- thanks.\" Minato always loved it when Aigis rubbed his stuffed gut after every binge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAigis placed her hands on Minato's stuffed gut and started moving them in soothing and gentle motions in it's blubbery surface, which felt absolutely heavenly to the bloated bluenette. Despite being a robot, Aigis' hands felt as warm as any other human's. All the rubs caused Minato to emit quite a few loud belches, which went along perfectly with the massage in soothing his stomach. Aigis also kneaded Minato's tummy, which at one point caused the obese bluenette to let out a really big burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRP! Oof.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe that was your biggest belch within the previous 24 hours.\"</span></div></div>",

All she would do was eat, even during the dark hour! She would hand out food to her fellow members like it was trick or treat night! Even when all she received was a slight scratch from a shadow, she would eat an entire loaf of bread or a Wild Duck Burger! Speaking of, any time she could, she would be seen at Wild Duck Burger stuffing her face with everything on the menu. She simply couldn't help herself and it was definitely showing on her figure. What was once a nice slender girl when arriving, was now a girl with love handles and chins like no other. Almost every step she took, the ground around her shook and she didn't seem to mind nor care. It was amazing she could still do just as much as her fellow members during the dark hour with how much fat she had to carry around on her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fuuka's cooking didn't help Minako either. Every batch of cookies Fuuka would make, Minako would eat it all, even if it wasn't all that amazingly made. As for Shinjiro's cooking, Minako would down her portion and ask for seconds before anyone else could even thank Shinji for the food! After about four months into her binging, Minako stepped on a scale to see how much she weighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it...</span></div></div>",

She knew she wasn't as mobile as she had been before but, 500 pounds?! That was ridiculous! She looked in the mirror and at her face. She didn't know what to think, but of course, when she didn't know what to think and was upset, she went right to food. She went down the stairs to the kitchen of the dorm and started eating everything in sight. She didn't know how to deal with this sadness that had slowly crept in so, the only way she knew how to deal with things was to eat, and boy did she eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The kitchen had just been restocked earlier today, courtesy of the Kirijo group, and an entire week's worth of food for 8 people, a dog, and a robot was a lot indeed. In only a matter of minutes, a fourth of the pantry was gone into Minako's stomach. She simply sat on the couch in the lounge across the TV with lots and lots of empty bags around her and plenty of potato chip crumbs all over her shirt and face. She just kept shoving handfuls and handfuls of food into her mouth as she kept watching TV. Luckily, Minako had decided not to go to the dark hour this night so no one was up as late as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After her run of eating now almost half of the entire food stock for the week, she had finally decided she was full and went back up to her room. This time she weighed herself again and she was now 510 pounds! She had gained 10 entire pounds in just one binge! She was know even more distraught and simply didn't know what to do. However, she knew that the pantry was already low so, she simply decided to go to sleep. During this sleep, she had a dream where she would get her face stuffed and stuffed by a machine that was feeding her constant extremely fattening foods. She got so fat she couldn't even move! However, when she woke up, she was back in her room and out of her dream, although, she had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked out of her room and...</span></div></div>",

She suggested that Ms. Arisato goes on a diet instead, or else she could be a burden on the team. Minako, being the stubborn girl that she is, refused to do something as low as going on a diet and suggested the idea to Aigis again. Whether it be her loyalty to Ms. Arisato, or her programming, Aigis, after a bit of time, agreed to Minako's terms. However, they couldn't do it in the dorm, as the messiness and the noise could disrupt others, even though that never stopped Minako before. Aigis suggested they go to Yakushima, where the food supply is much greater there, and can even be replenished if needed. Plus, if Minako were to want to do this for a long period of time, she would need medical care, along with lots of sciencey things to help her, even if the feeder was just Aigis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0During the night, Aigis and Minako would get a boat ride to Yakushima and Aigis would start feeding Minako at superhuman speeds, making Minako both happy and larger by the minute. With lots of medical and science help at the base in Yakushima, Minako nor Aigis were in much trouble of overdoing anything, as such Minako was free to eat and eat and eat and eat and eat like she always had. Her waist got larger and larger, along with her already plump and sausage-like finger becoming even more so. Her fat cheeks, both on the front and rear of her were quite apparent, and her breasts weren't anything to scoff at either. They were past double F's and were more like double K's! Plus, her waist was about 2 entire feet in front of her! While her stomach probably got the brunt of it all, her butt cheeks weren't light either. They were like two overstuffed, full-sized bean bag chairs that you could fit two people onto! It was amazing that Yakushima even had clothes that fit her as well as they did, even with Aigis continuing to feed Minako to the point of bursting every night now. Of course, this translated on Minako's ability to do everyday things. She now needed help with almost everything except walking, which with how she shook the ground with every step she took, she now shook every chair, desk, table, anything with each step she would pound on the ground.

Aigis even started to like Minako's plump figure, even if it was quite... non-mobile. After just 3 weeks from starting the feeding, Minako needed help walking, as her legs were just too plump. After a morning routine, that had now become half of Aigis' job, Minako stepped onto what was now a special scale given to the two by scientists and Yakushima and it read...</span></div></div>",

She had become at peace with her growing and even wanted to grow further. She wanted to be the biggest girl on the planet, and nothing was going to stop her. As Minako's journey went on, the rest of SEES carried on without Minako or Aigis at their side, which was quite the blow to their overall team but, with all their powers together, the rest of the group was unstoppable, even to Strega! Junpei and Yukari even supported Minako's journey, with the rest of SEES not really understanding it, but definitely also supporting it on the downside. In fact, Minako's stuffing had started to rub off on the rest of SEES! They all were slightly letting themselves go, even Akihiko, the protein junkie himself, was getting a little flabby. However, the person besides Minako who was the flabbiest was actually Aigis! Aigis was starting to get jealous that Minako was the big one out of everyone, and she requested that the scientists make her a bigger chassis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It didn't take long for the scientists to do so, after all, a robot that not only had a bigger figure, to begin with, but one that could eat and grow as she ate was quite the marvelous and ground-breaking technology that they had only dreamed of studying on! So, as every one night Minako got bigger and bigger, so did Aigis. Along with feeding Minako, Aigis also started to feed herself. Her chassis wasn't even half of what Minako's had now become but, just like Minako herself, it wasn't anything to simply scoff at. Aigis's robot body was getting harder to cover with her uniform at school, as she had to order many sizes above what she had previously. Luckily though, she was able to pull it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After only a month and a half of constant every night feeding, Minako was getting to become more or less immobile as she got closer and closer to weighing a literal ton. Her breasts were now double Z's, her face almost unrecognizable with how plump it was, her legs looking like plus-sized roosters, her arms looking like giraffe necks, her hands and feet looking like blown up gloves, her butt cheeks looking like two entire couches, and her belly, whew, if you could see anything of her, it was her belly as it was an entire 6 feet from one side to the other. Minako was quite the sight to behold and her bodies ability to scarf down food like a madwoman was insane. The Yakushima scientists even had to make a machine that helped them collect food from around the island just to feed both Minako and her robot assistant. As for Aigis, she was about 600 pounds and looked like Minako did when she was that big! Aigis was even starting to look like she might need help lugging her body around, but the number of stabilizers inside of her was more than enough to keep her mobile, even if she surpassed a ton. Aigis would even lay on Minako's incredibly soft body as that was the only way to get to Minako's mouth and feed her. Aigis was starting to become in love with all the fat that not only surrounded her but surrounded Minako as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eventually though, one day...</span></div></div>",

The excitement on her face was quite immeasurable. It was around here when she finally became immobile, however, that didn't mean she would stop eating. Even after her accomplishment of weighing a ton, Aigis still kept on feeding the huge hunk of woman. Minako's breasts were now two, full-size beach balls, both being way past ZZ's. Her butt was the same, seemingly able to crush even the largest of couches in its way. Now, of course, her mid-section was the biggest of her, being nearly the size of a common living room, and still growing! Aigis, along with stuffing the now immobile teenager, was stuffing herself too! Aigis was starting to have trouble even feeding Minako, as Aigis' own fluff and girth was getting in the way of getting food to Minako's mouth. However, the scientists at Yakushima had made an invention that would help both Minako and Aigis gain without either of them doing any work. Two hoses were connected to the teenager and the robot, both filled with an extremely fattening liquid that not only could pack on the pounds in seconds, but tasted amazing too! The Yakushima scientists turned the machines on, and both the robot and the teenager started to <i>really</i> pack on the pounds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In mere seconds, Minako was already ten pounds heavier than before, and it was showing too! Both her and Aigis were like two of the worlds largest bean-bag chairs, and with how many curves and love handles the two had, you would think their sides were racetracks, curving this way and that! Minako was content with gaining this way, and Aigis was right there with her. Minako knew that this would be her life now, but she didn't mind. Being able to fatten up to her hearts content with no downsides was what she has wanted for a very long time. In just ten minutes, she was 100 pounds heavier, and an hour, 600 pounds heavier! There seemed to be no slowing down on both her gain and Aigis' gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom here though...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a cool autumn morning over Iwatodai Dorm, the Sunday of September 6th, 2009. While most Japanese Students went into the city on Sundays, many to do lots of fun activities with their friends, the teenagers that made up the numbers of S.E.E.S were not like most Japanese Students. This Sunday was one the had been proceeded by one of the most strenuous \"Full Moon Operations\" that they've underwent to date...everyone in the dorm was exhausted. This included their field leader, Minako Arisato, who was ordinarily bouncing with so much energy that you could easily mistake her for a field mouse on crack. But today, she had her face buried deeply into her pillow, drool comically leaking from her mouth and off the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though her alarm clock had rang out at least 4 times, Minako was still fast asleep. Not even heavy construction or even a nuke going off could wake the red-headed girl...but a nuke was nothing compared to the wrath of Mitsuru Kirijo. Without any regard for privacy, Mitsuru slammed open Minako's Door, the knob thudding against the wall. Even if the noise didn't wake her, when her door opened, Minako instantly jumped out from her covers, hair disheveled and pajama shirt partially unbuttoned. She stared wide-eyed to her left, Mitsuru standing in the door frame. At this point, Minako had been apart of S.E.E.S long enough to sense when the imposing 3rd was <b>not</b> happy, so she was on full alert. As Minako shifted from her bed and onto the floor, Mitsuru began to speak.<br>\r\n\"Arisato! Can you care to explain why you were still in your room, sleeping while it's currently 11 in the morning?\"<br>\r\n\"Um...\", Minako hesitated, \" 'Cus it's a Sunday? And we also got back from an operation last night, as everyone was really-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone?!\", Mitsuru retorted, eyes gazing at the shorter red-head, \"When you say 'everyone', you don't mean to say the entire team was exhausted, do you? Because if I can recall correctly, It is just yourself, Iori, and Akihiko who consistantly sleep in late! You and Iori because you two stay up playing Video Games, even on School nights! And Akihiko because...<i>sigh</i> he insists on training on his punching bag for hours into the night...\" Mitsuru's eyelids lowered upon mentioning her good friends childish attribute...\"Regardless!\", she continued, \"Since I have already taken the liberty of awakening Iori, saving you the trouble of looking into the trash pile he calls a room, someone needs to get Akihiko to wake up! I would do it myself but...\" Mitsuru paused for a moment, shifting her body, looking off to the side while gripping her arm in a typical fashion for her, \"I do not think he would appreciate me invading his privacy in such a manner...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an additional 20 seconds of awkward silence, Minako sat up from her bed and approached her closet, shifting through her casual shirts as she picked her outfit for the day. Taking an orange sweater of it hanger, Mitsuru broke the silence, \"However!\", she bellowed, startling Minako, causing her to slip and fall on the cold floor, one are already through the sweater. Looking up, she was greeted by Mitsuru's finger pointed at her. \"I know you are already in a rather intimate relationship with Akihiko, so it would be no problem for you to infiltrate his room in order to awaken him, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako, still on the floor, tried to respond to the request. \"Um, yeah, I guess I could-\" Mitsuru again interrupted her. \"Trei Bien! I'll be counting on you, see to it that he is up within the hour. Farewell.\" Before she could even blink, Mitsuru had shut Minako's door as quickly as she'd opened it. Minako was left on her bedroom floor, wondering exactly what she did to deserve this. Taking her new assignment in stride, she sat up from the floor and finished getting dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer outfit picked out and her disposition back to the cheery norm, Minako emerged from her room and ran down the stairs to Akihiko's room. Walking down the hall, the door to Junpei's room was wide open...\"I really don't see what the big deal is. It's only a little dirty, so what?\", Minako thought, briefly peering in before she continued on her way. Arriving at Akihiko's Door, Minako did the proper thing and gave a few knocks before barging in like Mitsuru had done. <i>knock knock knock</i> \"Akihiko, sweetie, it's time to get uuuu~p!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......There was no response. Being a bit more forceful with her knocking, Minako tried again. <b>KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK</b> \"Aki, come on, It's almost noon! You'll miss the morning special at Hagukure, and I know how much you love that!\" ......Still no response. Minako couldn't believe it. \"Wow, even at the mention of half price beef bowls, he's not up yet...that normally works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then turned the knob of the door, finding it unlocked. Slowly pushing, the door creaked open. Mitsuru was right to let her wake Akihiko up, as she'd been in her a number of times already. And from her previous experience, she also knew Akihiko slept naked...And there, on the bed that her and Akihiko had shared at least 2 'tender moments' on, layed Akihiko. Carefully approaching the bed, Minako crouched to quiet her steps. \"He's always so cute when he mumbles in his sleep...I'll just have listen real quick\", Minako thought, as came close to his still sleeping head. Here, she listened to his tired mumbling, things involving training, something about Shinjiro seeing what he did, the usual. But about 2 minutes into her listening, Akihiko began to shift in his covers, his legs buckling and his  hands were...squeezing his pillow? Minako didn't know what to make of this...she'd never him do this before....but it was what came out of Akihiko's mouth that surprised her most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow almost fondling his pillow, Akihiko mumbled several strange things, things like \"Uggh...yeah Minako-chan...you're so soft, agh!\" and \"Your belly makes such a good pillow, ya know...so plump and warm\" and most shockingly \"Mmmmh...I love you so much, Minako-chan...I love that you did this for me...makes our cuddles so much softer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako...didn't quite get what she was hearing...\"Soft? Plump and...warm? Cuddles...did it for him?\", she went over the strange phrase again in her head. This was just too much for her to process...did Akihiko, the Akihiko that was so obsessed with fitness it was a second language to him...like fat girls? No...that can't be. But as Akihiko's girlfriend, she had to know for sure. As she jostled him awake, she thought about asking him right then and there....she ended up:</span></div></div>",

Though no-one besides him knew, he joined SEES to get revenge for his mother, who was accidentally killed by one of their members, Shinjiro.

UUUURRRRP!\" The brunette said as she rubbed her big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it. UUURRAAP! I couldn't eat another bite.\" Minako said, sitting across from Yukari as she rubbed her own bloated tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari had just finished having an eating contest with Minako at Wild Duck Burger and was the clear winner. Both their bellies had become very bloated from the sheer amount of burgers (and occasionally fires) they shoveled into their greedy mouths. All the soda and water they drank wasn't helping either. Both their bellies were so big that they had to unzip their school jackets to make room for their big middles. The shirts they wore under their jackets were now far too small for their huge guts which were causing them to rise up to the point that their bellies were now completely exposed. Their bellies were large orbs stuffed to the brim with food and they almost completely covered their laps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they had both eaten a ton of food, Yukari's gut was much bigger then Minako's as, unlike her brown haired friend, she was fat. While having a much bigger belly was an obvious advantage for her, Yukari truly did have a talent for stuffing herself and Minako was no slouch in that regard either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari had always been a chubby girl and her weight had mostly spread evenly. Her belly was an almost completely spherical orb of adipose that was very large and soft. It would jiggle and bob in a gelatinous fashion with every step the Persona user made, this was especially shown off during PE or when she was fighting shadows. Her tummy was soft and pillowy, making it a rather nice place to rest one's head. Minako was actually rather interested in feeling it herself, she loved big soft things.  The brunette's gut had a noticeable hang to it that emphasized just how huge it was. Yukari had some impressive love handles (fitting given that her persona was of the Lovers arcana) that were accompanied by some noticeable side rolls. She also had a deep bellybutton that almost looked like a black hole in the middle of her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette had some very impressive boobs. The soft and jiggly sacks of fat were very large and perky. They were one part of her body that Yukari didn't mind being big, though she didn't like having to put up with all the jiggling that came with the territory. It wasn't a big deal during the normal parts of her life but it was certainly a problem when she fought shadows. Not only was the feeling of her breasts jiggling very distracting but they were jiggling while the other members of S.E.E.S. were around. She especially hated the thought of Junpei staring at the sight, he could already be annoying enough. She had already caught him staring at her big boobs many times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari had a huge bubble butt that was just as jiggly as her gut. It was so big that Yukari actually had some trouble finding a skirt that was  shorter then the one on the normal Gekkoukan uniform and would still cover her ass. Each cheek was big and soft and would completely fill up any chair she sat down on, with some of her flab even spilling off the sides. The brunette's butt would even leave a noticeable imprint on her dorm's couches whenever she planted her ass on one of them. Yukari's ass was complimented by some very wide and meaty legs. They almost always rubbed together and wobbled with every step the fat brunette made. Yukari also had some lardy hips that did a good job of showing off her curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari's face was very pudgy, with a big double chin and chubby cheeks that were very soft and so round they were practically puffed up. They actually helped to make her face appear rather cute and inviting. Even her moments of anger seemed cute because of this, though whoever she was upset at probably wouldn't be able to appreciate that at the time. All in all, Yukari's chub did not get it the way of her having a very pretty face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince one's persona was the manifestation of one's subconscious, Yukari's persona, Io, was just as fat as her and had the same body shape as her. While her having an obese persona was perfectly logical, it was a bit of a shock to Mitsuru, Akihiko, Minako, and Junpei, as each of their respective persona had a very slim body. Before, they didn't know if an overweight persona was even possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you up for another round?\" Yukari said, tending to her swollen middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof, no way. UUURRRP! I couldn't eat another bite.\" Minako answered, giving her tummy a few rubs. \"Man, you can really pack it away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm actually pretty stuffed myself. UUUURRRP!\" Yukari said as she idly drummed her fingers along her tummy. \"Really, I'm shocked by how much you ate. You're a lot slimmer then me and you still kept up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm full \u2013UURRAAP- of surprises, Yukari.\" Minako said with a grin. She then gave her gut a hearty slap for emphasis. However, as soon as her hand made contact, her expression turned into one of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" She uttered as she cradled her gut. Slapping her stomach turned out to be a lot more painful then she thought it would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari chuckled at the unusual sight. She wasn't sure who was the bigger dork, Junpei or Minako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, Yukari and Minako happily chatted about a variety of subjects, belching all the while as they waited for their stomachs to digest their meal. They actually wanted to head back to the dorm right now but they wanted to digest a little bit more of their meal before they got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Minako had a question that caused Yukari to worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, how bad is the bill for all this going to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Yukari had just realized that she and Minako got so caught up it in the contest that they never actually thought about how much all this food was going to cost. \"Really bad, I know that.\"</span></div></div>",

They waddled over to the couch as quickly as they could and collapsed on to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two overfed teens began rubbing their big bellies and belching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, \u2013URP- as stuffed as we are, that was actually \u2013UUUURRRP- pretty fun!\" Yukari said, smiling warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it \u2013UURRRAAP- was.\" Minato concurred, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari and Minato simultaneously belted out a massive belch.

She couldn't help but wriggle a bit from the fullness of her stomach as Mitsuru placed another cinnamon roll between her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't the first time Yukari had been in this situation, sprawled on her bed as Mitsuru stood over her with a box of sweets, Yukari's stomach distended to it's limit, straining the buttons of her pink cardigan and red from pressure. Over the last few weeks, Mitsuru and she had been having secret sessions like this regularly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It had been an accident, discovering each other's... secret pleasures. A little more than a month ago, the members of S.E.E.S. had held a banquet, the occasion for such a feast escaped Yukari at the moment, and she had had too much to eat, her stomach similarly taught as it was in the present. Yukari found herself liking the feeling of letting go, eating past her limit without a care for how it affected her waistline, something she had never allowed herself to do before that moment. It was a new sensation, one she couldn't quite explain why it felt so good to her. Unbeknownst to her, Mitsuru had also found pleasure from the circumstances, albeit in a different way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, both had tried to keep their desires secret, Mitsuru from Yukari, and Yukari from everyone in general. Mitsuru spent a couple of weeks attempting to contrive excuses to get Yukari to stuff her face, and Yukari, looking for opportunities to do exactly that, obliged. As time passed, and Mitsuru noticed how eager Yukari was to eat, and Yukari noticed how often Mitsuru gave Yukari the opportunity, secrets came out, and the two decided to share the experience with one another more honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the last month or so, Yukari had gained an impressive amount of weight. She had gone from being a girl of relatively average size, just under 130, to officially overweight at 160. The weight had not concentrated in any one place, at least not yet, but instead had spread all over. Her once slender frame now had a noticeable potbelly that hung into her lap and pushed against the buttons of her shirt even when she wasn't full to bursting. Her breasts now fought for space against her bra, and her thighs now rubbed together slightly when she walked. Her skirt rode up along her enlarged buttocks, and her face was considerably more cherubic. She had yet to upsize her wardrobe, but at the rate she had been gaining, she would certainly need to very soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm afraid that's the last pastry. I guess we'll wrap up here for the night.\" Mitsuru stated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BRRRRRAAAAAPP!... excuse me.\" Yukari belched out, relieving some of the immense pressure in her gut \"Oh, this feels so good, Mitsuru-senpai. At first, I just wanted to eat. I'd never just let myself eat whatever before, y'know? But now, it's not just that. I never thought I would say something like this, but I think I'm actually liking this fat. It's so soft and it's... it's... something. It feel better than I thought it would, that's for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" Mitsuru inquired with a grin \"In that case...\"</span></div></div>",

She was surprised, for certain, but she couldn't quite pin down her other thoughts on the matter. It seemed bizarre, how quickly Mitsuru had chosen to sacrifice her debonair figure for potential pleasure, but on the other, Yukari was strangely entranced by the idea of a pudgy Mitsuru, her potbelly slowly outgrowing her blouse as the buttons grew tighter and tighter....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While I have my concerns, spending these last few weeks with you has provided me with new insight into my own desires.\" Mitsuru's response snapped Yukari out of her train of thought \"Besides, on the off chance I find the added poundage too cumbersome, I have faith in my willpower to lose it should I so choose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, good for you!\" Yukari said, a bit worried she sounded too enthusiastic \"So, how do we want to get started on your new life as a fat girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru pondered for a moment...</span></div></div>",

I wish to sample as many different restaurants as possible, and find the ideal way to gain. Perhaps we could also use the opportunity to buy some new clothes. Both of us will be needing them soon.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Yukari was awake enough to recall those words, she sprung out of bed with vigor, causing her breasts and stomach to bounce and jiggle in her nightshirt. She wasted no time stripping out of her pajamas and into her weekend attire, a pink dress with fur on the hem, now barely containing her new figure. Her breasts threatened to pop free at the slightest jolt, and her gut strained the strings holding the dress on, but she didn't care anymore. A quick brushing of hair and application of light makeup later, and she was down in the lounge awaiting her... gaining friend? Yukari was still uncomfortable with the thought of being involved with another girl. She definitely liked guys, but she had never felt anything like she had with Mitsuru. Was it just the weight gain, or...? She decided not to think too much harder about it. She was too excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Takeba. Are you ready?\" Mitsuru entered the lounge wearing a black sleeveless shirt that hugged her soon-not-to-be slender figure, elastic sweat pants, and a scarf around her midriff to help cover her stomach once she had eaten her fill. It was clear just from her wardrobe choice that Mitsuru was prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I ever! Let's get out of here and eat before Stupei or someone else shows up and starts teasing me about how fat I am.\" The rest of S.E.E.S. was still in the dark about the relationship and unusual tastes of the two. Their reactions to Yukari's rapid ballooning had ranged from Junpei playfully teasing her, to Aigis matter-of-factly expressing concern for her health, to Fuuka expressing a strange curiosity at Yukari's subtle pleasure. Yukari hated it, but it wasn't enough to deter her from stuffing herself, especially with Mitsuru encouraging and consoling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first stop that the two ladies made on their restaurant binge was Wild Duck Burger at Iwatodai. Mitsuru had ordered two large meals for each of them, all consisting of the largest, meatiest burger the place offered, the Mega Duck, and large side orders of fries and onion rings. Yukari's mouth watered at the mere thought of the savory goodness, digging in without hesitation the moment Mitsuru brought it to the table. She ate with uncharacteristic gluttony, powering through the first of her massive, bacon-and-cheese-laden burger with insane speed. Mitsuru was fascinated, but quickly turned her attention to her own meal, eating quickly, but failing to keep pace with Yukari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter half an hour or so, both women had finished their meals, Mitsuru's stomach distended slightly, making her already tight shirt just a little tighter, and Yukari satisfied but still with room for more. \"I must say, this is very pleasing.\" Mitsuru stated, her hand resting on the small bump of digesting food on her previously flat stomach. \"Give me a moment to rest, and then we can continue.\"</span></div></div>",

They punctuated their extended binge with stops at clothes stores, as Yukari overhauled her wardrobe to account for her expanding figure, and Mitsuru made preparations for her own growth. By late afternoon, both members of S.E.E.S. were not only toting around several shopping bags full of plus-sized clothing, but also large, stretched-out stomachs full of as much food as they could handle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru's svelte figure was interrupted by a belly that made her look eight months pregnant, a small sliver of reddened skin showing between her tight shirt and the scarf around her midriff. She looked as though she could hardly hold herself up as she staggered back to the dorms, her face a mixture of discomfort and erotic pleasure as she thought of her figure expanding, becoming soft and large like Yukari's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari, on the other hand, seemed to have fewer problems with moving about, having gotten used to moving about while stuffed beyond the normally acceptable amount. Her soft gut was pushed out a few more inches than usual, slightly red and with stretch marks along it. She wore a newly bought tank top and short shorts that fit tightly and allowed the bottom of her stomach to peek out just a bit. She was hesitant to buy something that she knew she would outgrow within a week or two, and that showed off so much of the fat she was still not completely to terms with yet, but Mitsuru had talked her into it and even promised to pay for everything she bought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls panted their way back to the dorm, weighed down by their stomachs and the shopping bags on their arms. As they finally reached their destination, sweat drenching both of their faces, Yukari pushed open the front door and walked into the lounge.</span></div></div>",

We found that we both received a certain degree of pleasure from her eating and gaining weight and we got carried away. I guess you could say we've been in a relationship for the last few weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuuka gasped and Aigis stood there, staring blankly as she typically did. \"Mitsuru-senpai, are you serious? And what about you? Is that stomach because you're trying to gain weight as well? I don't know what to say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's true.\" Yukari sighed and sat down next to Mitsuru. \"Almost every night, Mitsuru-senpai has been feeding me food and... sometimes doing other things.\" Yukari murmured the last bit, blushing \"It was just about eating at first, but then I started getting chubby and we both liked it. Mitsuru just started trying to gain with me today.\" Yukari started to subconsciously play with her gut and love handles just thinking about her nights with Mitsuru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sexual experimentation, even with members of the same sex, is normal and healthy for humans of your age.\" Aigis interjected with no hesitation \"Sexual deviancy is also not an uncommon occurrence among humans. Excess fat tissue can lead to health problems, but the correct diet and exercise regimen can allow for excess weight with minimal health concerns\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aigis...\" Yukari was shocked that the most strictly logical member of S.E.E.S. had been so quick to understand, even if she had put it so bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aigis, are you saying you're okay with them getting fat for each other?\" Fuuka seemed dumbfounded \"Well, I guess if Aigis is right and you can be big without risking your health, I just want you to be happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?! You're okay with us?! ...Fine. Just... please keep Mitsuru-senpai and me a secret, okay?

Fortunately, she had been true to her word and kept quiet about it until they were ready to tell the others themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the time since then, both Yukari and Mitsuru had doubled down on gaining. Fuuka had even been willing to help by researching a weight gain diet for the two that would keep them relatively healthy but gain even faster. Yukari had passed 200 pound just the other day and Mitsuru wasn't far behind, having closed some of the gap between her and her girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were currently in Mitsuru's room, Mitsuru laying on the bed as Yukari kneeled over her, holding a box of donuts and feeding them to her lover. Yukari was currently wearing nothing but a thin t-shirt and panties. Her weight had slowly shifted to a slight pear shape as she gained, and her panties were clearly straining to contain her larger butt and thighs. They stretched thin across her legs and were partially swallowed by her ass, revealing most of her cheeks to the world. Her pale, smooth gut fell several inches into her lap, the shirt she wore making almost no effort to cover it. Her almost DD-cup breasts strained her shirt as well, pert nipples indicating that there was no bra underneath. She had a double chin and slight bingo wings, and her legs had widened, her thighs and calves jiggling as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru, laying at Yukari's knees in nothing but a bra and panties, weighed in at about 190, and was absolutely determine to reach her 200 milestone. She had developed into a curvy hourglass figure. Her face and arms were virtually untouched, but her torso had widened to accommodate the massive breasts that were squeezed into the bra she was wearing, cutting into her back fat and pushing her basketball-sized breasts together to create a large valley of cleavage. Her hips widened and her butt was about the same size as Yukari's, swallowing her panties in much the same way. Her stomach was currently large and swollen with sweets from her recent feeding session, but was normally only a minor paunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you've still got some room left, we still have a few more boxes here.\" Yukari said as she began to rub Mitsuru's red, swollen gut, causing her to let out a few slight moans of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if.. ah... you have... mmm... room for some... oh... yourself.\" Mitsuru said through her haze of fullness and arousal. \"Or, we could... take this further than that.\" She slowly moved her hand along Yukari's large, smooth thigh, ending by pinching and jiggling her love handle. Yukari giggled, then leaned to almost lay on top of Mitsuru and touched her lips with her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like that. The food will be there after.\" Yukari whispered...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"That was delicious! UUUURRRRP! Oh, excuse me.\" Mitsuru said as she gave her big belly a soothing rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru Kirijo had just finished eating a massive dinner and her belly had grown even larger from it. Mitsuru had undone most of her blouse's buttons when they began to feel tight, leaving her gut completely bare. The redhead gently wiped her lips with a napkin, a pleased smile on her chubby face. Yukari watched in silence, she had never seen someone eat so much in one sitting before, yet Mitsuru didn't even seem to care that she just ate over twenty dishes worth of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something the matter, -UUURRRP- Takeba?\" Mitsuru noticed that Yukari was staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've just never seen someone eat so much before.\" Yukari stated,she soon realized that Mitsuru might take offense at her words. \"Eh, no offense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken.\" Mitsuru said, smiling. \"But really, this isn't \u2013UUUURRRP- Pardon me. This isn't unusual of me. After all, how do you think I got this fat?\" Mitsuru gave her belly a hearty slap for emphasis, eliciting yet another belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru was a very fat woman. Her belly was the biggest part of her. The redhead's belly was an enormous sphere of adipose.It was incredibly soft and malleable. It would actually make a good place to rest one's head. It had a noticeable hang to it, emphasizing just how big it was. Mitsuru's tummy was very jiggly, to the point that it would jiggle and bounce with every step the obese redhead made, especially whenever she was running. Given that fighting shadows meant that Mitsuru would often be running around a lot, the other members of S.E.E.S would often be witnesses to the sight of Mitsuru's gut jiggling an incredible amount. Her stomach also had a spare tire and a very deep bellybutton<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru's breasts were very big as well and they jutted out almost as much as her gargantuan stomach. They would've rested upon it, had they not been so perky. The redhead's boobs were large orbs of soft flesh that were envied by many female students in Gekkoukan High. Her chest was so busty that it was actually capable of causing rips in some smaller bras. Much like her gut, the redhead's breasts were very bouncy, something that was proven beyond the shadow of a doubt whenever she was fighting shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead's butt was quite a massive thing. Each cheek was huge and very soft. Mitsuru's butt was just as jiggly as her gut and was often bouncing in tandem with the giant ball of fat. Mitsuru's jiggly behind would completely fill up nearly any chair she sat in. Her ass was complimented by the very wide and meaty legs Mitsuru possessed. They constantly rubbed together and wobbled slightly with every footfall. Mitsuru's legs went along well with the very impressive hips she had that did a very good job showing off her curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, there was Mitsuru's face. She had very cherubic cheeks and her chin was double-tiered. These features gave her chubby face a very cute appearance. Of course, this did not in the slightest deter Mitsuru from being taking seriously. She still displayed an incredible amount of elegance and grace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her obesity, Mitsuru was a fit and very capable fighter. Spending so much time fighting shadows (and performing the art of swordplay) resulted in the redhead's body adapting to her weight. It was quite the sight seeing Mitsuru masterfully perform elegant and graceful sword moves as her entire jiggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I guess that's true.\" Yukari said. \"So, since we're both done eating, do you wanna watch TV or something?\" Yukari wasn't close with Mitsuru but since everyone else besides her and Mitsuru was off doing their own thing, she might as well hang out with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. UUURRRP! Excuse me. Though I'm not sure if my tastes will go along well with yours.\" Mitsuru answered, drumming her fingers along her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it. We'll just see if there's anything good on\" Yukari replied. \"And if there isn't, I'm sure we can find a bad movie to watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would \u2013URP- we want to watch a bad movie?\" Mitsuru asked, a quizzical look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know how me, Junpei, and Minato get together after school and watch TV or play some video games? Sometimes me, Junpei, and Minato find an unbelievably bad movie and we laugh at it together.\" Yukari explained. \"I've gotta say, Junpei's got a knack for finding some really bad ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Mitsuru said. \"That's sounds fun. Would it be alright if I joined you three next time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, no problem. I'll have to ask them if If they're okay with it but I doubt they'll mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Takeba.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari and Mitsuru then got up, with a bit of difficulty in the redhead's case, and walked over to the couch. Yukari couldn't help but notice how much Mitsuru's belly, ass, and breasts jiggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then sat down and watched TV as Mitsuru continued to tend to her belly.</span></div></div>",
