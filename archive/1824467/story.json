You can recall that it was dark, storming, and that something caused your parents to swerve off the road and crash. How you survived is beyond expression of words, miracle does not put to justice how you emerged unharmed from the wreck. Still, your life has gone better since that night. After the crash, you were taken in by a Pokemon, and are now their little child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was that Pokemon?</span></div></div>",

I could only close the scars up on you.\" Gardevoir said. \"Alright.\" You said getting down from Gardevoir's Arms, You were still 4'3, and 10 years old. You quickly ran away with tears scraping down your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped at a nearby tree stump, and curled up in a ball and cried. An Hour Later, Gardevoir had found you, and put her hand on your shoulder. \"Come with me.\" Gardevoir said. She teleported you out of there, and you appear in a Cobblestone House in the woods, and it had a nice family in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Hun.\" Said a Gallade reading a Newspaper on the couch, \"Hey Dear.\" Gardevoir said. \"Hi Mommy!\" a Ralts said, running to her. Gardevoir accepted the Ralts' Hug, and you stopped crying. \"Is that Ralts a boy or a girl?\" You ask. \"Girl, Ralts, this is a human, we live alongside them in this world.\" Gardevoir explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to join our Family, we have lots of fun.\" Gardevoir asked. \"Yeah, plus, it would be little more exciting having a human in the family.\" The Gallade said. \"Yeah!

I know and I need you to listen to me.\" Mom said. \"Okay.\" You replied. \"I need you to go up stairs and hide.\" \"Why.\" You asked \"Please just do it.\" She urges.

Then you hear Mom saying sternly. \"I don't know what your talking about.\" Then a man says. \"You know something. Okay men let's take her and burn the house.\" They leave and you get out from under the bed. You run down and see flames. \"NO...\" You thought. You then run out the back and watch the flames engulfing your house. Then you saw the forest on fire as well. \"No... Not them too.\" You run in the forest and see Growlithe with Vulpix. You told them. \"We have to get out of here.\" Then Growlithe says. \"What about Eevee and Pigeotto.\" \"Pigeotto probably got out already but I'll search for Eevee.

Even the simplest of movements were lethargic and took what breath you had out of you. When you finally could open your eyes, the sight before seemed completely unreal. It was Reshiram, <i>the</i> Reshiram. Even more confusing was that, she (upon looking at her body) had similar characteristics of a human female. She was beautiful, and her deep blue eyes seemed to infinitely radiate a calmness that you feel could quell the rage of a rampaging Gyarados. Everything about you hurt, now that you were awake and your senses were coming back around. It was a throbbing ache, thankfully, but it still made movement nearly impossible. Seeing your eyes open was thankfully enough to get her to relax, if she was panicked or upset. \"Good, you are not dead, thank Arceus for that~.\" You were confused, what was she talking about? \"What,\" you began, \"Do you mean?\" Geez, even something as simple as talking hurt. Something in your mind was telling you that recovery was going to be a long and hard road. But, where did these injuries come from? Where was mom, and dad? Why could you only see this Reshiram? Well, perhaps that was because you were in a dark cave and her fur was white as snow, but there were bigger questions to be answered. \"Miss...\" You started, and she promptly stopped you, \"Please, just call me Reshy~.\" \"Okay, Reshy, where are my parents? And, why am I in so much pain?\" She stopped, her eyes seemed to widen a little, \"You don't remember?\" She hesitantly asked. \"Remember what?\" Came your response to her. Seeing this as something no young child should know, she shook her head, \"It's nothing my sweet child, you just hit your head a little while ago~.\" It seemed believable, all of the pain was coming from your head, so it made sense to you. Reshy nestled you a little closer into her supple bosom, rocking gently back and forth. Even if you were ten, there was still something about being held to someone's heart and gently rocked. Completely nestled in loving warmth, it took mere seconds for you to fall asleep in the dragon's arms. After you were soundly asleep, she sat there, contemplating, \"What now? He doesn't seem to remember what happened, he's completely without a family.\" It then dawned on her, <i>she</i> could be your family. She'd never done it before, but she couldn't just leave this young boy alone. She had things to do, so to keep you safe, she put you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Yeah, yeah, I skipped one of my own rules. But, how many of you enjoy this already? Hmm? You can add a male option somewhere, but I'm gonna keep this going, okay? Besides, I'm the author, it's my chapter~)</span></div></div>",

You couldn't tell the difference between her maw or her chest, both were equally warm and felt as luxurious. Not wasting any time, she tilted her head gently back and sent you down into her with a wet soft <i>glk!</i> Moving down her throat, the muscles on either side of your body gently massaged you as they pushed you deep, deep into her body. It felt wondrous, something beyond description, something special. This odd sensation caused you stir, but you fell back into sleep not long after, not enough the assess where you were. Finally, her throat opened up and pushed you into her stomach, which closed in around your form and cradled you in its warmth, keeping you safe.

You're devastated at the news, your face suddenly melts into a sadness someone your age should never experience. A soul chilling, gut wrenching, life destroying sadness that causes you to bury your head in Reshiram and cry your eyes out. It was horrible, you just lost your family, you couldn't believe any of it, this had to be a dream! Reshiram wipes the tears from her eyes and begins to attempt to comfort you. Thoughts raced as you cried more and more, where would you go, who would take care of you, where will you live, what will become of you as an existing being of this world?<br>\r\nReshiram looked out and thought of something, you two were really close, maybe she could take your parent's place. She looked down at you and popped the idea, \"Well, what if I fill in as your parents?\" In your sadness, the idea swirled around, congregated with a few others and you realize, she has a point. She has always acted very parent like when it came to you. The idea didn't sound so bad, and you looked up at her and the look in your eyes said more than enough. She smiled and continued to comfort you as you accepted your new fate, becoming the son of the Vast White Dragon, Reshiram.</span></div></div>",

I soon decide to start breast feeding her as she get done she starts to cry I pat her on the back as I have seen others do when she burps she sighs and falls asleep.

Will she go to school?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we continue talking we hear her start crying we run in and see her tossing and turning. As I pick her up sing to her and rock her slowly she starts to calm down. As she starts to giggle I start to play with her I walk into the front room with her in my arms as she looks into my eyes with her amber red eyes of hers that shine with a special something that I just can\u2019t describe. When it is time for dinner her stomach grumbles again as I breast feed her then burp her she slowly falls asleep as I go and lay her down on my bed near me so that we can bond I want her to bond with Latios too. So that we will get along better, we spend more time together in the front room we play with her as she has hit the age of 3 she has said mommy and daddy at which we just smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she hits 8 she has developed into quite the cute girl with b sized breasts and that she can now talk clearly as she heads off to school we say bye honey as she come home she says a trainer almost caught her.

It bounces off harmlessly as Latios decides enough is enough I go over to Stacy that everything will be ok she says \u201cI feel funny.\u201d  I say \u201cFunny how?\u201d She says \u201cL-L-like I like him. I don\u2019t understand mommy. What does it mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sigh and say \u201cStacy what you are felling is passion I don\u2019t know if it is love or something else but some trainers use Pok\u00e9mon for their own gain although others respect them as individuals.\u201d \u201cSo your saying I love him?\u201d \u201cYes and no honey. We aren\u2019t sure how he will treat you we will ask though.\u201d \u201cOk mommy be careful.\u201d \u201cI will honey.\u201d As I see Latios has the trainer tied up.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But I got a suprize.\" \"Really?\" \"Yep\" \"Show me please!\" \"Ok, Ok\" He smiles and throws a pokeball as you wait the red light dissapears you see Damon.

Lets go get something to eat huh?\" Amy and Damon say enthusiastically \"Yes Let's eat.\" As they all head down the stairs they see that nurse joy is making food for them she says \"Oh there you guy are you have been asleep for five hours that battle must have been tiring.\" Jaden say \"Yeah I guess it was more tiring than we thought, oh by the way can you check my pokemon my Latias, Celebi, Flareon, Oshawott, and my Bayleaf.</span></div></div>",

The pok\u00e9mon varied from pidgey to the occasional rattata, but there have been some other pok\u00e9mon like pikachu from deeper in the forest. You have seen only one when you were trying to find the pok\u00e9mon that were hiding from you, but you stared at it for a moment before it looked at you and it moved closer to you in curiosity. You were a little nervous as the pikachu came closer to you and it stopped when it was about a few inches from you trying to get a good look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI saw you playing with the other pok\u00e9mon in the forest.\u201d It said you heard a girl tone in its voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d You said smiling a little since the meeting with the pikachu<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing this far in the forest?\u201d she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlaying a game with the pok\u00e9mon.\u201d You said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t you get home to your parents?\u201d she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the sky and it was started to get a little late, but your parents told you that they hired a babysitter to watch you when it got late and she should be getting to the house soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to find the last one before I have to leave.\u201d You said whining a little and she giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, which one is it?\u201d she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, pidgey I think.\u201d You said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm well, I think I saw it flew into a tree.\u201d She said looking around trying to find the right tree<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, maybe I should just let them win this one.\u201d You said looking at the setting sun<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe that would be best.\u201d She said concerned for you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, you had to get back to the house before you were late and had her waiting for you. It was getting close to dusk and you were close to the back door where you usually use to get into the forest, but you heard a car pulling into the drive way. You knew it had to be her so you into the house and walked into the living room of the house to meet your baby sitter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you been waiting here to see me?\u201d a slightly older female voice said noticed you in the room as she came into the house<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, I was out in the forest playing with the pok\u00e9mon.\u201d You said being honest and she nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re Ryan.\u201d She said and nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Sira.\u201d She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour baby sitter is tall compared to you, but she is 6\u2019 tall, has a golden tan color on her body, has white hair in a style of a comet\u2019s tail; but it reaches the middle of her back, wearing a gray shirt with \u2018Original One\u2019 written in kanji, gray pants with gray socks and gold color shoes, a spiked gold choker around her neck, golden green eyes with red irises. She walked over to you and gently picked you up in her arms before giving you a warm hug. You noticed that she had a nice figure and it looked as big as you, but you weren\u2019t looking at her chest or behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought I heard you breathing hard like you were running to get here before me.\u201d She said before rubbing your head sweetly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both shared a hug before setting you on the couch and turned on the tv.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStay here and I\u2019ll go make us something to snack on before we do something fun.\u201d She said with a smile as she head into the kitchen<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~I hope he doesn\u2019t figure out that I\u2019m Arceus in disguise.~ she thought while she was looking at you watching tv<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out a letter for you from your parents in case something happened to them and with the letter is their will. She put it on the counter near where she was making your and her snack, but she was thinking of what is going to happen to them. She made some small sandwiches for you and made herself a few sandwiches. You were watching some funny cartoons that made you laugh when she came back with your and her snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you watching?\u201d she asked you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome cartoons.\u201d You said before biting into your first sandwich<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you watched cartoons while eating your snack and soon it was about time for your parents to get home. The phone started to ring and she got up to get it; you were looking at her talking on the phone with the tv slightly covering what is being said on the phone. It was about 5 minutes before she finished with the phone call and she came over to you before turning the tv off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was the hospital calling.\u201d She said to you sounding sad and serious<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d you asked wanting to know if something happened to your parents<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe doctor told me that your parents were caught in a wreck with another car.\u201d She said and you were sad and worried about them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre they going to be ok?\u201d you asked looking for hope<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter the impact, they were seriously hurt and needed medical attention; but they had only minutes before they were dead.\u201d She explained and you started to cry as she hold you in her arms<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the day that changed everything, but after enough time had passed you had your parents funeral. You were standing tall and proud for them as they wanted you to be, but you were holding sira\u2019s hand with an iron grip yet gentle. Sira became your legal guardian since you wanted to be with her, but you noticed something was wrong about her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The parents checked Beta for injures finding out that he had black tiped little yellow ears and black lightning tail. \" He looks like a human to me, and he looks like the baby in the photo on our mantle at home.\" said Pichu. \"Lets get him home and worry about why his lightning bolt cheecks are crackling with electricity.' said Raichu. As beta grew up he found out that he was capable of using thunder shock, but also he was from Pichu's granpa's side of the family.

If I see anything along the lines of that this new addition is being revoked IMMEDIATELY, so don't toy with me!<br>\r\n(As of 12/15/12)<br>\r\nTHANKS FOR ALL THE ADDITIONS! (even though there really weren't many) Sorry I haven't been adding lately, school is in the way and everything so I'm usually busy or I'm working on my personal fanfic stories. I really haven't been on my account since summer at least so I get on and see this is almost to 50 chapters! (wow, what a milestone. &gt;.&gt; &lt;.&lt; ) Anyways I just wanted to thank all users who've added to this and I hope you check out my other items!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRead these if u know what's good for you.<br>\r\nYour parents die in a crash, but only knocking you unconscious. When you wake up, you're being held in a Pokemon's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules are as follow;<br>\r\n1. You're very young, no older than ten years old. (Only exception is aging.)<br>\r\n2. I will allow the character's size to change, however, no smaller than 3cm tall(Main if u want), nor larger than 150ft(Pok\u00c3\u00a8mon).<br>\r\n3. I will allow anthros, just suggest before continuing.<br>\r\n4. There can be younger Pokemon with the parent who takes you in.<br>\r\n5.No M/M or F/F relations ok.<br>\r\n6. No cursing<br>\r\n7.There can be more than one parent of the same gender, just don't go over No.5 Ok?<br>\r\n8. No killing, extreme fetishes, etc. <br>\r\n9.If i see any chapters that have such bad grammar it makes no sense, i will completely revise it. You've been warned...<br>\r\n10.All Pok\u00c3\u00a8mon can talk and understand you.<br>\r\nThere they are folks, enjoy the story! =P</td>",
