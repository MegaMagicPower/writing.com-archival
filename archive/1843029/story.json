            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chun-Li took notice of the sign as she approached the farm. 'Fat Farm', it said. A rather off-putting name, but from what she heard it was one of the best spa resorts around. Cammy had signed up for it a couple weeks back, and hadn't returned. Neither had Rose, C. Viper, or even Juri, who surprisingly joined the spa in a peaceful manner. She had talked to Cammy on the phone since, but when asked if she was coming back, Cammy seemed to avoid answering, which got Chun worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFat Farm was on the outskirts of society, and Chun-Li had to take a bus out of the city for nearly an hour-stretch, until she reached a quaint, rural area. As she walked down the dirt road, what looked to be several big barns lay ahead. This didn't look like much of a spa, Chun-Li thought, more like a gimmicky petting zoo. But it seemed to be the right place, and the same location that Cammy told her, so she trekked on ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChun-Li entered what seemed to be the main entrance, and looked around to see a pretty big reception area. However, elements of a farm-stead surrounded the entrance, with some haystacks around and farm equipment. Chun-Li figured this was the 'setting' of the spa. She walked up to the front desk, where a portly, redheaded woman with glasses sat. The woman looked a bit unkempt, but Chun-Li tried not to be rude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, excuse me,\" she said. The lady looked up and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, hello there ma'am! Came to sign up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... not really. I actually came to check up on a friend who signed up here. Her name is Cammy White,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smiled, rotating to her computer and typing in the name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, Cammy... oh yes, Ms. White still has a few appointments left to finish today, so you might not see her for several more hours,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChun-Li sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh! What am I gonna do till then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, well, you know, the first day of our treatments is absolutely free,\" the lady said, \"In fact, since your friend technically recommended you here, your first whole week here is free!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, well, I...\" Chun-Li nervously chuckled. She wasn't exactly interested in joining this weird place...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just try the first day out,\" the lady said, \"Here, choose something from our activity pamphlet,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed a small pamphlet to Chun-Li, who gave it a look over. She had to admit, one activity caught her eye...</span></div></div>",

But somehow, being around other women who were five times her size made her feel normal in comparison. As she checked out the rest of the farm, she noticed a sign for the 'Junked Jacuzzi'. Having been a bit worn out by the travel, she felt like she needed a bit of a relaxation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe entered a stall and a small, bubbling gray pool was in front of her. She smelled a heavy aroma from it, unlike most other odorless jacuzzis she'd been in. Taking off her clothes, she slowly dipped in, relaxing within the murky, gray substance. Checking her pamphlet, she read that the jacuzzi was made up of liquids found in various dumpsters, which surprised her a bit, but she felt that she didn't have anything to worry about, as it felt very nice. She pushed her body deeper in and closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle to her knowledge, the liquids were soaping into her body. Slowly, but surely, she began to develop more flab. Her muscles began to turn into doughy slabs of flesh. Her big thunder thighs were now wide like flattened basketballs. Her gut protuded and her breasts puffed. A few extra chins developed around her neck. As she spent an hour in this jacuzzi she gained an extra 80 pounds on her body. As Chun-Li began to awaken, she got up to put her clothes up, surprised by how much tighter they felt and ignorant to her weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof, guess I need to do a little shopping later,\" she thought, none the wiser to her new figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scratched her butt as she looked around the farm. Looking at the time, Chun-Li figured that Cammy might've been done by now, though she was interested in what else was around...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jill woke up after her brief nap with her stomach growling. She wasn't terribly surprised by it; She didn't eat since she got on the plane. A small salad sounded really appetizing right now. She lifted herself off the bed, as she walked out and strolled down to the cafeteria lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the massive cafe, the first thing that caught her eye was that most of the women surrounding her were packing on the pounds quite heavily. And looked rather unhygienic too, to be frank. Not trying to be rude, Jill just ignored it as she grabbed a large tray and looked around at the food. She was rather disturbed by the food selection: Lots of meat, greasy products, candy, sweets, fattening food, carbonated soda, plus some slimy substances she couldn't recognize, but looked unhealthy to begin with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a single yogurt or anything?\" she thought. But she was quite starving anyways, and figured a little food wouldn't hurt. So she grabbed some bacon strips and was about to walk off when she felt someone tap at her shoulder. She turned around and it was an employee, a rather thick blonde lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, Mrs. Valentine? I hate to bring this up, but before you sit down to eat, you must keep in mind that there's a required minimum for the food you must eat for every meal,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry, didn't know!\" she replied, \"How much more do I need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... let me help a bit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman grabbed the tray and much to Jill's shock, starting piling on pounds of food onto the tray! A few heavy burgers, tons of bacon strips, sprinkled with some cupcakes and some other assorted sweets. She handed Jill the heavy tray, along with an XXL cup of cola. Jill was intimidated; She could barely eat all this in a week, let alone a day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We also have a rule against wasting food! So you'd better eat up, or else we'll put you to some kitchen labor! Enjoy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady walked off as Jill gulp. Even someone as strong willed as her didn't want to test that rule. She sat herself down and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, better get started!\" she thought, first biting into a big, greasy dripping burger. The first taste was absolutely heavenly to her. Somehow, all her worries went away as she dug into the rest of her meal. Time slowed down in her head, but she was continually gorging into the burger. As she finished it, she almost immediately moved onto another one. So good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her only about thirty minutes to get through the food. As she did, her body accepted the food and adapted. Her stomach put on a couple pounds, as some slight fat slabs rested against her pants, which popped open and shot out the button. Her ass began to stretch out and fill the chair. Her chin packed up, as crumbs and drippings fell onto her chest and clothing. By the time she somehow managed to finish all this food, she put on 50 extra pounds. She sighed as she laid back. Jill realized that she gained some weight, and in her mind was a bit upset with it. But at the moment, she just wanted to relax after such a stressful series of events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, wonder what else there is to do around here,\" she thought, getting up and not bothering to clean her stains off.</span></div></div>",

In there she found a floor covered completely in mud and no exercise equipment at all. \"Um, is this the right place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" said a red headed, freckled woman with pigtails, wearing overalls with a farmers tan. \"You're here to exercise right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.... yeah I suppose so,\" she said very suspicious of this room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then come on in, we believe that exercise is important to a happy customer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good,\" said Jill, still very confused. \"Where's the equipment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh your own body is all the equipment you need. Here, get down on your knees.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the mud?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" said the trainer with a smile. Jill, still completely confused, decided to go along and got down on all fours, her knees and hands getting soaked in the mud. \"Now, just start rolling around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the mud? Roll around... in the mud?\" she asked like she couldn't believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, all exercise shouldn't be too stressfull, it should be loose and free and relaxing. Rolling around in this mud will work out every part of your body, and it will get you over the last few hangups you probably have about what goes on at this spa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill didn't know exactly what she meant by that, but maybe she was a tad too stressed, maybe she should just shake it all off. She flopped down onto her now bulbous stomach, letting out an \"oooooohoohoo\" as the cold mud sent a chill across her stomach. She thought it was just like jumping into a pool, she had to get used to it. So she began rolling back and forth, wet mud sloshing back and forth, splatters going across her body, and she couldn't believe it but she actually did start to feel better.</span></div></div>",

She had brought one along, but oddly enough it didn't even come close to fitting anymore.

It was a pink bikini with a curly tail coming out the rump, just like a pig. It even came with a pair of pig-like ears on a headband to wear. She found it odd but after looking it over she realized it did look pretty darn cute on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter much squeezing and struggling, she eventually decided to stop trying to pull the wedgie out of her rump and just go outside in her new swimsuit. She found the pool and it was almost as filthy as the floor of the gym. \"Maybe I'll just hang out in the jacuzzi,\" she thought, until realizing that the jacuzzi had been filled with greasy chicken and was being used as a free style buffet for the pool attendants. </span></div></div>",

She then saw in the middle of the room a long buffet rack, and pulled the covers off to see that instead of being filled with multiple trays of different food, it was all one long tray that was filled with mash potatoes, bacon, chicken, gravy, corn, and everything else you could want, all mixed together. \"Oh, that's... rather interesting... well where are the plates?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around for a while until finally she had to go, \"Alright, if they're not giving me any, and it's all mine, then I'll just use my hands.\" She rolled up her short sleeves, and dug her hands in, grabbing handfuls of slop and started munching on a collection of bacon in mashed potatoes. It was delicious, and the moment she swallowed she just wanted more of it. She didn't care about who saw her, she was now confident that with no one there to see her she could just dig right in and not have to worry about it. \"What the heck, I was about to go bathe in mud after this, so why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started shoveling food so fast into her mouth that her cheeks were covered in it and it spilled down to the ground without her even bothering to contain it, she just wanted it in her mouth. She felt her vest starting to restrain her movement, so she had to whip it off. Her shirt began to rise up over her stomach as she developed a sturdy round belly. And finally, as if a bell to signal the meal was over, she heard several pops come from her backside, being caused by her jeans ripping apart, showing a full moon rump being covered by stretched out pink panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, now that was just what I needed,\" she said patting her stomach. \"Now I'm ready to go and relax in-\"</span></div></div>",

Just follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmelita did as show was told and followed her down the hall way. As she walked down the hall, the hotel grew more suspicious to her. There were dozens of pictures of either obese women in revealing clothes or pictures of farms with huge pig pens. Plus all the doors to each of the hotel rooms had no knobs. Each of them we're computerized to open just by voice command of who ever stays in the hotel. Though it was hard for her to focus on these details when ther was a foul odor in the air. Patty smelled bad, no doubt about that, but the halls smelled almost a thousand times worse that her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you think of the place so far?\" Patty asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm, so far it's...<i>interesting.</i>\" Carmelita said, pretending to be polite. She really thought the place was disgusting and smelly, but she decided to play nice to help with the investigation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think this is good wait till you see the buffet!\" Patty said, followed by a quick yet loud snort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the hallway was a huge door, with the words <b>\"Pig Out Buffet\"</b> on the door in golden letters, real GOLD. But like the other doors, there was no knob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do we get in if there's no handle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's easy. All you got to do is say the magic words. I'M HUNGRY!\" Patty shouted at the top of her lungs. The computer opened up and engulfed them both in a bright lights. Once the light cleared, Carmelita saw the biggest buffet in her life. In the center of the room was a huge mountain of junk food. There was so much food, Carmelita thought it could feed a whole country for a year. Then she noticed the other patrons of the hotel were surrounding the food and greedily gathering as much as they could fit in their mouths. All of them were women and each of them were either chubby or obese. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are ya waiting for miss? Dig in!\" Patty quickly ran to the table and like the other patrons, Devore anything she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmelita had to admit that despite how unhealthy the food was, it looked scrumptious. She was very tempted to try out this shmorgishborg. Yet it seemed suspicious to her, all the women here ate like they were in a trance and the hotel seems to encourage this behavior. There was something suspicious going on and she was concerned, though the it felt like the food was beckoning her to eat. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>'As if today couldn't get any worse,' Yennefer of Vengenberg sighed to herself as she unwittingly stepped in horse crap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was walking through a lower middle class neighborhood in Novagrad, a place a sorceress wouldn't be seen dead in normally. Not poor enough for a black market of useful materials, not rich enough for anyone who could afford her services. But it was the only place with a lead for where she could find a cure for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it began raining, a cold oily rain over the overcrowded city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Of course,' Yennefer groaned, pulling a somewhat ratty hood over her frizzy hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally Yennefer would have just teleported to her destination, but that wasn't possible for her now. Not after the second convergence of spheres had flooded the world with magic and crushed the raven haired beauties ability to gather power into herself. It had taken her too long to realize she was running on empty, long enough for her sorceress allies to seperate, long enough for her step daughter Ciri to go off to be an Empress, long enough for Geralt to go off vampire hunting hundreds of miles to the south. Long enough for her to be low on funds and alone in Novigrad, with just enough juice for one emergency short range teleport and nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot make up, as shown by her tired face with new bags under her eyes. Not her hair, as its immense frizziness instead of its normal smooth straightness showed. Not her clothes, as her somewhat torn and faded clothing testified. And certainly not her body as...well as a grumble in her stomach showed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe near powerless mage walked into a small eatery, smells of grease and cheap sugar hitting her nose. Yennefer licked her lips involuntarily, the cheap, easily produced food of the masses had become her standard fair as a way to stretch her emptying coin purse. And the consequences were accumulating rapidly, Yen reflected, as she tugged on the too tight belt she couldn't afford to replace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fat woman, rolls pouring out of her cheap dress, showed the almost destitute mage to a seat, leaving her with a grease stained menu. Yennefer sat, pants pinching incredibly tight against her lower tummy, as her purple eyes ran up and down the menu: doughnuts stuffed with cream and layered in sugar, stacks of bacon and eggs, piles of fatty sausages and fried poatoes, fried brad and meat patties...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'll...just have a small wine,' Yennefer said, picking up her purse, '...the cheapest one you have.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sure thing sweety,' the jolly but obese patroness smiled, waddling off towards the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYennefer nursed the wine, barley able to believe what she'd been reduced too. Once the finest salons would have clamored for a famous sorceress to be there, just the rumor of her beautiful form in a new silk dress would have been enough to draw crowds to watch her drink the finest wines and sup on light salads before she teleported back to the finest hotels or a manor gifted her just for her own use by a grateful town. Now she was in a dive diner, able to afford either a small meal or another night in the crappy boarding house with a leaky roof and a screaming neighbor with a pack of brats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mage's unpainted nails tugged at her belt debating on whether to let it out or not. She'd sold most of her dresses and all of her jewels for far less than their market price, what she had now was a pair of formerly loose pants that she'd had to shoe horn herself into for the past two days. Despite not eating since yesterday morning the pants were skin tight, so snug she couldn't get the top two of its three buttons done up thanks to her cheap, high salt and high fat diet.They pinched Yen's legs like a sausage was pinched by its casing, showing off softer thighs and thicker ankle in front and a swollen backside in the back. Yennefer had been known for her beautiful legs, legs that were going fully to seed now that she was powerless and poor. When she was out of her clothes, the fallen magician's ass had started drooping and had begun to sport a dimple or two of cellulite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the worst thing was, these clothes were about to go. The upper thighs had started to chafe where her thighs brushed and two inches of pale skin showed as her tummy made her shirt roll up. The sorceress wasn't fully sure how much she'd gained, but it had to be at least thirty pounds on her previously short, slight frame. Her breasts had filled out to a soft C cup, bouncy things that overfilled the bra Yennefer couldn't afford to replace. Even her face had changed with a little double chin forming under her jaw and her cheekbones slowly vanishing from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCombined with her thickening eyebrows, she couldn't magically pluck them anymore and an unhealthily pale complexion, Yennefer had gone from one of a kind stunner to just a pretty girl who didn't pay quite enough attention to her looks. Without her magic she felt like a complete nothing, fading into mediocrity or worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd worst of all, she was hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the waitress returned with her drink, Yennefer bit the bullet and ordered a double order of bacon, eggs, fried toast and syrup. She waited on the fat woman to bring it back with near drooling lips and dug into it with gusto, lips curling into a smile as she felt the only happiness she could anymore. Eating had become her outlet, her way of dealing with her fall from wealth, status, power and beauty into poverty, anonymity, weakness and mediocrity and she fell into it even as she fell further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You don't look like a sorceress,' a sneering voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYennefer looked across the table, seeing an arrogant half elf woman looking down her nose at the chunky woman gorging on greasy breakfast foods. Her hair shone, her skin was flawless and her figure was shown off by a eye catchingly beautiful dress. She walked with her shoulders and head up, without any of the stoop of fear a powerless Yennefer had come to know and project. In her hands was the most expensive glass of wine in the building, far away from the swill Yennefer had had to down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm...on the outs at the moment,' Yennefer said with some bitterness, 'do you have what I asked for?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It can be gained... for a price,' the half elf smiled, 'a way to return magical power to one who's lost it? It can be done, although I'm not sure if you an afford the cost.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYennefer thought of her nearly empty coin purse, 'I'll pay anything. I have funds in other cities I can't access yet, but once I can teleport I can...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, payment up front,' the half elf smiled, 'one thousand novigrad crowns.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYennefer swallowed. Once it would have been the work of a moment, gained from curing an heiress' acne or a countess' accidental pregnancy with a snap of her fingers. Now? Now it was a thousand times all her money in the world and she had no way to earn it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'll...find a way to pay you,' Yennefer said, 'is there a place where I can reach you when I have it?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh I'm sure you will, I have rooms at the chateau d'mormor, the duchess suit,' the half elf sneered, 'when you have it, call for Lidia.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe half elf stood up, poured the untouched wine on the ground and teleported away, wasting thrice the magical power Yennefer had. With a whistle the overweight inn keep waddled over, bill in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wow, a sorceress, here!' the waitress said, 'who'd have thought!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'yeah, who would guess,' Yennefer sighed, taking the bill and seeing it thrice as high as what she'd ordered, 'um...I didn't order that wine...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, she'd promised you would take care of it,' the obese woman said, in tone that said Yennefer absolutely would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I...I can't afford that,' the crestfallen brunette let out a sob, 'I only had enough coin for my own food...and she...she didn't I thought she was...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYennefer put her head in her hands and sobbed, utterly undignified. The waitress let out a kindly sigh and sat down on the bench, which groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, I understand girl,' the woman sighed, 'so, here's your two options. I've got a couple friends who can help girls like you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Like me?' Yennefer asked, thinking of depowered sorceresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, girls who've been kicked out on the street,' the waitress said, 'its not the best work, not the best paying but its not that bad. Nothing will be hurt but maybe your dignity.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What, what is it?' Yen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well...one place is a spa catering to noble women who've gotten fat,' the obese waitress told her, 'you might clean up presentably and you'll just be folding towels. It doesn't pay very well though, I overheard that lady say a thousand crowns and well...you might make that in a hundred years unless you're willing to steal some jewelry.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYennefer thought of growing old, ugly and poor in this place or risking being put in jail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And the other?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well it pays a lot more and for a girl with your ...particular looks there'd be extra tips,' the waitress said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Tips?' Yennefer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, you see...its a strip club for rich men who like...bigger girls,' the waitress said, 'you'd start off serving drinks but for workers there's discounted food...but just to warn you. I bought this place with money I earned there and i was your size when I started.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYennefer thought to herself, trying to figure out if her losing her dignity and weight was worse than wallowing in poverty...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She'd helped save the world and now she had the options of holding towels for the obese rich or showing off her chunky body for perverts? But between the two insulting offers, she'd had to pick the former.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYennefer was a sorceress, and by consequence a great beauty. Using her look to advertise and manipulate was part of her training and personality, her low bust lines and tight dresses were as much of that as her smooth skin and jet hair. Even if she'd let herself go to seed surviving on cheap food for several months, she'd rather be lusted after than be a servant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this was after spending three hours washing dishes at the diner. Utterly miserable, with her dishpan hands shoved into her pockets, her spellbooks on her back and her hood drawn up over her head against the rain, she sat out. It was slow going for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYennefer had never been athletic. Slender and elegant, yes. Slim and lovely, of course. But her svelte legs hadn't had much muscle even at their thinnest and her flat belly had only been girlishly firm, never hard. Months of a bad diet of grease , fat and sugar and spending as much time possible indoors craning her neck over now useless spell books in hopes of a cure had destroyed her wind while plumping her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was four full miles to the strip club, located out past the city walls, and it took the sorceress a full two hours to get there. Yennefer's boots, her sole good mundane possession, were pinching her chunky ankles on the walk and were soon soaked through. She was cold and miserable and soon winded, her squeezing tight pants no help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen at last she arrived at the club in the early afternoon, insultingly titled the Spinning Chubette, she was almost at her end. Unused muscles quivered and spasmed in her legs and Yenn's breathe came in pants as she walked into the yard full of coaches and horses. Several drunk noblemen stumbled by, drunkenly boasting:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That red head had to be six hundred pounds!' one slurred, 'I kept shoving coins in her fat rolls and...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fell over into the mud and his nearly equally drunk friends pulled him up. The sorceress watched in fear, knowing she was defenseless and saw the dull glint of a coin purse in the rain. Looking around to see if anyone would notice, she soon had it in hand and shoved twenty precious coins into her pocket, leaving the purse under a wagon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'980 to go,' Yennefer said, ashamed of having been reduced to thievery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe avoided the busy main entrance, which opened to emit new customers and revealed loud music and instead headed to the back, hoping to find an employee entrance. For once Yen was lucky, a nearly plump blonde girl lounged next to an open door, clearly on break. She was much taller than the petite mage and proportionally as chunky, hints of a muscular frame still apparent in her arms  but with a pot belly on display and a soft pair of sturdy legs wrapped in thigh high boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Looking for work?' she asked somewhat kindly as she looked Yennefer up and down, eyes pausing on the mage's wide hips, soft thighs and plump waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, yes I am,' Yennefer admitted, biting down on her pride, 'I've never done this before but...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But you're desperate? So's everyone, but you're lucky you've got looks,' the blonde said, 'name's Big Cat.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Y...Jenny,' Yennefer lied, not giving her given name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd been famous as a mage, but she wasn't one now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well Jenny, you're lucky. I'm in charge of the drink pit crew and I just had a girl graduate up to the polls,' Cat told her, 'follow me, I'll see if the boss will take  you on and then we'll get you prepped.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYennefer was led through a back locker room of women ranging from over plump to fat to fully obese to barely mobile, applying make up and squeezing acres of curves into skimpy clothes. A minor sense of revulsion went through her, soon she'd be just as fat as any of them but if it got her her powers back....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Room, board, uniform, costumes and medical expenses are included as part of  your pay, you will have shifts in the kitcens, cleaning and taking care of the big earners during the day,' Cat explained, 'there's a physical at the start and mandated dancing classes.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I know how to dance,' Yennefer objected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You knew how to dance as a skinny girl,' Cat observed, 'and clearly haven't for a while going by those thighs. You're here to get fat and dance, we've got to build up some strength on you while we pad you out. Meals are at 6, 9, noon, 3, 6 and 9. You won't miss any of them, understood?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYennefer's paunch chose that moment to gurgle, just as a four hundred pound ox of a woman lumbered past, thighs slapping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah...I won't,' the powerless mage agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat led her into a richly appointed office, ancient nude statues in the corners. There a red haired elvish woman lay on a couch, long and lean in a near transparent dress that showed off every inch of her thin figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Madame, I've got a new girl, Jenny' Cat said somewhat timidly, 'for you too look over.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf stretched like a slim cat and looked Yennefer up and down with lazy green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Let's see, a very pretty face although I can see its one that needs to be very thin for its best features to come out, hmmm...ever been fat before girl?,' the Madame asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, I've always been thin,' Yennefer said, conscious of how the gorgeous elf's eyes were looking at her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hmm, I'll need to check you then, strip,' the Madame ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Strip?' Yennefer asked, wishing she could incinerate her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Strip or leave, I won't ask again,' madame commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYennefer bit her tongue and slowly began sliding her clothes off. Madame got up off her couch, eyes running up plump legs and chubby hips, glance resting on a soft fupa and the little layers of fat over Yennefer's ribs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You must have been a real beauty before you were made poor. I'm seeing stretchmarks that are still recent,' the elf observed, 'and your cellulite is just starting to come in. Too much bad food though, its ruining your complexion. We won't have that here, my girls eat healthily to perserve themselves. Hmmm, were you rich?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYennefer didn't lie, fully, 'I was...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Play your cards right and you can be again,' the elf said, 'looking you over you're going to be...'</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Usually, the workaholic sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg woke up well before dawn. She\u2019d be researching with a scowl on her face long before she broke her fast as she thought about all the work to do that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday Yennefer awoke in the beautiful vinyard villa of Corvo Blanco like she did every morning, to the chirp of birds and the smell of cinnamon rolls. A smile was on her face before she was even awake, stretching out beneath her satin bed sheets, as she looked forwards to the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Yennefer was up and at them, choking down some tea and a few pieces of dry toast as she worked at least an hour before bathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis morning, her purple eyes blinking softly, the raven haired wizard sat up and licked her lips, seeing a plate of curled cinnamon rolls drowned in icing, steaming on her bed side table. A minor spell flared from her finger tips to animate the knife and fork and soon the pastry was flowing into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally Yennefer only wore white and black to compliment and contrast her ivory skin and Raven hair. She\u2019d return any other garment given to her with a sneer. When she slept, she\u2019d wear black lace lingerie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday as she finished her plate of pastries, a snug pair of pink pajama shorts grew snugger around her middle. She tugged on it without thinking, loosening the waistband to make room for her latest binge meal. That she did this was unknown to her, the dark haired beauty had accepted it as second nature over the past year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh Gods, these rolls get better every day,' the enchanter cooed as she finished, putting her hand on her stomach, 'but I do wish the cook would make more of them. I\u2019m finishing them faster and faster.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing her belly against her gorge, the Mage considered going back to bed for another hour or two. But Geralt had suggested they go riding, had been insisting it for a while, and she didn\u2019t want to disappoint him. And she\u2019d need to get ready first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old Yennefer wouldn\u2019t have set foot outside her bed chamber without spending half an hour magically brushing her hair until it shown and putting on expensive glamour make up that made her normally just devastatingly pretty face near inhumanly beautiful. Nor would she go out not wearing a dress worth a small house, of silk, fur or embroidery. Today she simply brushed the hair back past her shoulders, rubbed sleep from her eyes, cleaned her teeth and tied a soft bathrobe around her body. She ignored that the robe\u2019s edges didn\u2019t quite meet and that its belt was almost out of fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSashaying down the stairs and through the halls in her slippers, Yennefer greeted and made small talk with every one of her servants. She\u2019d learned almost all about them in the past several months and asked how they were as she sipped from a pint size coffee cup heavy with cream and sugar. She thanked the cook and asked for bigger portions while munching on a fresh roll, told the groom to get her horse ready and was just slightly annoyed at the washer girls for yet again shrinking her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Yennefer wouldn\u2019t have even bothered to learn their names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer walk to the bath house was the longest one she\u2019d do all day and the budding heat of the Beauclair summer was beginning to make Yennefer sweat. She considered just teleporting next time to the spring, but couldn\u2019t remember the last time she had used that spell. Besides, it would stop her talking to the vineyard\u2019s servants, which she enjoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, what a beautiful day,' the mage said to herself as she walked through the herb garden, sashaying and humming without realizing it, \u2018this could go on forever.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSun struck Yen\u2019s face and she realized she\u2019d forgotten her hat, just like she had many weeks. The young looking face, with its slightly recessed chin, high cheek bones, large violet eyes and pretty, crooked smile wasn\u2019t quite so porcelain pale anymore. A slight tan and even some freckles were the result of Beauclair\u2019s southern climate on the woman who\u2019d abstained from almost any sunlight to keep her skin pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathhouse itself was a little engineering marvel she\u2019d designed upon her first arrival at Geralt\u2019s villa. A classical building with columns built over a natural spring, it was divided into a cold pool and a warm pool powered by magical batteries, with a waterfall shower at the lip. A mosaic of water Nymphs was at the bottom of the pool, cunningly painted to resemble Yennefer herself: short, slender and shapely, free of any lazy fat. It had been the last clever device the Mage had designed, sticking since then to doodles and love poems. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Cold might wake me up, but I think today I\u2019ll use the warm,\u2019 Yennefer decided, ignoring how once she always took cold baths too awaken herself, \u2018just for a moment\u2026\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasting her robe over a chair, Yennefer snapped her fingers to dematerialize her pajamas. A red ring was left on her waist from where it had pinched. Not caring who might stumble in on her naked, the sorceress jumped into the warm water with a splash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, Yennefer lay near asleep in the shallow end. Her long black hair was an ink spill behind her and a sleepy smile was on her lips. Her fingers were idly tickling her belly, easing the digestion of her breakfast stuffed waist. She knew she needed to get up and wash her hair and soap off, but the water was just so relaxing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Little late for bathtime isn't it?' a gruff voice chuckled from the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dozing sorceress turned, smiling as she saw Geralt of Rivia. A tall, fit man wearing armor stained with some monster's blood, with cat like yellow eyes and white hair, handsome even with scars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Its morning is it not?' the sorceress asked, 'and where were you, you said we were going riding this morning and left me in bed.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Its almost noon Yen, I tried getting you up at 5 am and 6 am and you kept teleporting me away,' Geralt smiled, beginning to unbuckle his armor, 'at least it wasn't that far this time.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well...I need my beauty rest,' the sorceress smiled, showing her perfect teeth and a new set of dimples, 'its working don't you think? I feel pretty as a wood nymph.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wood nymph version of herself was visible through the flowing water: a rail thin fae with girlish hips, a wasp thin waist, easily visible ribs, long slim legs and high breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Nah, you look better,\u2019 the witcher smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeralt\u2019s thoughts, once frequently skimmed by Yen, were carefully avoiding terms like: plump, fat, chubby, bulging, rolly Polly, round, dumpy or soft. He\u2019d been doing so ever since Yennefer had begun her slide into pampered laziness months ago and was now fully unnecessary. The Mage never cast that spell anymore, once reflexive it had fallen from her repertoire alongside fireballs and anything that didn\u2019t involve eating, turning a page or very minor healing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Then come show me, witcher,\u2019 Yenn smiled, violet eyes flashing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was surprised that this had gone on so long and so well. Neither of the two of them were used to monogony and both had sharp tempers and wanderlust, but Geralt was feeling satisfied hunting monsters in the Duchy and Yennefer somehow was perfectly happy being a lazy farm wife. They hadn\u2019t argued, they hadn\u2019t fought...and Yennefer had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was pleasant instead of sarcastic. Warm instead of icy. Kind instead of mean. Understanding instead of demanding. Relaxed instead of neurotic. Caring instead of combative. The harsh exterior that had grown protectively around her caring personality had fallen away. But there\u2019d been a cost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYennefer\u2019s work ethic and self motivation were gone, replaced with a lazy indolence once foreign to her. She slept twelve hours a day now, read nothing besides cheap romances, did no work at all and physically had let herself go. Once always prim, the short sorceress hadn\u2019t worn make up in months and her hair hadn\u2019t been styled or cut in the same time. It wasn\u2019t that the sorceress needed either, she was a stunner in her natural state but\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeralt splashed into the pool and picked up his lover, pausing as her belly bumped into his muscled waist. There shouldn\u2019t have been even a bump on Yen\u2019s middle, but now her belly had entered into territory best described as \u2018pot belly\u2019. He picked her up, marveling at her weight, his fingers sinking into the heavy, toneless fat of what had been a pert derri\u00e8re and felt her soft, thick thighs wrap around him. That paunch pressed closer into him, as did the pillowy bulges of her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018How about I just ride this instead?\u2019 The Mage laughed, beginning to writhe up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother half an hour passed and the two cuddled. Yennefer was nearly asleep, her plump, chubby form pressed tight to him. He looked down to her protruding waist, a full on beer belly anymore. Most of her clothes wouldn\u2019t have hoped to fit onto her anymore, she\u2019d gone from lithe to lazy, svelte to soft, trim to tubby. She was still gorgeous, he\u2019d found no change in his attraction to her, but how would Yennefer feel when ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeralt wondered how long this would go on. His enhanced senses had noticed when she\u2019d begun gaining week by week, fine features swallowed by softness, dresses beginning to whisker, bulge out and then be let out by Yennefer\u2019s chamber maid and then quietly retired before the sorceress noticed. The whole time Geralt had been sure she\u2019d notice any day, but she hadn\u2019t as her ribs had disappeared, as her belly had begun to puff out, as her breasts began to droop, as her thighs began to rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to have gained forty pounds in her first year of retirement, in this happy dream life. How big would she be when she woke up?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two years later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had taken Empress Cirilla, or Ciri as she preferred to be called, two years to get the Nilfgard Empire on a stable footing where if she looked away the black clad nobility wouldn't try to stab her in the back and go on a conquering spree. No one had liked her father and her ending the war peacefully and allowing most of the north to be independent protectorates hadn't been that popular, but the Child of the Elder blood was tough, smart, cunning and pretty. All good traits for a politician who was trying to turn a quasi-fascist empire into stable state run for the benefit for all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, even if her sorceress powers kept her aging slowly it would take all of Ciri's life time to change the Empire to how she wanted. But there was progress: most of the armies were demobilized, new schools were teaching the orphans, the lodge of sorceresses was now an official institute skimming the population for girls with the power and no one had tried to kill her in nearly a month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time for a little vacation, just an afternoon off to go talk to family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her palatial chambers, fitting for a palace, the Empress dismissed her army of attendants, ladies in waiting and body guards at last and shed her red velvet gown. Hanging up her crown up on a stand, the ashen haired teleporter looked her nearly naked self in the floor length mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I need to get back in shape,' Ciri smiled at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lady of World's was freshly twenty two and by any standard quite a looker. Her hair was an ashen blonde, almost white currently up in an elaborate braid, she tugged out the braids and let it fall, putting the long locks into a pony tail. She wiped away her makeup, exposing a smooth, slightly freckled face with big yellow green eyes and a scar down the side of one soft, slim cheek. At 5'8 she was slightly on the tall side for a woman and at 145 lbs nicely curvaceous while still being quite slim, with long slender legs, a heart shaped bottom, a low tapered waist and full breasts, between a C and D.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sitting on that throne is making me soft,' the ashen haired woman sighed, pinching the extra little inch on her stomach, 'I haven't been able to spare time for sparring in months.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demands of Empire (meetings and hearings and court cases and briefings and wooing provincial warlords and going to balls and keeping suitors at arms end and arguing with her counselors and practicing her magical powers) meant that Ciri barely had time to sleep, let alone exercise. Combined with the rich court food, it was no surprised she'd gained ten pounds over the last two years with such a sedentary life style. Once Ciri had trained every day at the Witcher's brutal conditioning regimen, honing her muscles, reflexes and sword. She'd had a hard four pack and the muscles on her arms and legs had possessed a lithe, agile strength. Combined with her teleporting abilities and source powers, Ciri had been one of the most dangerous combatants alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And all those hand crafted deserts,' Ciri groaned, sucking in her stomach as far as it went and then sticking it out as far as it would go, 'I really can't let this slip.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no world was the Empress fat, but she wasn't the athletic paragon she'd been when she'd defeated the Wild Hunt and the White Frost. Her belly was mostly flat, her hips smooth, her breasts firm and her limbs didn't jiggle. But she didn't have abs anymore, her arm muscles didn't show and her thigh gap was 2/3rds of the way closed. She hadn't really noticed it to her shock: as Empress she received new dresses constantly and the tailors didn't tell her her measurements had changed a little. None of her bathing attendants would mention the gradual loss of tone, despite how gentle the Ciri was with them. She hadn't had any time to pursue any sort of actual relationship either and the suitors she kept at arms length did nothing but sing praises, not point out how her waist wasn't so hour glass anymore. She was rarely even naked alone, surrounded by attendants changing her gowns and doing her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'At least I noticed this before it got too bad,' Ciri told herself, digging out her witcher clothes from the back of her closet and taking out her sword, 'if I hadn't decided to do this I could have wound up really plump before I figured it out.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer leather pants were a little snug in the thigh, her sword belt was out a notch, the leather corset armor pinched a little more than it once had and her larger bust puffed out through the gap in her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'New imperial edict: the Empress spars an hour a day and runs three miles,' she said, patting her waist, leaving a note that she'd be back by morning and stepping through space and time, appearing in the court yard of Corvo Bianco, 'and anyone who offers a sweet is executed.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiri's teleporting wasn't flashy, none of the villa's staff noticed her. She walked towards the main house, happy to not be escorted for once and ignoring the little pinch her pants gave her thighs. Drawing herself up she knocked at the door to see her adoptive parents for the first time in two years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was baffling, but she couldn't help but wonder what they'd think of her little weight gain. Of course it wouldn't change how they felt about her, but given Geralt's amazing senses and Yennefer's perfectionism they'd likely notice. The witcher might make a small joke and offer to spar with her, but anticipating Yennefer's reaction made her worry. Ciri had met many sorceresses and great beauties, but Yennefer took the cake. Both flawlessly slender and impossibly curvaceous, with a sharp ageless face, she'd been an intimidating figure. Her praise had been hard to come by and worth more than diamonds to Ciri, who'd been fascinated by this imperious beauty who demanded excellence from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the door opened she smiled, but saw only a butler, the man Geralt's letters had called BB.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes?' he asked, taking in the sword on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, I am Emp...I'm Ciri,' she smiled, 'is the Master of the House in?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ah,' the butler said, bowing stiffly and formally, 'I take it you would not like the full Imperial treatment? Master Rivia said you would come one day and not prefer it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, not this time, its an unofficial family visit,' Ciri smiled, 'so...have you seen my parents?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Unfortunately Master Geralt has taken a contract hunting wyverns in the mountains,' the formal butler said, 'but Mistress Vengerburg is in the kitchen. Shall I fetch her?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYennefer in the kitchen? How truly bizarre, Ciri had seen the sorceress eat of course but she'd been fastidious, picking at salads and eating vegetables to watch her figure. Her only vice, other than sex, had been competition with her fellow sorceresses for magical power andpolitical status. That she'd never arrived at court or one of the magical academies Ciri had founded actually surprised her, she wouldn't expect Yennefer to last more than three days her trying to relax before she got so frustrated over her inactivity she began ripping out her black locks. That she'd lasted more than two years in this buccolic retreat was a miracle large enough to found a religion over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, just show me the way, I'd like to surprise her,' the witcher girl suggested, following the butler into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main house was excellent, although small by the standards of the palace Ciri lived in. She heard singing from the kitchen as well as the clatter and hum of cooking, what really surprised her was that it was Yennefer's voice. The sorceress thought singing was a waste of time. BB stopped her at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You should prepare yourself, but it has been a long time since you have seen Mistress Vengerburg, correct?' he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, but she shouldn't age or get sick, she's a mage after all,' Ciri told him, 'she should be the same.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, I had forgotten Yennefer was a sorceress, its been so long since she has cast a spell,' BB admitted, 'in any event, she is...not as you knew her. It is best if you don't draw attention to it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slid open the door and ushered Ciri through, who took a step in. An immense pastry chef hummed as she stirred a bowl of icing with her back to the Empress, possibly the fattest woman Ciri had ever seen. Her arms were thicker than Ciri's arms, looking like pastry bags stuffed far too full of vanilla frosting, so thick her knuckles had dimples and her meaty under arm wings flopped with each moment. She was wearing a sundress with a back that was exposed to her hips, an unfortunate choice for a woman with a back full of fat crevices deep enough for Ciri to lose a hand in. Her slumped shoulders had a saggy set of back boobs larger than the Empress' not small breasts. Her ass was a thing that had to be seen to understood, a sixty one inch monstrosity that had to be seen to be understood, a drooping mass of cellulite wide as the very short cook was tall. It had collapsed onto itself, a wobbling apron of ass fat that's cellulite could clearly be seen through her far too tight skirt. Cankles bigger than Ciri's thighs were visible as the short skirt led down to flat, sensible shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Have you seen Yennefer?' Ciri asked, making the woman turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitanic, completely unsupported tits wobbled and heaved, twin seas of slightly tanned lard bobbing and jiggling in a hypnotic tide that pressed tea cup nipples into the thin fabric of her green flesh. The bowl of frosting rested atop a foot blocking doubled belly so big the smile of its folds was clearly visible, on her sides her butter-slab love handles hung over a plain belt big enough for Ciri to jump rope with. Her face was fat as a pumpkin, swollen cheeks impossibly round, while her jowls flopped and wobbled as she hummed.  Short black hair framed her face in an unflattering, matronly way. As she saw the visiting monarch, purple eyes lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'CIRI!' Yennefer, three times her old size yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Y-Y...mom...you're so...,' Ciri mouthed as she fainted in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ciri woke up to a dark room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found herself on a comfortable bed, naked underneath the sheets. A cold cloth was over her forehead, she smelled fresh cupcakes and heard the sound of a needle going through thread. The Empress' memories were a garble of her adventures, out of order and confusing beyond belief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting, she sat up with a lurch and took off the cloth to see shadows. A short figure was to her right, hands busily stitching a skirt and humming softly. Ciri almost panicked and teleported out but then she smelled lilac and gooseberries, her adopted mother's perfume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yen...Mom?' she said in the shadows, 'Mom is that you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ciri!' Yennefer said with joy and concern, leaning forwards in the 3/4th darkness to put a hand on her daughter's forehead, 'Oh don't sit up, you hurt your head when you fell. I had to cast a spell over you to make sure you healed, it might have left you a little confused...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I...yes that would make sense,' Ciri sighed, laying back and wondering when Yennefer's slim fingers had gotten so soft, 'I had the strangest dream...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Really?' Yen chuckled, 'what happened?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I...I was an Empress...,' Ciri began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ciri, you are an Empress,' her sorceress adoptive mother laughed softly and there was a soft grunt and a pop of joints as she stood up, 'you must have hit your head harder than I thought.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, that's good I guess...but in the dream you were...,' Ciri blinked as Yenn leaned over her to kiss her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething very heavy and warm fell over Ciri's chest and face, a smothering blubber blanket with mammary pillows so heavy it drove the breath from her lungs. Yen let out a fat girl grunt and kissed her daughter's forehead, drowning her in boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I was what dear?' the sorceress asked, brows furrowing in effort as she turned on a magical light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spell, one taught to prospective sorceresses in their very first class, was difficult enough for the master mage to be left panting and slightly sweaty after she was done. Heaving, Yen put her hand on her usually pained back for support, the mere effort of leaning over and standing up too exhausting for her morbidly out of shape body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'you'd...put on a lot of weight,' Ciri asked the shadowy woman who was almost as wide as she was tall, 'and gotten fat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How...how...silly,' Yen wheezed as she collapsed back onto her chair, 'I mean...I put on a couple pounds but I'd never get fat...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sturdy wooden chair let out an ominous groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I mean...I've put on a little bit once I retired and stopped using those wasteful, vain weight loss charms...,' Yennefer panted, 'but its ten pounds at most...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Uhh yeah...,' Ciri asked in shock, seeing Yennefer, the woman she looked up to more than anyone in the whole world, the strict sorceress who'd educated, trained and raised her as a blob of butter flowing out of a cheap dress, three times and more her old size and winded from standing up and casting a simple cantrip, 'are you alright?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just fine, a little stressed but that's what the muffins are for,' Yennefer sighed, pulling a muffin from the depths of her cleavageand shoving it into her mouth, devouring it in one bite and gnawing it to pieces, crumbs falling back into her impossible tatas, 'You gave me quite a shock.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I did?' Ciri asked, seeing the raven haired mage's four chins wobble and flap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh yes. It used to be when I was worried that I'd have to do research or pace or make love, but now I just eat a muffin or a cupcake or a doughnut. And seeing you look so...,' Yennefer explained and Ciri winced bracing for a lecture on her untoned thighs or little starter belly from this near fifth of a ton woman until Yennefer finished, '...you look so thin...I made extra muffins for you after I had you stabilized.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'For me?' Ciri said, looking at the small mountain of muffins on the bed side table, her breakfast for an entire week or more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Of course dear, you've gone all gaunt! You must be working far too hard being Empress, you need to relax more,' Yennefer smiled, deep dimples appearing, 'or eat better! How about I come back to your palace with you and cook for you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiri blanched. Once she'd have loved to have Yennefer, a hard nosed and cunning political operative as any, in her corner but now? Yennefer was more than twice size of any woman at court, jaws would drop that this used to be a sorceress...hell, several of Ciri's advisors were sorceresses. If Phillipa or Triss or Margaritta saw what had happened to their colleague they'd double over with laughter. Given how delicate Yennefer's clogged constitution looked, so out of shape she'd nearly fainted from standing up, what would that do to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Umm....I wouldn't want to trouble you,' Ciri played off, 'say, how about we go on a walk together?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, a walk, but its almost night time!,' Yennefer laughed, 'won't that be dangerous?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'll carry a lantern or put out a magical light,' Ciri said, intent on getting this gelatinous tub that used to be her slim adoptive mother moving before her heart seized up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, I suppose if you want,' Yennefer shrugged, a tectonic movement that set off an earthquake in the canyon of her cleavage, 'I'll need to find my walking shoes though. But you should eat first.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I...really I'm full,' Ciri tried to deny, looking at the calorie bombs ready to blast away what was left of her waistline and replace it with a paunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the obscenely obese Yennefer was an alarming shock to the slightly padded Empress and one that made her feel even worse about her own slight puffiness. It had to have started the same for Yennefer, slowly filling out into barely mobile lardiness. She couldn't let herself turn into that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, then I guess I'll polish them off,' Yennefer sighed, reaching for the plate and hampered by how her acres of lovehandles and farmsteads of hips couldn't bend past the armrests of the chair they poured through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYenn had always been a short woman, something Ciri had never realized because the brunette's forwards personality, self confidence and energy. But now that she was fat, meek and barely mobile, Yen seemed stubby and pathetic. Her chubby fingers lunged towards the muffin, rocking side to side and still feet from reaching the mountain of transfat, sugar and grease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Come on...come on...,' the mage grunted, sweat beading off her forehead at the effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould Ciri let her mother eat that? She looked one sniff away from a heart attack...</span></div></div>",

As soon as she entered, she saw women of varying weights in line getting food or sitting down and gorging themselves on the food they decided to put on their plate. Cristina could smell the food, and it was making her mouth water. She decided to grab a plate and get in line.<br>\r\n  Upon entering the line she saw some of the hundreds of thousands of very appetizing foods she could choose from. Juicy hamburgers, whole pizzas loaded with olives, pepperoni, and cheese stuffed crust, Mongolian chicken, cheese fries coated in ranch dressing and bacon, and that was just what she could see! As soon as she laid her eyes upon the food she decided to get as much as she could fit on her plate, but made sure she didn't get foods that could be too fattening. After all, she did have a figure to maintain.<br>\r\n  Upon choosing where to sit, she realized that there were no utensils. When she asked one of the women sitting near her, the woman responded that utensils were considered a waste of time and that Cristina should just dig in. Cristina found this odd, but decided to focus on eating for now. On her plate were two slices of pizza, a hamburger, and a handful of cheese fries.<br>\r\n  When Cristina bit into the burger, she was expecting it to taste like an ordinary burger, but she was wrong. The burger tasted heavenly. Suddenly Cristina forgot everything else and just focused on her food, which she ate ravenously. Within two minutes the voice actress had finished her food.<br>\r\n  \"BRAAAP! Whoa! Excuse me!\" Cristina excused herself as she laid back upon finishing her food. She then tried to get up and stretch, but the chair stuck to her for a few seconds before falling to the ground.<br>\r\n  \"Huh. I don't recall the chairs being so small\" Cristina said, failing to realize she had gained several pounds, with her once flat stomach had become a slight potbelly. <b>What Cristina <i>did</i> realize was that there was still food at the buffet, but was she still hungry?</b></span></div></div>",

Her mouth began watering at the sight of such mouthwatering foods as her stomach made its desires known by growling even louder.<br>\r\nDeciding to get back in line, this time Cristina picked out some more foods that caught her eye and began filling her plate with the best looking foods in the buffet. Sitting down, she overlooked the contents of her plate and licked her lips in anticipation before ravenously consuming it all. Within several minutes, two enchiladas (one chicken and one cheese), several pieces of Mongolian chicken, a chicken sandwich, and the five handfuls of cheese fries that had filled her plate were gone, the only signs of their existence being the stains of sauce on Cristina's face and fingers. The voice actress became aware of this and wiped the stains off with her hands. Deciding she wouldn't let any food go to waste, she began licking the stains off of her hands.<br>\r\nOnce she was finished, she sat back and let out a loud belch like last time. While normally Cristina would have excused herself, she had become so distracted by the food that the only thing on her mind was what she would have next to eat.

At first, she was stumped for ideas, but then she was informed of this strangely named spa resort. Though initially skeptically, the Canadian-American actress eventually heeded the praise that many of its clientele heaped on it online, and gave it a shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, the blonde left her car, having driven away from the city for a solid hour a reach her destination, and got a first hand look at her vacation spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'The Fat Farm'?\" Veteran Voice Actress Tara Strong asked to herself, reading aloud the sign that bared the moniker of this establishment in big silver letters. As far as she could tell, neither aspects of the name fit the spa itself at all. It looked just any other spa that Tara could have gone to, complete with the typical pool and hotel additions, and she had yet to encounter anyone here who could be considered 'fat'. Tara raised an eyebrow in confusion, believing that she may have taken to wrong turn in that fork in the road some odd miles back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, sheer curiosity compelled her to continue and she walked through the front doors into a large reception area. There a rotund redhead with blue eyes, freckles, rectangular, black-rimmed glasses and a ponytail sat at the front check in desk, toiling away on a computer. For some reason, the woman's dull white coat  was muddied with sweat stains on her armpits and food stains everywhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Well, it is 90 degrees, and she might've just had a big lunch.</i>\" Tara mentally rationalized. \"<i>Still, one would think that she'd have a backup coat just in case.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat greeting brought the blonde out of her thoughts, and she walked toward the smiling receptionist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi. I'd like to sign up. My name is Tara Strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you're <font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><i><b>THE</b></i></font> Tara Strong?!\" The receptionist gasped. \"Oh My God! I'm your biggest fan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 44-year-old chuckled lightly. She was used to reactions like this whenever someone recognized her. It was cute to be honest and actually pretty funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you...\" Tara squinted her eyes to read the employee's name tag. \"...Carrie.\" Then, she turned her head to get a better view of the inside, which was no less ordinary in appearance than exterior of the spa. \"I take it that this is the Fat Farm that I heard such great things about. I don't know why it's called that though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before, this was just a farm built by a wealthy family, but it was sold and converted into a spa.\" Carrie explained giddily. \"Now, it's a paradise where women can just rest and relax! Well, anyway, for you, the first week of our treatments here is absolutely free! That is, if you'd like to try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara pondered her choices. She didn't want to abuse her celebrity credentials to get preferential treatment. It was a cliche negative stereotype which she had no desire to perpetuate, and on top of that, it just felt a little wrong. However, something was motioning her to play the \"I'm famous\" card, just this once, though she could not place her finger on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love that.\" Tara agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Here are your choices in our activity pamphlet.\" Carrie said, handing a small pamphlet to Tara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. <span class=\"cgreen\"><i><b>*BBBhhuurrrpp!*</b></i></span>\" Tara replied before getting cut off by a short, yet loud belch. It reeked of the two Diet Pepsi and Coca-Cola cans that she had on the way here. \"Excuse me. That just slipped out.\" The blonde giggled nervously with blushing cheeks and her right hand covering her mouth too late. Surprisingly, the receptionist also let out a giggle, though hers sounded like genuine amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that, Miss Strong. Everyone does it, including me.\" To prove her point, Carrie casually belted a belch that put Tara's to shame. It carried (pun intended) a scent of digested pizza, hot dogs, burgers, soda, and other food and drink that the vocal artist could not immediately identify, and was putrid enough to make her fan away the incoming fumes. She flinched at the sound of the burp, which roared with enough force to ruffle Tara's signature golden locks. The length was also impressive, clocking in at three seconds - triple the duration of Tara's comparatively minor eructation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Tara muttered, earning another giggle from Carrie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, we all let out some tiny puffs of air, so you shouldn't feel bad.\" The ginger reassured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>'Tiny puffs of air'?</i>\" Tara thought, incredulous and a bit miffed that she was so easily out-burped. \"<i>Mine was just an accident. If I could work one up on command, I'd have won. Wait, why am I thinking about that?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you're right.\" She said, regaining her composure. \"Thanks for the... uh, advise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, and the treatment are down the first hall on the right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, and please, you can just call me Tara.\" The VA said as she walked down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara arrived in her room, glad to finally get this week of R&amp;R started. She had met a few people on her way here. They were all nice, though their figures were at the very least pudgy and at most morbidly obese. However, Tara was not one to judge people based solely on appearance, as that was another stereotype which she did not want to legitimize (though given what occurred earlier, that might not last long).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, that must mean that the food here is good, right?\" She quipped in solitude. \"And speaking of food...\" She pulled out the brochure provided to her by Carrie and gave it a good reading. There, she reviewed some options that caught her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the mud bath sounds nice and relaxing, but I skipped breakfast and lunch today, and the buffet looks delicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking for a bit, she decided to go to the...</span></span></div></div>",

We have a wide assortment of treatments, relaxation methods, and a 5-star buffet and restaurant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust from hearing that, Suzy clapped her hands in excitement, \u201cMaybe a seven day stay won\u2019t be long enough. Arin won\u2019t mind.\u201d She thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe did some discussion at the planning process for this facility and believed that a guest visiting the first time would enjoy going either to the Mud Bath or the Buffet/Lounge for their first  activity.

With the same color too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are here for the Mud Bath, yes?\u201d she spoke with a thick Russian accent, \u201cUndress in the closet and hop in the tub.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzy was taken aback by the direct orders, but did the orders anyhow. She undressed and walked out in her black bathing suit. Before her was the bathtub that sunk beneath the tiles. The brown slobby mixture of dirt and water occasionally bubbled, signifying that it must be warm, but she had to make sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzy dipped a toe, \u201cOh, yeah. That\u2019s perfect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon she had completely submerged her body within the mud. It\u2019s warm, yet sloppy firmness had held her in such a way nothing else had before. At this point in time, she had felt truly relaxed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzy closed her eyes and let the mud do it\u2019s job of completely relaxing her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Suzy opened her eyes to see Mindy at her side, \u201cIf at any point during the bath you get hungry there are buttons at your side.\u201d Suzy looked over to indeed see buttons to her side, \u201cThese buttons control a hose and a robotic hand that feed you both food and drink. Namely soda and pizza and chocolates, seeing as that was what the researchers said women preferred.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brief moment of silence passed, \u201cAnyhow, I\u2019ll leave you to relax.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm?

Her eyes drank in the Spanish influenced interior design. Its meets the criteria of above and beyond in presentation while also being fetching and memorable in food selection. Additionally, Suzy\u2019s nose had been entranced by the pleasant, mouth watering smell that flowed from the heating plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swipes her dark hair from her astonished face and does what anyone would do. Grab a plate and start chowing down. Which was much easier said than done. The entire buffet had to be the size of a football field with a selection from every region in the world; America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, Antarctica, Mexico, Russia. The list went on and on. In combination of that list came the overwhelming selection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the weeabo that she is, Suzy started her meal in the Asia section, specifically, Japan, \u201cOh man. Arin would love this place,\u201d giggled the \u201cgamer\u201d plucking sushi and sashimi onto her plate. She made a bee-line for America. Stealing slices of pizza, a few burgers, and onion rings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzy returned to her table with a plate piled full of sushi, ramen, and other oily foods. Her chopsticks plucked off the edibles into her hungry mouth. The sushi served here, surprisingly, tasted leagues better than the sushi she ate in Japan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the third helping, Suzy still felt a hankering to eat. She decided to deviate from the safe options of American and Japanese cuisine to eat from the other areas of the world. \u201cKangaroo meat? Peanut Butter Soup? Borsche? Well, since it\u2019s here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo keep things short, Suzy had found a liking to food from different cultures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until her twelfth plate and tenth pitcher of Mountain Dew that Suzy had actually stopped eating. Her bloated stomach rose and fell with each labored breath. Suzy had gone way past her limit, possibly consuming enough calories to be in the high thousands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven worse had to be the clothes she wore. Already a little tight on her body after the fifteen pound weight gain. Her green short sleeve v-neck shirt hardly covered her stomach at this point, clinging to her torso tightly. It dug into her softer upper arms and b-cup breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzy gulped the last mouthful of food and pushed herself away from the table, \u201cWhew. I lost control there,\u201d hiccupped the streamer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far her stay in the resort already left a positive impression on her. Despite her stay only starting hours ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rumble erupted in her stomach, \u201cThere\u2019s no way I can be hungry again. Ugh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzy decides to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A phenomenon known as sudden onset hunger had hit her once more. Was it because she was on vacation? That\u2019s one variable. Was it because she was in a room containing a damn near endless source of delectable food? That\u2019s better. Was it because her eyes had laid on the Japan section of the buffet complete with sushi conveyer belt? There\u2019s your answer. Besides, she might as well get as much as she can, she paid for it after all. <br>\r\nDespite the vacation aspect of her situation, Suzy wasted no time picking from every platter to pile up her plate. Pot stickers, white rice, roll after roll of sushi, lobster, bowls of udon noodles, and crab Rangoon. Her inner weeb smiled ear to ear with every quick bite she greedily took. Suzy would kick herself if she could for not snapping a pic of the delightful oriental feast before her for her twitter followers. <br>\r\n\u201cThere will be other chances,\u201d she tells herself licking the crab Rangoon grease from her lip. Suzy downs spoonful\u2019s of udon broth with white rice soaking the liquid up. The lobster soaked in butter disappeared in seconds after soon laid eyes on it. To top it all off, in a moment of pure gluttony, Suzy drank just a bit of the lobster butter. Melted butter was a taboo little thing for her to enjoy. <br>\r\nThe youtuber laid back, rubbing her stomach in satisfaction now that the awful hunger sensation has dissipated. Thoughts of feeling like a bloated pig with thyroid issues would have to wait for tomorrow. Where she could try dieting again. <br>\r\nSuzy laid her head back while her stomach sloshed and churned, \u201cJust for today. Tomorrow will be better.\u201d After several moments of rubbing her taut midsection, Suzy stood up. As before her clothes felt even tighter. Especially when she peered down to see a belly forming. Her muffin top had been bloated with fish and rice into giving Suzy a preview of what\u2019s in store if she doesn\u2019t watch her eating. <br>\r\nShe too ignored the fullness of her stomach. It was taut and bloated with fish and rice. Suzy couldn't deny the calling to the cake. \u201cBetter get out of here before you get any bigger.\u201d<br>\r\nOnly two steps were travelled before an enticing aroma floated around her nostrils. The scent had led her to a thick, triple decker fudge cake next to a platter of salted caramel doughnuts. Suzy sweated with a whimper. This time her stomach wasn\u2019t instigating any actions, rather it was the satisfaction of enjoying desert after a meal. \u201c\u2026well\u2026\u201d, she thought, biting her lip. Her stomach felt taut, near the brink of utter fullness, yet she wanted just a little taste of both. \u201cJust a little slice of both.\u201d<br>\r\nSoon those little slices became more slices until Suzy ate the entire cake. Same with the donuts. Nothing much to describe here folks, just telling what happened.<br>\r\nSuzy let out a little whine. Her sudden huge appetite had gone too far. The dark green shirt she wore couldn\u2019t passively cover her stomach that had become bloated with an immense amount of carbs. Resting in a chair, she had to force a lean back. Any forward movement would hurt her stomach. <br>\r\nAs time passes, the pain subsides, and Suzy without a second thought dashes out of the buffet. Next time, she\u2019ll have to control herself a better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzy, still stuffed to the brim, walks around the Hotel until\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lots of times I see a story start on one character and then quickly it goes \"yeah but let's just switch to these characters here and forget the main character.\" If you want to add more characters that's totally fine, just don't forget whoever it was that the story was about. </td>",
