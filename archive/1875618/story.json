I don't know if we should try this.\" Ethan commented but he knew how stubborn Benny was. \"And you said there is no way to revert this. If something goes wrong...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I'm just gonna shoot something randomly. Like one of Jane's dolls.\" Benny knew how to persuade Ethan and he got it. Ethan nodded in response knowing he would regret allowing Benny doing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine just shoot that fly.\" Ethan pointed to the flying insect and Benny said the words. A blue lightning went across the room, swerved the fly and went right into Ethan's chest, making him fall on the floor. \"Ouch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry man. I don't know what happened. Are you feeling anything different?\" Benny helped Ethan getting on his feet, not sure of what his friend can turn into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay, I guess. I told you this was no good.\" Ethan said worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it was nothing. C'mon, let's hang out a bit, so you can relax a little.\" Benny oferred and Ethan nodded again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were walking,...</span></div></div>",

I have to lace my shoes.\" The young wizard knelt down on the floor. While Ethan waited, he could see Kurt coming closer. And the guy seemed mad. In fact, Kurt wanted revenge since he lost that wrestling match for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you know why I'm here Morgan. And there's no way for you to runaway.\" Kurt grabbed Ethan by the collar of his shirt and lifted the smaller boy one feet from the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan's nausea got worse and he felt all his muscles contract and relax. The strange part was that they kept as the same size as when they were contracted. Benny soon realized the clear change in his friend's body and gasped in surprise. Before any of the three was able to say something, Ethan's muscles contracted again and again. Ethann was growing before their eyes. To adjust his growth, Ethan grew in height, which made his feet land on the floor, standing taller than Kurt. Ethan's arms grew so big that looked like they would burst at any moment. His pecs pushed his shirt forward and grew towards his face blocking his underside view. His traps engulfed his growing neck and pulled his shirt up till his stomach which now revealed an powerful eight pack. His back was so wide as Benny with open arms. There were no room  in his jeans for his expanding quads. They were enormous as Kurt's waist. And his calves looked like soccer balls implanted to the back of his legs. Finally, his shoes exploded because it couldn't bear the massive feet that now touched the concrete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you're the incredible hulk! At least, without the green part.\" Benny joked amazed with the size of his best friend. Ethan was now taller than him. One thing that previously was the opposite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. That's impossible.\" Kurt said scared of what kind muscle beast Ethan turned himself into. He decided to run before Ethan could do anything to his now hulked form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Benny, what did you do? Now I look like a freak!\" Ethan said and felt that nausea coming up again.

They're getting huge!\" Benny noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, his calves were growing and they weren't stopping yet! They inflated bigger and bigger, becoming bigger than softballs. They were like two large spheres of muscle, sticking out from his legs, hard as rocks! But, they kept on growing. They became like soccer balls, big and round and heavy, packing on muscle and making Ethan feel the strength in his legs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! I feel... freaking strong... in my legs!\" he moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis calves slowed down as they bulged out, like two large slabs of steel.

It looks like you're back to normal again!\" Benny cheered, while breathing a deep sigh of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but... That growth spurt has destroyed my clothes!

And grandma's out of town.\" Benny replied, trying to sound blameless. Right then, the collar of Ethan's shirt ripped until the middle of his torso, putting the two slabs of brawn on display. Ethan moaned and grumbled all the way they grew to the new massive size. As soon as it was done, Ethan opened his eyes, but his underside view ws completely blocked by his pecs. Benny punched his friend's chest but pulled his hand back quicky right when the pain started. \"Man, these are hard like rocks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey normal citizens, wha...

Are you nuts? You said it was random! All I know is that you made me turn into this freak!

Then the feeling spread to his stomach and his arms and back, and they also inflated with size to match his meaty pecs.  Again he grew a bit taller and as the two other boys watched in awe and amusement Ethan continued to scream and grunt as his body packed on more and more muscle, this time even more than his previous growth spurt.  Finally after several minutes of growth, he felt the tingling sensation stop and he stood there naked except for his boxers.  He now looked like a smaller, normal colored version of the hulk.  But despite his newfound power, Ethan was still reluctant about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...damn, not again.... how am I supposed to find clothes?

Then, his mighty calves in the back of his legs just sprung to life, inflating like mighty balloons which were attached to an air pump. They inflated like titanic spheres of mighty muscle, ripping out of his legs like those of an Olympian... and even bigger! Amazing red veins covered the legs, making them thick and wide. Ethan's legs grew longer and wider and thicker and deeper until they were as big and as round and as hard as oak trees, ripping with muscle that was as hard as steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh man...\" Ethan gasped when the incredible growth spurt stopped.

Ethan's boxers were pushed to its limits as the expanding quads forced the cloth to its maximum stretch. More and more muscled were bor upon the previous ones, forcing Ethan to spread his feet to give room for his growin legs. His calves, round as basketballs, harder and harder as if it was contracted all the way. Impossibly, Ethan's eight pack became a ten pack, looking like a wall of muscle bricks. The widening back made Ethan's V shape more pronounced, putting the pair of lats on display just like a bird spread his wings. But the set of muscles that called the boy's attention was the arms. Ethans biceps and shoulders turned into four beachballs of muscle, showing all it's vascularity as the veins pumped a huge amount of blood through all that muscle bound geek.

Ethan had all that now, but still he was nervous about meeting her like this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being reluctantly persuaded to go the gym, Ethan was given a some workout clothes and a towel by Rory, and the three headed to the nearby gym.  Along the way Ethan saw several people stare at him and his new body.  He didn't feel the tingling sensation for a while now which may have meant that he was finally stabilizing.  He found it....very different to be at the center of attention like this.  He also found it difficult to move as he had the bulk of five large bodybuilders all packed on a single human frame.  He couldn't put his arms down by his dies because his back and arm muscles were so wide, and he couldn't put his feet together for the same reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three entered the gym they notice...</span></div></div>",

This is your chance!\" Rory said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah I know, but don't you think this is sorta suspicious?  I mean, I was skinny before a day ago and now I'm suddenly all huge?\" Ethan retorted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well just tell her you had a little accident with a magic spell, I'm sure she'll understand, or that you've been on steroids!' Benny joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan shook his head.  As he waited for the others to get ready, he walked over to the sinks to wash his face a bit.  As he finished washing up, he looked up at his reflection and for the first time, he got the full view of his sheer bulk.  He neck was incredibly thick, as wide as his own head, his deltoids were almost pas his ears, his shoulders and biceps looked like over-inflated beach balls, making his shoulders about 3 1/2 feet wide, almost as wide as the doorway.  He had a ripped eight-pack that looked capable of stopping a champion boxer's punch, but of course his most impressive muscles were his massive pecs.They jutted out almost 8 inches from his chest, a solid wall of muscle rivaling that of a greek god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, admiring yourself there big guy?\" Rory asked as he was ready to start working out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! I..I don't....ah whatever...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three exited and started their stretches before moving on so some cardio.  Ethan had yet to test his endurance so he thought he'd try the treadmill to see how long he could run for.  Meanwhile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Or maybe this was going to be a steady growth?  Ethan took his mind off the tingling sensation, finished his 20 min jog on the treadmill and went  over to some of the weight machines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what's next big guy? I doubt you're tired from that one little jog?\" Rory asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, no I'm not.  I feel like I could have gone another hour or so!\"  Ethan had to admit that having humongous, muscled legs meant that he would never tire out. Before he could barely jog a half mile without having to slow down or pause for a break.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how about working out your arms next?  Like barbel curls?\" Benny asked pointing over to a rack with several weights and dumbbells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan nodded and walked over to the weights.  He test lifted several of them before choosing a 70 lbs dumbbell, taking it one of the armrests and began pumping his left arm.  Again he continued to feel the tingling sensation, and the more he pumped his bicep, the bigger his arms got.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude you're arm's getting huge!  Try switching over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan moved and switched to his right arm and started pumping.

His veins pumped with magical blood and run through his arms, making it grow a little. Surprisingly Sarah didn't notice the slight growth of the teen's arms. But it wouldn't last long.

If possible, his muscles started piling on more pounds of the toughest and hardest man-beef in the world. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nRory, Benny and Sarah all took a few steps back out of instinct, but each had different expressions.  Benny of course, still had that curious and goofy grin on his face watching his buddy's muscles grow even bigger.  Rory was a bit more skeptical, but still interested.  Sarah however was both shocked and a little disgusted.  Sarah was worried that Ethan may actually pop from too much muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pecs for example, swelled further and further from his ribcage towards the other three, first surpassing the size of large television sets, than past desks and finally large beanbag chairs.  At least to keep the balance, his arms and shoulders also grew and pumped with more muscle.  In fact, all this muscle was blocking the lower part of Ethan's head from view.  His shirt, previously stretched to its limits, finally began tearing to pieces before finally being destroyed completely and revealing Ethan\u2019s hulking mass for all to see.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh\u2026..ugh\u2026too\u2026.big\u2026..\u201d Ethan grunted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah\u2019s face reddened a bit out of embarrassment, she didn\u2019t mind the look of a little muscle on a guy she admitted, but this was simply way too much, bigger wasn\u2019t better in this case.  The other two didn\u2019t really share her sentiment though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon E!  Show us how big you can get!\u201d Benny egged on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, man! Keep growing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Ethan kept on getting bigger and bigger.  His muscles kept heaving and inflating with more muscle and even though Ethan tried to keep his anger in check, the magic spell kept on working its magic on Ethan\u2019s body.  After several minutes of growth, Sarah had enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEthan! Stop this at once!\u201d she cried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, why? E here is like the Hulk!\u201d Benny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, hey I finally came up with a name for him!  The Big Bulk!  Ethan the Big Bulk!\u201d Rory suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you see that your friend here looks like he\u2019s about to pop?!\u201d  Sarah exclaimed.  The three of them argued for several more minutes forgetting the growing Ethan.  They finally stopped talking when they heard a muffled voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, guys? I think I\u2019ve stopped\u2026..growing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three turned around and to their shock, Ethan did stop growing, but it was his huge size that caused them to go silent.  Ethan was a 500 lbs jock last, but now, it looked like he ha d swallowed the Hulk\u2019s size on top of that, and cramming another 1500 lbs or so on a barely 6 foot tall body.  He was wider than a pair of French Doors, and his arms and legs were so huge that they were sticking out because the sheer mass pushed them aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee?  That\u2019s the Hulk for ya!  C\u2019mon, let\u2019s go outside to show everyone your new bod, do you think you can lift a car?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026if I can move even\u2026.\u201d Ethan tried to move his legs and arms, but he was so huge and pumped up that the muscles were restricting his movements.  He was able to move a few feet but it was very crude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee guys? He can barely move with all that bulk!  And it\u2019s all thanks to your crazed obsession with turning him into some sort of super muscular superhero!  Well, I for one dislike this \u2018new Ethan!\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan was saddened but also happy to hear Sarah say that.  This meant that it wasn\u2019t muscles that Sarah was interested in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan\u2019s feelings\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Listen to me, firstly we're gonna...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Benny whispered devilish words inside Rory's ear, Ethan'd stopped shrinking. Sarah was amazed at how good Ethan now looked. At 6 feet tall and 175 lbs, Ethan'd body was perfect for an international model. The only thing Ethan thanked was the fact he'd got his mobility back. But as long as Benny and Rory were there, they wouldn't let it last more thana few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.. E, my ol' buddy.

They are only trying to make you grow again.\" She said as Ethan recovered his peaceful state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right.

Ethan's favorite. \"It's so sad that these pages are easy to tear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenny tore page by page of the comic. He could tell Ethan was hardly holding on to Sarah's advice to not get angry.

I can feel my underwear straining.\u201d Ethan looked embarrassed but Benny just smirked and smiled with glee like a kid at a candy store. \u201cDon\u2019t worry E, I\u2019ll find something to fit. Wait here!\u201d Benny left the dressing room to search for something to wrap around Ethan\u2019s waist. He stealthily slipped by Sarah and Rory who were still arguing over what to do about the spell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to any of them, Ethan\u2019s body was growing more, though it was very slow and the tingling sensation was nearly unnoticeable. Ethan waited in the dressing room. He wanted to sit on the miniature bench but wasn\u2019t sure if it could hold all his new weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenny was looking far and wide inside and around the gym for anything to cover Ethan up. The biggest thing he could find was an abandoned shirt in the locker room but it looked like it wouldn\u2019t even fit around one of Ethan\u2019s tree trunk legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t going well.\u201d Benny spoke aloud. \u201cMaybe Rory could help me out.\u201d He pondered for a moment to think if Rory would be of any help but decided it was worth a shot. After all, he wanted to see Ethan become the Big Bulk too, so it couldn\u2019t hurt to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenny returned to where Rory and Sarah were outside the dressing room and pulled Rory aside. \u201cHey, do you think you could go back to your place? We need to find something to wrap around Ethan pronto!\u201d Before Rory could give an answer, Sarah stepped into the conversation. \u201cAre you two crazy? What we need to find is a reverse to the spell!\u201d Sarah tapped her heel, growing more and more impatient as nobody seemed to want to fix Ethan but her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring Sarah\u2019s pleas, Rory looked back to Benny. \u201cSure thing, be back in a flash!\u201d Rory left the gym and trekked to his house as quickly as he could. Sarah groaned and glared at Benny, \u201cIf none of you are gonna help, I\u2019ll find a cure by myself.\u201d She stormed out of the gym in search of anything that could help reverse the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenny sat outside the dressing room and waited for Rory\u2019s return. As he sat down, he could hear muffled moaning from inside the room. \u201cHey Big Bulk, you okay in there?\u201d Benny leaned his ear against the door and could hear Ethan\u2019s low sounding voice. \u201cBigger... It\u2019s happening again... Too tight...\u201d Benny didn\u2019t want to miss out on seeing his friend work his magic, literally, so he knocked on the door. \u201cE, it\u2019s me, I\u2019m coming in.\u201d but before he could reach for the doorknob, the walls in the dressing room began to crack in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan\u2019s muscles had grown significantly since Benny began his search 15 minutes ago. His pecs had jutted out two more feet and began crushing into the dressing room walls. His nipples were bigger than the doorknobs and closer to the size of a CD. His pecs had passed over his chin and covered his mouth. Now his head was stuck in place because of his humongous chest and shoulders. His back was wider than a small car and his legs could crush steal. His arms were forced at an angle as Ethan\u2019s biceps grew past the size of beach balls and slowly worked their way to yoga ball sized. The magic forced Ethan to grow taller in order to accommodate for his freakishly big muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly cow E, you\u2019re bigger than the dressing room!\u201d Benny spoke with excitement. Ethan grunted as the foundation of the room around him was breaking and forming more cracks. \u201cI have got to be the biggest geek on Earth- no, in all of history.\u201d Ethan\u2019s words weren\u2019t totally clear but Benny could still understand what his pal was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Ethan was feeling the walls break away, he could feel something else breaking away too. His underwear! Pretty soon it\u2019d snap off and leave everything out in the open for all to see.</span></div></div>",

Would Sarah like him the way the was now? Or would she find him maybe a bit too big, too tall and too muscular? Maybe Ethan would meet some other girl who would like him, instead?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral guys who were already working on the machines and the cardio equipment looked up as Ethan quietly walked past them. Ethan knew he was getting a lot of attention already, with his broad shoulders, his bulging chest and his massive biceps. It was hard NOT to notice him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a girl walked up to him. It was NOT Sarah. It was... Erica!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well... What brings a big hunk like YOU in here?\" she said, as she did a hair-flip as she approached him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenny's jaw dropped wide open. Erica was HOT.

I came to... uhhh... work out?\" Ethan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My goodness... I don't know if we have machines to fit a body this big!\" Erica swooned, as she ran the tip of her finger over Ethan's chest. \"What do you plan to... work out, big hunk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhmmm... My... Uhh... My arms?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really?\" Erica grinned, running her hands over his big biceps. \"I can't imagine these guns growing any bigger than they already are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Ethan felt that faint tingling again...

His pecs pushed outwards until they looked like two large bricks that were sticking out from Ethan's chest, divided by a deep cleavage! In the front, they were oval shaped, with nipples near the bottom of each large pec muscle. Ethan could feel an amazing amount of strength in his chest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! Your chest! It's huge!\" Benny gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ethan opened his eyes, he could no longer see his feet, or the floor in front of him.

Soon Ethan's shoulders and biceps caught up to his growing chest and he soon developed a monstrously muscled physique complete with a 70 inch chest, 25 inch biceps and boulders as opposed to shoulders.

Some of them sat on the bleachers as the coach left the gym, catching their breath and asking the captain, Brad, what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are we gonna get some grub, Brad?\" Asked a team mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I was thinking we could torture that wimp, Ethan Morgan.\" Brad laughed and flexed his biceps. \"It's good to have a little bitch to beat senseless. Anyone know where the little pussy is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can help,\" said a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team of sweaty beefed up jocks turned to stare at the giant that entered the room. They barely noticed Benny standing next to him, but Ethan stole attention from all the jocks who stared with wide eyes and wide mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan's ego grew along with his biceps, lats, traps, pecs, thighs and glutes. This was clear because that wimpy nerd that was punched and pushed around by jocks all the time was no more. Instead, Ethan's cute face had a cocky expression as he flexed his boulder sized biceps and started bouncing his pecs. He felt a slight punch with each bounce as his pecs were so big they hit his face as he made them dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan's muscles had grown significantly bigger since the initial spell. From 25 inch biceps to 50 inch all in under an hour. The growth rate seemed to stop though, but this was plenty for Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe basketball team stared in awe as Ethan flexed his now massive muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! What happened to you?\" Brad asked the 6 ft 6\", muscular Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just been workin' out, pussy\" Ethan said with a chuckle as Benny grew excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad felt a chill of fear tingle through his body as he saw the gleam in his eye as he said this. This was the same thing Brad said to Ethan the previous week when he held a skinny Ethan in a headlock that nearly crushed his skull. Ethan choked out \"how did you get so strong?\" And Brad replied, \"oh, just been workin' out, pussy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Ethan's bicep was 10 times the size Brad's was, and Brad was not looking forward to feeling that bicep crush him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's play ball,\" Ethan said with a devious smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was Ethan's first target, and he enjoyed picking up the 6 foot tall jock and giving him a wedgie before throwing him to the other side of the gym, straight into the basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenny grinned in excitement as he watched his beefy friend dish out a beating to the bully. Ethan was satisfied to see Brad groaning in pain as his ass was stuck in the basket, leaving him stuck. But Ethan decided to make the rest of the team suffer too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe used a variety of moves to make these bullies suffer, including crushing one's head beneath his 50 inch bicep. He was too strong to use full strength, so to be safe he applied light but still very painful pressure to the jock before throwing him in the basket on top of Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Ethan grabbed a jock and shoved him against the gym wall. Ethan turned around and squashed the basketball jock to the wall with his wide lats. The guy grunted in pain as he was crushed into the wall by an even harder wall of muscles. When Ethan stopped crushing the guy he thought the pain was over, but then Ethan grabbed the jock by the chest area of his tanktop and decided to slam dunk this jock on top of Brad and the other jock, eventually breaking the basket with his immense strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the team was pretty easy to beat, and Ethan laughed as he flexed his anaconda arms. Benny cheered Ethan on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude that was awesome! Look how much damage you can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Ethan said, grinning. \"I wonder, you think I could go bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Benny said. \"I could try the spell again. We'll turn you into a muscle giant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenny did the spell again, and the result was...</span></div></div>",

When Benny had first cast the spell it had hurt as he grew,  but when he had shrunk back it didn't.<br>\r\n\"Are you saying that I just thought about shrinking and it happened' Ethan said.<br>\r\n\"Maybe let's face it most of my spells don't really just go away like that\"<br>\r\n\"So how do we test it out\" Ethan asked?<br>\r\n\" How about you just think about how tall you want to be\" Benny said.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

He had figured that growing to twenty feet would not be possible.  Looking at himself everything was normal for his new size he then noticed Benny.  \"You look like an action figure\"  Ethan smirked.

The young vampire had flown into the yard and was floating in front of Ethan's face.  \"Hey, your sister Jane she's at her school and a bunch of vampires have taken her and some other people hostage\" he rattled off.  Benny just stared up at his two friends one a giant and one floating in the air.  Rory looked down at the ground at Benny then back at Ethan.  \"What's going on\" he said while he landed.  \" Ethan had a growth spurt\"  Benny said smiling at his joke.  \"Really\" the blonde vampire exclaimed.  \" So why is Jane at school it's the weekend right\" Benny asked Ethan.  \"She had something to do I'm not sure, but we have to save her and the others\" \" You better shrink back to normal\" Benny told his friend.  Rory watched in apt amazement as Ethan shrank to his normal height.  \"How are we going to get to the school\" Benny asked?  \"I'll fly\" Rory said.  \"We can't fly\" Benny pointed to Ethan and himself.  \"I'll carry both of you\"  He grabbed one hand from each boy and went to take off and crashed back to the ground.  \" What happened\" Benny asked?  \"I'm not sure, let's try again\" The same attempt was met with the same result.  \"Maybe I need some blood to strengthen myself\" and with that Rory took off.  \" come on we have to go now\" Ethan told Benny  <br>\r\n   The two boys arrived at the school.  \"Hey E\"  \" Yes B\"  \" Did you bring any stakes\" \" No\" \" Me neither\" \"We wont need them\" Ethan marched into the school, with Benny tagging along wondering if his best friend had gone crazy.  The first vampire was or had been a collage jock.  Benny stared at the muscular guy.  \"E even without him being a vampire he still tear us apart, you should grow now\"  Ethan just smiled pushed Benny gently out of the way and turned to the jock.  \"You know who i am\"  \" the vampire snarled \"The seer with tasty blood\"  \" well come and get it\"  Ethan taunted.  Benny couldn't believe his ears, so he closed his eyes when the vampire used his speed to tackle Ethan.  With eyes still closed he heard a body falling to the floor.  Opening them he was shocked to find Ethan standing and the vampire on the floor.  The bruised vampire got up and punched Ethan in the stomach.  Benny flinched as if the fist was heading towards him.  As he was expecting Ethan to be shoved across the hall or to end up with a hole in his chest, he was amazed and also surprised when the vampire's fist seemed to have no effect on the seer.  \"My turn\" Ethan said.  He kicked the jock in the leg which snapped causing the vampire to fall to his knees, then placing one hand under his chin and the other on the back of his head the geek twisted the jocks head and broke his neck.  The body fell to the floor.  \"How did you do that\" Benny just stared at the body. \"Is he dead\" \" of course he's a vampire\" \"I mean like for good\" \"no\" \" How did you do that\" \"I'll explain later we have to keep going\" </span></div></div>",

Ethan had saving his sister on his mind so he lifted his arm along with Benny, and began walking.  Benny stared wide eyed as Ethan effortlessly carried him one handed.  It wasn't like Ethan had never carried him before or the other way around,but it was only for a few feet and using both arms.  Benny had been struggling the whole time Ethan had been walking.  And yet Ethan didn't even seem to notice.  \"Can you fly\" Benny asked sarcastically?  \"What are you talking about\" Ethan stopped walking yet still held Benny aloft.  \"Did you become superman or something\"  Benny demanded!  Ethan laughed \"No, I still retain all the attributes of being twenty feet\" \"What are you talking about,I'm confused?\"  Before Ethan could elaborate three vampires emerged.  \"Well well well looks like the geek squad final arrived\" one the males said.  \"Ethan put me down please\" \"Not right now it's safer if you're not on the ground\"  The other two vampires the second guy and a girl smirked at each other \"Looks like the seer doesn't want his lover to get dirty\" the female said.  Ethan raised his right foot.  \"Awe look, he's going to throw a temper tantrum\" the one male said.  Ethan slammed his foot down which caused cracks to radiate out from the floor under his foot also causing the three vampires to fall from the human caused earthquake.  He stomped towards the one vampire he said he was going to throw a temper tantrum.  Each step caused even more quaking as Ethan put all of his weight behind each one.  This made sure the vampires couldn't get up.  Benny held onto Ethan's arm afraid he'd would drop him and watched as Ethan crushed the vampires head in just by stepping on it.  He flattened it so bad that the other two vampires started to retch.  Luckily the head squashed vampire ended up dissolving into dust.  The other male got up and super sped towards Ethan.  Ethan had turned so that the arm not holding Benny was facing the rushing vampire.  The vampire slammed into the seer and fell like the first had, but instead of snapping his neck Ethan tore off his head while Benny now held onto him for dear life.  The last remaining vampire, the girl also used her vamp speed, yet she ran past Ethan and away from him escaping.  \"Wow\" was all Benny could say.  His friend final put him down.  \"I'd hug you but I'm afraid you'd just crush me\" Benny half joked and was half terrified that would happen.  Ethan smiled \"I can control my strength and if I did accidentally crush you I would become a mega giant and destroy the world or most of it.\"  Benny grabbed Ethan in a giant bear hug fortunately or unfortunately Ethan didn't return it.  \"Thanks for caring so much, now let's go get Jane\"</span></div></div>",

The other boy paused in his step \"I told you I still have the giant attributes\"  \"What does that mean exactly\"  \"It means that even though I am regular size I still weigh what I did when I was twenty feet tall\"  \"So that's why Rory couldn't pick us up, you were too heavy\"  \" And as a result I have the strength of a giant\" \"That is so cool can you go back to your normal human attributes\"Benny asked?  \"I think so but I'd have to grow to the twenty feet again to reset myself\" \"What if you grew even bigger then you would be even stronger then superman\" \"I don't think I'd be stronger then superman\" Ethan stated.  \"Sure if you grew to say hundreds of feet or even miles\" Benny explained.  \"I don't even know if that would be possible\" \"Let's try it out\" Benny said getting really excited.  \"Benny were in the school not to mention our home town if I did grow really really big I'd most likely crush it killing everyone including you\"  \"Oh, I forget about that small detail\"  \"I thought you might have\" Ethan shook his head at his friend and couldn't help but laugh.  At first he was slightly miffed at Benny casting the spell on him.  But now with these special perks he could live with Benny's mistakes.  They had arrived at the classroom were Jane was as it was the only one locked plus Jane was yelling for help.  Ethan grabbed the door handle and tore the door off it's hinges.  \"Thanks Sarah\" Jane said.  \"Sarah's not here\"Benny told her.  \"So Rory or Erica then\" she was looking around for the vampires but only saw her older brother holding a broken door.  \"Are you saying Ethan ripped the door right off\" \"Well I didn't do it\" Benny said.The three of them returned home.

Ethan was just standing holding his friend when they both heard a scream.  Looking up or in Ethan's case just a bit down they saw Jane at her window screaming.  \"Put me down\" Benny yelled up to Ethan.  He placed him on the ground.  As soon as his feet were on the ground he ran into the house and up to Jane's room.  \"Why is Ethan a giant\" the little girl demanded.  Benny scratched his head trying to avoid eye contact with her.  \"Benny what's happening\" \"I hit Ethan with a spell accidentally and now he can grow into a giant\" He explained.  \"Can he go back to normal\"  \"Sure\" Benny went to the window opening it up.  \"Is she alright\" Ethan asked?\"  \"Seems to be yet she wants you to go norm\" Benny said.  \"Fine \" Ethan sighed as he shrank back to normal.  He came inside the house and up the stairs.  \"Are you completely normal\" Benny asked his friend?  Instead of answering Ethan ran and jumped causing the spell master to raise his arms to catch him.  They both crashed to the floor in a heap. \"Why did you jump me\"Benny moaned.  \"To show you if I was still like before I would have crushed you\" \"Not to mention you would have fallen through the floor\" They both got up from the floor. \"Let's go to your room\" Benny suggested.  \"Are you good now\" Ethan asked his sister. \"ya but it'll cost you\" she held out her hand for her payment.  Ethan opened his wallet giving her ten dollars hush money.  If Jane was blackmailing him then she was fine.  They two boys went to Ethan's room.

His two friends watched in rapt attention as they stared at Ethan, both getting excited about what he was about to do.  Aaron had closed his eyes in joyful bliss as Ethan was raising him to his mouth.  When he stopped moving he opened his eyes.  \"Are you totally sure you want to do this once I swallow that's it I'll digest you.\" Ethan told him.  \"Yes, please I want to offer myself to your glorious body.\"  Benny just pouted whispering under his breath \"Why does E always get the best stuff.\"  Rory turned to him \" Hey maybe we'll get  people giving themselves to us as well\"  Benny nodded agreement \"Maybe Ethan will develop a taste for destruction\"  They both turned back to said boy.  \"E he really wants to be eaten by you\" Benny told his friend.  Ethan looked to Benny then back to Aaron \"Last chance\" he told him.  Aaron gave no indication that he didn't want this to not happen.  Ethan raised his hand and slowly fed Aaron into his mouth.  It took a few swallows to get him down.  Once Aaron's feet had disappeared down Ethan's throat Benny and Rory watched as the lump moved down Ethan's neck and disappear into his chest.  Ethan  put his finger on his chest following Aaron's descent.  \"That was weird and still is I can feel him inside of me.\" \"How is it\" Rory asked? Ethan thought for a second \"it feels awesome I want another one\" The two other boys smiled as each other then looked around for more people to feed to Ethan.</span></div></div>",

Turning to Ethan those thoughts were squashed as he saw Ethan looking at him with hunger.  \"You're not going to eat me are you\"  he asked scared?

Benny didn't want to reveal that he had cast a spell on a group of people that would all offer themselves to Ethan.  \"I accidentally stepped on a parked car\" he told him.  \"Really, Benny both you and Rory already destroyed a couple of cars\" Ethan couldn't believe his friends weird behavior.  Rory started to get bored \" Come on I want to go this way\" he began to move towards the group of people that Benny had put a spell on.  The three teens began to move down the street a few people began to notice them and cowardly hid  in their homes.  \"I wonder why they're so afraid of us, it's not like were going to eat them\" Benny said.  Ethan's stomach rumbled in hunger.  Benny looked to  his friend maybe he didn't  need to cast the spell on the people. The people in question came into view.  There was only about seven people .  There was a teen girl, an adult male, a teen boy, an older woman, a preteen girl, and two little boys.  \"Look the man said it's Ethan let us offer ourselves to him.\"  All the people knelt down in offer to the godly boy.  Ethan looked at his two friends first in confusion then in joy.  One by one the people were picked up and swallowed by Ethan.  As the last person found his way sent to Ethan's belly he turned to Benny \"Thanks Benny that was great\" Benny was confused \"Why are you thanking me I didn't do anything\"  \"Sure sure you didn't like I don't know when you're lying or when you put people in a magic trance\"  Benny was staring at Ethan in shock \"And you ate them knowing that they weren't actually offering themselves to you\"  Ethan just smiled quietly burping.  Rory was so lost in his own thoughts that he had missed the conversation that Ethan was going bad.  </span></div></div>",

Ethan smiled back \"so that I'm corrupted what do you have in mind\" Benny turned to Rory who hadn't been paying attention for awhile.  \"So Rory, Ethan like's to eat people\" Benny told the blond vampire.  \"Really that's cool\"  \"I was thinking that if we both asked him he could go to the stadium and eat all the people there.\"  Rory's eyes lit up at the thought of Ethan eating all those people at the stadium.  \"There's like hundreds of people there.\"  \" You guys want me to eat the stadium\" Ethan asked?  Rory turned frowning \"I was hoping to beg you\"  Ethan looked confused \"Why did you want to beg me.\"  \"I was hoping it would be to much and we would have to convince you\"  \"But I want to do it\"  Rory looked crestfallen as he wasn't able to talk his friend into doing what his friend was going to do.  Rory was a strange boy, but then Benny had an awesome idea.  \"Hey Rory , the stadium has about a two hundred people at it so Ethan should get bigger\"  Rory got excited at that \" Ethan you should grow bigger\"  Ethan laughed at his friends at Rory for thinking that it was his idea and at Benny for letting Rory think it was his idea.  \"OK Rory so how big should I get \" \"You should be  be about two hundred feet\" he told him.  Ethan nodded at Rory then began to grow.  Rory watched as Ethan began to expand upwards and outwards.  \"Why aren't we also growing to\" he asked Benny?  \"Because he said how big should I get, nothing about all of us, and maybe he wants to be bigger than us.\"  Ethan was amazed at how tiny everything looked when he was twenty feet tall the houses were as tall as him now at two hundred feet they were all below his shins.

Lifting his friends up he asked them which way to go.  \"It's past the skyscrapers\" Rory said pointing to the downtown area.  Ethan looked over in that direction and began walking.  Coming upon the middle of the bustling downtown the sight of a 200 foot teen boy caused a bunch of car accidents and people to start running away.  A few people stared in amazement at Ethan just in shock that he was so big.  Ethan watched all the little people scurry away from him.  It didn't matter one way or another as Ethan had a goal in mind to reach his destination.  A few cars and a couple of people were stepped on by the giant teen.  \"You think they would all not stand in his way\" Rory said to Benny.  \"I think those people wanted to be stepped on\" Benny answered.  Ethan had heard his two friends and wondered if what Benny said was true.  Looking down he saw one tiny person in the middle of the road.  Lifting his foot up he held it above the tiny person for a few seconds.  When the person didn't run away he realized that what Benny had said was true.  So he lowered his foot crushing the person.  Crushing was fun but eating was more enjoyable.  Making it to the stadium didn't take that long as Rory was right in the direction.  Now what to actually do here.</span></div></div>",

Both boys spent their time not trying to pin the other one, as they both liked it when the other caused them to crush the buildings under their massive bodies.  \"Hey you're not doing it right\"  Rory said when noticed what they both were doing.

Ethan was much smarter and would most likely be able to wield the powers better than him.  \"I'll let you take them if you wish.\"  Ethan walked up to Benny placing his hand on Benny's face he began to draw out the powers.  Benny was quite powerful or rather he had lots of untapped potential.  Ethan was amazed at all the power that <br>\r\nBenny contained.

Benny delicately brushed Ethan's cheek with his fingertips being gentle as if the boy would vanish and maybe he could now.  Ethan got up and walked over to Rory.  With Benny he was gentle kind, but with Rory he took what he wanted.  Grabbing Rory he took his strength his flight and his immortality.  Lets face it what's the point of being a god if you can't live forever.  He did leave both of his friends their original powers as that was apart of them and if he took it all he would kill them.  Of course both would have let him if he wished to.  Now with both of his friends power magnified by his own natural powers he was a god.</span></div></div>",

He looked around at the buildings \"Where is he, it shouldn't be this hard to spot a 200 foot giant\" Rory complained.

Looking at the street in front of him he shoved the building on his left in the direction that Benny had ran.  the building toppled over into the next one causing the next and the next to fall over.  Watching the ground as the buildings fell over he saw a group of people fleeing in terror.  He spotted Benny away from the crowd.  Ethan figured that maybe Benny had decided not to follow the crowd as Benny probably figured that he would be drawn to all the people.  Ethan watched as Benny was in a parking lot. Which didn't have any cars in it. Ethan quickly grabbed Benny lifting him up.  He had a hard time on deciding on what to do.  He then decided to put him under his arm.  Holding him there he lowered his arm till he felt Benny being crushed in his pit.  His body vanished then he grew to 800 feet.</span></div></div>",

He had made it so every time that Benny or Rory were killed they would re spawn in one of a few places  Which one they were sent to Ethan didn't know as that would be cheating.  He suddenly had the urge to go pee.  Looking around he noticed the swimming center.  Walking over he ripped off the building from the ground leaving the pools.  Unzipping his pants he aimed down and used the pools as his own toilet.  His urine filled all the pools within thirty seconds.  After he was done he shook himself off and zipped up.  He then felt himself growing.  Reaching 3200 feet he realized that he had pissed on both of them.  Deciding to head towards the school he felt a small crunch under his sneaker.  He then grew to 12800 feet, what were the odds that both Rory and Benny would be right in front of him. He looked at his watch and noticed that only one hour had passed since they had started.  And Benny and Rory were left with only 2 lives each.  Yeah he would definitely win.</span></div></div>",

Rory ran his fingers through his hair as he thought of the last times they were killed.  \"Drowning in your best buds piss is not a way I want to go.\"  Benny shuddered as he also remembered their shared demise.  They both had decided to hide out in the pool as it was or rather looked well sturdy.  It wasn't tell the entire building was removed by Ethan and he unzipped his pants that they realized their mistake.  \" Ok so we should split up like you said\" Rory  agreed.  \"Yes and try not to get killed\" Benny yelled as he was running away from Rory.  \"What will happen?\" Benny stopped turned around to stare at his friend.  \"Ethan gets bigger\" he stated.  \"Oh right avoid Ethan\" Rory said to himself then ran away in the opposite direction.  Benny watched as Rory ran down the street human slow.  Sometimes Rory forgot about being a vampire, but then again Ethan might have taken that power when he became a god.  Benny cast a quick spell to see if he still had his powers.  A small glowing ball of light appeared in his hand.  Quickly putting it out so no one saw it he then quietly laughed as a colossal Ethan was taking everyone's attention.  Rory was just being forgetful like usual.  Watching Ethan in the distance was quite thrilling to the spell master.  The seer didn't seem to be deliberately destroying anything yet he was casually walking and crushing cars and people under his sneakers.  Benny couldn't see behind the buildings that Ethan was behind yet he could just imagine most of the people panicking.  Which led to them being stepped on.  Benny sat on the sidewalk and just watched his best friend pace back and forth in thought.  After awhile the only noise he could hear was Ethan's foot steps.  </span></div></div>",

Benny should have got up and tried to hide or escape, but he was tired and hungry.  Running for your life and being killed multiple times was kind of exhausting.  Benny was lost in thought as the ground started to vibrate.  Looking up he saw Ethan coming towards him as the giant boy was 2 miles tall he was kind of hard to miss.  Benny saw everyone around him panic as they noticed the formerly friendly teen walking towards their part of the city.  Each step he took entire buildings disappeared under his foot to be totally pulverized  into rubble.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 Ethan really enjoyed being a 2 mile giant.  In fact being a god was thrilling, exciting, and just down right amazing.  He still couldn't wrap his head around the fact that it was all thanks to his best friend.  As he randomly picked a direction and began walking he felt elated as the buildings were destroyed under each step he took.  He wondered if he would feel the same way if he wasn't able to bring the destroyed city back to it's original state.  The thought quickly left his head as he came upon a suburb, he could tell as all the buildings were tiny and all roughly the same size.  Looking down he saw the ant sized people scurrying around running it seemed all over. Biting his lip gently he stepped on a  lone figure. The feeling of power he felt was orgasmic.  For some reason killing people one at a time was much more satisfying then whole groups.  Scanning the ground below he saw a lone figure not moving, as all other people seemed to be in panic mode this one seemed weird.  With extreme gentleness he used his thumb and forefinger to pick up the person.  Bringing his hand up to his eye he smiled when he saw that it was Benny.   Holding Benny for a second he thought about just squishing him like a bug with his colossal fingers.  He decided  to swallow him instead.  Tilting his head back he dropped the tiny teen into his mouth. Letting his saliva build up he promptly swallowed.  Seven seconds later he grew to 4 miles.</span></div></div>",

The people were even smaller.  He knew they were there as he could see what looked like blobs moving around.  As a god he could use enhanced sight to see the people, but that would be unfair to his friends.  So for the remainder of the game he had limited his powers.  He would only grow every time Benny or Rory were killed.  Most of the deaths of his friends were accidents.  He wondered if they were even trying to escape him or make him grow bigger.  Thinking about getting bigger Ethan decided that since he had the powers of a god he should look like one.  Closing his eyes he willed himself to grow bigger.  Not in height but in mass or rather muscles.  He felt every inch of his body swell with the added muscle.  He didn't want to become too huge so he stopped after his body became what would be called hot, not that he hadn't been hot to begin with.  But now he looked it rubbing his hands over his now beefy pecs he slid down to his toned stomach then continued to his muscular butt.  Flexing his arms his biceps bulged with new found power and strength.  He was getting aroused by his new body.  Ethan thought about continuing exploring himself or about ending the game.</span></div></div>",

Placing both of them upside down so that a cluster of buildings were now basically inside the shoes.  Smiling as he stood back up as he thought about all the people being tortured by his shoes.  Wondering if they would suffocate from the odor.  He moved onto his pants unbuttoning then unzipping them pulling them down exposing his now muscular legs.  Next he tore off his shirt throwing both items of clothing to drape over the city behind him.  He stood in his socks and boxers.  Looking down at his new improved beefy body his cock started to rise to attention.  Ethan thought he must be very narcissistic as he was turning himself on.  Well who wouldn't be as he had the power and body of a god.  Placing his hand in his underwear he began to stroke, as he he gripped his meat he sat down.  Moaning in pleasure as he began to pleasure himself.  It didn't take long for him to reach the end as he gasped and exploded in white golden bliss.  He watched as his cum splattered all over his body and places of the city completely soaking the ground  and drowning countless people.  Nodding off he was unaware as he began to grow again to 8 miles.</span></div></div>",

Hearing a light yet thunderous snoring Rory asked Benny why Ethan was sleeping.  Benny pointed around to the still moist pools of cum all over.  \" We shouldn't be this close to him\" Rory cautioned as Benny was walking towards Ethan.  \" I want to check out his body\" Benny responded entranced by what was in front of him.

Rory thought about this it did sound reasonable.  As the two were walking and talking the object of their conversation was beginning to awaken.  Ethan slowly opened his eyes as he roused himself from a contented sleep.  He felt so relaxed despite the fact that he was laying on top of a city.  He wondered where his friends were.  As he thought of them he could hear them. \"It's a good thing you can fly\" Benny said.  \"Yeah it would have taken forever to climb up Ethan's leg without my vampire flight and speed power\" Rory bragged.  Ethan lied there listening to his friends wondering how he could  hear them.  He felt so stupid when realized the answer was obvious.  his telepathy had kicked in as soon as he had thought about them and as they were currently on top of his leg he was able to hear them.  Concentrating on the tiny movements he deduced that they were on his right thigh.  He could have squashed them like tiny bugs yet decided to see where they were headed and what they planned to do when the got there</span></div></div>",

Ethan got slightly cramped and slowly raised his right leg causing the two boys to swiftly tumble down.  Which would have taken them forever to reach the top of his muscular thigh took only a few seconds.  He held his breath waiting to find out where they ended up.  It didn't take them that long to figure out that they were lost in Ethan's pubic hair.  He slowly rose to his feet knowing that his friends were holding onto his tree like hairs.

Ethan had snapped his fingers causing Rory to become mute.  His mouth was still moving but no sound was coming out.  \"What did you do\" Benny questioned?  Ethan cheekily raised an eyebrow \"I'm a god, I just muted him.\"  \"Can you do anything then\" Benny was asking?\"  \"What ever you want I can make it happen.\"  Benny hadn't thought about what that had meant about what he could choose to do.

As Benny was thinking about what to get Ethan to do for him.  Ethan slowly began to telepathically whisper in his head.  He made it so Benny would believe that it was his conscience.  ``Hey I have an idea let`s play the same game but with more people`` Benny blurted out as soon as Ethan had placed it in his head.  Ethan smiled ``So who should we choose.``  Benny scratched his head ``How about characters from TV and books and such.``  Ethan gave him a funny look.  ``What you said you were a god so this should be no prob for you right``  ``No, I should be able to do it I`m just surprised you thought of it``without my help he whispered under his breath.  Meanwhile Rory had noticed that the other two were ignoring him and couldn`t hear him.  Both Benny and Ethan watched as he mouthed the words ``Oh no I`ve gone deaf I can`t hear myself`` Benny smacked Rory upside the head ``You are not deaf Ethan muted you`` Benny smirked.  Rory`s mouth dropped open in shock as he looked between the two dark haired boys.  Ethan snapped his fingers giving Rory his voice back.  ``Why`d you do that`` Rory asked. Ethan shrugged ``you were getting annoying.  ``Anyways Benny has an idea for another game``  ``So what is this new game`` Rory asked Benny.  ``We do the same thing as last time except with people Ethan pulls out of TV and books``  ``That sounds like fun but will Ethan be the giant again.``  Both of them turned to the person in question.  ``I`ll place a random factor component in the game so that one of the participants will be it``  he said as it would be unfair if he just made himself it, and he wanted to be fair.  ``So who are we going to pick`` Ethan asked the both of them</span></div></div>",

Ethan had to try and think of a fair way to choose who would be the giant for the up coming game.<br>\r\nIt was then that Chace come up with a reasonable way by drawing straws.  As Rory vamp sped to grab some straws Adam asked \"Is he bionic too?\"  Benny not even looking<br>\r\nat the taller boy nonchalantly said \"No, he's just a vampire.\"  Oliver with wide eyes and a pale pallor to his skin screamed \"A vampire\" he placed his hand on his neck.<br>\r\n  \"Don't worry he only eats the blood from small animals\" Benny reassured the small boy.  \"Hear that Chace\" Adam nudged his little brother \"You should be careful or <br>\r\nthe bad vampire will get you.\"  Chace just rolled his eyes \"He meant like rodents and small pets most likely.\"  \"Well he said small and I wouldn't want to have to <br>\r\nstake you if you got bit.\" \"If I got bit and turned, I would bite you then\" Chace stuck his tongue out at Adam.  \"I would totally bite you\" Kaz told Oliver.  Oliver<br>\r\nsmacked him in the arm \"Why would you do that?\"  Rory had returned from wherever he had gone to get the straws.  Ethan answered for Kaz \"He cares for you and he would <br>\r\nwant to share his curse with you.\"  Oliver grinned shyly not meeting his friends gaze.  \"Or else you'd be beside him and he'd fall upon you like a side of beef\" Benny<br>\r\ntold Oliver.  Rory had the straws placed on the table and was cutting one to designate it.   He gathered them all up grouping them together and mixed them around.<br>\r\n\"OK everyone grab a straw.\"  They all quickly grabbed one straw each and looked at the one they pulled out.  \"Yes\" Kaz pumped his fist in the air as he had pulled the <br>\r\nshort straw.  \"I get to be it.\"  \"Now we have to set up the rules\" Ethan told him.  Kaz stopped cheering and turned quizzically to Ethan \"I thought you make me a giant <br>\r\nand I kill all of you and that's it\" he answered.  \"That wouldn't be a very fair game\" Chace said.  \"So what rules\" Kaz asked? \"Well for starters how big do want to be<br>\r\nand how many lives do each of us get, and do you want to  grow each time you kill us.\"  Ethan explained to him.  \"Oh do I get to pick all that\" Kaz was getting excited<br>\r\nover the power he was going to receive.  \"No, the rest of us will\" Ethan told him \"now sit down while we hash out the details.  He sat on the couch and watched the six <br>\r\nothers argue over his fate.  Chace wanted him to be only ten feet tall as he said it would be easier to contend with him at that size. While Oliver suggested as big as<br>\r\na skyscraper.  Kaz was amazed that Oliver wanted him that big.  They all agreed he should start out at one hundred feet.  \"We should have two lives each\" Rory said.  <br>\r\n\"And he should triple his size each time\" Oliver added.  \"So how long should it last for\" Benny asked the group.  \"How about twenty four hours\" Ethan suggested. <br>\r\nThey all agreed. With a huge grin on his face Kaz stood up \"OK grow me.\"  Ethan put a hand on him \"First I have to teleport everyone to different locations\" which he <br>\r\nthen did.  \"Now I will\" Ethan used his powers on Kaz \"You'll start to grow in five minutes\" and with that he vanished.

Deciding to stay, as he was going to go on a rampage he then sat<br>\r\non the couch.  Ethan had told him that it would take five minutes before he grew.  And those five minutes seemed to be the longest ever.  Kaz began thinking maybe Ethan had stopped time.  He had said he was a god, or maybe Ethan and the others had lied and they were holding Oliver captive.  It was very weird that only he and his friend didn't have any so called powers.  Maybe they were bad guys.  Kaz was about to get up when he felt a tingling sensation all over his body.  Looking at the clock in the room he realized that the five minutes had passed.  With a sigh of relief that It wasn't a trap he began to expand upwards and outwards.  He broke through the ceiling of the house as he reached the height of 100 feet.  The ruins of the house lay scattered among his giant shoes.  Looking down at the wreckage he had caused he did a little joyful hop.  Which caused a small tremor which then caused a bunch of cars alarms to go off.  He thought he would feel different, yet he felt the same it was if he was normal sized and everything else had shrunk.  He didn't want to dwell on it as he had to go hunting for the others.  Now where to start, he scratched his head and went. </span></div></div>",

If they were in a parallel universe then that might mean they're other versions of them.  His mind began racing<br>\r\nwith the thoughts of another person like him, or like Kaz.  As he thought of Kaz his mind got locked on his friend.  For some odd reason he just couldn't stop thinking<br>\r\nabout him.  Ethan was at the school, sitting in an empty classroom.

Scanning the other one Chase discovered that he wasn't Kaz.<br>\r\n  Then who was he, he wondered.  Kaz almost fell over when he almost ran into himself.  \"Hey, did I just copy myself somehow\" he asked aloud?  His doppleganger looked<br>\r\naround at the small buildings and small people and small cars.  \"where am I, and why is everything so small.\"  Kaz sighed  as he sometimes had a hard time understanding<br>\r\nthings now he had to explain it to himself.  \"well Kaz\" he began.  \"Wait why did you call me Kaz\" the boy asked confused?\"  \"Because that's our name\"Kaz answered. <br>\r\n\"My name is Gabe\" not Kaz told Kaz.  Gabe turned out to quite smart as he understood what Kaz told him about the game.  The only thing Kaz couldn't tell him was how he got<br>\r\nsuddenly appeared.  Both Kaz and Gabe slowly began to step on cars and rip apart houses.  This had the cause of people running in terror.  Gabe watched all the fleeing<br>\r\npeople run away from them.  The fact that he was a 100 foot giant was starting to cause some stirrings in his nether regions.  Looking down he saw a teenager crouching<br>\r\nbeside a car.  Biting his bottom lip he raised his right foot over the boy then stepped on him. Chase was to busy watching Kaz that he totally forgot about the other one.<br>\r\nGabe felt a rush of pleasure as he stepped on the boy.  His pants tented as he felt himself getting bigger.  He then noticed not only was growing down there but everywhere.<br>\r\n  He and Kaz were both 300 feet tall. \"What just happened\"  Kaz asked?\"  \"I think I killed one of the players\" Gabe told him.  \"I wonder who it was\" Kaz said aloud.<br>\r\n\"I didn't really get a good look at him, but he should come back as you explained to me, so if I recognize him I'll show him to you.  </span></div></div>",

It may have been the fact that Gabe looked <br>\r\nlike him, but he found his double very attractive. Or maybe he just thought that he himself was that good looking.  He finally <br>\r\nnoticed that the other giant boy was staring at him worriedly.  \"Are you OK\" Gabe asked? taking a step back which caused <br>\r\nhim to crush a car that was trying to drive away.  This ended up causing Gabe to once again pitch a tent in his pants.<br>\r\n  \"You're a crusher\" Kaz exclaimed getting excited, but not as excited as Gabe was.  \"What are you talking about\" Gabe<br>\r\nanswered nervously.  \"You get turned on by stepping on tiny things\" Kaz smiled as he pointed to the other's crotch.<br>\r\n  Gabe gave a slight blush \"It's not just stepping on them\" he coyly stated.  Kaz looked around until he spotted the mall<br>\r\ntaking a few steps towards it.  He tore off part of the roof which made most of the people inside who hadn't noticed<br>\r\nthe two giants outside to flee.  All except one person, Adam was so engrossed in eating his incredible edibles that he<br>\r\nhad failed to notice the sudden hole in the ceiling, or the giant hand that grabbed him.  Kaz had grabbed the only person<br>\r\nwho hadn't run away.  Bringing him close to his eyes he saw that it was Adam.  \"Hey it's Adam\" he told Gabe as he held him<br>\r\nout to the boy to get a good look at.  \"Was he the one you stepped on\" he asked?  Gabe pursed his lips as he thought about<br>\r\nit \"No, he was shorter and had brown hair\" \"That must have been Chase\" Adam told them both.  \"So you stepped on one of <br>\r\nthem how would you like to crush one with that hot bubble butt of yours\" Kaz licked his lips in anticipation.  \"Don't you<br>\r\nwant to do the honors\" \"You have the same type of butt that I do\" Gabe was getting more comfortable with Kaz's attraction <br>\r\nto him.  \"No, you're the crusher, and I know you want to use those hot cheeks of yours to squeeze the life out of him.<br>\r\nGabe turned around which was all the answer Kaz needed as he gently held Adam between his thumb and forefinger.  Once he <br>\r\nfelt that Gabe had a hold of the tiny boy he let go withdrawing his fingers from the hotness of Gabe.  The giant boy <br>\r\nclenched both cheeks trying to crush his victim between the two fleshy mounds.  Luckily for Adam he had his bionic strength<br>\r\nso it was proving to be a bit difficult for the giant.  Kaz watched in amusement as Gabe strained mightily.  Gabe was struggling<br>\r\nso hard that he was surprised when he let out a monstrous fart.  Which enabled him to finally crush Adam. This made both<br>\r\nboys to grow once again reaching 900 feet.  \"Did you crush him or suffocate him with that awesome fart\" Kaz was grinning as he<br>\r\nhigh fived Gabe.  \"And I thought mine were atomic.\"  Gabe felt pretty good that his gas may have killed someone.  \"So <br>\r\nsince I've already proven to be deadly to the little players.  I think you should finish off the next 2 as you are the<br>\r\nmain player in this.\"</span></div></div>",

As Gabe was pondering what to do he could feel Kaz growing stiff beneath him giving him an idea.  \" How about we place him on one of our cocks and the other sucks\" he grinned as Oliver grew white with fear.

Kaz tore off his pants then his underwear in record time.  \"Wow\" Gabe gasped as Oliver was struck speechless.  Kaz was a bigger boy than him but the size of his penis was just amazing.  Oliver seemed to blink and was placed on the tip of his friends cock.  Kaz felt so amazing just with his diminutive friend on his tip.  Looking at Oliver staring at him \"Worship me\" he commanded.  Oliver just stood scared to move and afraid of what was coming over Kaz.  \"I'll worship you\" Gabe told Kaz.  Oliver looked up as Gabe's mouth descended upon him.  Kaz watched as Oliver then the top of his cock were both inside Gabe's mouth.  Oliver was inside the warm moist cavern of Gabe's mouth.  He could feel as the tongue gently slid over him caressing him.  Kaz began to run his hand through Gabe's hair eyes locking as he began to thrust into the mouth.  It felt so wonderfully amazing that he couldn't hold on as he released his load.  Gabe was taken a back by the force as he almost chocked for a second.  Gulping quickly he didn't even feel when Oliver slid down with Kaz's cum.  After Kaz was done and Gabe wiped his lips he sat back patting his belly.  \"I think your friend likes his new home\" Gabe burped slightly.  Kaz smiled at the thought of Oliver in there.  After a few moments Gabe  said to Kaz \"Oliver might like his new home, but it loves him so much it wants to make him part of the foundation.  Kaz was confused as Gabe said this.

Hey since I\u2019m here wanna play some games upstairs?\u201d Ethan asks, \u201cya that sounds great. I will just wait here for the pizza looking over spells in the mean time, set up the game for me will you.\u201d Benny says more cheerfully. After a while Benny hears Ethan playing a fighting game upstairs while Benny is trying to find out where he went wrong all the while groaning with ever growing hunger, when suddenly he hears the door bell ring. Benny heads to answer the door and sees a 17 year old, 6\u2019 2\u201d, toned delivery guy. Benny thinks he recognizes him from the basketball team, but as the pizza guy is speaking Benny can\u2019t hear him over the groan of his stomach, it\u2019s all he can think about.

With newfound strength benny openes his mouth and closes it around the pizza guys head. With the first big gulp Benny feels the guys head get pulled by his throat muscles which is immediately satisfying for Benny. More and more of this poor soul gets swallowed up by Benny expanding Benny\u2019s throat and stomach as more of this guy is pulled in. Finally Benny swallows up the rest of the pizza guy felling his feet descend to his stomach. Benny comes to his senses again realizing what he had just done. \u201cOh geez! What did I just do!\u201d The imprints of the pizza guy push out as it seems he is trying to escape with no avail. Benny moans as he feels the guy move inside of him, it was such a powerful dominant feeling to have a guy hopelessly squirm in him. In this pleasure Benny feels hot and begins to sweat as suddenly his stomach shrinks and an energy coming from his stomach move to his balls, all the while a different energy flowing through all of his body. Benny immediately begins to grow taller adding 2 inches totaling 6\u201d 2\u2019 for his total hight. Benny\u2019s stomach shrink then tighten forming a 6 pack abs, his biceps grow larger, his legs grow slightly thicker to acomodas-te the new weight. Then the heat subsided and Benny realized what happened. \u201cI just digested a guy and absorbed him mass for muscle. But what was that other energy?\u201d Benny immediately goes to his book and realizes his mistake. The spell he cast wrong instead backfired onto him with a similar spell. The spell called \u201cdomination dominion\u201d the spell allows the person to swallow whole any human and absorb there mass for muscle and hight while their soul is trapped inside the balls of the person aiding in filling the persons strength. Benny is shocked at first but feeling the pizza guys soul squirm in his balls makes him smile. \u201cThis could actually be good, I always felt like I\u2019m the alpha in this town now I can prove it. And grow bigger while doing it.\u201d</span></div></div>",
