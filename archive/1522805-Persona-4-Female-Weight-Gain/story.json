And while she had been putting on a brave face for all her friends, deep down she missed her friend. Without him she didn't even enjoy training anymore. So instead she spent most of her free time at home watching her kung fu flicks and snacking away. After school she'd go out for steak, even when nobody else came with her. It had only been two months since her friend left, but Chie had already put on twenty pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer other friends were really starting to worry about her, partly because she didn't even seem to notice that anything was wrong. She still acted like the same energetic tomboy she had always been when she was around them, so it was most likely that this gain was subconsious in nature. And she still wore the exact same clothes, only now her newly formed pudgy stomach was poking out underneath her green jacket and her skirt was getting really tight. But even with these changes to her wardrobe she didn't notice anything different about herself. She just kept saying her mom shrunk her clothes in the wash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day her friend Yukiko finally worked up the courage to talk to Chie about it and invited her to Junes for steak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Yukiko you shouldn't have,\" said Chie as she waited at the table for their meal to be ready.<br>\r\n\"It was my pleasure,\" she answered as she worried how much this was going to set her back.<br>\r\n\"So, what did you want to talk to me about,\" asked Chie as she looked back to see if their food was ready.<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, right.\" Yukiko wondered how she should aproach the subject. \"Well, I just wanted to know how you've been.\"<br>\r\n\"Me, I'm great. You know me, always ready for anything. I mean I got a little depressed yesterday because I tried on my summer uniform, seeing as how we'll have to break them out soon.\" Chie paused for a second to look back at the resteraunt counter again.<br>\r\n\"Oh really,\" said Yukiko, wondering if Chie was about to say what she thought she was going to say.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and you won't believe it, but my mom shrunk that uniform too,\" said Chie as she dropped her head down, causing a small double chin to appear. Yukiko sighed, realizing she had assumed right. \"I mean, seriously,\" said Chie, \"the buttons would barely connect. I thought they were going to pop off.\"<br>\r\n\"Right, um, well...\" Yukiko decided this was the time to speak up.<br>\r\n\"Ooh, steaks done,\" said Chie as she jumped up and ran over to the counter. Yukiko just sighed again. Chie quickly returned holding two trays, one with one steak for Yukiko, and the other with three steaks for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

She couldn't keep lying to her like this, it just wasn't right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie,\" Yukiko began gently, reaching across to wrap both of her hands about Chie's slightly chubbier ones, \"I don't think that it's your clothes that have been shrinking. I think that.. well.. I know that you've put on some weight. Since Souji-kun left.\" Chie's eyes widened, a startled flush sneaking across her cheeks at the mention of their leader's name. She looked down with a frown at herself, even she couldn't pretend to not notice the way her stomach bulged out against her green jacket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man,\" Chie whispered as she ran her fingers down the straining zip, able to feel the rise of flesh billowing out to stretch the material to it's very limits, \"I really have packed on the pounds, huh?\" she sounded so dejected, Yukiko moved around to hug her pudgier friend about the waist, resting her head down to her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Chie.. it's not your fault,\" Yukiko insisted as she stroked through her friend's hair, \"Sometimes these things just happen. I can help you lose it, if you want?\" she added, Yukiko was always paranoid she would lose her own slender figure, getting in shape with her best friend was something she could see herself being more than interested in, \"What do you say?\" Chie looked up a little bashfully at her friend, before giving a relieved burst of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, Yukiko.. how do you always know how to cheer me up?\" Chie exclaimed, her bright smile showing the hints of a double chin underneath her own, \"You really mean it? Hey, maybe we can train together. Or,\" she added after a moment, Yukiko didn't look all that keen on the idea of getting even the slightest hint of muscle, \"We could try something else?\" Yukiko touched a finger to her chin, before nodding suddenly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They've opened the new swimming pool at the leisure centre,\"  Yukiko reminded Chie, swimming was supposed to be amazing for losing the pounds, \"Or there's a new dance class that would could try.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chie could only see how much weight she had gained when it came to pulling on her bikini underneath her clothes that bright Sunday morning. She had struggled to fit the top of the bikini about her slightly fuller breasts, and the straps had dug tightly into the softer flesh of her shoulders. The bikini briefs were pinching at her fleshier sides, and were struggling to contain her rounder behind. But that was nothing compared to her stomach. Chie groaned as she examined it in the mirror, her stomach was now round and fat, and stuck out over the waistband of her briefs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man,\" Chie whined as she felt over her stomach, \"I look like I'm pregnant. How come I didn't even notice this before?\" She moved closer to the mirror, even her thighs were brushing closer together now, her knees dimpling a little from the extra flesh. There was no words for it, Chie thought a little miserable, she was chubby. Gone was the toned muscle she worked so hard for, replaced with softer flesh that seemed to jiggle with just the smallest movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I just have to try and swim it away,\" Chie decided with a sigh as she pulled up her denim skirt over her fuller thighs, struggling to even get it to her hips, let alone attempting to do it up. The gap between the button and the hole seemed bigger than ever, and after a few struggles, she gave up completely. She pulled on a long tank top that only emphasised her stomach, but covered up the fact that her skirt would no longer do up about her chubby waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that her cell phone jingled to life. </span></div></div>",

She could feel her stomach pushing against her lap, and her chubby cheeks flushed as she looked pointedly away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Souji's voice was as deep and warm as it had ever been, \"This is the first free day I've had in a while. What's up?\" Chie twiddled her fingers against one another, usually she had no problem with talking to Souji so honestly and openly, but now she was suddenly unsure of what to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing much,\" Chie chirped after a moment, \"Just school and stuff. Must be hard getting used to life away from Inaba, huh?\" she teased him good naturedly, \"I bet you miss the steak croquettes and the Junes meat platter?\" Damnit, she felt her stomach growl at the thought of that food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little,\" Souji admitted, \"Not as much as I miss all of you. Especially you, Chie,\" Chie felt her cheeks go red as she listened to him, her heart racing a little more, \"I'm coming back for the summer holidays in a couple of months. I wanted to let you know first.\" Chie felt her heart soar for a brief moment, only to fall on seeing how fat she looked in the mirror. She couldn't let Souji see her like this. She had to get toned, and she had to do it as soon as she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Souji!\" Chie smiled brightly, the hint of her double chin showing, \"Just let me know what day and time, and I'll be there!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they had said their goodbyes and hung up, she was left with the worry of how to get in shape before Souji returned. </span></div></div>",

She had gotten the same phone call as Chie had, but she had received it a good half an hour later. Given the text she had gotten from Yosuke, it meant that she was the third person Souji had thought to contact. Yukiko's dark eyes glistened as she dropped her cell phone wordlessly against the bed. She loved Souji with all of her heart, and he chose Chie over her? The slightly cruel edge of Yukiko rose it's head, the darker side that the gentle natured girl did her best to keep in check. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut every now and then she would lash out. She had punched Kanji for having a nosebleed. She had kicked Yosuke because she had misunderstood what he had said. Yukiko's cruel side was very small, but it would show up now and again to protect herself. Like now. Yukiko wiped a hand over her eyes, before gazing to the photo booth picture of herself and Chie pinned up at the corner of her mirror. They were smiling, arms about one another, beaming at the camera. It was back when Chie was still her toned, slender self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko was at a loss.

She'll like being fatter. I know it.\" She pulled out a bandage from her belongings, and quickly slipped it over her wrist. She fixed it into place, before returning to pick up her cell phone from the bed. \"Souji doesn't want to me with her,\" Yukiko added in that same, soft tone, \"I'm just doing him a favour too. I'm not hurting them at all.. I would never do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scrolled through the phone towards Chie's number, before calling it. It was only minutes later that Chie picked it up, and Yukiko felt a brief twinge of annoyance on hearing how happy her tone was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Yukiko!\" Chie greeted her through the cell, \"So, are you ready to go?\" Yukiko leant back a little, before resting her bandaged arm against her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh.. no,\" Yukiko spoke softly, \"I hurt my wrist.. I don't think I can manage swimming. But do you think we could do something still?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Yukiko,\" Yukiko could hear the note of disappointment in Chie's voice, as well as the concern, \"Well sure, we can do something else. What did you have in mind?\" Yukiko looked about her room for inspiration. Exercise was out of the question, she didn't want Chie to lose any weight if she could help it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was thinking that we could..\"</span></div></div>",

I know it isn't as good as swimming, but it is starting to rain, after all.\" Chie made a soft tutting sound at the other end of the phone, before giving a soft laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, Yukiko. We could watch one of those romance films you keep telling me to try?\" she responded teasingly, \"I'll be over in a little bit. Just rest your arm, okay?\" With that Chie hung up, and Yukiko smiled slowly to herself as she sat up. It was going to be an ample opportunity to try and get her friend fattened up, but she had to work fast to get things ready before Chie got there. With that Yukiko disappeared downstairs to get what supplies that she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she led Chie up about forty minutes later, Yukiko's room was almost filled with fattening snacks and treats. Chie whistled as she walked into the room, her gentle brown eyes wide as she studied her friend's usually neat and pristine room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Yukiko,\" Chie commented as she looked around, \"What's with all the junk food?\" Yukiko followed after her, just giving Chie a sweet smile as she sat down on the edge of her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we had this left over from a party,\" Yukiko lied effortlessly, feeling the mattress dip considerably as Chie sat down next to her, \"It's only going to be wasted if we don't eat it.\" As she set the DVD player up, Yukiko noticed with some amusement that Chie had already opened a packet of chips, and was starting to eat them. It was going to be a lot easier than she thought, Yukiko thought to herself with a smile as she sat down next to her chubby friend again. Chie was doing all of the work for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an hour into the movie that a very stuffed Chie fell asleep. Yukiko looked over at her, watching in morbid fascination at the way Chie's bloated stomach rose and fell in her sleep. Her tank top was starting to pull even further against the excess flesh, and it was starting to rise up slightly. Yukiko looked over in thought, Chie was a notoriously deep sleeper. She took a a chocolate from the half empty bag that Chie had started, gently hovering it over Chie's half open mouth, before gradually lowering it in; she didn't want to risk choking her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie gasped a little, but didn't wake, instead smiling as she ate the chocolate in her sleep. Yukiko watched with a small smile, before ignoring the film completely, dropping another chocolate down into Chie's awaiting mouth. Chie happily ate every single one of them, only moaning or sighing softly. It only felt like minutes later that Yukiko realised that her fingers were now scraping at the bottom of the empty bag, and she tossed it aside into her trash can, pulling out one of the box of chocolates she had stacked up earlier. These went down a treat, Chie didn't seem to notice that she was consuming several more calories than she should be in her sleep, she didn't even stir when Yukiko moved on to the next box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later, and the film had ended, and Yukiko was left staring at Chie's bloated gut. The long tank top had long bunched up underneath Chie's breasts, exposing her tanned, rounded stomach to the world. It was very taut, packed with all of the chocolate Yukiko had gently guided past her friend's lips, not to mention the snacks Chie had stuffed herself with. Yukiko brushed her fingers against the curve of Chie's stomach, before pressing in slightly; there was still some room in there, and if she was going to fatten Chie up before Souji returned, Yukiko was going to have to fill it. </span></div></div>",

While she had stopped trying to feed her best friend up, Yukiko realised with some alarm that Chie was doing it all by herself. When it came to the day that Souji was returning, the members of the gang, that were still in Inaba, gathered at the train station to meet him. Yukiko swallowed. This was the guy that she had loved so dearly during the year he had spent with them. And while she loved her best friend dearly, a small part of her was hoping that he would be turned off by how fat Chie had become, and that he would be with her instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouji climbed down from the train onto the platform, rising his hand in front of his eyes to protect them from the sunlight. He could see his friends, and a small smile crossed over his pale lips on seeing Chie. He could hardly believe his eyes. She had changed so much, and it was all for the better. She was rounded out beautifully, a true butterball, and her big stomach was the most prominent part of her. While Souji was reserved most of the time, he moved to hug the shorter girl first, noticing with a thrill that his arms only just went about her, and sank into her soft flesh. Chie gave a startled gasp, and felt herself blush as she moved her fleshy arms to hug him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko hung back a little, watching as Souji greeted them all one by one, shaking Yosuke and Kanji by the hand, and hugging little Nanako so tightly it looked as if he would break her. When her turn came, Yukiko savoured the moment, hugging him back tightly for one last attempt at getting him to like her. But it was with the final hug that Souji returned to Chie, taking her chubby hand in his. Yukiko smiled a little, letting go of her jealousy on seeing how happy her friend was with Souji. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few days had passed since Souji had returned and for those days Chie seemed to be walking on cloud nine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery chance they had the pair met up, whether it was with the group or by themselves. Souji seemed to revel in his friends new form and seemed to be doing his best to add a few more pounds to her already generous frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course he didn't come out and tell her about his desires, but whenever Yukiko looked into Souji's eyes, she could see the same look that she herself held. A lust for seeing their friend grow bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with Souji working on growing Yukiko's pet project, it gave her enough time to work behind the scenes so that little Chie didn't realize just how large she was growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few new jackets here, some new skirts, and a few fresh pairs of panties and Chie's wardrobe had been supersized to fit the new Chie. With the new wardrobe and Chie being to ignorant to check the tags, she lost all thought about her having gained weight and instead got into her previous care free mindset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko meanwhile stood in the shadows, watching her friend grow larger and slowly outgrow her new wardrobe. The thought alone was beginning to ignite a fire in her, one which she had ignored for too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the days began to wind down, Souji received a call from home. He'd have to leave soon; so seeing an opportunity, Yukiko planned to have a small party with her friends. Making sure that everyone but Souji and Chie's invitation's were 'misplaced', they gathered for one last <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">stuffing </span>meeting at the inn.</span></div></div>",

The bottle was a small pharmesudical prescription bottle that one of the guests had left behind. Inside were close to 60 white tablets which held the power to chance how things were between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the party, Yukiko realized she couldn't deny hew feelings any longer. She loved seeing her friend become fattened up. Even more so when she realized that Chie knew nothing about her plight. Pound after pound had been added to the once athletic girls frame and the fatter she got the more her desires controlled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the party the skirt she'd personally bought for her new size just a few days ago popped a button. Yet Chie was so engrossed in her food that she kept eating onwards, disregarding the fact that her tight green panties were showing in plain sight of her crush. Said boy could only eye her crush lustfully as he continued to help her stuff her round gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko meanwhile sat back with a knowing gleam in her eyes. Soon Chie would be all hers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the food had run out, Chie had been too tired to get home on her own. Before Souji could offer his assistance, Yukiko offered a sleepover with her friend. With naivety, she accepted, and after nearly shoving Souji out the door, Yukiko helped her friend to bed and got dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh and what a sight her friend was now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to her comfort with Yukiko, and the fact that it had been a hot night that night, Chie had slept in her underwear, stating that \"mom must have shrunk my pajama bottoms in the wash... again...\" As the large girl fell into one of her deep slumbers, Yukiko took a moment to assess the damage Souji had done to her friends body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThick creamy thighs which once were toned with muscle lead to plump feet. Just above that were her green panties, stretched to their limit while trying to contain the large girls overly stuffed ass which was spilling out of the underwear regardless of how hard it tried. Her breasts which were once light and supple now spilled out over her new bra, the fatty globes looking to have sized up another cup since Chie had put on the new bra. Her face now sported a clear double chin and her cheeks looked as if they belonged on a chipmunk rather a human being. Lastly was the belly. The pale globe seemed to catch the light of the moon just perfectly as it hung over the girls panties. At one point Chie could have been called pudgy, and then a bit later chubby. But now she was plain F-A-T. Because of both Souji and Yukiko's efforts, the girls once prominent tan was beginning to fade, leaving her body a bit pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad Chie not managed to eat most, if not all, of the food, Yukiko would have gladly stuffed the girls belly more. But due to the lack of food, she had to get her kicks another way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a bit of her friends belly fat, she gave it a squeeze, marveling at how soft it was, despite her friend having eaten only a few hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the night, Yukiko fondled her friends sleeping form, doing her best to get her kicks while ignoring the fire that now burned in her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis lead to the current situation. In her hand was a bottle of muscle relaxants. Yukiko couldn't deny that she wanted Chie all to herself now, and didn't want her to even have a chance to loose the weight. She planned to use the pills to weaken her friends muscles to the point that she didn't have the energy to exercise. But how long should she do it?</span></div></div>",

The night he left, Chie came over to Yukiko's and buried her fat face in Yukiko's shoulder, sobbing so much that her fat body jiggled fiercely. Yukiko pat her back as gently as she could, feeling a bit of a thrill at all that fat that surrounded her formerly fit best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Chie. I'm here for you,\" Yukiko whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie just hugged Yukiko tighter and her sobs turned to sniffles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Chie's stomach rumbled and Yukiko smiled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was a large feast cooked by Yukiko, who had become quite the cook when she started her fatten Chie plan. But now she was cooking because she liked to see the look of joy on Chie's fat face when she saw just how much food was made for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're eating too, right Yukiko?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko nodded, helping herself to a large plate of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair managed to finish off most of the food, with Chie eating the lion's share, but by the end there were still five full plates of food, Chie hiccuping and groaning, pushed plate towards Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat up Yuki...I think you have more room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...Chie...\" Yukiko started to say. What if she got fat? What if Chie didn't want to be friends with a fat Yukiko?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the least you could do, after all the times you stuffed me,\" Chie said quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko flinched at that. \"What...what are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't, Yukiko.

Now I just...I don't know. I see you and you're so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what?\" Chie asked, scooting over so she was closer to Yukiko, her fat love handles pressing against Yukiko's skinny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie held up a fork with some steak on the the end of it, placing it in Yukiko's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beautiful,\" Yukiko said after she had swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie didn't respond, merely got another forkful of food ready to feed her friend.</span></div></div>",

Just keep calm and use your jacket as cover... We'll get out of here and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... But we just got the steaks!\" Chie protested, still taking off her jacket to wrap it around her waist. \"I'll be good for at least until then... Besides, the skirt probably just shrunk in the wash again. I'll ask Kanji-kun to fix it up later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko couldn't help but blink in confusion at her friend's choice...

This is of course to see what Chie does and maybe get a good idea of what kinds of food that Chie has eaten to get this way. Unfortunately, the only thing in the house is junk food, forcing Chie and Yukiko only able to eat those kinds of foods all night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOR<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Aftermath Hunger: Yukiko decides to call up Rise and Naoto in Inaba to talk about what's going on with Chie. While this is going on, the meeting takes all the way to Midnight, where we learn that there's an after effect for girls to enter the Midnight Channel, giving any girl an extreme hunger. And since Chie was the first to enter the weird world, she's the first to feel the after effects.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Chie had no idea why she was suddenly getting all this attention from her friends, but she didn't mind the free meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, finally its hot enough to try out my summer clothes,\" said Chie as she took off her PJs and started rummaging through her clothes. Normally she didn't care about clothes or fashion no matter what time of the year it was, but she knew that her mom hadn't washed her summer liesure clothes yet so they'd still fit. She was tired of being forced to wear all her winter clothes that were now three sizes too small. She pulled out her clothes and was so excited she did a little dance to herself in her underwear, unaware of how much her stomach and rear were shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled up her short blue pants and to her horror quickly discovered that they didn't go all the way up. \"Oh you have got to be kidding me,\" she said about to cry. \"Come on, come on,\" she chanted as she wedged the short shorts up inch by inch until it wedged snugly under her stomach. \"I guess it was just my imagination,\" she said unaware of the fact that her pants were now wedged far up her backside. She then moved on to her green tank top and pulled it over her head. The large arm holes and neck allowed her to slide it over her fat body as easily as it went over her thinner form. \"Now that's more like it, nice to be back in my old...\" she stopped as she looked in the mirror. Her tank top now stopped just under her breast, like she was wearing a green sports bra. \"Oh no. I can't believe it. Mom! You shrunk these ones too,\" she shouted downstairs as she stomped her foot and shook her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But honey I haven't even washed you summer...\" shouted her mom from downstairs. She didn't get a chance to finish as Chie shut the door, sat down and pouted. She had been looking forward to wearing comfortable clothes so much that now she wanted to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly picked up the phone and called Yukiko. And even though Chie had gone into one of her hysterical crying and yelling fits like she was known to do, Yukiko could still make out that she wanted to meet so she could talk in person. Chie hurried off to the Inaba shopping district and sat down outside the steak shop and ordered two plates to hold her over as she waited.

Yeah that makes sense, wouldn't want to set 'em both off on each other again by having them both meet up with you at the same time.\" Kanji agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That said, it should be noted that such a method may take quite a bit of time, as I expect that I may have to earn the trust of both girls in order to discover the cause of their conflict.\" Naoto briefly pondered the matter. \"I believe starting with Chie-senpai is a viable choice; seeing how she may be easier to accommodate so long as the possibility of steak is mentioned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that...\" Yosuke said, knowing from the several experiences of having Chie drain his wallet from unwillingly treating her to steak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With the plan set, all that remains is to put it into motion, I shall keep you two updated when progress is made.\" With a tip of her hat, Naoto left Yosuke and Kanji to make preparations for her impending 'investigation'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt; The front gates of Yasogami High, after school...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She should be arriving any moment now...\" Naoto noted, having investigated the Investigation Team prior to joining them during the murder cases of the previous year, Naoto had learned that Chie would often be the first before Kanji to leave the school grounds, assuming she wasn't accompanied by anyone else from the Investigation Team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the detective attempted to find Chie amongst the traffic of other students leaving, the search ended preemptively when Naoto spotted a distinctive brunette-colored, bowl-shaped haircut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, that must be--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto slightly winced at the sight of her kung-fu-loving friend, the sleuth recalled Chie's green jacket being a much looser fit on her figure, or the lack of pudginess that had formed around her skirt, which was to say nothing of the mass that her legs had accumulated that she was certain wasn't muscle. It seemed Yosuke and Kanji certainly weren't exaggerating about her weight gain. Naoto tried not to think about Yukiko's current state...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStay focused. Naoto urged herself, good detectives did not lose their composure around suspects so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective cleared her throat before speaking. \"Afternoon, Chie-senpai,\" Naoto greeted with a cool, moderated voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecognizing the voice of her friend, Chie turned around \"Oh hey, Naoto-kun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirecting her attention towards Naoto, the signs of Chie's increased girth had become more apparent, her rounded face now among the many changes in her image, the slightest of hint of a forming double chin present to the detective's keen eyes. Unsurprisingly, Chie's hips proved to have become wider than Naoto initially assumed, it seemed her lower half had received more than just its share of the pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... thought maybe we could spend sometime together after school, if your schedule allows it.\" Naoto offered, deepening her voice to a formal tone that had become second-nature from working in numerous police departments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie thought momentarily \"Well... okay! I'll hang out with you, Naoto-kun. Oh! But can we make a stop at the shopping district, I've built up an appetite for some meat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was... remarkably quick... Naoto thought, amazed at how Chie had almost immediately made food the focus of their meeting. \"Certainly, Chie-senpai.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk to the Central Shopping District was longer than Naoto would have liked, her unremarkable social skills made it difficult for the detective to break the silence without feeling tactless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... how have your studies been coming along?\" Naoto feebly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... I'm getting by.\" The brunette responded. Academics were obviously not a subject of interest to Chie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... how has life been for you?\" Too vague? Naoto worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So-so as of late...\" Naoto couldn't help but notice the almost-wistful expression on her face, it was likely she was dwelling on Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie quickly put on a smile upon sensing the detective's stare. \"O-Oh, but this is nice.\" Chie hastily added \"I mean, we never hung out together since last year, gotta spend time with all my friends, y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully this will be a pleasant experience for the both of us.\" Naoto agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That shouldn't be a problem. So, taken on any interesting cases since last year?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose there was one that stood out in particular...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto's worries about being unable to engage in conversation with Chie had been put to rest. Although still lacking confidence in her ability to tell stories, Chie seemed to be paying attention to Naoto recalling details from her recent investigations, the walk had passed by without much stagnation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like there's no shortage of work for you, Naoto-kun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will admit to it being a bit overwhelming at times.\" The detective responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, a break's always good every once in a while, speaking of which, looks like were here!\" Chie said enthusiastically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah right, we were headed here to eat if I recall, but where exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aiya's of course! It's almost been a whole four days since I've last been here!\" Chie answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four days...\" Naoto quietly repeated to herself, the sleuth was unsure which was more concerning: Chie eating at Aiya's on a near-daily basis, or her making a fuss from briefly not eating at Aiya's on a near-daily basis.</span></div></div>",

I gotta say, I'm a bit surprised.\" Chie said, looking impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I enjoy Aiya's beef bowl as much anybody else.\" Naoto stated as-a-matter-of-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but a large bowl? You can handle that?\" Chie asked, still in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see no reason why I couldn't.\" Naoto boldly proclaimed. In truth, the detective had never had a large beef bowl from Aiya, having found its regular-sized variant to be sufficient, but being intent on gaining Chie's close companionship meant taking a few extra measures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, guess there's more to you than I thought...\" Chie said in wonderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two orders of the Large Beef Bowl...\" The chef handed a bowl to Chie and Naoto \"Enjoy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, no use in me holdin' back... CHOW TIME!\" Wasting no time, Chie split her chopsticks and began digging her mound of meat and rice with fevered enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... undoubtedly.\" Naoto stared briefly at her bowl, a warm flush overcame her face, unsure whether it was the steam billowing out of the bowl or the detective's uncertainty of being capable of consuming the meal without so much as a stomachache if she was lucky...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Some brief time later...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, Aiya's always hits the spot.\" Chie effused, slightly slumping on her stool as she contentedly patted her stomach. \"Uh... you sure you're gonna be able to finish that, Naoto-kun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to Chie, Naoto was scooping up another serving of meat and rice, her hand slightly trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I must... consume...</i> Naoto willed herself, having finished a little more than half of the bowl, the sleuth had eaten far more than she deemed enough. which made the remaining food all the more dreadful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will finish this without hesitation.\" Naoto said in the most confident tone she could muster, wondering if Chie believed in her statement as much as she did. Lifting the chopsticks, the detective opened her mouth as she braced herself for another hellish round from the beef bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Another brief amount of time later...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geeze, Naoto-kun... I really didn't think you could eat all that...\" Chie said in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-of course I could, I-I gave my word after all, didn't I?\" Naoto mumbled, her mind in far too much of a haze to focus on anything but the unbearable aching in her stomach, almost certain she would vomit or burst in any second, whichever came first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you're not sick?\" Chie asked in concern for her clearly fatigued looking friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely n-- *<i>URPH</i>* --not, I'm simply... full is all...\" 'Full' didn't even begin to describe her current state, Naoto was grateful that she had opted to wear loose-fitted clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so.\" Chie resigned, stretching her arms as she eased herself out of the stool. \"Well, it was nice being able to spend time with you, Naoto-kun. We should do this more often, see ya tomorrow at school.\" Chie gave Naoto a friendly pat on the back as she made her way to the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll-- *<i>HRPH</i>*-- I'll be looking forward to our next meeting as well...\" Damned girl nearly caused the sleuth to forcefully regurgitate her current bane of existence. A few more swallows later, and Naoto was certain that her meal would now stay down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove all else, progress in the 'investigation' had been made, Naoto had successfully made the first step in resolving Chie and Yukiko's conflict. But for the time being, Naoto would focus her efforts on returning to the Shirogane estate, hoping her walk wouldn't too hindered as she perpetually clutched both arms around her abdomen on the way back.</span></div></div>",

You dare to make me think Souji returned!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my power isn't perfect, is it Tsukoyomi?\" Shin said a Persona flashing in and out of existence, Chie could only make one feature out of it, a mirror on it's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what? You have a Persona too?\" Chie said shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what it's called? Nice to know these things have a name.\" Shin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey that doesn't change my question!\" Chie shouted reverting back to her angered state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to know I'm the number one student in the First Year Classes Chie-senpai, of course you didn't care, no the only name you cared to see at the top of a list is Souji's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey call him Senpai too!\" Chie shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NEVER! That man...all you cared about was HIM! I'm nothing to you, yet I adore you the most out of all the students in my class, maybe even the school, when you were signed up for that beauty pageant I almost danced out of my skin with joy, finally I could have seen if you were hiding chub under that large sweater....BUT NO! YOU WERE SKINNY JUST LIKE THE REST!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You thought I was fat!? Oh that does it pal!\" Chie said trying to get into her battle stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie-senpai, you haven't realized it yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Realized what?\" Chie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing his Persona's power Shin transformed into a mirror image of Chie, who finally got a look at herself, but shook her head. \"WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TRYING TO PULL!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie my power is to become a reflection of what I see, and what I hear.\" Shin's voice was now a double's of Chie's!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No...\" Chie shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've become so big since Souji left, which I like, to be surrounded by a soft fatness, it's like being covered by a warm blanket as a child. I want more, to make you fatter\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're nothing more then a pervert that likes fat chicks! Cept I'm not fat! And how dare you kiss me!\" Chie shouted realizing she kissed him and spat randomly in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still delusional, perhaps...you need more truth...\" Taking a photo out Shin became a duplicate of Chie when she was skinny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My power isn't as strong in this world as it is in that...other world, but it should be enough, in this world I'm 25% as strong and fast as the person I copy, so if you lose to me then you should have no doubt that you're slower and weaker.\" Shin assumed Chie's fighting stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Million Kicks to the face, Two Hundred thousand for calling me fat, Three Hundred Thousand for being a pervert and kissing me, and Five Hundred Thousand for insulting Souji-kun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie has to fight the Doppelganger, but in her fattened state...can she really win?</span></div></div>",

The tree shook, but so did her leg as she struggled to not shout out in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay Chie?\" cried Yukiko as she ran up to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie bit her lip as her eyes started to water. \"Um, yeah, never better. You wouldn't happen to have a wheelchair on you, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later Yukiko had helped Chie make her way to Junes where she was resting her leg on a bench. \"You can't keep trying stunts like this Chie, you're going to break every bone in your body one day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee thanks mom,\" said Chie as she rolled her eyes. Yukiko frowned at her and poked Chie's foot, sending a sharp pain through her body. \"Okay, okay,\" she shouted, \"I know, I know I should stop. It's just, well I saw this movie last night and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Chie, not this again,\" said Yukiko with a sigh. \"I keep telling you, that stuff is special effects. Nobody can do all those flips and kicks and stuff, you've got to... Oh is that the time,\" she said noticing the clock on the wall, \"I, I forgot I'm suppose to be helping out at the Inn in fifteen minutes. I'm sorry Chie, I have to go. Can you get home okay or should I call somebody?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, nah, I can totally handle this,\" she said as she tried to hide the excruciating pain she was in. Yukiko was gullible enough to believe her and bid her friend goodbye. Chie sat there on the bench until she felt strong enough to stand. She limped her way out of the mall, but before she got to the exit she noticed her favorite DVD store and even though she had just been scolded by Yukiko for taking her movies too seriously, she couldn't resist the urge to check out if anything new had come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered around the store for almost an hour, and even though she saw several movies that she wanted, they were all too expensive. She was about to leave when she noticed a bargain bin where all the films were dirt cheap. She didn't expect to find anything good, but she really needed her kung-fu fix. However there was only one action film in the entire bin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Legend of the Fat Master?\" she uttered while looking the box over. On the cover there was an obese black haired woman, almost four hundred pounds, wearing a skin tight yellow jumpsuit. \"This can't be real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you had better not be bad talking the Fat Master,\" said the twenty something shaggy sales clerk. \"That movie is the bomb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kidding?\" she said with a cocked eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I kid you not,\" he said as he went into a mini-geek fest, \"it was shot with almost no budget, relying almost solely on the star's abilities. You don't see stuff like that anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's that great then why is it in the bargain bin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh,\" he said with a shrug, \"nobody respects art anymore. Well, that and people kind of frown on overweight action heroes. Now are you going to buy it or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie looked the box over once again, and even though she doubted how good it could be, she really did need a new movie. She bought the movie and rushed home (as quickly as she could on her busted leg) and plopped herself down in front of her TV. The movie's plot was fairly basic, a local noodle shop owner has her shop destroyed by a gang of ruffians and she decides to use her unique martial arts skills to fight back. There was only one twist, she was incredibly fat, which lead her opponents to always underestimate her. Chie's eyes lit up as she watched the action unfold, she had never seen anything like it. Even thought the heroine was overweight, she used it to her advantage. She rolled over her opponents, jumped off of high buildings and bounced off her stomach to safety, and plowed into her opponents with her custom belly punch attack. Not to mention, she had the same love of steaks that Chie had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is so awesome,\" shouted Chie as the credits started to roll. \"And the guy at the store said that this was all real, no special effects. Does that, does that mean that I could do stuff like that if I tried.\" Chie knew that gaining all that weight might not be a good idea, but it was like she always said, don't think, feel. \"I'm doing it, I am so doing this,\" she passionatly declared. The only question was how should she go about it?</span></div></div>",

Yukiko was surprised Chie was in such high spirits after returning from what must have been a reprimand.  It had been only little more than a week since Chie began her training, but boy, had it begun to show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is such a great day! Not only am I sure my leg's back to 100%...er, not that I was hurt or anything, I was fine!...anyway, not only that, but half of my teachers told me my skirt was too short today! I must already be getting in fighting shape!\" Chie raised a knee to begin a kick, then realized how little leeway her skirt would allow, and her shorts were giving her a bit of a wedgie, exposing some of the extra flesh that had built up on her rear end in the past week. Her foot returned to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...Chie, I know you went over the plot with me a couple of times...even while I was trying to study on Thursday...but don't you think someone who weighs 400 pounds would need to have really significant muscle mass to be in fighting shape? I know you want to start lifting weights today, but one day a week of it would really only make getting fat comfortable when you aren't exerting yourself...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on Yukiko!  I've definitely had at least as much fat as I've had muscle when we were...y'know...\" Her voice lowered a little. \"Actually fighting shadows and stuff....\"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko tilted her head slightly. \"But Chie....you weren't 400 pounds either...I'm pretty sure-\"   Chie frowned and placed her hands on her hips, which were flaring out of her skirt. She had finally found a form of martial arts that let her pursue her love of eating just as vigorously as the rest of her training, and quite frankly, she didn't want to give up such a wonderful lifestyle.  \"Yukiko.  Don't think. Feel!  I'm going to do this, and don't worry, I'll do this right!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie didn't admit to herself that not only did her body easily handle her increased eating with little discomfort, but that going back to her normal eating habits would take willpower she didn't have at the moment. <br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, Chie gave herself an examination in her room. Her thighs had gotten nice and meaty, but her belly had only jutted out slightly and formed only a few tiny rolls when she sat. \"Oh come on...I need an athlete's flab here! Everything she did, she did with her belly!\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie got off  her bed and pulled out an old pair of weights from her closet.  She worked with them for a about twenty minutes in her bra and black shorts. She could feel her rear end jiggling slightly as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew! Ok. That should be enough for today...\" Chie smiled to herself, proud of her little workout. \"I'm sure my belly will pass up my hips in no time! Its not like my ass is going to keep going like this, that sort of figure just isn't in my genes!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie could have sworn something put her momentarily off balance.Behind her, her persona, Suzuka Gongen, had flickered very momentarily  into corporeal form  and delivered a gentle kick to Chie's rear end. Unbeknown  to Chie's conscious mind, she had literally just kicked herself for concocting such a fundamentally, inexorably, and blatantly false delusion. <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Guess we're just both going to be fat and useless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie sighed before turning on the TV, what luck they were showing Legend of the Fat Master II!

Yes she was quite the mind blowing martial artest, it's a shame that in a horrible accident this great woman was lost.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A year has passed since the fog has lifted, and Chie Satonaka didn't feel as sunny as the sky above her. Despite the weather shifting to summer and the climate overall heating up, she was...drudging along as they say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the last year, ever since Yu left, the group has diminished in some respects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYosuke's dad managed to get a big time gig to expand Junes in Shanghai and thus had to move. Yosuke was bummed to move, and after many hugs, he reassured them all that he will email them and keep in touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanji's family also had to move, as their textile shop wasn't making as much business in Inaba as they liked, so they set their sights for up north. Naoto felt bummed as heck too. After a month or so of moving away, Kanji visited in April and revealed that he managed to get a girlfriend who was also into textile and sewing as he was, not to mention she had a certain grace about her only rivaled by Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto was even more bummed out...last time Chie has seen her, she looked...softer for some reason. She couldn't place her finger on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that left Teddie, who decided that he wanted to see the world, using the TV World to make himself a mass fortune to explore the many sights and sound of the human world, basically becoming a world tourist. Chie recalled that he has sent over half a dozen postcards of Hong Kong, Beijing, Tehran, and many more. The last one showed him in Egypt on a camel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Least someone is having fun...' Thought the martial arts afficionado. She turned to her computer after a long looking out to the Inaba mountain ranges and started up her email.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man. Life without Narukami-kun sure is boring...\" She said sighing...as she reopened her eyes she saw she had a new mail in the inbox. Clicking to get into her inbox, she saw the mail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>FoolYu@gmail.jp</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie felt her heart skip  a beat. It was an email from Yu! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the email, found out that he had mailed it out to multiple people as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo herself, DFighterGirl@gmail.jp, amagiy@gmail.edu(Yukiko), mysterprince@yahoo.jp(Naoto), and marusunQ@gmail.edu(Rise).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she began to read the contents...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hey guys! It's me Yu,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSorry if it's been a while. School has been dragging me down, but I managed to finish up my classes, and now I am free all throughout summer. I talked with Uncle Ryotaro and I plan on staying over for summer break. I was hoping that we could all get together. Me and Yosuke and Kanji have talked through mail and I tried to invite them but Yosuke has to take summer school in China and Kanji has his family business to tend to. And we all know about Teddie the Globe Trotter. I will be arriving this Saturday around 9 in the morning or so. After I get situated back with Uncle and Nanako-chan, then we can hit the town and have fun! Get back to me ASAP if you can<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarukami Yu</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie felt her jaw drop, eye twitch. She heard her phone vibrate next to her, her answering in a heartbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You get the email Chie-chan?\" Asked Yukiko's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette smiled. \"Well, we better take care then. It's been so long...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know...It's going to be great seeing Narukami-kun again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and me both sister.\"</span></div></div>",

It has been over a Year since Chie and the other's had seen him so Chie contacted Yukiko, Rise, and Naoto last night to See if the four of them could meet up at Junes to plan some idea's on what to do when Yu Return's for summer Vacation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie was the first to arrive at Junes as she was wearing her normal outfit of her green jacket with the single yellow line across her chest and plaid Skirt with black short's on underneath her Skirt. That outfit of her's was one of her favorite's as she always wore her favorite Jacket when she could as long as the weather wasn't too hot for it and wearing her skirt and black short's was something she liked to wear as well since not only did it show off her slender legs but also gave her more movement when she's outside jogging or practicing her Kung-fu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie walked over to one of the round table's that she and the other's use to sit at all the time during the whole incident that happened with the murder's and going into the TV world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko Was the 2nd one to Arrive as She was wearing Her red sweater, Plaid skirt and black opaque pantyhose. She had a Slender figure as she was always carefully watching her weight and tries not to go over board with eating too much food. She still wore her Red hairband as always as if it was apart of her. She waved over to Chie and Sat down next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise Kujikawa as Next to arrive as she was wearing an orange top and white pants. She had her Reddish brown hair tied up in pig-tail's like she normal does everyday and her carefree smile. Even though Rise was a famous Idol but took a small Hiatus after being saved by Yu and the other's, she had returned to work once the incident's were cleared but she always made sure to make some time for her friends when she could so she would hang out with them. It would only seem fit since she enjoy's being with her dear friends who saved her life after all. After seeing Chie and Yukiko, Rise went over to the table and sat down with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last one to arrive a few minute's after Rise was none other then Naoto Shirogane who was also known as the Detective Prince. Even though Naoto had that nickname, Naoto was really a Girl who chose to hide her real Gender by having everyone think She was a boy during the incident's last year but after being saved by Yu and the other's, She decided to reveal her gender to them But continued to wear her trademark blue pants and blue button up shirt with her blue hat as it was a outfit she was very comfortable with and hid her figure from other's. However, even though she was wearing her normal outfit, she seemed a little more softer looking then before ever since Kanji's move. She may have seemed to gain a little bit of weight but it didn't show much as she soon sat down at the table with the other girl's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Now that we're all here, It's time to discuss what we should do when Yu return's for summer vacation!\" Chie said to the girl's with alot of energy and joy in her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe that Senpai is really coming back after all this time. It's like a dream come true.\" Rise said as as she sat back some with a very wide smile on her face. She always stayed close to Yu Narukami as much as she could when he was around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we should start making some plan's on what to do when he arrive's. We can't let thing's be boring for Yu-Kun since we haven't seen him in a year.\" Yukiko said with her finger's crossed together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. So to begin with, how about a welcome back party for Narukami-san so his first day won't be Ordinary and We can get him a few welcome back gift's as well. Though i'm sure Nanako-Chan will be the one more happy to see him then us as well.\" Naoto said in her regular and relaxed tone with a small smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's right! Nanako-Chan has been talking about wanting to see him when we bump into each other at the park every now and then.\" Chie said as she normally see's Nanako with her father who is also Yu's uncle at the park When Chie goes out jogging or work out session's in the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then i think we should start by getting some cooking ingredient's together and prepare a big meal at his uncle's place so he can have something nice to eat when returning.\" Rise Said to the other's after thinking of it for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a great idea Rise-chan. Then we can go to the swimming pool the next day and then go to my Families Inn for some relaxation at our Hot Spring's.\" Yukiko told the other's her idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then i'll make sure to call Doujima-san to let him know that we'll be coming over very soon and about the party. We don't want to be a inconvenience for him and Nanako-chan after all.\" Naoto told the other's as she got up and pulled out her Cell phone to Let Yu's uncle, Doujima, about them coming over and having the party for Yu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's all set up for now. We'll come up with more idea's after the party and when we're at home.\" Chie said to the other's as they all agreed and got up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie and Naoto went to the Grocery section to pick up the ingredient's they'll need after Doujima gave Naoto some suggestion's of what to fix while Yukiko and Rise went to get some extra plates and cup's along with a couple welcome back balloon's as well.</span></div></div>",

For over a year she'd been trying to convince the school to open some kind of a fighting club and now it had finally happened. \"Let me see, let me see,\" she said as she forced her way through. \"What kind is it, karate, boxing, kendo?\" She made it through the crowd and looked at the sheet on the wall with the announcement. \"Sumo club?\" she uttered as she read it. \"What the, this isn't anything close to what I've been asking for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" said one of the students, \"apparantly some of the teachers are big fans of the sport.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie huffed and puffed to herself while looking at the announcement. She knew she shouldn't have gotten her hopes up. \"Well,\" she thought to herself, \"I guess it is a legitimate fighting sport, plus if this club does really well, then maybe they'll add other sports.\" Chie hated the idea of joining the team, but if she ever wanted their school to have a real martial arts team she knew this one had to be a success. And the only way she could guaranty that would be if she joined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to the try outs the next day and was handed her uniform. She went into the empty women's locker room and changed into the green sumo thong and tank top she had been given. As she looked herself over in the mirror she felt incredibly exposed and embarrassed. \"They expect me to actually fight in this, the bikini Yosuke gave me was less revealing than this.\" She thought about leaving and going home, but she just kept repeating to herself, you're doing this so you can get a real martial arts team, you're doing this so you can get a real martial arts team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked out of the locker room and stood in line with the rest of the students who were there to try out. She looked down the line and noticed that not only was she the only non-fat person there, she was also the only woman. The coach walked down the line, looking each student up and down until he got to Chie. \"Um, are you sure you're suppose to be here,\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, this is the sumo club right?\" she answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, it's just, well women compete in a different league than the men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" she said not seeing where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coach sighed and said, \"Well, it's just that you're the only girl here. And we can't really have a team of just one person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie was crushed, her only chance to get the teachers to start a legitimate fighting club and now it was gone. \"Wait,\" she said as an idea popped into her head, \"what if I can convince some other girls to join.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sure, but we'd need at least three more of them before tomorrow's practice if we're going to register you as a team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say no more,\" she said as she ran off to the locker room to change. The coach tried to speak to her, but when Chie put her mind to something, nothing could stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she spent the rest of the day running all over the school and town trying to find every large female student from her school that she could. Unfortunately none of them wanted to join, no matter how much Chie begged them. In fact when she asked Hanako to join she barely escaped alive, apparantly it wasn't a good idea to tell Hanako she was fat to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night Chie sat at home wondering what she was going to do. She had to find three more girls before tomorrow or else she could kiss her dreams of the school adding more fighting teams goodbye. But Chie didn't know anymore big girls, in fact the only three other girls she hung out with were skinny. \"Wait,\" she said, \"I'm kind of thin and they're letting me join. Maybe they don't have to be fat to join the sumo team. And sure none of them are really skilled in hand to hand fighting, but I could train them.\" Chie knew what she had to do, the next day at school she had to ask her friends to join the team. But who should she ask first?</span></div></div>",

She closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and said, \"Yukiko, please join the sumo team with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-what? N-n-no, are you serious?\" Yukiko was so shocked that she almost fell over. \"I can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, please Yukiko,\" said Chie dropping to her knees and bowing down, \"pleeeeeeeease, I'll be your best friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko froze and looked a little hurt. \"You, you mean we're not already best friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie quickly jumped back up, rubbing the back of her head in embarrassment. \"Oh, sorry, I guess that promise doesn't really work if it's already true.\" Chie took a big sigh and dropped her head. \"You're right, we are best friends, and there's no way I could ever ask you to do something like this. I'm sorry Yukiko.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie started to walk away as Yukiko watched her friend shuffle her feet.

More than likely thinking about her choice with joining the Sumo Team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were even a few times that Yukiko didn't realize that her name was being called out a few times, that made some of the class snicker silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater at lunch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Chie!\" Rise announced exiting the door that led to the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon Rise,\" Chie replied with a grin on her face as she lifted up a small bowl of instant ramen to Rise. She knew that Rise liked ramen since the field trip. \"I hope I got you the right ramen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks a lot sempai,\" Rise giggled taking the slightly hot disposable bowl. \"So...

After I took that time off and temporarily retired all these rumors started going around that I had had some kind of a breakdown or something, and, well, never mind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no what is it,\" said Chie, \"we're friends, you can tell me anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said Rise with a huff, \"it's just, um, you see I've heard some people talking about how now that I'm in high school I'm not unique anymore. I mean, there are tons of high school pop idles, but I was unique because I was so young. Now people just want to talk about Kanami Mashita, the new young girl on the scene.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well people that say stuff like that are just jerks,\" said Chie patting Rise on the back, \"the only kind of people who would go for a girl as young as Kanami Mashita are dirty perverted old men. And you don't want them asking for your autograph, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise cheered up and giggled. \"You're right sempai, I'll make it back into the spotlight my own way.\" Rise took a big slurp out of her ramen. \"But still, I wish I could think of something to make me stand out a little more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie perked up, this was her chance. She almost felt bad for what she was about to do, normally the only person she was this manipulative with was Yosuke. But now was not the time to hesitate. \"Well, what if you joined a club. You know, something that no other pop star is affiliated with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I see singers and actresses who play sports, or sponsor events for school clubs, so maybe if you found some kind of a club that no other pop star had ever been associated with you could start making headlines right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise pictured it in her head. As annoying as constantly being hounded by fans and the paparazzi was, she did miss it. And Chie had a point, this would certainly be an easy way to stand out. \"But wait, all the clubs we have at school are pretty run of the mill. I mean we have a few sports teams and a drama club and a music club, but there are already tons of pop stars who are associated with those types of things. Thanks, but I don't think that there's anything here that will make me stand out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie tried to hide her devilish smirk. \"Well, we did just open a new sumo club.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sumo,\" said a disgusted Rise, \"you mean that thing where sweaty fat guys slap each other around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not just guys, girls can join it too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Rise with a cringe, \"but would that really get me the kind of attention I'd want. I mean, who would want to see a pop star that sponsored Sumo wrestling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me,\" asked Chie as she jumped up excitedly, \"sumo is one of the most popular sports in the country. It might as well be our national past time. And yet no one person has ever been 'The Face of Sumo.' Imagine the kind of fame that would come with a title like that, nobody would even remember Kanami Mashita if you did this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Face of Sumo?\" Rise repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie could tell her friend was actually thinking it over, she just needed one last push. \"Hey, I'll tell you what. I know that you might think it's wierd or embarrassing, so I'll make you a promise. If you join then so will Yukiko and I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise's eyes widened and she squealed in delight. She jumped up and hugged Chie. \"Oh Senpai! You'd really do that for me. That is so nice.\" Chie was actually surprised that that worked, but she wasn't about to look a gift horse in the mouth. Rise spun around, finished her Ramen in one giant slurp, and said, \"But it can't be just us, it would feel like something was missing with just the three of us. We have to get the whole gang together, so can we please, pretty please, ask Naoto to join too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie couldn't believe her luck. \"Well if that's what you really want,\" she said with a sly grin.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly she remembered something that Yosuke had said to Naoto that was very effective. \"Yeah, I guess it isn't something you'd want to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for understanding,\" said Naoto as she stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a little too young,\" continued Chie, \"we wouldn't want you to get hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that,\" said Naoto with a cold tone as she stopped in her tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just saying it's not a safe sport for a kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't call me a kid!\" Shouted a furious Naoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko and Rise realized what Chie was up to. \"You're right Senpai,\" said Rise, \"I mean, I know that we're in the same grade and everything but I'm a few inches taller than Naoto, plus I'm stronger, I use to get a good workout whenever I danced on stage, so I'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have you know,\" shouted Naoto, \"that being short is an advantage in sumo, you can get under your opponent and push them back more easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think that's true,\" said Yukiko, \"I mean, I'm tall and I'm sure that I could easily beat you. Sorry Naoto but you're just not old enough to join.\" Yukiko tried not to go into one of her laughing fits. She still didn't want to be on the team, but she couldn't pass up a chance to join in the fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show you,\" said Naoto, \"take me to the team right now.

Naoto and Yukiko tried to hide their faces as they walked past, both of them thinking \"how did this happen to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the locker room the girls changed into their t-shaped sumo thongs and tube tops. Chie's was green, Yukiko's was red, Rise's was orange, and Naoto's was dark blue. \"This isn't so bad,\" said Rise as she looked at herself in the mirror, \"it's like a padded bikini.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't put it like that,\" said the embarrassed Naoto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on,\" said Chie, \"you'll get use to it.

She couldnt' stand the thought of seeing herself dressed like this. For years she had been so ashamed of the fact that she was a woman that she use to use bandages to make her breast look smaller. But now here they were behind a tube top and her feminine hips were on display for the whole world to see.

I don't expect to see you all tomorrow, but I will want a progress report by the end of the week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the girls scampered into the locker room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... With Chie getting a few glares from the other girls, \"Heh... well, might as well see what the weight classes are...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n/-/-/-/-/-/-/<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeight Classes for the Girls' Sumo Team<br>\r\n<br>\r\n180-195 lbs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n205-230 lbs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n240-265 lbs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n275-300 lbs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut...

The two girls turned to Yukiko and Naoto, wondering what they would say. But the two of them just stood there silently shaking with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Ahahaha,\" Chie laughed nervously. \"So, um, so who's going to gain how much? Maybe we should start at the bottom and work our way up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" said Naoto as she clenched a fist, \"I think we should start at the top.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" added Yukiko, \"you know, in the 275 to 300 category.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie looked at her friends as if seeing them for the first time. Naoto was normally so calm and collected, and Yukiko would never hurt a fly. Chie began to realize that maybe she had gone too far when she asked them to join. Meanwhile Rise kept staring at the sheet and thinking about her goal of becoming the number one sumo pop star. In order to do that she would probably have to dive into this head on, but did that mean having to completely sacrifice her figure?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, sure, okay,\" said Chie trying to calm her friends, \"I guess we should take a vote then.

Now even if they did get a real club, she'd be too out of shape to join it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko and Naoto saw how crushed she was, and even though they were still upset, they started to regret their behavior. \"Chie, um, I'm sorry,\" said Yukiko, \"but this was your idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus,\" added Naoto, \"logically speaking, because you're stronger than us you have more muscles, meaning you're already heavier than ther rest of us to start with. The three of us are each less than a hundred pounds, but you're already a few pounds over it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, thanks,\" said Chie in a clearly sarcastic and hurtful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie, I'm sorry again,\" added Yukiko, \"maybe we can get the coach to make an exception. Maybe he can get us each put in the lowest class if we protest, or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie was moved by her friends compassion, and she knew what she had to do.

Chie and Rise were ready for their meals to arrive and hadn't stopped talking since leaving practice, but Naoto and Yukiko hadn't said more than a few grumbles under their voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it's actually happening,\" said Chie to Rise, \"we've got a complete team, you're going to be a superstar, all our goals are coming together.\" Rise and Chie continued laughing and talking, unaware that this comment caused Naoto and Yukiko to stare daggers into them from across the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Rise and Chie continued talking, Yukiko whispered to Naoto, \"Hey, Naoto-kun, you're not really going to go through with this are you? I mean, you've got some sort of way of getting out of this, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto sighed and reluctantly said, \"I wish I could. But as soon as I signed that entrance sheet earlier today I gave my word that I would be a part of this team, and a detective is a person of honor who never goes back on their word. But you're in no such predicament, I would fully understand if you backed out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko began to think about it when suddenly the waiter arrived at the table with their meals, eighteen bowls full of steaming hot meat. \"What, what is all this,\" asked Yukiko, \"we haven't even ordered yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I called ahead,\" said Chie as she took out her chopsticks, \"I didn't want you guys to go ahead and worry about what to eat. I'm the captain after all, I should be taking care of these things.\" The waiter put six bowls in front of Chie, five in front of Naoto, four in front of Yukiko, and three in front of Rise. \"See, I even ordered different amounts since we each have to be in different weight classes. So don't worry about a thing, I'll make sure that we hit our goal in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-b-but this is insane,\" said Yukiko as she stared at the large amount of food in front of them. There was so much steam coming off the bowls that she could hardly see Chie on the other side of the table. Even Rise went quiet as she marveled at all the food. \"We only had coupons for for bowls at this resteraunt. We'll go broke from all this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukiko, didn't I say I had everything planned out,\" said Chie with a confident grin, \"it's raining outside, right? And that means that today is Aiya's famous rainy day special. This is this biggest meal, and if we can finish it then it's free. So all we have to do is eat all of it, and anything that isn't eaten we can use the coupons on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" said Rise feeling very unsure of the plan, \"I guess you did think everything out sempai.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't humanly possible,\" said Naoto in a matter of fact tone, \"the human body, especially ones as small as ours, cannot consume this much in one sitting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" said Chie as she started shoveling food in her mouth, \"we've only got two weeks until our first match, and we each have to gain a hundred pounds or more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That also isn't humanly possible,\" interrupted Naoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not with an attitude like that,\" said Chie with meat sticking out of her mouth, \"but am I the only person who's forgetting we've done stuff before that nobody thought possible. And besides, I refuse to let this team down, to look weak in front of the school, or to cause you guys embarrassment by losing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko wanted to tell her that the only embarrassment she felt was over having to put on a hundred pounds and wear a sumo thong in front of people. But then she saw the burning determination in Chie's face as she shoveled meat into her mouth faster than a person should. \"Um, Chie, you'll get sick if you eat that much, you should really slow down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie looked up and smiled. \"Don't worry Yukiko, I'm the captain. So if anybody has to get sick in order to meet our goals, it should be me.\" She then went back to eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko looked at Chie who clearly was one hundred percent focused on the task at hand. Next to her Rise was closing her eyes and slurping up the bowl in an attempt to eat as quickly as possible. Even Naoto was dining at a resonable pace, although she clearly wasn't enjoying herself. It was then that Yukiko realized that her best friend really did care about this, and that it was important to Rise as well. Even Naoto was taking it seriously, so maybe it was time to give up her lifelong diet. She picked up her chopsticks and dug in as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours passed as the rain kept pouring down outside. The girls had each gotten through about half of their individual meals when they hit a wall. Not even Chie could keep going. Their stomachs were clearly rounded and protruding, slightly lifting up the bottom of their shirts and forcing Naoto to even go up a notch on her belt. Chie looked at the three bowls left in front of her and couldn't believe she could only eat three of them. Granted she had never tried to eat more than one at a time, but she could always do that so easily so she figured six would be fine. Clearly she was wrong, it was like these bowls were gateways to the meat dimension. She looked around at all her friends who were each moaning and rubbing their stomachs. She realized what she had to do.</span></div></div>",

Her arm started to rise up, almost as if it was on autopilot, she wasn't even looking at where it was going. Slowly the hand reached for her final bowl when Yukiko swung in and grabbed it. \"Chie, please, you look like you're about to pass out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iodowanasto,\" muttered Chie, dazed from the pain. She shook her head and got her thoughts together. \"I-I can keep going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto sighed, she had to admit to herself that for a brief moment she enjoyed seeing Chie go through this, seeing as how she got them into this. But deep down she was still her friend and nothing would ever change that. \"Come on Chie, our captain has to take care of herself,\" said Naoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Naoto,\" uttered Chie in disbelief. Che looked like she was about to cry and nodded, \"Okay, okay.\" She leaned back and looked at the plates still on the table. Yukiko and Naoto both still had two bowls left, and Rise had about one and a half. She was amazed that they came this far, not even Kou or Daisuke from the sports teams could eat more than one bowl, but her friends were so dedicated they had eaten much more. She was about to compliment them on their work when she started doing the math in her head. \"Hey, wait, we have four coupons for free bowls. If you guys can each finish one more bowl, then our entire meals will be for free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls each looked at one another and then at their bowls. They were each about to burst, but she was right. Finishing two bowls was clearly impossible, but getting just one more bowl down was a goal that might be in reach. Each of the girls took deep breaths in ordrer to psyche themselves up. \"Alright,\" said Rise, \"let's go team.\" She sluggishly raised her hand as if trying to give a cheer. Even this knocked some wind out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls started cramming food into their already stuffed stomachs. It hurt, but they knew that if Chie could be this dedicated, then they had to be as well. Even Naoto was starting to get excited as she saw the finish line in reaching distance. Chie sat back, patting her stomach and watching her friends as a feeling of pride washed over her. It took another thirty minutes but the girls finally started to finish. Rise (having the smallest amount left) finished first and immediately fell over, resting her head on Chie's shoulder. Both of them were so full they didn't have the energy to move her out of the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto was next, thanks to her understanding of proper eating methods and her determination, she was able to finish it without appearing to be in too much pain. \"Wow Naotooo, yooo rlly mmm...\" Rise couldn't bring herself to make any sense as she passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think what she said is that was really cool, good job,\" said Chie. Naoto nodded to them without saying anything. She might have appeared calm on the outside, but in reality her mouth was still full of food that she couldn't swallow yet, and she secretly had to undue her belt, hoping nobody would notice for fear of embarrassing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey turned to Yukiko who raised the final piece to her mouth, her hand shaking all the way. Chie could see that she needed help, so she worked up her strength and started cheering. \"Yu-Ki-Ko, Yu-Ki-Ko, Yu-Ki-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not hoping that we join in on that are you,\" said Naoto as she tried to hide the food still in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt might have been silly, but Yukiko actually did feel a burst of energy from this. She was able to put the final piece in her mouth and swallowed before falling back on the booth and letting out a huge sigh of relief. Chie wanted to applaud her friend and everyone else, but she just didn't have the energy. \"Okay,\" said Naoto, \"let's never do that again.\" Chie and Yukiko moaned in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aiya,\" shouted the owner of the store as he walked over to the table, \"that was incredible. I've never seen anyone eat that much before. You girls are going up on our wall of fame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko wanted to tell him not to do that, afraid someone she knew would see it, but she was too full to speak. \"Cool,\" said Chie as she took a breath, \"but could you do two more things for us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" he said with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First,\" she said with a pant, \"let us just sit here for one, two, maybe four hours.

Naoto sighed and placed a hand on her hip. \u201cI know one day\u2019s overeating can only affect body fat so much, but I already feel rather bloated. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready to surmount this dish, even after skipping lunch.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko nodded. \u201cI haven\u2019t even eaten since yesterday. That may have been the most I\u2019ve eaten in one meal in my entire life. I almost still feel full.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise and Chie tilted their heads; the thought of preparation for what would clearly be an overwhelming and limit-pushing meal had never occurred to them. \u201cMaybe I shouldn\u2019t have gotten seconds earlier, now that I think about it\u2026\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise grinned and turned to Yukiko and Naoto. \u201cYou know, since you guys haven\u2019t been eating normal food with normal fat content, you should be able to fit more of this super-fattening stuff-you really are dedicated to this!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto and Yukiko froze for a moment until a clearly gloomy Yukiko turned to her seat. \u201cLets just stuff ourselves and get this over with.\u201d  Yukiko glanced down at herself and mentally bid her figure goodbye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owner of Aiya nodded at the girls. \u201cTook me a while to find all of the ingredients, but in ten minutes you girls will be in noodle heaven!\u201d   As the broth was readied, there wasn\u2019t a single member of the group who wasn\u2019t suddenly hungrier than they were a second ago. The smell of what could have been a banquet flooded through the restaurant- evey sinful pleasure that could be distilled into a soup was represented. Chicken, beef, dumplings, and eggs were all represented.  However, when the bowls finally arrived, the girls were rather shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dish looked like a slightly golden broth with plain noodles with the occasional egg or dumpling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat gives? I smell meat!\u201d Chie placed a hand on her stomach, which was rumbling despite how well she had been fed in the last twenty-four hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto looked closer at the soup, and her eyes widened. The golden tint of the broth was from an alarming amount of fatty oil that was floating in their meal.  \u201cYou didn\u2019t\u2026.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owner smiled. \u201cYup! Every last ounce of fat and flavor, cooked out of the meat and into the broth! No drinks with this stuff either, it\u2019s for your training.\u201d   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? How can that possibly help our training? Soda\u2019s got plenty of calories!\u201d  Rise frowned adorably, clearly upset at being denied a sugar fix. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust enjoy. I\u2019ll be in the back getting more ready. Ring the bell when you\u2019re ready for seconds!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie was the first to dig in. \u201cMMMMph! Thish is fantashtic!\u201d  Yukiko had to wipe a bead of soup from her cheek as Chie ate and spoke at the same time.  Even Yukiko couldn\u2019t deny it though- it was heavenly. However, it seemed almost excessively salty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie finished her bowl first and rang the bell. \u201cThis stuff is fantastic, but why nothing to drink? I\u2019m dying of thirst!\u201d  The owner of Aiya smiled and placed mugs on the table. While he ladled both noodles and broth into the bowls, he was sure none of the noodles got into the mugs as he filled them with broth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise\u2019s eyes widened.  \u201cBut, what\u2019s the point?  We drink that and we will only feel better for a second, then we\u2019ll just get thirstier!\u201d    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto figured things out. \u201cAnd then we will drink even more broth to quench our intensified thirst\u2026\u201d    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie slammed her now empty mug down on the counter. \u201cRefill please!  -Uurrrrrrp.- So, What were you saying just now, Naoto?\u201d  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>-------<br>\r\nExcerpt from an old newspaper clipping concerning  Aiya's \"Special\" Ramen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n....though there are none of the aforementioned meats themselves in the final product, an examination of fat content clearly demonstrates they are far from absent. The broth is obviously filled with the grease and fat taken from severely overcooking various beef and chicken products. While run-of-the mill ramen is hardly a health food, typically running somewhere around 400 calories a bowl, this  frankenstein dish contains no less than 1600 calories in a serving. Even a cupful of just the broth itself runs a whopping 600 calories- with this much fat crammed into the broth,  the fried noodles of the dish are only a small portion of the caloric content. Considering the recommended 2000 calorie diet and taking into consideration that a pound of body fat consists of a mere 3500 calories,  any self respecting......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko managed to get to her third bowl before she caved and began drinking the extra broth that had been set in front of her. It all tasted so good to her usually fat-deprived pallet! She tried to be as polite and ladylike as possible with her meal, but her growing thirst made it harder and harder to eat at a steady pace.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto's calculated thought process set her eating habits from the start- this madness would end when they were properly fattened up. The fastest and most efficient means of doing that would be to play right into the dish's hand- after her first bowl she was sure to drink as much of the broth on the side as she could- her thirst kept her eating pace up even as her stomach started to fill up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise was quite enjoying her pig-out. With broth dripping down her chin, she brought bowl after bowl up to her face and gobbled the contents down. She was free from the restrictions of an idol's diet, so she figured she might as well enjoy herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile each girl hit the double digit mark for bowls and drank at least a dozen mugfulls of broth each over the two hours that they were seated at Aiya, all of them had stopped when their stomachs had become clearly round and visible through their school shirts, threatening to rupture a button. All of them except Chie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto, Rise, and Yukiko stared with near- religious awe as Chie poured yet another bowl of ramen down her throat,  noodles and all, sans chopsticks. Her mouth was dripping and a couple of noodles had landed on her school shirt, staining the fabric yellow with fat. She rapidly downed another glass of broth, stopping only to breathe and belch. Twenty minutes passed. An hour passed. Chie grew bright red, broke a sweat, and unbuttoned the bottom of her shirt to let her swelling belly breathe. She did not, however, stop eating.  She had reached her twenty-fifth bowl, with countless glasses of broth consumed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie knew she wasn't the smartest girl in the world, or the most popular. She wasn't even the most athletic or fit, even at her prime- her overly stretched skirt demonstrated several reasons why she fell short of athletic perfection. <br>\r\nThis though, Chie thought to herself, this was something she was great at. She loved to eat and the idea of eating like a pig to become good at a sport, a martial art of all things, was too good to be true. She was going to show everyone what she was made of- she was going to get into sumo shape and she was going to do it with more passion than her most ferocious training regimens. She had been preparing for this her entire life! No pain, no gain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour and a half after the rest of them had finished, Chie finished yet  bowl and let it drop to the counter with a loud thud. <br>\r\n\"Urm....-urp- I think I'll stop at thirty.....\"  Chie slumped back a little and rubbed her exposed stomach with both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of recovery, Chie  turned to the girls and asked:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I, for one, am glad you're our captain.\" Rise didn't say it was because that meant she wouldn't have to gain the most. Although she did have to admit that she actually enjoyed stuffing herself far more than she thought she would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto rolled her eyes and said, \"Well, I suppose the healthy option now would be to sleep and let our food settle. Even though we didn't eat as much as you did Chie-senpai, we still pushed ourselves to our limits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko yawned and said, \"That's true, I've never eaten like that before.\" Yukiko couldn't help but feel odd about the situation, she hated the thought of getting fat and ruining the figure she had worked so hard on her entire life. But on the other hand, she had never felt quite so free and unrestrained as she did when she was eating this meal. It was the first meal in years she had eaten where she didn't count the calories of it. And even though she was scared of the thought of how much she would gain after she went to sleep, she also found it a little exciting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then team, let's head on home and (yawn) get to sleep,\" said Chie as she struggled to stand up. She had the most powerful legs of anyone at her school, but even she was having trouble holding herself up at the moment. The other girls felt themselves growing tired at a steady pace and walked outside togethr. Naoto agreed to take Rise home since she could barely keep her eyes open, and Yukiko took the bus back to the inn. Chie went home and after a few minutes of her parents asking her what she had done to her shirt, she went up to her bed and fell asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she woke up she discovered...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chie rose groggily from her slumber. The morning light was streaming through her window- she had slept clean through the afternoon. She glanced at her alarm clock-It wasn't set to go off for another hour and a half- her copious amount of sleep allowed her to wake up when the first rays of light fell over her face. She rose to a sitting position on her bed, feeling a little more naked than she should- she glanced down - the thin tank top she wore to bed was stretched tightly around her breasts and midsection. The once-loose garment had risen up a few inches, leaving a strip of exposed flesh between it and her identically tinted (Chie always did have a weakness for green.) panties. Chie puckered her lips in discomfort before picking at her scrunched-up undergarments.  She then rose and walked over to her mirror, noticing how different her body felt in motion- she felt parts of herself touching other parts of herself, and the tiny, almost unnoticeable sensation of flab jiggling had developed in her rear end and thighs. She surveyed her progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing that caught Chie's attention was her face- she almost didn't recognize herself, as her cheeks had swollen and a double chin was beginning to set in.  Her breasts had swollen some, which she regarded with a twinge of backwards pride, as their newfound weight and roundness would clearly fill out her shirts much more noticeably.  Her stomach had become much more rounded and pushed forward substantially, and would clearly be even more obvious in her current clothing than her breasts...there was a chance it wouldn't even stay IN some of her clothing for long, judging by how easily it overcame her tank top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile most young ladies developing such a flabby midriff would lose their feminine waist-hip ratio, Chie's body certainly did not-  her belly looked as tiny as ever in comparison to the pudding-like strips of fat that were now coating her thighs. Her hips had flared out an extra two inches in both directions, causing her panties to cut into her waist, generating micro-rolls of fat just above the waistband. Her buttocks, which were never small to begin with, were slightly less circular- they had not only grown but thickened horizontally, as the perfect roundness of her rear end was only sustainable with a somewhat even ratio of muscle to fat- this balance was clearly no longer the case. Her panties had retreated to reveal banana shaped rolls of fat just under each cheek, and a third of her fleshy rear end was now exposed, her clothing unable to cope.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped on the scale. 140 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, just from one meal! This'll be easier than I thought!\" Chie was overjoyed that she was getting so fat so quickly- her training was paying off!  She was even more happy to find that she was actually quite famished- she was definitely in the mood for a nice, big breakfast, and was sure she would be ready for another tidal wave of Aiya's special menu item by the time the afternoon rolled around.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot stopping to throw anything else on, Chie went to the kitchen.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a few months since Souji (the main character) had left Inaba, and things had returned to normal for the most part. Yukiko was busy with school and her friends, and she now had a new sense of determination to help out at the family inn. But now that she wasn't running around fighting Shadows anymore, she had a strange unsatisfied feeling inside her. It was like there was something she now wanted, something new that she couldn't quite put her finger on, something she hadn't noticed until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne rainy night she was doing homework when she saw it was getting close to midnight. The midnight channel hadn't aired since they solved the mystery a few months ago, but part of Yukiko missed waiting to see what would appear before her. \"Oh, what the heck,\" she said as she decided to close the blinds and turn off the TV. \"It might be fun to pretend for a few minutes.\" She stared into the TV knowing nothing would show up, but as the clock struck midnight a fuzzy image did start to appear. She could barely make it out, it almost looked like a large blob. The camera zoomed in on the figures face, and instantly she realized it was her. It was Yukiko, but incredibly fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, what was that,\" she wondered as the image faded away. \"Was that me? But, the image is suppose to display our true feelings, so what was that suppose to mean?\" She thought about calling her friends to go investigate, but if that really was her she couldn't bare the thought of them seeing her like that. They already saw her dressed like a fairy princess and saying she wanted to \"score with guys,\" and that was humiliating enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day after school her friends wanted to hang out, but Yukiko blew right pass them, saying she already had plans. She headed to Junes by herself, put on her glasses, and jumped into the TV screen. She searched around inside the TV world, and it didn't take her long to find what she was looking for. She saw before her a giant castle designed to look like a cake and made entirely out of sweets. \"Oh great,\" she said feeling embarrased even though no one was around, \"again with the fairy tale stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran into the castle and hurried to the top. She saw a few shadows, but they were all fat and slow so she was able to breeze right pass them. She reached the top of the castle and walked into a giant dining hall. Standing before her was the figure from the screen. It was her alright, she was even wearing Yukiko's red uniform, plaid skirt, and black leggings. But there was one huge difference, this shadow version of her was three hundred pounds heavier. All of her clothes were stretched so far they looked like they were going to burst, and her stomach poured out under her shirt and over her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who, who are you,\" asked Yukiko.<br>\r\n\"Me,\" said the glowing eyed version of herself, \"I'm you, isn't it obvious? Or did my beautiful figure confuse you?\"<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about\" shouted Yukiko. \"You're not beautiful, you're, you're, you're a cow.\"<br>\r\nThe shadow laughed, causing her double chins to shake. \"But isn't that what you want. I know what you long for, what you've been craving. You're always trying to watch your figure, and you hate it. You just want to let go and eat whatever you want.\"<br>\r\n\"No, that's not true,\" said a panicked Yukiko.<br>\r\n\"Oh just think about it. You've already been down this road once before. You know we shadows tell the truth about how you really feel. And you know what happens if you deny us.\"<br>\r\nYukiko knew the shadow was right, they did only reveal the truth about people. But this still just couldn't be true. This had to be some kind of a trick by someone. Yukiko wondered what she should say.</span></div></div>",

Yukiko tried to fight back, but was still too weak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two princes tied Yukiko's hands behind the chair and her legs together, the shadow Yukiko laughed. \"Now, hopefully my new form will make you realize the wickedness that can come from being skinny. Because I'm going to make you face your inner desires no matter what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko kept fighting to break free as one of the smaller shadows returned with a giant wedding cake and placed it in front of her. \"No, I don't know what you're planning, but I'll make sure to stop mmfff,\" Yukiko couldn't finish her sentence as one of the princes shoveled a handfull of frosting into her mouth. The food was so creamy it just slid down her throat before she could spit it out. \"What is the meaning of ammph,\" once again the second she opened her mouth more food was shoved in. She tried to keep her mouth closed but the second prince just tickled her, and since Yukiko could not resist a good laugh she started snorting and chuckling while the other prince shoved two handfulls in at once.</span></div></div>",

She now had a second chin and the start of a third, all of which was covered in frosting from the endless supply of cakes she had been fed. Her stromach rolled out on top of her chubby legs, jiggling with each breath she took. She lifted her arms, which were now thicker than her legs use to be, and felt her body with her chubby fingers. She didn't know when they had untied her, but that wasn't important to her now, all she could think about was what had happened to the body she had worked so hard on. She had grown so large that she had ripped through all her clothes except for her bra and panties.

Mission accomplished.\" The shadow laughed to herself again, clearly enjoying her own game. \"Now run free and enjoy yourself, well, I guess run is the wrong word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, but where am I suppose to go like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's up to you, goodbye my dear,\" smirked the shadow as she turned her back to Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am, am I really free,\" asked Yukiko as she turned and looked at the door.</span></div></div>",

She sank down onto her bed that Sunday evening, clutching her bloated stomach with a groan of pain. \"Man,\" she sighed as she looked down at herself, \"Yukiko can really eat!

It was Yukiko alright, but her once slender body was gone, now she was nothing more than a giant ball of fatty folds. She was completely immobile, with her large stomach and massive butt spreading out on the ground so far that it looked like she was sitting on three bean bag chairs. Her tripple chins merged into her body, making her look like a giant gumdrop, and every inch of her jiggled as she breathed. On the ground around her were the shredded remains of her clothes which had ripped off long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chi-Chie,\" responded Yukiko, her voice a tad deeper than normal. \"You, you actually came to rescue me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course, we're friends so I'd...\" Chie tried to pretend like everything was fine but she couldn't avoid it any longer, \"Yukiko what happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko started tearing up as she told Chie the long story about how she had been force fed for days in this place and about all the horrible things her shadow had said. \"Wait,\" interrupted Chie, \"you're shadow said you always wanted to be fat? But that's ridiculous, I've never heard you say anything like that. You're always dieting to keep your figure. I mean, do you feel any better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no not at all,\" she said trying to shake her head, causing her chins to bounce up and down, \"well, I mean the food was good. And this chair is kind of comfortable...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Yukiko,\" said Chie rubbing the back of her head, \"what chair? You're just sitting on your butt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" replied Yukiko as she tried to figure out what to make of this relaxed feeling she was having. Could it be that the shadow was right? \"No, let's not think about that. We've got to get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" answered Chie without stopping to think about how they would move her, \"and then we'll work on getting you thin again.

That all depends,\" Chie growled, not taking her eyes off of her chubby shadow. \"Are you planning on stopping us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...

Their friends searched the midnight channel thoroughly for any signs of them, but even Rise couldn't pick them up with her scanning abilities. Rumours were rife that the two girls had been killed like poor Saki Konishi, despite their killer having been found and bought to justice. As time passed, gradually the small town moved on from the horrific summer that had taken a few of their own from them, and the girls faded to nothing more than a memory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYosuke eventually took over as manager of Junes, following his father's footsteps, and one of his first ports of call was installing a fountain in memory of those who had died that summer. He took a wife for himself, and began helping Inaba restore some of the beloved shopping district, working alongside the old stall owners to ensure that Junes could help their business, rather than hurt it. With time the shopping district began to bloom again, under the watchful eye of Junes, and Inaba went from strength to strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanji and Naoto ended up getting married one beautiful spring morning, and settled down in Inaba. Naoto continued her detective work, showing the world that not all of the greats needed to be male, and went on to found her own agency. Kanji learned to embrace his softer side, and took care of their children, all the while running workshops to help people learn the basics of sewing and darning. He took over the textiles shop after the death of his mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise went back to fame, but with a stronger set of shoulders to help her cope with it. She included her missing friends in her songs, and dedicated as many of her concerts as she could to their memory. Time went by, and she decided to turn her talent to acting, a lifestyle that gave her the chance to have a life outside of her work. She married a certain Souji Seta in her early twenties, and named their first child Chie. Souji remained in Inaba to help out Yosuke now and again, a part of him tempted to jump back into the TV, and continue the search for their friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep in the bowels of the television world, a candy castle went unnoticed. It's occupants were two massively fat girls, who spent their days eating and growing. Their bodies no longer resembled anything human, just massive blobs of flesh that were packed with fat. Chie and Yukiko only knew eating and growing fatter and fatter. Their supply of food was endless, the castle would expand every now and again to contain their massive bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes while waiting for the next mouthful of candy, their thoughts would drift to home. Then they would be forgotten with the sweet taste that flooded their mouths, and they would continue eating. </span></div></div>",

Unaware that as she munched through the treat, her skirt became a little tigher as did her green jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another hour and a half of pushing (and snacking), a larger Yukiko and slightly pudgier Chie were seated out in front of the castle... Both of them munching on some of the broken off candy castle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, that didn't last long - For a little while later, Chie was rolling Yukiko right in front of the three Televisions where they could exit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly Yukiko was obviously too big to push through the TV. Chie had to go through herself and get help... And that meant leaving Yukiko alone in the area...</span></div></div>",

Chie took a moment to assess her surroundings, it seemed that all of the treats around them would effect them in some way. It was just a case of using the right one to be able to allow them both to move again. The rounded girl rolled herself next to a bush that was sprouting two treats, candy canes and bubblegum. Which was she going to risk? </span></div></div>",

Chie looked all about herself, before up at the gaping hole in the ceiling, it seemed so very far away now. She looked around desperately for a tree that was tall enough for her to climb up, but none of them even touched the edge of the hole. She stamped her foot in frustration, before looking around for Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's so much fruit here,\" Rise mused as she crouched in front of one of the bushes, \"Do you think we need to do the same again to get out?\" Chie hesitated, they had only just slimmed themselves down to normal, and she could have kicked herself for not stuffing her pockets with more candycanes to help them out if they should get bigger again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".. we might have to,\" Chie admitted reluctantly as she studied one of the bushes, \"But you let me try first, okay? It's no good if we both end up immobile again.\" Rise nodded, and stepped back, twirling the end of her ponytail anxiously about her fingers. Chie looked over the various, fat fruits on offer, before taking a raspberry from the bush, and popping it into her mouth. It was sweet, with just the right hint of tang to it, and she found herself licking her lips once she was done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So far so good,\" Chie managed a weak smile over at Rise, before gasping as she felt something push inside of her. She gazed down at herself as her stomach began to slowly push out in front of her, the only part of her body that seemed to be growing. Her breasts filled out a little after a moment, but it was nothing compared to how her belly stuck out over the hem of her skirt. Chie looked down thoughtfully once the growth slowed down, touching her hand to the side of her newly formed stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this another weight gain thing..?\" Chie asked softly, before gasping as she felt something kick her hand, \"Oh...what the?\" her eyes widened, \"I'm... is there something in there?!\" She grimaced at the pain that shot up from her lower back, and moved her hand there to ease it. \"Rise, be careful.. I think these make you pregnant!\" She gasped as she felt another kick, trembling a little at the strange sensation. </span></div></div>",

Well, it was a little, Chie soon realised she had to waddle due to the weight pulling down at her stomach, and that her joints were aching a little from carrying the unexpected weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now what?\" Chie questioned as she looked up in thought, she had little idea of how being pregnant was going to help them get out of there, \"We've got to get up there to get to Yukiko but.. how?\" She rubbed the side of her stomach thoughtfully, as if it would help her think of something.

To his credit, the blond didn't seem to notice, and instead patted Chie's slender shoulder reassuringly, his trademark grin flickering over his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, yeah,\" he nodded, his bangs brushing against his cheeks, \"We got worried about you when you didn't show up for school. Long story short, Naoto suggested we came in here and.. well, wow,\" he rubbed the back of his neck, \"This place is really messed up, huh? It seems like all it wants to do is get you bigger.\" While it was hardly there, Chie noticed with some surprise that even Yosuke had a slight bulge to his middle that he didn't have before, and he gave a short laugh on seeing her eyes focus there. \"Uhh yeah.. came up against one of those candy shadows..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Yukiko?\" Chie asked desperately, \"Is she okay?

After having nothing to eat other than a liquid diet, designed to provide nutrients without adding the pounds, Yukiko slowly slimmed down by the day. Soon she was able to move around, even if she couldn't move very far, and even more weight began to fall from her massive frame. Before long it was the date of her surgery to help trim off the excess skin she was left with, and what fat they could safely remove. Another few months of rehabilitation and muscle building, Yukiko was finally able to come home, a lot sooner than anyone had ever expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko beamed as she walked out of the hospital on her own two feet, delighted at the simple feel of the sunshine against her face. She was still obese by many standards, but after resembling a mountain of flesh, she was just so happy to be able to walk again without needing a walking frame. She stretched her arms over her head, her blouse riding up to show off her fat stomach for a moment. She giggled sheepishly, tugging it down, before smiling even more on seeing who was waiting for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie was still younger than she should have been, fortunately since her mind was still that of a sixteen year old, they hadn't dropped her down to middle school. She had given birth safely, and was now holding a sleeping one year old child to her chest. The doctors had checked the child over, but had agreed that like Rise's group of children, he was surprisingly healthy, and surprisingly human. With that Chie had firmly decided to raise the boy herself, with the help of her parents while she attended school. She had named him Shinji after one of her favourite Kung Fu actors, and he resembled his mother a fair bit, though his hair was somewhat darker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chie,\" Yukiko beamed at her as she waddled over, cooing a little on seeing her sleeping nephew, \"It's so good to be free.\" Free was a loose word, Yukiko was required to go back to the hospital every month for a check up, and she was required to keep a physio regime in order to keep her body strong. Chie smiled brightly in response, hugging her son closer to her shoulder. Yukiko noted with some surprise that Chie had a small pot belly, the last time she had seen Chie, she was completely slim again. </span></div></div>",

Rise? Rise-chan? Are you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, she isn't here, she's in another room,\" said a voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's there?\" Chie asked looking around frantically. It was then that she noticed this room was full of machines and formulas that she had never seen before. Although, when she stopped to think about it, they did look familiar. \"No, no way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm afraid so,\" said a figure as it stepped into the light. It revealed itself to be Naoto's shadow, decked out in the same lab coat it had worn the last time they had encountered it, only now her detective hat was gone, and replaced with a large purple top hat that also reminded Chie of that one American movie she could not place her finger on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, but how,\" said a shocked Chie, \"we defeated you. And Naoto accepted you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh she did back then,\" chuckled the shadow, \"but we shadows can be recreated whenever doubt is felt. And once the murder investigation was over, everyone went back to treating poor Naoto as a child. She got angry, and she wanted to use her brilliant and creative mind to find a way to make them pay. So here I am again, running wild and having the time of my life, getting to play with everyone however I want, and boy do I have a lot of ideas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, what do you want with me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's not you, it's everyone,\" replied the shadow, \"ever since women learned that Naoto was also a woman, they made fun of her figure. They use to love it when they thought it belonged to a boy, but on a girl they laugh at her for it. So I want to show them what a true woman's figure looks like. Overrun with pudge and folds of fat. And boy, do I have a lot of ideas of how to make that happen.\"</span></div></div>",

For just a blissful second she could pretend that it had all been nothing but a bad dream, that she was still at home tucked up into bed. Then reality hit her hard, and she looked down at herself with a gasp. Shadow Naoto's bizarre experiment had actually worked. Her flabby, obese body had rounded out on all sides, her pale skin having turned into a rich purpleish blue shade. Chie struggled to stand from the booth she was now wedged into her, her feet were helplessly small at the bottom of the ball, and her arms had sank into her own flesh, leaving her hands uselessly waving either side of her rounded form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to get out of here,\" Chie murmured to herself as she continued to try and squeeze out of the booth, wriggling a little to get her near perfectly spherical body out of the increasingly small looking opening. She tilted forwards after a moment, falling with a cry onto her rounded stomach. She was much heavier than she had been expecting, and as she rolled helplessly on the floor, she realised that her insides were sloshing gently with juice. Chie came to a stop after a moment on her rounded back, her hands and feet dangling helplessly in the air. \"Ugh,\" she sighed as she gazed up at the ceiling, \"So much for getting help..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow Naoto chuckled as she stood up from the seat she had slept so deeply in, walking over to prod Chie hard in the side. Chie felt her insides slosh around, her skin remaining taut underneath that prodding finger. This made Shadow Naoto chuckle, and she began pushing against Chie to see how far she could roll her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it does work,\" Shadow Naoto mused as she let Chie go again, \"At least, part way.\" She looked up to check on the booth that Rise had been forced into, her eyes lighting up on seeing that a very obese Rise was spilling out of the booth, folds of flesh covering what little of her clothing remained. Rise's weight had gone to her stomach, a massive ball of flesh that stuck out in front of her, a smaller roll lining the top to rest her suddenly massive breasts on. Rise struggled on seeing Shadow Naoto looking at her, before whimpering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Rise whined a little as she struggled to free herself from the booth, \"Who do you think you are?! Let us go!\" She managed to get one shapely leg out of the booth, the generous curve of her ass cheek getting stuck against the side. Chie watched helplessly as her friend struggled, her eyes fixed on the laughing Shadow Naoto, who was slowly making her way to the booth. Chie looked down, noticing that one of her hands had rolled close to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long shot, Chie realised, but she could try and roll herself into Shadow Naoto.  </span></div></div>",

Her momentum picked up, and she sped across the floor towards the unsuspecting Shadow Naoto, sending her flying into the booth that she had just vacated. Shadow Naoto gasped, turning around fast, iron restraints wrapping about her ankles and wrists to keep her in place. She struggled, crying out a little as she arched her body back, her blue eyes fixed angrily on the rounded Chie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me out!\" Shadow Naoto demanded, almost childlike, struggling against the restraints, \"I need to finish my experiments! You're going to pay for this!\" She fell silent on hearing the machine whir to life, looking up at the digital display that proudly announced the transfer was beginning. \"Wait, no!\" Shadow Naoto pleaded as the machine began to do its work, \"No, I can't end up like that! Not me! I'm the scientist, not the experiment!\" Eventually her cries began to grow silent as the process took over, and she slumped against the side of the booth. Rise followed suit, and all Chie could do was wait, watching as the fat was transferred from Rise, into the Shadow Naoto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the strangest thing to watch. Rise's body began to lose it's folds, the skin shrinking back to her slender form, the excess flesh seeming to melt away to reveal the thin girl underneath. While Shadow Naoto was ballooning up with the fat that was being pushed into her, the once too big lab coat now filling out with rounded curves. Soon it was too small for her rounded frame, the sleeves starting to wrinkle and tear from the sheer amount of fat pushed into it. Chie watched in morbid fascination as Shadow Naoto slowly filled more and more of the booth, jumping a little as the machine pinged to show that it was complete. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise!\" Chie called over to the girl once her brown eyes had blinked dazedly open, \"Quick! Roll me into the booth!\" Rise looked at her in some confusion, before looking across to the now obese Shadow Naoto, who was just starting to wake up. She nodded suddenly, her ponytails bobbing, and ran over to begin rolling Chie into the booth. \"Make it a one way transfer,\" Chie explained as Rise pushed against her rounded side to squeeze her in, \"We've got to make sure that she can't get us!\" Rise nodded, pushing Chie in at last, before running over to the control panel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One way transfer,\" Rise murmured as she looked down at the various dials and knobs, \"Um.. let's see... we'll try this.\"</span></div></div>",

It seemed like only moments later when she woke up, but a glance down at her body proved that it wasn't the case. While it was mostly back to normal, Chie noted that her stomach still bulged out in front of her more than it had done, it almost looked as if she were pregnant. On standing up, she could feel it sloshing with juice. While it was a worry, there were literally bigger things to worry about, Tripping out of the booth, Chie looked over to the watching Rise. Her face lit up on seeing Chie, and she ran over to wrap her arms tightly about her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I was so worried,\" Rise explained with wide eyes, \"I'm so glad that it worked. I guess something must happen with a one way transfer,\" she added guiltily, on looking down at Chie's stomach, \"But.. she won't be getting us anytime soon.\" Chie followed Rise's gaze up to where a simply enormous Shadow Naoto was too big to even fit in the booth anymore. She was massive, rounded and fat, her skin blue and taut with juice. Her head seemed so tiny on top of everything, and her voice seemed so far away, neither one of the girls could hear what she was saying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget about it,\" Chie insisted as she took Rise's hand in hers, \"We need to get Yukiko and get out of here.\" Rise looked concerned, but eventually nodded, and together they ran out of the lab to look for their friend. Shadow Naoto looked helplessly after them, unable to move so much as an inch with her heavy, juice filled body weighing her down. Anger crossed over her features, determination entering her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHundreds of miles away from Inaba, Naoto rolled over in her sleep, subconsciously cradling her stomach that had started to push out gently against her pyjama shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She moved to sit up, only to freeze on feeling something press against her knees. It felt like a pillow, Naoto mused with some confusion, and she lifted the covers to take a closer look. She gasped, her blue eyes going wide as she looked at her swollen stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was round and taut, and stuck out so much the buttons of her pyjama shirt were struggling to remain done up. Gaps had appeared between the buttons, showing Naoto's pale and taut skin in teasing glimpses. The young detective forced herself to remain calm as she leant back against her headboard, feeling over the side of her expanded stomach. It was cool and heavy, and Naoto assessed that it was about the size of pregnant stomach, around seven months gone. She sighed as she cupped her hand underneath it, testing the weight. She could hear a sloshing sound inside, and quickly worked out that she had been filled with <i>something</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to make some notes,\" Naoto decided as she climbed out of bed, and walked over to her desk. She sat down in the desk chair, noticing with a raised eyebrow that her rounded stomach now pushed out against the desk, and she opened her laptop to start it up. Creating a new document, Naoto began to type. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSUBJECT: Mysterious Bloating<br>\r\nDATE: 8/20/11<br>\r\nTIME: 3:05 am<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3:05 am: I woke up to a bloating sensation in my stomach. On further inspection, it seems to have bloated out with a liquid of some sorts. My waist now measures 42 inches, when it previously was 22 inches. I have gained 20lbs of weight, but it seems contained to my stomach area. I will be keeping a close eye on proceedings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto leant back as she felt over her stomach, she wasn't used to having a rounded gut out in front of her, and her pyjama shirt was only just holding it; then again, it had been oversized before hand. That led to the problem of what she would wear come the morning, the rest of her clothes were fitted to her more slender form. Naoto sighed as she tapped her fingers against the desk, she also had to try and get to the bottom of just what was causing this. </span></div></div>",

What was she pregnant with? When would she give birth? How had she gotten pregnant? She could only bow her head as she tried to think of the most logical thing to do. Chie and Yukiko could still be in danger from her Shadow, she had to save them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to go and find the others,\" Naoto decided with a nod, \".. we'll deal with this as and when it happens.\" Rise gave a short nod, and together they left the area of the lab. Deep inside Naoto, her Shadow grew from strength to strength, returning herself to power the only way she knew how; by leeching from Naoto's own body. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was beyond terrified of gaining all of that weight back, but she didn't know what could be happening to her dear friends.

After her first trip into the TV World and encountering her original shadow, she thought this was all just because she hated her fate as the next owner of her family inn, after all it was her parentes who told her it would be good for business if she was in shape when she took over. But eventually she realized that she wanted to stay at the inn, and she embraced this life. So why did she keep hating her diet? Could it be that she really wanted to gain weight and look like this shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a trembling lip she said, \"You're, you're right. I do hate my diet, I do hate counting calories.

No, not just gain weight, I want to be fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the shadow version of her began to glow with a bright light and transformed into Konohana Sakuya, her original persona. It had the same beak like pink mask, heart shaped chest, and feathery pom poms. Except, like the shadow version of herself, it was huge.

Oh man I bet it tastes just as good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got some milk to go with the pie, taking a 1/10th sized slice she took some with her fork and ate the piece, she chewed faster with her eyes wide and a huge smile across her face. \"IT'S EVEN BETTER THEN IT SMELLS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate the slice quickly then moved on to the pie taking a 1/5th sized slice and eating that. \"I can't believe it! I finally made something amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went through that slice before taking a quick sip of milk and then just going for the pie itself eating it within a 15 minutes frame and downing the milk to cool her throat from the still hot pie, she signed, highly content with her binge from the pie. \"I've never had food like that before. The taste was exquisite, everything about it was perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko then looked to see it was almost 11. \"Oh shoot I better get to sleep, oh well I'll make something tomorrow morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night Yukiko went to bed, the warm belly the pie sat it gurgled, her belly pressed against her kimono and stretched the sash's fabric putting a small tear in it, and unnoticeable one, meanwhile in her head Yukiko dreamed of the pie, then of all the food she'd eat, at 1 in the morning the sash tore a bit more, Yuki's tummy pushed the kimono open a bit, at 4 the sash was halfway torn and the kimono was showing Yukiko's belly button which was a bit past the kimono. 5 in the morning Yukiko yawned as she sat up. \"Time for breakfast.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko got up seeing the sash on her kimono was tearing. \"Huh? Oh don't tell me it tore while I was asleep. Well it was a little old, had it for three years, had to outgrow it sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko got a new sash that she'd wear tonight, it was new for when the old one gave, she quickly dressed, not even noticing her recent gain as she headed out of her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko walked into the kitchen as the chefs were standing around sniffing the air. \"This smell has been here all night I tell you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Yukiko asked puzzled and a bit surprised by the cooks all standing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something smells amazing but we don't know what!\" One said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko sniffed then giggled. \"That's the pie I made last night, didn't think it's smell would stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU made this aromatic masterpiece?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes, is there a problem with that?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Doughnuts were considered somewhat of a very rare treat for Yukiko. She found the highly fattening balls of dough to be irresistible, she could pack away the greater part of a bag without stopping to lick her sugar coated fingers. The dark haired girl blushed a little at the thought, turning the pages of the recipe book to find the page that she was looking for. Propping the book up against the wall, she began to gather the ingredients she needed. Once they were all set up, Yukiko began to follow the instructions fluidly, to the immense surprise of the passing kitchen staff. It was beyond amusing that the girl who had once burnt soup was now creating delicious food from scratch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good forty minutes of work, the doughnuts were finally ready to go into the oven, after being coated with the special glaze that the recipe had insisted needed to be used. Yukiko crouched down to slid the tray in, not noticing the way that her clothes pulled at her slightly larger body, or the way her ass pressed out against the thick material of her kimono. Setting the oven to the correct temperature, Yukiko stood up straight, stretching a little. She had a good twenty minutes to spare, so she left the kitchen to take a shower, and pull on a fresh kimono. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a slightly newer one that her mother had bought for her lately, in her favourite colour. It was a deep crimson shade, with pretty snaking patterns in black curling across the material. Yukiko shivered as she slipped the slightly cool material onto her bare shoulders, there was nothing she loved more than the feeling of new clothes. Moving to tie the sash into place, Yukiko felt her pale cheeks burn red on realising that the kimono was a very tight fit about her waist and behind. She just managed to slip the sash on tightly, but when she turned to the side, she could see the start of a small stomach starting to bulge out against the material. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess mother must have gotten me the wrong size,\" Yukiko mused as she felt down her sides, deciding that she really had to diet if she wanted to look good in such a gorgeous kimono, \".. I'll start after those doughnuts,\" she added a little sheepishly, leaving her bedroom to hurry down to the kitchen, to check on her cooking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had come out perfectly. Yukiko's mouth watered as she piled the doughnuts onto a plate, sweeping from the kitchen before any of the staff could hope to try and steal one from her. She had made twenty of those gorgeous doughnuts, and she wasn't about to let even one go. Locking herself back in her room, Yukiko sat cross legged on the bed, and took a bite into the first doughnut. She moaned softly, the hot, sweet dough almost orgasmic to her taste buds, swallowing slowly so that she could savour every single fraction of the taste. She took another without realising it, pushing it past her lips with such force, some sugar dusted down onto the neck of her kimono.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGradually, Yukiko's body began to soften from the effect of those doughnuts. Her stomach pushed out with the gentle bloat of rising dough, soft and white as it peeked out from the ever increasing gap of her kimono. Her breasts swelled out to hang down against the newly expanded flesh, a layer of flesh forming about her previously stick thin arms and legs. Yukiko continued to eat, blissfully unaware of the fact her behind was stretching her poor kimono to it's very limits, and that her stomach was already a soft bulge of fat against her fleshier thighs. The doughnuts seemed to have an almost hypnotic hold over her, it wasn't until the evening when Yukiko came to her senses, and gazed down at herself in wonder. </span></div></div>",

They soon were met up with by Naoto Shirogane, who had finally ditched her facade of being a man and dressed in the Yasogami High school female attire, and Rise Kujikawa who had grow a few inches, as well as a bigger bust line to her male fans delight. \"Morning Senpai.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good Morning Rise-Chan.\" Yukiko said brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you hear the rumor about a new transfer student? They say he's a Regional Pro at video games, gets high scores in everything, beats pro players, even gets in on early testing seats and early copies of the latest games.\" Chie said wanting to stir a conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Tohiro Shujo? I've met him once during a charity drive where he bet against some of the best local players in the city it took place in, he crushed them and gave all his charity to food for the poor.\" Rise said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah I think I saw that once, course you still made three times that with your dancing, but he really did take out a lot of people.\" Chie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't quite get video gamers.\" Yukiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are all types Yukiko-sempai, there are those who play for fun, for sport, stress relief, they're like normal people. Even if those people who analyzed Mitsuo Kubo would say otherwise.\" Naoto said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh don't remind me of him.\" She said somewhat disgusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then they saw a kid with a dark blue baseball cap turned backward, glasses and the Yasogami high uniform being picked on by bullies. \"Well if it ain't the new hotshot of the school, you honestly think you're popular here? To us you're just some big geek.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey that's Shujo-kun!\" Rise said angry that the bullies were attacking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What do you guys think you're doing!?\" Chie shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh if it ain't Satonaka, look missy we're just introducing this kid to our policy here, no Uber geeks around!\" The bully pushed Shujo into another bully who held him ready to beat him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a problem here?\" A famliar voice said as second year Kanji Tatsumi walked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah shit it's Tatsumi! Beat it!\" The bullies ran away at the mere sight of Kanji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friggin punks, hey kid you ok?\" Kanji asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, thank you all for trying to help.\" Shujo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Tohiro Shujo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe they were picking on you like that.\" Yukiko said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Miss Amagi, I know they aren't worth getting angry over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know me?\" Yukiko asked puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I stayed at your inn once two years ago during a trip to a gaming tournament, you never spoke much to me.\" He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh is that it, well I've changed since then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? Was this 'Amagi Challenge' I've also heard about after that change?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughhh People still bring that up? I thought I told them I'm not some game!\" Yukiko said angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you are one of the more beautiful girls in the school senpai.\" Rise said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you guys need me I'll be in class.\" Kanji said walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's right we better hurry on to class!\" Chie said rushing on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all started hurrying sans Naoto who looked at Shujo. \"Hmm something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's nothing. Just a feeling of Deja Vu. Like you're familiar.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Familiar?\" Shujo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said it's nothing.\" Shirogane walked away from Shujo who walked to Yasogami as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school Yukiko and Chie were walking out when Shujo walked up. \"Hello girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Shujo-kun, what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering if you two would like to eat out? I have plenty of Yen from my last tournament.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, ummmmm sure?\" Yukiko was taken aback by this, she was wondering if he was participating in the Amagi Challenge like many who asked her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe it, that kid got to the 1st checkpoint of the Amagi Challenge!\" A student whispered to another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll never make it to the 2nd one, Amagi would never hold his hand, probably reeks of plastic from controllers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Naoto, have you seen how many hits my blogs get? If I was to trash talk some students, I think half of the region would know.\" Rise said walking by and stating this fact louder then usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, those people would be embarrassed for weeks, good thing no one spreads nasty rumors.\" Naoto answered back the two students leaving the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Junes Chie and Yukiko had grilled steak with Shujo the two put down their utensils and sighed peacefully . \"DEElicious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the meal Shujo-kun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just my way of saying thanks and hello Miss Amagi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please you can call me Yukiko.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Yukiko-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man being a big shot gamer must be great, playing games and getting money for it, I bet everyone wished they had your job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not all fun and game Chie-san, I have to practice all the time to ensure my ranking stays high, meaning I have little time for the more important things in life, seeing nature's splendor, real friends and more importantly...ah never mind.\" Shujo said as Chie looked bad knowing what the last part was, but could tell Yukiko was oblivious to the fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we should hang out again sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes now that I've found a place to stay that isn't too far from all the regional areas that hold the tournaments I can try to have a normal life, and I'd like friends very much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we'll see you.\" The girls said leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, it had began to rain, the drops hit the window like mad, loud thuds from large drops, Shujo was in his bed arms over the sheets, glasses on the table, he had a dream, a black haired maiden in a meadow large and nude, he woke up,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy has Shujo woken up and how does it relate to gaining weight?</span></div></div>",

She swallowed it successfully, and moved back to wait with her chubby friend for the bus to arrive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie's weight was positioned mostly about her stomach, she had fairly thin legs still, but seemed to round out from her thighs upwards.

All of the little girls present on the bus were chubby, some her size and beyond, and others as pudgy as Chie. Yukiko moved with her friend to sit near the back, the seat only just managing to accommodate the two more than plump girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mysterious spirit, that caused Yukiko's wish to come true, watched her from one of the back seats.

The spirit smiled, Yukiko's wish had been a challenging one, but she had fulfilled it as well as she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the question of what to do next.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was yet another bright, clear day in the rural town of Inaba. A few clouds and a great shining sun filled the sky with a calm atmosphere, the sky a rich light blue. In general, Inaba had been mostly peaceful for the past month or so. No murders, no fog, nothing to bother the teenagers that had gotten to the bottom of the mystery that had struck in Inaba. With nothing much to do, each of them had soon gone to other matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu Narukami (Or the protagonist if you didn't know his name.) had since moved away from Inaba, going out into other parts of Japan to pursue new things. While he didn't specifically say what he planned to do, the others were for the most part on board with his decision and so he made his leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLove had also managed to bloom between some of them, the most clear and obvious being between Yosuke Hanamura and Chie Satonaka. The boy and girl had been going to out with each other for a month now, and for the most part, it was a fairly stable relationship. Yosuke would sometimes end up being a punching bag for Chie, and other times he would need to take care of a bill that Chie would have racked up if she had let her passion for steak get to her. Despite this, the two had clear feelings for each other and it was good enough to keep their relationship going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere had also been some goings on with Kanji Tatsumi and Naoto Shirogane, both of them beginning to spend more time with each other. It had started off slow, with Kanji confessing his love in the most awkward and stretched out ways until he finally got it out, a very strange sight to see if you managed to catch a glimpse of it. Naoto was okay to oblige, though it was unsure if she actually felt happy. The couple had tried to get some romance started, going to the usual settings that made for romantic moments. After a while, the two had warmed up to the idea of them being together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing down the street on the way back from school, the figures of Yukiko Amagi and Rise Kujikawa could be seen. It was quite strange to note that the two lovely ladies had been unable to get boyfriends in the past months. Neither of them seemed to care too much for the matter, the two merely happy that things had settled down so they could relax a little. They spent a lot of time together, generally being good friends when it came to most things. Even at school, they found themselves working together in most occasions. As they walked, Yukiko turned to Rise and asked her a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't heard from Teddie recently, have you? I haven't seen him in a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise also turned and replied. \"I've seen him a few times, but not really spoke to him. He spends so much time in his human form these days, always ogling girls in stores. He'll go into them just to chat them up sometimes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko laughed a little. \"At least he hasn't changed a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the duo were about to turn a corner, mumbles could be heard from behind the corner. They sounded rather threatening, so Yukiko put her hand on Rise and ushered her to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's something going on behind that wall, it doesn't sound pretty.\" Yukiko told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but should we be really getting involved into it? It isn't like it matters to us, even if it is a bad thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko thought about this.....</span></div></div>",

All of them were either tall or burly, with each one having devious smirks on their faces. Surrounded by them, was another person, who was significantly smaller and thinner than them all. This person had messy, silver hair that somehow still looked clean and kept despite the hairstyle. They wore a white buttoned shirt, along with a jacket that was sleeveless and covered their back. The jacket weaved it's way down to their lower body, a square of fabric covering the front of their thighs. A pair of white shorts were worn underneath the black square, reaching just above their knees and ending there. These clothing choices all showed how thin this person was, almost to the point of being scrawny. This appearance in general made it hard for Yukiko to decide whether this was a boy or a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortuntely for this person, they were currently being confronted by the larger group of boys, all of them slowly surrounding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne began to talk. \"We've already explained this to you before, we don't appreciate \"Girls\" on our turf. Especially pussies like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silver haired person panicked. \"Okay, it won't happen again! Can you let me go now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the person tried to walk out, another boy moved in the way and folded his arms. \"Not just yet \"Girl\". We've got to make sure that you don't go ahead and squeal on us like you did last time. We know your family is in high places, they'll get on to the police as soon as you rat us out. We're going to make sure you shut your trap for good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko's eyes widened at the scene unfolding before her. \"Quick Rise! We need to do something or else that kid's going to get pulverised!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise instantly straightened up. \"I hear you. But what approach of attack should we take?\" </span></div></div>",

I wasn't getting enough time being raised by them, and they felt that me being raised in the city wouldn't do me any good, so they sent me out here in the country to live with my grandpa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We knew a very good friend from the city,\" commented Yukiko. \"You also have his hair color!\" She gave a smile as Takeru blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh...do I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-Hmm! Although your's is a much lighter tone of silver and I gotta admit Takeru!\" She stepped in front of 'her' to get a better look. \"You do look good...What kind of grooming tips do you use?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeru blushed very noticeably and began stuttering. \"W-W-Well you see Rise I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here!\" Said Yukiko, grabbing the both of them by the hands and dragging Takeru inside, Rise seemed to have complied accordingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the trio sat down at the table. The restaurant in question was a Thai BBQ place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never tried Thai BBQ, so I thought we could try this new place out,\" said the dark haired girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukiko I love the way you think!\" She turned towards Takeru. \"So girlfriend, what do you want to eat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeru was twiddling with 'her' thumbs, blushing and biting his lower lip. An all too cute expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Kujikawa, Miss Amagi...there's something I need to tell you.\" The girls quirked their heads to the side, setting down their menus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...I'm a boy...\" </span></div></div>",

Thankfully for all of them, it was swiftly broken thanks to Rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you are? Sorry about calling you a girl back there, guess I was too quick to assume that.\" Rise shrugged her shoulders inbetween her response to Takeru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, I'm deeply sorry Takeru. I was just going along with what Rise assumed.\" Yukiko added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait....you're not shocked? Not in the slightest?\" Takeru asked, a little confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, not at all Takeru! Me and Yukiko wouldn't get fussed about anything like that, right?\" Rise replied, shifting her eyesight to Yukiko near the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't dream of getting shocked over the matter.\" Yukiko smiled warmly at Takeru, trying to calm his nerves a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeru's face lit up and he nodded a few times. \"Wow....thank you Miss Kujikawa, Miss Ama-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise waved her hand disapprovingly, cutting off Takeru's thank you. \"You know Takeru, you don't need to call us Miss or anything! Just call us like we're your friends, because we are, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay Mis- I mean, Rise.\" Takeru was a little shaky with his words at first, but soon felt better about it near the end. Calling someone by their first name for once felt nice, very casual. To have people like Rise and Yukiko around him, Takeru felt better after his encounters and confessions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClapping her hands together, Rise grabbed a menu. \"Alright, let's order ourselves something. We can let Yukiko starve now, can we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some pondering around at the menu, the two girls and the single boy had selected their respective meals. Getting a waiter over to take their orders down, they soon waited for the food to be ready. As they did, Yukiko asked a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Takeru, since you're new to the area, perhaps me and Rise can help you out? We can show you all the main need to know areas in Inaba for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeru beamed. \"Oh yes please Yukiko, I would highly appreciate that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent to hear, we can get started first thing after school. You go to our school as well, yes?\" Yukiko queried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I do, no need to worry.\" Takeru replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery soon after, the food for the girls and Takeru had been delivered to the table. But one of them seemed to have much more food than the others....</span></div></div>",

There was actually a second waiter at the table, carrying any of the other plates the first waiter was unable to. One them were various different dishes, most of them meat related, obviously since the establishment was a BBQ place. Sauces and seasonings alike were littered around the dishes, coating the meats in even more delicious extras.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the plates were handed to the individuals at the table, both Rise and Takeru had noticed most of the plates that had been served had ended up at Yukiko's part of the table. 3 plates full of ribs and steaks surrounded Yukiko, making the girl lick her lips in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter noticing Rise and Takeru staring at her, Yukiko smiled at the two. \"I'm just hungry, is all. Makes sense to eat when you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise took a glance at what Yukiko ordered. \"Yeah, but this is along the lines of overdoing it! Sure you'll eat all of that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko nodded. \"I'm certain of it. I've gotten quite the appetite worked up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the group of three pulled their plates close to them and began to enjoy their food. However, Rise couldn't help noticing how Yukiko was handling her food. She looked across the table to see that Yukiko had instantly headed for her ribs, picking them up with her bare hands, bringing them to her mouth. While it was considered better to eat ribs with hands, Rise never expected Yukiko to do it, it just seemed too messy. However, Rise was staring at Yukiko happily digging into the meaty ribs, some splotches of sauce dripping onto her cheeks, but somehow the girl kept her smart way of eat as she feasted. Yukiko kept a steady pace as she ate, chewing with her mouth closed and wiping her face every few ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise? Are you okay?\" Takeru nudged Rise's shoulder, noticing the girl was seeming spacing out. \"Feeling well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise turned to him and nodded. \"Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks for asking.\" She then shrugged off her concern for Yukiko and started her meal.</span></div></div>",

As they continued onwards, Takeru soon heard Rise's voice increase in volume, looking up to see the girl waving her free arm that wasn't holding his hand at a couple from across the street. Takeru soon felt his arm tugged as he was forced along the road with Rise, the girl running towards the two figures he saw as strangers but what Rise seemed to identify. Coming to a stop, Rise went up to the two people and gave a greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Kanji, hello Naoto! Nice to see you both again!\" Rise beamed at the boy and girl, Naoto smiling slightly and Kanji wearing a bigger smile on his face. He tilted his head to the side, noticing Takeru by Rise's side. Takeru was currently slinking behind Rise, feeling intimidated by Kanji's tall, imposing appearance. Kanji noticed this and walked towards Takeru, stretching his arm out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Rise, good to see you too.\" He turned his head from Rise to Takeru. \"Hey, relax. I know my look can be intimating, but trust me when I say I'm on the level.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeru slowly moved out from behind Rise and shook Kanji's hand, relived that he wasn't like the same people that were causing him trouble earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should really wear something different, the shirt is giving people a bad impression on you.\" Naoto had spoken for the first time, walking up to Kanji and prodding his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I really like this shirt!\" He pulled it out to show off the Skull. \"Tell me that doesn't look cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It may be cool, but it still gives the wrong impression of you.\" Naoto continued. \"It's odd, your family has a textile shop, you yourself being skilled in the art of tailoring. Why not wear something from the shop instead of that shirt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanji held his hands up, moving them back and forth, as if surrendering. \"Okay, okay Naoto. First thing tomorrow after school we'll go over there and you can pick a shirt for me, okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto folded her arms. \"As long as you don't count it as a date.

Her slender form was down to the soft drink Kelorie Magic, the latest flavour was surprisingly effective when it came to sudden weight loss. The already slim Rise had managed to shift ten pounds in a single weak for a photoshoot, and the sweet drink quickly became a part of her every day intake.

As the sun began to warm her stomach, the smallest of changes began to occur within her.

It stuck out to the point where she looked as if she could be with child, Rise grimaced; she knew the media would have a field day if they thought she was pregnant. She ran a hand down her stomach, it felt surprisingly heavy to the touch, as if it were filled with something. \"I guess I should be careful when gulping down drinks,\" Rise finally decided wearily as she reached for another can of Blueberry Blast, \"This must be all the air I end up swallowing.\" She chugged it in quick succession, and leant back against her sun lounger, basking in the sunshine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still feel a little bloated,\" Rise rubbed over her stomach, trying to ease how taut it felt, \"Maybe I should see if I can get some tablets for it?\" She gasped as she felt her stomach nudge against her hand, now that she was more focused, she could see that her stomach was slowly growing. Rise whimpered as she tried to sit up straighter, it was hard given that her expanding belly was in the way. \"What... what.. help!\" Rise glanced about desperately, realising with a deep blush that she really didn't want the entire beach to see her like this. With that she ran away, running into the nearest public bathroom, and locked herself into one of the cubicles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach continued to bulge out, Rise noticed with wide eyes that it was beginning to spread around her sides too. Her stomach was spreading, she couldn't believe her eyes, but it was slowly rounding out her entire body to resemble a ball. Her breasts vanished into the expanding ball of flesh, her arms were forced out at her sides due whatever she was being filled up with. Rise whimpered on feeling her sides press against the walls of the cubicle, no matter what way she turned, she was still wedged into place. The young pop star managed to fumble for her cell phone, and call the only person she knew could help her right now. </span></div></div>",

I'm at Kitako beach. In the ladies. I.. I'm so scared!\" She yelped as she dropped her cell phone to the floor, and tried to lean over to reach for it, finding her rounded sides wedged too tightly in place. Rise cried a little as she looked down at her rounded form, while she had kept her arms, the ball of fat had engulfed her legs, leaving her with just her ankles and tiny feet. Her arms were starting to become engulfed also, and Rise noted with some horror, that there was a tinge of blue starting over her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just half an hour later that Souji rushed into the girl's bathroom, ignoring the strange looks he had gotten for it. He had been beyond worried when Rise had been cut off like that, and he had left immediately to make his way to the beach. He looked at the empty stalls as he walked past them, coming to a stop outside of the only one that was closed. He hesitated on hearing the soft crying coming from within, reaching out to try and push it open. It only went a small way, it was stuck on something. The sniffling stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Souji?\" Rise whispered, \".. I can't get out.\" Souji raised a dark eyebrow as he moved into one of the other stalls, standing up on the toilet to peer down over the side at his girlfriend. His eyes widened on seeing the completely round Rise wedged into the cubicle, her arms helpless at her rounded sides. She was massive, and her skin had become a rich blue colour. Rise looked up at him, tears staining her blue cheeks. \"I don't know what happened.. I...

Souji picked it up for her, and leant over Rise's vast stomach to hold it to her hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello..?\" Rise asked tearfully, noticing with some embarrassment that her boyfriend was sinking a little against her rounded stomach, \"Who is this..?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Doctor Kawishika,\" the voice responded, harried and stressed sounding, with a lot of noise in the background, \"Miss Kujikawa?

Her jeans completely burst open and her tree trunk legs flowed out. Her undershirt turned to confetti as her fat paunch and large breast burst through it. Rise was amazed to see the kind of effect this food had, but also amazed at Naoto's new measurements, she wondered if she was this womanly back when she was thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waaaah!\" cried Naoto as she rubbed her eyes. Her shouts caused her ballooned cheeks and triple chins to jiggle uncontrolably. \"I'm just a big fat pig, a cow, a whale.

So, after Yu had left Inaba to go back to the city, the other members of the Investigation Team got much more easily bored. However, it was Rise who first heard of something interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At her relatives tofu shop in the Shopping District of Inaba, two older ladies were talking about an adult show late at night. It was hosted by, who else, but Tanaka. The only catch was that it was for the more adult oriented items, whether that be panties, private toys, or breast enhancing cream! This caught Rise's attention. She herself wasn't in need of breast enhancing, for she was content with her own size, but she knew someone who was a bit down in the dumps for not having knockers like she wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rise got a grin on her face then looked at the time. Oh, crap! It was almost time for the show to come on! She managed to slip out of the shopping part of the building and got to her room where there laid a TV. She quickly turned it on and switched the channel to Tanaka's show. Yes! She was in luck! There were two things left! She said, why not, and ordered both of them. Hey, they were on sale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It wasn't long till the cream came in, and Rise made absolutely sure that her relatives wouldn't figure out she bought it. When she opened it, however, there was two huge packs of the stuff! She only thought the stuff was as expensive as it was cause it was rare or something, but no! They were family packs! Rise kinda shrugged it off though. It was for a friend, and... she needed it? Plus, she has been hinting at it a bit to Naoto over the past few days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Anyway, the day after the cream came in, Rise took both things to school. At lunchtime was when she revealed them to Naoto. Naoto couldn't stop smiling. She hugged Rise tightly and even cried a little. She could now be a full woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After the day of school went draggingly by for Naoto, she ran straight home as fast as she could, which actually wasn't all that fast since the immense weight from the packs wasn't exactly light. When she opened the door to her house, she didn't stop to say high to anyone, just straight to the bathroom. She knew that the bathroom would be the safest place to do this since if anyone came barging into her room, it would be way too awkward. She took out the packs of cream, took of her school uniform and started to apply the cream to her breasts, but no matter how hard she applied, nothing was happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What did she do next?</span></div></div>",

She started to fondle her breasts a bit, which made her entire body feel warm and tingly. She looked at the two entire packs of breast cream and thought, well, this'd be a waste if I didn't use every last drop, wouldn't it? She grabbed the entire first pack of cream with both hands and squeeeeeezed out every last drop of the cream onto her breasts. She rubbed it around and around, only making her body feel more warm and tingly, her breasts even more so. Speaking of her breasts, they were finally at work and they looked like they were growing! She started lightly chuckling to herself. She had wanted these all her life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Whenever she couldn't see any more excess of cream on her breasts, that were still growing by the way, she took the next entire pack of breast cream and squeezed it all out again. She kept rubbing her breasts again and again and again, making her body warm and tingly all over again. Her breasts were looking like double D's with no sign of slowing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Naoto's face was lit up with delight. She couldn't help herself as to not fondle the amazing funbags Rise had let her have! Speaking of, her breasts were now F's! She never would've thought she would have breasts this big! G's! H's! Hell, by the next couple of minutes, her breasts were almost on the floor and were a good 2 feet in front of her! Still, they showed no sign of stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What does she do next?</span></div></div>",

She figured it was the volume of the music she had been listening to lately her father had warned her about such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging it off Nanako continued on her way...again another thump but this time it seem to be accompanied with an urge of sorts. Something was pulling at her to head toward Junes, normally the teen girl would jump at the chance but this time felt different much different and yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I doing this?\" wondered Nanako as she aisles at Junes till she found the Electronic section. She grunted silently as she felt that urge once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Television...\" she mumbled to herself. Finally she came to stop in front of a 52\" HDTV, Nanako was actually amazed at how large and vast the set was. Another mild grunt as her head pounded for the umpteen time today. Instinctively she reached out to the vast TV screen her fingers inches away from tapping away at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I doing this?\" she wondered and thankful that by some miracle no one was around to see her strange behavior. Then it happened her fingers tapped the screen but to her shock her hand literally went through the screen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hazy buried memory from when she was kidnapped during the infamous murder case years ago came back to her. With a quick look around and once she sure no one was indeed nearby Nanako steeled herself before stepping through the television screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered being tossed in by the man named Namatame but not much else of the strange world she now found herself in, only that her big brother and their friends had apparently fought some great evil to save her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanako sighed as she felt the pressure within her head finally beginning to subside. Looking out into the distance Nanako could vaguely make out the form of a bear resting on a large boulder. The strangely colored bear looked beaten and exhausted as it rested silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it occurred to her that bear was Junes' mascot and her long-time friend Teddie! Rushing over Nanako called out to the resting bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nana-chan?\" Teddie said in a weak response, Nanako nodded as she reached his resting spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nana-chan!\" exclaimed Teddie with pure happiness, \"Oh but you shouldn't be in here especially after what just happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about Teddie?

Ai felt that Yukiko was one of her first real friends other then Souji who did help change her personality to be more likable of a person but if Ai's memory is correct Yukiko's best friend is Chie who is super athletic and that would be a problem if Chie was not okay with Ai's and Yukiko's new found friendship <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" So Yukiko.\" Ai said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh yes Ai?\" Yukiko replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a question about Chie are you two still hanging out?\" Ai asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well *munch* we don't see each other much anymore.\" Yukiko said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did something happen?\" Ai said then taking a huge bite of her 40oz steak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it is just that it is that well are parents had some kind of fight but I can't remember what it is about.\" Yukiko said sadly then starting to eat faster<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry Yukiko I did not mean to bring something up.\" Ai said felling guilt about the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it is okay Ai I know you did not mean any harm so let's finish these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow the two girls where still able to have a conversation with out anything awkward coming up and in fact Ai started wondering why she did not hang out with her much before so after the two girls finished there meals they went and bought about 10 boxes of doughnuts and plenty of other snacks and even a cake. In fact even Yukiko found herself enjoying overeating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAi noticed something about her parents lately that they have been serving much bigger proportions at the dinner table as of late even before Ai was set in stone on becoming her old self again now Ai's parents are people with just amazing metabolisms but I did not carry over to Ai so when they are giving out the proportions that sized she is bound to become her old self even with out trying. In fact they would probably give a lot of food to guests also. An idea pops into Ai's head <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Yukiko do you want to come to my house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure but do you want to do more shopping?\" Yukiko said<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ai sighed as she tried to ward off her stomach pains by taking a walk along the upper floors of the school, rubbing her side to try and make the ache go away. She had been shocked to discover she had gained a couple of pounds, and terrified of becoming Piggy-hara again, she had decided to accidentally forget her lunch that day. Ai's reasoning was that if she didn't have any food or much money, she wouldn't be tempted to buy anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately she hadn't counted on being so unbelievably hungry. She stopped outside of a classroom with a groan, just happening to glance inside. One idiot student had left their bag on their desk, Ai noted, before a sudden realisation hit her. That could have meant they hadn't returned to the classroom before lunch had began. Which meant that there could be food in there that Ai could help herself too. Smirking a little, the slender girl looked up and down the hallway to check for anyone who might have been watching, before she slid open the door, and slipped into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better be something good,\" Ai muttered to herself as she rummaged through the back, noticing with some disappointment that there was neither a bento box or any money in the contents, \"Ugh! What kind of moron doesn't even have food?\" she complained, clearly not beginning to think that she would belong in that category. She was about to give up and cut her losses when she felt something soft and squidgy at the corner of the bag. She pulled it out, and looked in wonder at the little blue sweet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... huh. Better than nothing,\" Ai decided, and popped the sweet into her mouth without a second thought. It tasted sweet, but a little musty, as if it had been in the bag for some time. Ai pulled a slight face as she swallowed it, surprised at how full she felt from just the one sweet. It was better than nothing, she quickly decided, and moved to rearrange the student's bag so that no-one would notice it had been rummaged through.</span></div></div>",

Ai was starting to regret eating the sweet she had found, it was making her stomach ache. She reached a hand down to rub it underneath the desk, noticing with some annoyance that she had began to bloat out from it. She felt over the rounded curve of her stomach, suppressing a shudder at a suddenly vivid memory of Piggy-hara.  She forced herself to go back to writing her essay, if anything, it helped distract her from the pain in her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the bell rang to signal the end of school, Ai was all too grateful to stand up and slip her messenger bag over her shoulder, leaving the room before the teacher could even begin to explain the homework. Ai muttered to herself as she walked down the corridor, her stomach was still aching badly, and she could have sworn it stuck out further than she remembered. Her blouse was starting to ripple at the sides from where the material was trying to hold back the bloated flesh, and a button was just a little too tight about the curve of her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid stomach,\" Ai noted angrily as she stopped at her locker to change her school shoes over, noticing with some embarrassment that it was harder than ever for her to lean over and just replace them, her stomach kept getting in the way. It bought back yet more memories of her fatter days, but even then her stomach hadn't given her this much trouble. She toed on her street shoes with some annoyance, slamming her locker closed with far more force than necessary. </span></div></div>",

Anyway,\" she continued with a hushed whisper to her best friend Yukiko, \"Souji-kun asked me to hold onto one of those water gems, right? I think a teacher or something wanted one. So he asked for it earlier and I couldn't find it. Werid, huh?\" Yukiko nodded a little as she kept her head in close to Chie's, this wasn't a conversation they wanted to be easily overheard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess. I wonder if the gems naturally disappear after a certain amount of time?\" Yukiko whispered back, kicking her street shoes on with a surprising show of elegance, \"Or maybe it got squashed in your bag?\" She had seen Chie with it that very morning, it wasn't a case of the shorter girl having forgotten it all together. Chie nodded hesitantly, though she didn't look too sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess there's no point worrying about it,\" Chie eventually admitted as she closed her own locker, a lot more quietly, \"Even if someone has got it, it's not like they'd know what it does. I feel so bad for Souji-kun though,\" she added, regretfully, \"Remind me to try and pick him up some more tonight, okay?\" Yukiko smiled, and ducked her head into a small nod as she began to follow her smaller friend out of the front doors of the school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will. Don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAi looked after them after a moment, scowling as she slung her bag over her shoulder. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Curious to find out exactly what she had eaten, Ai quickly followed the two friends outside of the school. Fortunately the sidewalks were still crowded with students, so it wasn't all that hard to follow them without being noticed. She barged her way past her fellow students, her gaze firmly up ahead on Chie and Yukiko. Gradually the students thinned out, and Ai had to keep a little further back from them than she would have liked. She was starting to get hot and irritated when she saw that they were heading to Junes, and allowed herself to slow down a little to try and cool off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever that 'water gem' was, it must have made my stomach like this,\" Ai noted bitterly as she looked down at her swollen midsection, stamping a foot on seeing that it had bloated out a little more, the gaps between her buttons had increased, showing the flawless pale skin underneath. Her blouse was starting to get a little uncomfortably tight, Ai, was tempted to try and pull it down, but she didn't want to risk a button popping off. Instead she continued to follow Chie and Yukiko, and immediately felt a little better for entering the air conditioned Junes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust them,\" Ai sighed on seeing the two were heading towards the food court, \"That Chie is such a pig. I don't get how she stays so small.\" She hated the smaller girl. Not only could Chie eat her own weight in meat and not show a pound for it, Kou, Ai's precious Kou, actually had a crush on the tom boy. It disgusted Ai if she were honest, how dare he like someone like her, and ignore Ai completely? Ai was gorgeous, Chie was nothing on her. Her anger growing, Ai followed the two through to the food court, gasping in surprise on seeing the number of familiar students gathered about a table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made for an odd group of friends, Ai noted with a roll of her light brown eyes, but they were annoyingly close. There was Yukiko and Chie, who had just joined the group with a smattering of hellos and various greetings. There was Yosuke, who was an annoying little idiot who's father happened to run that branch of Junes. There was Kanji, the no good thug, and there was Naoto, the strange young girl who had posed as a man of all things. The thought made Ai wrinkle her nose, Naoto was just strange. Then there was Rise, a pop idol who somehow deemed those idiots as being worthy of her attention, and then there was Teddie, the strange newcomer who was an enviously pretty boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Souji. Ai hissed a sigh of frustration between her teeth on seeing Chie sit next to her Souji, and seeing the silver haired youth wrap his hand about her unfairly small waist. Ai gazed down at herself, at her bloated stomach that stood out so clearly against her thin frame; she knew if she wasn't so feared at school, a lot more students would have pointed it out to her. She rubbed a hand over it as she leant up close to a pillar to listen in on the group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about losing that water gem,\" Souji spoke quietly to Chie, \"We can find some more.\" He spoke little, but when he did, his words were wise and calculated; it was unfair that his gentle words were wasted on a dolt like Chie. Chie smiled in relief, and nuzzled up closer to her boyfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still.. we can go in and try and find some?\" Chie suggested, \"I'm always up for more training.\" There was a collective series of nods, and Yosuke stood up from the table first, his chair legs scraping against the concrete floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then. I think the electronics department is empty enough,\" he decided, a hand to his chin, \"Let's go!\" With that the rest of the group got to their feet, and began heading out of the food court again. Ai frowned a little as she watched them leave. What did the electronics department have to do with anything?</span></div></div>",

Yosuke scoured the entire department, before returning to the rest of his friends in front of one television in particular. Ai couldn't hear them from where she was, much to her frustration, but moving closer would only give herself away. She peered out over the top of the television she was behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she saw next was something she couldn't believe. First Teddie stuck his hand into the screen. He actually put his hand through the television screen, Ai noted with some horror. But the screen didn't break, if anything it began to glow, it's picture fading from sight. She could only stare as Teddie made his way through, followed by the others. They passed through the glowing rectangle one by one, until only Yosuke was left. He looked around one last time, before moving to awkwardly slip a lanky leg through the frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAi knew she had to move fast. She didn't quite know why, but the screen had only started to glow once they were near it. She ran lightly across the empty department to where Yosuke's foot was starting to disappear through the glow, her stomach bouncing heavily against her the entire while. She just managed to touch the screen before Yosuke disappeared completely, and a rushing sensation came over her. Ai close her eyes tightly as she waited for the dizziness to subside, before slowly opening her eyes. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But there was differences, Ai noted, just slight adjustments here and there. For one the double doors had been replaced by a glowing red rectangle, with lines of black swirling slowly inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is weird,\" Ai sighed to herself as she looked around. She was surrounded completely in darkness asides from the gym ahead of her, and it was for that reason she began walking up the steps that led to the strange door. She stepped into the light with a shudder, it felt as if her entire body was trembling, only to walk out into the lobby of the gym as if nothing was out of the ordinary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAi looked around at the lobby, it looked just as she had remembered it. The reception desk was unmanned, and it was almost deadly silent, but it still looked the same. Her footsteps echoed as she walked across the tiled floor, her eyes darting around to drink in whatever she could see. She couldn't even begin to try and understand what was going on, her best bet was that she had somehow gotten knocked out. Maybe if she was lucky she had fallen asleep in class, and this was all a bad dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh..\" Ai stopped with a gasp as pain shot across her bloated stomach, she reached down to hold it, crying out as a button popped clear from her blouse, \"Damnit!\" She looked down at the gap her stomach was now protruding through. It was almost completely round, and very taut, Ai poked it reluctantly, not only was there no give, it was cool to the touch. She was starting to get extremely annoyed by her bloated stomach, her hatred towards Chie growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is stupid,\" Ai turned on her heel, letting out a snarl of frustration on seeing that the door behind her had sealed completely, leaving only a blank space of wall, \"Now how the hell am I supposed to get out?\" She sighed as she folded her arms across her chest, deliberately ignoring how her lower arm now brushed against the curve of her stomach. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She touched a hand to her bloated stomach subconsciously as she looked from one to the other. Now that she thought about it, she was also a little thirsty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAi felt in her pocket for change, noticing with a sigh that she hadn't bought all that much money with her, to try and ease her temptation to buy lunch earlier on in the day. Fortunately for her, there was two things she could buy with the amount of change that she had. Ironically, Ai noted wearily, it was either a snack, or a drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was Bacon Bites, a small packet of chips that promised to have an authentically 'bacony' flavour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr there was Blueberry Blast, a fizzy drink that was made with real blueberries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Ai chose something?</span></div></div>",

Her stomach was starting to ache a little less, but it still felt very heavy, Ai was paranoid that she could hear a faint sloshing now and again from deep within. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came to a stop at the very end of the corridor, and tilted her head to look up at the signs that pointed in opposite directions.

She picked up her pace, her heart lifting at the thought of someone else being in there with her. She was more relieved than she would ever show, Ai broke into a run, her bloated stomach bouncing against her thighs with every step. She threw open the door that would lead into the changing rooms, and ran through them too, her footsteps echoing back off of the tiled walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAi was hit with a wave of warmth once she entered the pool itself, and she stopped to catch her breath. The air was muggy and warm, steam was rising up from the pool. She squinted, she could see a figure swimming through the water towards her, with steady, even strokes. Ai stuck her hand up into a wave, so desperate to find another soul in this place, she was willing to play the part of 'innocent lost little school girl' . She held her breath as the steam began to clear, before her eyes widened on seeing the figure that was slowly pulling themselves up and out of the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. It's you,\" the other Ai noted with a sigh, resting a hand against her hip, \"I figured you would get here at some point.\" The other Ai looked almost identical to Ai herself, except that her eyes were a pure gold colour that glowed eerily. And that she was a good one hundred and fifty pounds heavier than her. Ai backed away on seeing the other Ai in front of her, for once at a loss of what to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Ai was wearing a dark swimming costume that was stretched to it's very limits over her fat body. Her breasts were full to the point of almost spilling over the neckline of the costume, her stomach was fat and soft, and stretched the material to the point where Ai could make out the other Ai's belly button. The other Ai's legs were shapely and fat, the thighs brushing against one another even when she was stood still, and her arms were soft and fleshy against her sides. It made Ai shudder to look at her, and she closed her eyes to look pointedly to the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you looking away, Ai?\" the other Ai demanded, a hand resting against her generously rounded hip; Ai noticed for the first time that her voice was deeper than her own, \"I'm you. Why do you look so disgusted when you see me?\" Ai snapped a little on hearing that, stamping her foot as she turned to glare at the other Ai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you say that we're alike!?\" Ai demanded, \"I look nothing like you! You're a fat pig! You're disgusting! You're Piggy-hara!\" To her annoyance, the other Ai just laughed, and moved closer to Ai before she could even think of moving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're more alike than you think,\" the other Ai threatened, a fat finger poking at Ai's painfully distended stomach, \"I'm you. Don't you dare say otherwise.\" Ai met the other Ai's eyes determinedly, noticing with a sneer that the other Ai had what appeared to be the start of a double chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not me,\" Ai ground out, \"You're nothing like me!\" The other Ai seemed to smile serenely for just a moment, before her expression darkened, and she took a step back from Ai. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll regret this,\" the other Ai promised as darkness seemed to flicker all around her fat figure, her hair blowing about in the wind, \"You'll regret this!\" Ai could only watch in horror as the other Ai before her seemed to expand out even further, growing upwards and outwards into an extremely fat version of herself. Ai turned to try and run, only to find that she was frozen in place. </span></div></div>",

She flailed underwater for a good few moments before breaking free from the surface with a gasp, her hair plastered to her head. She gasped for breath, moving her arms to keep swimming in place, looking up with bleary eyes at her Shadow. She made to swim for the edge to climb out, when she felt something strange in her stomach, a low gurgle that filled her with absolute dread. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.. I can't move,\" Ai gasped suddenly, she felt so heavy all of a sudden, and her stomach was aching even more than before, \"What.. what's happening?\" She felt herself dip in the water and she moved her arms to try and stay afloat. She noticed with some horror that the water level was dropping with her, she couldn't begin to understand what was going on. Ai's Shadow laughed as Ai continued to struggle, and before long it was evident what was weighing her down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... no!\" Ai shouted as she saw her rounded form stick up out of the water, craning her neck behind her to see it was the exact same, \"No! What the hell is going on?!\" Her rounded stomach had somehow expanded to engulf her entire body, her breasts, her ass, it had all disappeared into the big rounded ball that was Ai's body. Her arms and legs stuck out with a slightly cone like appearance, far smaller than the every growing blob that was her body, fat at the top but thin at her ankles and wrists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Ai felt her rounded back hit the bottom of the swimming pool, the rest of the water being absorbed into her body. She cried and screamed out, but she couldn't do anything as she slowly expanded, her round body ridiculously huge now. She came to a quivering stop once the last drop had water had gone, she was now so big that her sides were close to brushing the edges of the swimming pool, and her rounded form actually stuck out over the edge. Ai panted as she tried to catch her breath. She felt so full, so heavy, she could barely move anything beyond her fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear,\" Ai's Shadow taunted as she led down near the edge, Ai could only distantly note that she was back to how she had looked when Ai first met her, \"I guess that teaches you for being such a pig and stealing that 'sweet',\" she chuckled as she patted Ai's rounded side, which wobbled and sloshed about as if Ai was nothing more than a water balloon, \"It's a shame you can't see how big you are now. Let's just say you resemble a hot air balloon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" Ai demanded tearfully, through the blur of tears she noticed she was wearing a swimming costume not unlike her Shadow counterpart, though now it was stretched to it's very limits to contain her bloated body, balloon like body, \"Help me! I can't be like this!\" Ai's Shadow slowly shook her head as she stood up, a slow smirk crossing her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No such luck,\" Ai's Shadow heaved a sigh, \"I don't you can even move, can you, Flabby-hara? You're just going to have to stay here. And I?\" she held a hand to her chest with a smirk, \"I'll replace you. I can finally be free. And you? You can stay here and get even bigger.\" Chuckling, Ai's Shadow moved over to a series of buttons on the wall, hitting one with a slap of her palm. Ai gasped as the sprinkler systems activated, and her body began to absorb even more of the water as it was rained down upon her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No-one will believe you!\" Ai shrieked after her, \"You're so fat and disgusting! They won't believe you!\" Ai's Shadow turned to smile at her slowly, before snapping her fingers. Almost instantly the fat began to melt away, revealing the same thin figure that Ai had before eating that water gem that morning. As a final touch, her glowing golden eyes dulled to the light brown Ai was known for. Ai felt hot tears streak down her face as her body expanded even more, to the point where she couldn't even see over it anymore. Ai's Shadow chuckled as she left the room with a sway of her narrow hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Ai screamed pleadingly, \"Please! Don't leave me!\" Ai's Shadow ignored her completely, and Ai's terrified cries were drowned out by the water that sprinkled down over her ever expanding body. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She tried to kick her legs again, they were tiny in comparison to the massive bulk of her body, she felt like a fat insect with tiny arms and legs in comparison to her massively inflated body. Ai closed her eyes wearily. She couldn't move. All she could do  was grow steadily bigger, she didn't even have any way of turning off those sprinklers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In here!\" a voice suddenly shouted, Ai turned her head to look towards the door, her eyes widening on seeing nothing other than Souji and his gang run through.

No-one said a word at first, it was Yosuke who finally moved first, running over the tiles to slap the sprinkler system off.

Teddie, any ideas?\" A red and blue bear bounced to the front of the group, Ai vaguely recognised it as a mascot from Junes. She didn't want to even think of why it was there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.. well it's not a spell, so I don't think we can reverse it,\" Teddie began, Ai noticed his voice was that of <i>Teddie</i>, the pretty blond haired boy, \"A Shadow must have done something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got an idea,\" Chie decided as she suddenly took a few steps back, stretching her legs, \"Ready?\" Ai could only watch as Chie ran towards her, aiming a kick down towards her midsection. Ai grunted a little, it didn't hurt all that much, and felt water seep out of her. It led about her for only seconds before it was soaked back into her body. \"Huh,\" Chie tapped her foot against Ai's rounded form, \"She's like a sponge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it!\" Teddie decided with a small nod, \"Yosuke-kun?

We should be able to get most of the water that way.\" Ai didn't have a clue what any of them were talking about, but she hated being spoken about as if she weren't even there, and she scowled as she felt Chie climb back off her again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get me out,\" Ai demanded as she looked to them all, \"I'm sick of this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYosuke rolled his eyes good naturedly, but he began cast Garu on her. </span></div></div>",

Soon the growth stopped, and the bloating began to recede. Her stomach didn't go back to being completely flat, much to Ai's frustration, it still stuck out in a slight curve from her frame. \"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amrita Soda,\" Yosuke explained with a roll of his eyes, the empty bottle seeming to fade in his hand, \"Guess you had a spell on you, Ai-san.

Chie had moved to support her underneath one arm on seeing Ai stumble, and Yosuke had been sticking close, worried that she would pass out on them. It was Yukiko who had helped her out of the television screen, and it was Souji who had steadied her on the other side. Ai closed her eyes weakly as she heard them talk, apparently Yosuke, that thug Kanji, and Teddie were going to take her home. She didn't respond until there was a gentle touch to her elbow, and she began walking with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've all gone through the same thing, if that helps,\" Yosuke spoke up after a while, \"Facing our Shadows and all. I mean, you didn't accept yours though, did you?\" Ai snorted softly, and gave a sharp shake of her head, \"Well it's easier if you do. Trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My other self, she was-,\" Ai began sharply, before falling silent suddenly, she couldn't admit to two stupid boys that her 'other self' had been overweight, \"... she wasn't me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how you feel,\" Kanji's gravelly voice cut across, \"The same thing happened with me. I thought that loser couldn't be me. Turns out he was. You just got to accept that and move on, or it'll haunt you forever.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAi frowned at that, looking away to the side. Was that fat girl really still a part of her? Was her true self Piggy-hara? Is that what they were trying to say, or did they just want to see her fat again? She sighed, it was all jumbling together into her mind, and that frustrated her beyond anything else. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To try and take her mind off things, Ai ran herself a hot bath the moment she got in. Her parents weren't home that weekend, they were away on one of their many holidays. In many ways, Ai missed how it had been before. Her parents had been home all the time then, while now she was lucky if she saw them during the evenings. Since winning the money they had invested it wisely, and could easily afford to go away every other week without any real dent in their income. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only upside was that it gave Ai a lot of freedom. Peeling her blouse and skirt from her slender body, Ai sighed a little at the events of the day, unable to believe that just hours ago she had been a massive water balloon that could fill an entire swimming pool with her mass. She sank down into the hot water with a sigh, closing her eyes. It was nothing more than a bad trick, she had decided, a bad dream. A weird effect of that strange place. Bought on by her bloated stomach during the day. That was it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing her eyes, Ai let herself sink into the water. The heat of the water and the tiring day let her doze off, her cheek resting against the lip of the bath. Slowly, her stomach began to push out from the water being absorbed into it. Ai shifted in her sleep as her body began to bloat out again, rounding out as her breasts and behind sank into the rounded shape of her body, squishing up against the sides of the bathtub. Ai continued to billow out until the very last drop of water had gone, leaving only her water bloated body wedged into the bath tub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe woke up some time later with a gasp, and for one horrifying moment, thought she was still trapped in the swimming pool. She glanced down at her rounded, squishy body, and let out a cry as she tried to pull herself out of the bathtub. She struggled, her arms seemed so small compared to the rest of her form, and she just managed to pull herself out with a light pop. Fighting to regain her balance, Ai fell onto the bathroom floor with a dull thud, the water bloating her body out cushioning any pain that she would have felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only problem now was trying to get back up her feet. Ai was stuck on the front of her rounded body, her arms and legs left kicking helplessly in the air, she was pushed up a fair bit from the floor by how much her body had bloated out. She grunted and swung her more malleable body against the floor to try and catch her foot against the tiles. It took several moments, but she succeeded, and clinging tightly to the bath tub, she managed to get back to her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This,\" Ai sighed angrily, \"Is getting really annoying.\" She waddled to try and see herself in the mirror, though she could barely fit all of her reflection in. She was nothing more than a fat ball with arms and legs, she fought to keep her breathing down, her body seemed to jiggle with every breath. She patted her side, she could feel the warm water sloshing within her, it almost threw her off balance. She looked as if she had swallowed a particularly large beach ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".. what do I do?\" Ai glared at her reflection for a long moment, her arms forced out to her sides slightly from just how rounded she had become. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She grunted as she inched her way slowly through, the door frame painfully tight against her sides. The only, only good thing about being filled with water was that like a water balloon, she could squash different parts of her to push the water elsewhere. Right now she was wedged mostly through the frame, the rest of the water bugling out behind her. It would have once been her back and behind, but now it was just a curve of pale skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh!\" Ai freed herself as she fell face first into her bedroom, her body jiggling wildly as it took a moment for the water to settle, \"Damnit!\" She picked herself up a little faster this time, she was slowly getting used to the way she had to use her body to her advantage, and was even starting to compensate for how off her balance was when the water sloshed too wildly. Standing, Ai waddled over to her wardrobe, looking at the pretty, tiny outfits with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been hoping she would never have to wear that again, but it looked like she had no choice. Pushing the pretty clothes aside, she reached in for an outfit hidden right at the back, an old school uniform that looked to be several sizes too big for Ai's slender form. These, she noted bitterly, had been the clothes that Piggy-hara had wore. Ai didn't know why she had kept them, but now they were going to come in useful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, it was almost horrific that she had the same waist size she had when she was 250lbs. Ai pulled the skirt up to rest at her waist, not even attempting to do the button up. The pleated skirt was smoothed out against her spherical body, and pinched slightly against her flesh. Ai grimaced, and pulled on the blouse. She pulled it closed with some effort, doing up the first few buttons with next to no difficulty. But she was forced to leave the bottom three up, she wasn't going to even try doing them up. Ai looked at herself in the mirror, noticing with a sigh that the skirt and shirt only just met. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get rid of this water,\" Ai muttered, \"But how? They used that.. weird, magic stuff. I don't have that.\" She didn't want to ask for their help again, it was beyond humiliating that they had already seen her as an enormous blob. Ai felt herself stiffen, she didn't want to ever return to being something like that again if she could help it. \".. I have no choice.\" </span></div></div>",

She waddled down the front steps of her porch uneasily, her arms held out either side of herself to stop her from falling. The walk to the street seemed to be longer than ever, Ai felt a little out of breath once she had reached the gate, her cheeks flushed red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost like being Piggy-hara again. Almost. Ai groaned as she forced her way through the gate with some difficulty, and out onto the street. She had never been more grateful for the fact that Inaba seemed to go to sleep early in the evening, it meant that no-one else was around. She began waddling down the street, the sloshing of the water inside of her oddly relaxing. She had never thought that morning that she would be wandering the streets with a rounded ball of water for a body. Ai rolled her eyes as she stopped to catch her breath again. She was barely down the street, how was she going to get to Junes when she could barely walk a few feet without losing breath. </span></div></div>",

It had been a gift from her mother on graduating from the esteemed Arisato School of Drama, paid for with the vast amounts of money her father had left for them after his death. The apartment building was in a nice area of the city, close to the theatre Yumi worked at to pay for the rent, and the apartment itself was just perfect for her. It was a one bedroom affair, with a large living room, cosy kitchen, and an almost luxurious bathroom that Yumi had fallen in love with at first sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi knew she was lucky, and every Sunday morning she went to the nearby shrine without fail, to pray to her father in gratitude. She was taking good care of her first apartment, the young twenty two year old had always been neat and tidy even as a child, and it was starting to feel a little bit more like home with every box she unpacked. Yumi smiled as she looked about her living room, giving a slight nod on seeing that it was finally complete. It was finally hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi had grown just a little taller over the years, and she was still just as thin. Her narrow face was complimented by her cropped dark hair that fell just past her chin, and helped to soften the harsh angles a little. She was pretty, though many had stated that she would have looked good with a few extra pounds on her tiny frame. Still, she was an actress, and to be noticed, Yumi knew she had to remain thin in order to portray a certain image. It was fortunate for her that being thin was easy, she struggled to gain weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm?\" Yumi glanced down at her phone as she passed it, noticing that a red light was blinking, \"Oh.. I've got a message?\" It must have rang when she was in the shower, she realised, and she hit a button as she turned to begin straightening out the cushions on the couch. There was a beep, followed by the standard electronic voice, before the message finally came through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yumi, sweetheart? It's Rochelle,\" Yumi stiffened slightly, it was her agent, \"You've been offered the starring role in a play, honey! It's Madame Butterball, I know, the Madame Butterball! I don't think I've ever had one of my girls get a role this juicy so quickly! Anyway, they're really happy with what they've seen so far! But.. uhh. Well, the thing is dear, that you need to look a little more like the esteemed Madame Butterball. You're far too thin. The director is gonna email you with the specifics, honey. Call me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi found herself gazing at the now silent answering machine with wide eyes. She had been offered the role of the Madame Butterball? The most fought after role in theatre to date? She felt herself go a little dizzy, and she had to hold onto the back of the couch for support. A wide smile tugged over her thin lips, and she gave a little dance for joy. Sure there was the whole issue of being too thin, Yumi realised absently, but surely there was ways around that? She sat on her couch, pulling her laptop open and quickly logged into her emails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><div align=\"center\">Miss Yumi Ozawa<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCongratulations! I would be honoured for you to star in my production of 'Madame Butterball' as the good Madam herself! You have the perfect voice and star quality to do the character justice.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When it came down to it, Yumi doubted that she could even begin to gain that amount of weight in such a short amount of time. Mr Mentou had insisted that Yumi get used to wearing the fat suit before the first rehearsal, as he put it, he wanted her to act as natural as she could in several layers of rubber and foam designed to look like an obese woman. With that he had sent the suit to her apartment, along with a couple of sets of clothes, and the clear instructions that she was to wear it at least a couple of hours a day before rehearsals began in two weeks time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi found herself staring at the flesh coloured suit in some awe, it was almost worryingly realistic. The outer layer had been coloured to resemble her actual skin tone, and even had little details here and there that made it look so real. Yumi set down the letter that Mr Mentou had sent along with the suit, and pulled off her skirt and blouse to set about climbing into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was more difficult than she thought, as she stepped into the heavy set legs that would replace her own. Yumi tugged the suit up to her waist, gasping a little at how hard it was; it wasn't heavy in the slightest, but the size alone was cumbersome. She did up the back of the suit before wriggling her arms into the fleshier ones provided for her. She stepped from side to side to let the suit settle, before waddling to check out her reflection in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi giggled, the suit was incredibly realistic looking, even when uncovered by clothes. She turned to check out how far her stomach bulged out in front of her, how the breasts sat upon the top roll of flab, and how her behind curved out behind her. Her arms and legs were made to look fuller, and they even jiggled slightly as she moved. Yumi was in awe, it truly was a work of art, if it wasn't for her thin face, it was as if she had gained one hundred and fifty pounds in just a matter of moments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.. underwear first,\" Yumi bent over with some difficulty to pick up the underwear set that had been sent along with the suit, stepping into the panties and pulling the bra on over her much larger breasts; something, Yumi could openly admit she could do with. Once that was done, she wriggled into the A-line skirt and blouse Mr Mentou had supplied, noticing with some amazement that they were a little too tight on the fat suit; she wondered if he had done it in purpose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm definitely getting closer to looking like Madame Butterball,\" Yumi felt over her sides as she examined her fatter form in the mirror, giggling, \"Wow.\" She began waddling about the apartment to try and test it out, it felt a little warm in the suit, and it was taking some time getting used to being so much rounder. She had almost knocked off her drink from the side when she decided to stop and catch her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what..?\" </span></div></div>",

I should have thought this through.\" She led down on her softer front to try and ease the zip down from that direction, her fingers just brushed the zip, but she couldn't quite grab it. Yumi let out a whimper as she rolled over onto her back, looking at the way her fat stomach rose and fell into the air along with her own breathing, it was so eerily realistic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I'm stuck in here,\" Yumi muttered after a few more struggles to try and pull the zip down, while she now had hold of it, the zip was most definitely stuck in place, \"Oh.. I suppose I should call someone to come and help me.\" She wasn't sure which of her friends she wanted to see her like this, she would be a little embarrassed to be caught in such a strange suit, but it couldn't be helpd. Besides, it wasn't as if she didn't have a reason for having put it on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that she heard a knock at the door. Yumi froze in place as she sat up, her massive stomach pushed against her knees. Of all times, this was when someone had to call around? She tried to get up without making a sound, hoping that they would think she wasn't in. She slipped and fell, creating a loud sound that all but proved she was at home. Yumi winced a little, only relieved that the fat suit had cushioned her fall somewhat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... please wait!\" Yumi tried as she struggled up, panicking now as she tried to wriggle out of the suit, it just wasn't working, \"Please, one moment! Oh..\" she sighed as the knocking continued, and she made her way over to the front door to pull it open, looking a little sheepish, and ready to explain the reasoning behind what she was wearing. </span></div></div>",

Souji Seta, the boy she had had a hopeless crush on ever since he had moved to her hometown of Inaba. It had only been one year, one, amazing year, but Yumi had become quickly besotted with him. He had been there for her in both her acting, and when her father died, and he had even sent her flowers on hearing that she had graduated from the Arisato School for Drama. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now he was right there in front of her, handsome as ever, and even taller than before. Yumi groaned, and she just happened to be in a fat suit. Why wasn't life fair enough for her to be in a slinky outfit of some sort, or even a pair of sweats? Almost anything would be preferable than this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Souji spoke before Yumi could, his grey eyes drinking in every inch of Yumi's curves, \"You look amazing.\" If it wasn't for the sincerity in his tone, Yumi would have assumed he was kidding. But he wasn't, she swallowed a little on seeing how his eyes had darkened. Did he really like what he saw? He kept looking her up and down with the air of a starving man who had only just found something to eat, and Yumi felt the heat rise to her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould it be he liked her at a bigger size?</span></div></div>",

He took a moment, swallowing hard, before continuing to gaze at her openly once again. Yumi was simply beautiful in his eyes with so much weight piled onto her frame, each curve and bulge of flesh stretching her clothes to their very limits. He wanted to touch her, to hug her, but he kept himself in check as he dipped his head into a controlled nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look amazing,\" he responded sincerely, \"I mean it.\" Yumi felt herself blush, and for the briefest of moments, wished that she really was that big, just for him. Instead she waddled away into the lounge, aware that Souji's eyes were drawn to her rear, that swayed slightly as she walked. She was feeling a little warm inside the suit, not to mention flustered, and just a little turned on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you but.. I'm so,\" Yumi patted at her stomach, \".. big. I guess stress eating has it's drawbacks, huh?\" even her own lies were starting to get to her, the thought of so much food that would have made her so very big, \"Do you want a drink? Or something to eat?\" Yumi turned to face him, only just avoiding knocking over a vase with the curve of her hip; she swore Souji flinched a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It suits you,\" Souji insisted, moving closer to her, his handsome face hard to read right there and then, \"I can take you out for dinner. I insist?\" Yumi hesitated, it was one thing to tease the man she had a crush on in her own apartment, but going outside like this? The words of the director returned to her, she did have to test out the suit, right? She had to get used to it, to make it seem as if she were actually that big. If Souji noticed, she could simply admit she had to use it for her play. That would work. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to,\" Yumi smiled at him, waddling closer and nodding her head, \"Where did you have in mind?\" She couldn't care less about the food right there and then, she was more focused on getting to spend some time with the young man she hadn't seen for so long. She barely listened to Souji as he named a place, and grabbed her handbag off the side as she passed, somehow forcing the strap over her fatter shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi gave a little gasp as she stopped in her tracks, looking down to see just what the problem was. She went a little red on seeing that her hips had brushed the sides of her front door, and she moved forwards to tug herself free, turning to lock it with shaking fingers. She had heard a sharp intake of breath from Souji, and she smiled slowly to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be fun. </span></div></div>",

It was new, if she remembered rightly, and had just opened a couple of weeks ago. It wasn't far from where she lived, but she had yet to visit it; food for Yumi was a necessity, not a pleasure. She found herself waddling next to Souji, able to feel how the thighs of her fat suit rubbed together as she walked. She was suddenly well aware of all the looks she was getting, and the whispers that followed her bigger frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In here,\" Souji slipped his arm about Yumi's wide waist, she could only wish that she could feel it through the layers of her fat suit, and guided her inside to the restaurant, \"There's a lot to choose from.\" Yumi waddled inside with him, her face burning a little as she took a look about the room. Of course everyone who looked at her was going to assume that she was a fat pig, Yumi realised with a sigh, in a way, that was just so unfair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi found herself at one of the booths while Souji paid for them both, and she noticed with wide eyes that they were actually fairly narrow. She sat on the edge, and gingerly wedged herself into the seat. It took some effort, trying to get the fat suit to behave, and Yumi was a little tired by the time she had finally gotten it so that she was comfortable. She had to question why an 'All You Can Eat' had such narrow booths. She watched as the waitress set down a plate in front of her, cringing a little at the look she was given. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get you something,\" Souji took both his and her plates and disappeared before Yumi could even protest. She sighed, before leaning back in her seat, or at least trying to with her bigger frame. She couldn't get over how the place wasn't catered for the larger person, especially when it offered an all you can eat buffet. It bothered her a little more than she was willing to admit. After a moment, Yumi took out her phone from her bag, switching through the screens to bring up a clean page. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\"><i><div align=\"center\">NOTES<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPapa Monroe's All You Can Eat<br>\r\nBooths v.narrow<br>\r\nStaff v.unfriendly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot catered to bigger people??? </div></i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi looked up as she saw a plate filled with food put down in front of her, and she slipped her phone into her bag. She smiled, taking up her fork, and looking warily down at the fattening food that was piled high. There was no way she could manage to eat all of that, even if Souji was looking over at her with that sweet, expectant look that made her a little weak at the knees. With that she took up her fork, and began to eat. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
