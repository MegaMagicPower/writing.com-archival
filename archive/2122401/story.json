Pregnant Twilight laid down gently on her left side and carefully placed baby Twilight near her teats. \"Drink up sweetie.

Rubbing her pregnant tummy, Twilight began to imagine each and every single one of the fillies and colts inside the schoolhouse preparing for the day. It was likely from the overactive, child-at-heart imagination of her new daughter Pinkie Pie, but Twilight wasn't one to look away from a sweet little daydream like she was experiencing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the daydream, Twilight slowly saw as the fillies and colts sat down at their tables as Cheerilee walked up to the board and looked out at her students. \"Okay Class, today we have a special guest arriving to take us all home with her where she will take good care of us. So get properly dressed and ready for your mommy to step inside!\" The fillies and colts all smiled warmly to themselves as they reached into their desks and pulled out various foal supplies such as diapers, pacifiers, footie pajamas, blankets, teething rings, and diaper bags. The classroom began walking around, the students helping one-another get ready for the arrival of Mama Twilight, by taping up diapers and zipping up pajamas, several of them put pacifiers in their mouths while others chewed on teething rings or played with various dolls and toy blocks when they were done. \"M-Miss Cheerilee?\" Spoke a worried Scootaloo as she struggled to get her wings inside of her jammies, \"I-I can't get my jammies on!\" \"If you don't get fully dressed, than Mama Twilight will leave you behind.\" Scootaloo managed to get her little wings inside, only for her zipper to get stuck as she tried to undo it. \"Better hurry, I think that Mama is just outside the door now. And you know how she feels about tardiness.\" Twilight soon saw as her daydream turned into a nightmare for Scootaloo as small tears began to develop in the fillies eyes as she saw most of the rest of her class already dressed in their pajamas with poofy butts showing underneath them, several students were already playing with blocks or with dolls while the small orange pegasus was apparently going to be left behind.<br>\r\nTwilight had enough of this sorrow and imagined herself walking into the classroom like a superhero fresh from battling the bad guys as she smiled triumphantly at Scootaloo before picking her up and setting her down on top of her desk. \"Pr-Princess Twilight.\" Spoke Scootaloo with an apparent blush, \"I-I-I'm sorry, I couldn't get my jammies on properly. The zipper... it is-\" Twilight flashed a heroic smile once again, sunlight gleaning off of her perceft teeth. \"No pesky zipper is a match for my delicate touch, I will get this done for you, my baby.\" With a dramatic flourish, Twilight helped to unzip Scootaloos' footie and re-zip it up again in a dramatic fashion, taking care to avoid running it against Scootaloos' fur and her poofy diaper, finishing it at Scootaloos neckline where sunlight once-again glinted off of the Zippers' handle with an audible 'SHING!'<br>\r\nThe rest of the classroom erupted into wild cheers at Twilights' seemingly heroic deed, Scootaloo climbing onto Twilights arm and passionately kissing the princess on her lips. \"Thank you for saving me, Princess Twilight.\" \"Don't call me 'Princess Twilight'...\" proclaimed the lavendar Alicorn dramatically, \"...I am your Mommy. And it is my sworn duty to take in all of the Little Ponies of Equestria to make them into my babies forever and ever.\" Twilight stood upright as she saw Diamond Tiara walk up to her and sit down, her padding making an audible 'fwump!' And crinkled as she sat down to look up hopefully. \"Can you be <i>my</i> Mommy too?\"<br>\r\n\"ABSOLUTELY NOT!\" Screamed a shrill voice from the opposite doorway as a familiar older mare stepped inside, her nose upturned and having a ring for a Cutie Mark. Spoiled Rich, Diamond Tiaras' birth mother. \"I am not going to have you become a baby to this Princess. Get over here right now missy!\" \"NO!\" yelled Diamond Tiara as she clung to Twilights foreleg, \"You are no longer my Mommy! Twilight Sparkle is my Mommy!\" \"She is right, I am Diamond Tiaras' Mommy! And I will not tolerate any bullies making fun of my babies like you are doing!\" Replied Twilight as she cast her magic to remove Spoileds' dress and leave the mare naked on the floor.<br>\r\n\"I think it is time I made you learn how to go potty.\" Spoke Twilight as she landed atop Spoiled, their nether lips connecting together as Twilight sat down and began to pump and gyrate her hips up-and-down while Spoiled looked up at Twilight and blushed profusely. \"Wh-wha-what are yooouu...\" Spoiled couldn't hold back any longer as she felt her body tense up and orgasm from Twilights' powerful movements, the Princess in-question smiled as her own nether lips quickly sopped up Spoileds' femme cream, leaving not a drop before starting the process again.<br>\r\nSpoiled felt herself growing smaller and smaller as she couldn't help herself as she continued to pump baby batter into Twilights hungry cunny, Twilight for the most part maintained her patient and loving smile as she milked away the years from Spoiled Rich through their sexual hunger. 'Gulp!' 'Gulp!' 'GULP!' Twilight smiled as she looked at the newborn Spoiled sitting atop her cunny, the filly beaming with pride at going potty into Mama Twilight like a good baby. \"There's my baby girl, my little Sweet Milk.\" Crooned Twilight as she pecked a small kiss on Sweet Milk (formerly known as Spoiled Rich ne\u00e9 Spoiled Milk).<br>\r\nSweet Milk looked around at the classroom before landing her eyes on her former daughter Diamond Tiara, who was now smiling happily at her. \"Pwetty wady!\" Teethed Sweet Milk as she waved her hooves at Diamond Tiara happily, who came over to hug her former mother and plant a kiss on her forehead. \"I drank all of your potty Sweet Milk, it's time for you to go to sleep.\" Said Twilight as Diamond Tiara handed Sweet Milk back to Twilight who also kissed her daughter before hovering the baby over her gaping cunny. Sweet Milk smiled as she felt sleepiness start to overcome her as Twilight lowered the baby towards her vagina, slowly slurping to foal deep into her waiting body. Sweet Milks head was the only thing sticking out of Twilight as she levitated a pacifier into Sweet Milks' mouth as the sleeping filly began to suckle on it, the Alicorn blowing a kiss to the foal as her nether lips pulled the child inside and swallowed it into her womb where she belonged.<br>\r\n\"Attagirl, Sweet Milk... Mama Twilight will love you forever and ever...\" Twilight opened her eyes to see the entire class smiling up at her as several of them blushed as they saw Sweet Milk vanish into their Mommy, \"Come on Babies, there is plenty of room within Mama Twilight for all of you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight finished rubbing her clit as she came out of her daydream; having ended it with having sex with Cheerilee before regressing her to and tucking her inside with the rest of the class. Thankfully Twilight was quiet enough to have not been seen or noticed by any of the students around the wchool since they were all inside of the classroom still. They all needed to be tucked into her womb,  but she needed to figure out which of the student she planned on making into one of her babies first...</span></div></div>",

Twilight felt a panic attack coming on, but a jostle from Pinkie Pie had stolen her attention as she calmed back down for their sake. <i>Having a Family is going to be harder than I thought.</i> not wanting to have her sons and daughters taken away from her, and seeing somepony start to crest the hill of the schools' path, Twilight looked down at her pregnant belly and rubbed it before deciding to leave before she was noticed.<br>\r\nReturning to the nearby Sugarcube Corner unnoticed was slightly easy as she entered the former abode of her Quintuplet Baby Bakers. Twilight procured the back door key as she entered their/her home before locking the door behind her, and looking around the storefront, at how quiet it really was now. Twilight looked up at the clock, before looking back down at her belly sadly. \"It's two hours until you open today, I think that Pinkie said that there was going to be several birthdays and several deliveries to make around town. But how can you do that, knowing that I've stolen your lives away like this?\" Twilight was crying freely right now, weeping as she held her hooves around her beautiful, wonderful, terrifying womb, \"I am the worst mommy in all of Equestria...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You're not all that bad...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight opened her eyes upon hearing this. \"Oh no, is somepony in here with me?\" <i>We're here with you, Mommy. Don't be afraid!</i> Twilight felt a surge of magic envelop her horn as two motes of light flew out of her horn before landing around the room, manifesting as two very familiar ponies: Carrot Cake and Cup Cake. <i>This is unreal...</i> 'spoke' an amazed Carrot Cake as he glanced around the storefront, <i>The books always said that astralprojecting would require much concentration, but I barely put any effort into it.</i> Cup Cake walked over to stand next to her Husband-Brother <i>That's because our Mom is one of the most powerful ponies in all of Equestria, and that power is now added to by our combined magic.</i> both of them looked over to Twilight as they smiled. \"Y-you're astralprojecting from my womb?\" 'Cup Cake' walked towards Twilight, looking as though she was gliding across the floor as she moved to her before looking down at Twilights belly and gently reaching out to rub it. Twilight feeling her gentle movement. <i>I think I'm going to enjoy this, Mommy.</i> \"Enjoy wh-\" Before Twilight could properly ask, 'Cup Cake' looked up and kissed Twilight on her lips, taking her by complete surprise before settling in to the kiss as the princess returned the affection. \"Y-you're not mad at me for taking you away from everything you've ever known?\" 'Carrot Cake' rubbed his hoof sheepishly <i>Well, I was a little bit miffed that you had stolen Pound and Pumpkin first without telling us. Then stealing Pinkie Pie before taking us.</i>'Cup Cake' looked up at Twilight <i>But then we saw your dream, that wonderful world and understood the darkness that had long-dwelled within your heart...</i> Four more Motes flew from Twilights' horn as 'Pinkie Pie' landed on her back before wrapping her hooves around Twilight in a hug. 'Maud' leaned against Twilights left side as 'Pound' and 'Pumpkin' floated next to Twilights' face, planting small delicate kisses on her cheeks. Twilight soon realized what it was that they were trying to say to her as a single tear rolled down her cheek before being lapped up by 'Pound Cake' as he looked sadly at her...<br>\r\n\"...I am Immortal... and you are not...\" <i>We were once Mortal</i> Explained 'Maud' as she rubbed her head next to Twilights' neck, <i>We are born, we live, we grow old, and we die... that is what everypony knows, but we never realized how sad and lonely it is for you until last night.</i> Twilight 'felt' a tear roll down her neck as she looked back at 'Pinkie' still hugging her tightly, tears flowing down from her face <i>You would be all alone with nopony left that you once knew, and we would be just gone forever!</i> wailed 'Pinkie' her form shifting to become the little filly that Twilight last saw her as. Twilight grabbed 'Pinkie' in her magic as she levitated the pink foal around to give her a hug to calm her down. \"It's okay Baby, Mommy is here right now.\" Twilight planted a kiss on the hiccuping foal as her tears slowed, \"And I will never let you go.\" 'Pinkie' smiled as she kissed Twilight back, her mane and coat practically glowing like a star in that moment as they shared the affection. <i>We realized that you need to do this, for your sake as well as our own.</i> 'Carrot Cake' explained further as 'Pound' floated over to his Dad-Brother. <i>We will try to help you out, Mommy.</i> Twilight looked over as she heard 'Pumpkin Cake' speak to her, <i>I don't need to know how to speak to talk with you.</i> 'Pumpkin Cake' pecked the side of her new Mommys' face before floating over to her Mom-Sister 'Cup Cake'. \"You're the best babies a Mom could ask for.\" Cried a happy Twilight as she ran over to hug them, her body passing through their ghostly forms before Twilight was caught in a multi-hued glow of magic as she was carefully lowered onto her hooves. <i>Be careful, there's seven of us inside and growing remember?</i> Twilight blushed as she gently rubbed her pregnant belly, conveying how much she really loved them all.<br>\r\n\"So what happens now?\" <i>Now?</i> chuckled 'Carrot Cake' as he glided over to the counter as he picked up his apron and put it on, <i>I think we need to get ready for the day.</i> 'Cup Cake' floated next to him as she was given her apron <i>Need to keep up appearances after all, don't want our Brothers and Sisters to catch on what Mommy is planning for their many, many Surprise Birthdays and Adoptions!</i> \"Can you even bake in this state? I passed right through you after all.\" <i>Relax Mommy Twilight!</i> smiled 'Pinkie' as she somersaulted overhead in a multiple backflip before reverting into her grown up appearance again, <i>Just go upstairs to sleep off with the others. This is our bakery after all.</i> Twilight felt 'Maud' gently pick up her hoof as she walked over to the stairwell. <i>You will need to try and rest up for tonight, your body may be that of an Alicorn but any pregnancy takes energy out of the Mares. I had to help take care of Mom before Marble, Limestone, and Pinkie were born so I know what I'm doing.</i> Twilight ascended the stairs as her daughters and son set out to work inside of the storefront as 'Pound' and 'Pumpkin' ran up the stairs after her before leaping into Twilights tummy and vanishing <i>Don't worry about us, Mommy.</i> spoke the 'voice' of Pound Cake inside of her head, <i>We'll fall back asleep with you.</i> Twilight smiled as 'Maud' led her up the stairs and back into...</span></div></div>",

I think I can craft a spell that will siphon off the majority of that power from you and transfer it into my body that way I can hide my wonderful, beautiful belly from the world and travel much easier without having to struggle and hide all the time.\" \"In order to do that,\" added 'Pumpkin Cake' as she levitated her own book, \"We will need to turn you back into a hatchling again, not all the way back into an egg like before.\" The Cartoon Spike was shrunk back down to a smaller hatchling size as it crawled towards Twilight. \"You will need to crawl through my vagina and into my womb for me to absorb your powers of growth, then transmit that energy directly into all of my babies to have their bodies shrink down so I can fit more inside of me.\" Twilight dissipated the cartoon.</span></div></div>",

The three mares made their way to Maud's 'former' home to see if the monotone mare was there. Twilight was slightly behind the other two due to what was about to happen when they got to the cave.

Starlight noticed that Twilight was lagging a bit and asked if she was alright. Twilight smiled and said that she just getting lost in her thoughts.

Twilight muttered, thankfully unheard over the din Cup Cake was making. Over the din Cup was making. It finally hit Twilight what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat have I done!? Twilight thought in alarm. Pinkie decided to chime in then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh! My Gosh! Mrs. Cake! When did you get pregnant again!?! Pinkie asked suddenly excited. When were you going to tell me you were giving Pound and Pumpkin siblings! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCup Cake shot Pinkie a glare. Tonight! She screamed. I just suddenly felt a weight and when I woke up I was like this! She screamed scared and confused at how she was suddenly ready to give birth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie! Carrot pleaded looking at the pink party pony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie scratched her head in confusion trying to figure out how this happened. Twilight was rubbing her chin muttering under her breath about the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Mrs. Cake like this though caused a twinge of guilt to pass through the invisible princess. <br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I should reverse this?\u201d She thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw the effects of the spell after all and could write up some notes on it now.  A counter spell combined with a sleep spell and maybe the Cakes and Pinkie would wave it off as a bad dream. Twilight wasn\u2019t eager to explain that she had cast a spell that had put Pound and pumpkin back in their mother\u2019s womb after all. She could always find volunteers later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied Twilight lite up her horn ready to cast<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He could easily sleep on Luna's muzzle with his whole body with maybe his tail dangling off that side if anything. He has fur that resembles that of Luna's but has a white mane and tale, and sky blue eyes. Some of the caretakers say his name suits him, because his fur is so close to the princess. Now, he's no awesome flyer, and is a bit of a late bloomer in means of flying skills. In fact, his walking skills are a little underdeveloped, and he sometimes trips while trotting as if he were a toddler, but to many who have witnessed him in person, they found it adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps Luna feels great sympathy for the colt's situation, and feels making him her son by blood would be the right thing to do, even if adopting him or not is involved as well. Or maybe she just finds him way too adorable to not be her son, that she has to make him her son. Make him an alicorn would make him 1000 times more adorable then he already is. Plus, she might want to see the look on Blueblood's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you want to choose this option?</span></div></div>",

You'd learned that such behavior is par for the course in living in a matriarchal society where the females outnumber the males.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could probably use a little snack for the long trip here before heading off to Spoiled's place, which by the sound of things is a relatively large and comfortable manor full of rooms to explore<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a pretty good-sized bag of bits given to you by Celestia to spend here in town, and she had informed you that Spoiled would be providing the rest and not to worry about money, which sounded like a pretty great deal.<br>\r\nNot having to worry about financial troubles any more suits you just fine, especially when it comes with the promise of free sex.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you near the point indicated on the map you notice a building that looks like it was baked rather than built<br>\r\nA large wooden sign outside is emblazoned with the words Sugar Cube Corner in a fancy font with a secondary sign with a pink frosted cupcake hangs above the front entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like this is your stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you neared the front entrance you heard some noise coming from inside that sounded like talking and laughing and the faint sound of music playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You went inside as the crowd makes space for you, you entered as the Ponies, mostly, no, all mares and even fillies come for you giving you a friendly wave and a bright smile, some had a rather lewd stare and licking their lips rather visibly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked as the party started to go on full swing now that you were here. A Pink mare with noble-esque outfit appears before, she had a non-sense look on her eyes despite smiling lightly. She was flanked by a dark-orange mare in a purple business vest with blond mane and tail and has a very stern and critical eye on you, she has a trophy as a Cutie Mark and a Blue quite chubby mare with rosy mane and tail with pink cupcakes as Cutie Mark that was giving you a kind, warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, greetings, Welcome to Ponyville, Anon.\" You blinked, did she know your name?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spoiled Rich.\" Wait, that's her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm quite aware of you, Hard to miss a pleasant-looking ape-man in weird clothing. The Princess has been quite detailed on your description, among other things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope you like the snacks and pastries around here, Daerie, I made them myself.\" The Blue Mare says \"Chifflon Swirl or Cup Cake. Although the majority calls me Mrs. Cake, I'm the owner of Sugarcube Corner, alongside my 'Husband' Carrot Cake, a pleasure to meet you, daerie. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harshwhinny. Mrs. Harshwhinny for you.\" The Orange mare, Harshwhinny stated in a very rigid and harsh tone \"If you gonna be in a herd, you better stay fit, knowledgable and active, I don't want a slobbering, lazy stallion making a horrible impression and you're not winning any point with me, already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harshie, dear, You should loosen up, we are in a party, no an office or activity that requires peak physical conditions.\" The mentioned mare looked at Mrs. Cake with a sneer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are always too soft, Chiffon. I can't believe how this place is still standing with such mindset\" In that Ms Cake lost her smile and stared at the elitist mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No all require a stern hoof, when you will you learn that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me..\" You say caught the attention of the mares again \"But Princess Celestia only mentioned that after catching up with Spoiled, a herd can be built up from there.\" Spoiled nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the idea.\" She says \"However, for that very reason I sponsored this party and had it filled with almost of all ponyville's female population which is 87% of all Ponyville, So the herd can be formed far faster by the end it, so you better be looking around, chat a little, enjoy the party with whatever mare that catch your eye\" Your eyes widen in surprise \"Oh, don't be surprised, Anon. Just remember, I'm the lead mare of this new Herd. The first offspring born will be coming from me and not before or our herd is broken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spoiled, daerie, I think you're intimidating him.\" Chastised Cup Cake \"Does even matter if you're lead mare, does the position even have any meaning in this day and age?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's how it should be, Chiffon,\" Harshwhinny commented, looking approvingly. \"A stallion must always listen to their mares, that's how society works in Equestria.\" Well, no really, you can attest that since you come from a male dominant world, You mean, isn't that female doesn't have power but men were all leading figures through history and are still even with many progressive and feminist movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, You're right, Swirly but Harsh also has a point.\" She looked at you with a small scowl \"If you want to stay up and be important and relevant enough, you better listen to me.\" She stated with a commanding voice but then her tone got soft again \"Your luggable will be taken by my staff and bring them to my mansion so you don't have to carry them always with you.\" You noted two new ponies on your sides, beckoning for your belongings, you, assuming that was her staff, put your stuff and bags on the floor which the ponies under her care took and exited the building with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Spoiled, your new 'Lead' Mare and she looked pleased. \"Good, enjoy the party, Me and my associates will be upstairs in case you want some more... <i>private</i> time with us.\" She winked to you \"Let's go, girls\" and with that, she and Ms. Harshwhinny left to upstairs, giving an ample view of their shapely behind, their tails raised giving you an excellent view of their winking vulva and part of their teats, Ms. Cake, however, stayed a bit longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that Spoiled and Harsh might look and act quite commanding and intimidating, dearie but they're good mares just don't listen to the whole 'Lead' Mare thing, that position is merely a title from archaic times, after all, she always wants to remind everypony that she is the one on top in every way. Just enjoy yourself, this is your party although...\" Her eyes turned into a sultry look \"If you truly feel like <i>unloading</i> some steam, You can always count on us or in me\" She winked to you and went to follow her friends upstairs. You saw her tail rising giving view to her slit and her much bigger jiggling flanks which were very hypnotic, you also saw her teats, that were visibly bigger compare to the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, the first impressions were important and so far, you were quite mixed. Spoiled and Harshwhinny were controlling and quite elitist mares and Cup seems to be the only one more sane and reasonable enough and she vouched for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were willing to give them a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile you...</span></div></div>",

Cup simply giggled on the rather childish display. You simply didn't mind as you took out your pants and undies, revealing your erected prick on front of her, this caused them to gasp on the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope its enough to satisfy you all and... hope you all aren't weirded out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weirded out? Dearie, It looks marvelous.

You shrugged and aligned your dick to her slit and then pushed inside. Spoiled grunted which morphed into a moan. You groaned feeling her tight convulsing around your shaft until you pushed all the way, bumping onto her ringed cervix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my Celestia!\" Spoiled gasped \"It's so big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unf!\" You grunted \"So tight! Didn't you gave birth to a daughter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh.\" Cup Cake giggled \"I don't know about your females, Anon, but we mares have great muscular control down there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chiffon is right, huff!\" Spoiled smiled lewdly to you panting, looking barely resisting to cum \"Boy, you're really something, Hadn't been felt something this big ever since Tiara's birth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought stallions were bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're big on <i>girth</i> Ahh~! But you're not that short either.\"She grins \"Come on, Big boy, move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grunt but obeyed beginning on moving your hips back and forth slowly just to feel her velvety flesh constrict on your flesh, she moaned, this time far louder as your pick up the pace until \"AhAHHH!\" You felt her pussy convulse again as your cock and crotch got bather as it gets tighter and tighter, almost like trying to milk you but you weren't anywhere done, You felt her tunnel got even more slippery as she panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Did she just.... orgasmed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my Celestia...\" She panted tiredly but looked at you quite strangely \"Why... you didn't cum...\" She looked a bit stricken, on shock \"I ... am not good for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I-I mean... didn't expected you to cum so soon.\" You say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.. soon?\" The Rich mare stared you strangely \"Stallions last for 2 minutes or so\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... That's it?\" You chuckled, Oh boy, you going to blow her mind, almost literally  \"Well, let me tell you that Humans last for far longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How... longer?\" As a response you began to move again surprising her, causing her to shriek as your penis pounded the quivering gates of her cervix, each time you pounded her she released a cutely moan and another silent-is scream as she came again but you didn't stop pounding her sensitive marehood, her tongue lolling out of her open mouth and her eyes looking up lost with tears of pleasure rolling out on her face only to tense again feeling another orgasm coming<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarshwhinny and Cup Cake stared agape at the rather raw mating prowess of the human as he pounded Spoiled's foal canal multiple times as she orgasm again and again and he hadn't cum yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long he last?!\" Harsh asked mortified, her eyes can't take the mating taking place \"Spoiled has come like...5-\" \"AHH!\" \"6 times already and he hadn't come a single load!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's until they heard you grunting \"Maybe you spoke too soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too soon?\" Harsh looked at Cup on disbelief \"That's a bucking miracle, for a minute I was worried!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignore their bickering as you focused on sexing this mare, rutting her brains out but you were approaching your limit, you looked down seeing her face and couldn't help but feel a bit guilty. she was quite mentally broken and exhausted, she has a mess of a face lost in her orgasmic world, You guessed that she was the one taking the dominant position but here, This is where you triumph over that controlling nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spoiled I... Gonna cum!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Cum?\" She drawled out and mewled on the sensation of another orgasm coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugn! Yep..!\" You started to increase you pace, she felt with her sensitive convulsing walls you rob twitch and throb, her cervix started to dilate after so many poundings and orgasms \"Have my children!\" You pushed deep as you can, pounding for one last time on the gates of her womb and came hard inside of her, filling her with your warm essence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink mare screamed out a final orgasm as she felt her womb finally receive the humans' seed. filling up her organ like a water balloon in three burst blast directly into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... warm...\" She pants, looking at where you dick and pussy join each other, your mass twitch as it pumped more seed into her hungry tunnel. \"I gonna get pregnant for sure...\" she smiles as she rests her head on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you ended filling her, you sighed and pulled out carefully, You hear her yelp but sighed after your withdrawal. Both, marehood and your penis drenched with mixed sexual fluid, mostly Spoiled's since it was all her orgasms that covered your dick first then the remnant of your semen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok, Spoiled?\" You asked in concern, she looked at you with an exhausted smile as she rubs her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... Goodness gracious yes..\" She looked at you you could've sworn seeing hearts within those opal colored eyes of hers \"Thank you Anon, for this gift.\" Well, it seems that you won several points with her, you smile at her and gave her quick kiss on her lips, you noted that almost no much leaked from her over-stuffed foalhole, she really wanted that foal and lucky for the other mares, you were still hard, of course, you weren't fully satisfied, it been a long while since you had any actions, a single filling to a mare won't be enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the other mares that were gawking at you and your still hard prick, they have hearts in their eyes and were positively drooling in both mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon one snapped out of her trance and it was..</span></div></div>",

Ah thing you're a scarin' the poor fella.\" Approached an orange pony with blond mane and tail two apples as Cutie Marks She has a strong and thick southern accent, she gave you a confident smile \"Howdy! Names Apple Jack, Ya must be that hooman critten from Canterlot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human actually but Yes, My name is A-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my Lord! What are you wearing!?\" You heard a dramatic remark \"Oh no no no no, That's absolutely dreadful!\" Came a white mare with curly violet and dark blue mane with diamonds as Cutie Mark, she looked like about to faint just by staring at you or rather your clothes \"Whoever made you wear that... thing... do not have a sense of fashion at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rarity..

No-Sense-Of-Persona-Space after pretty much invading your room for whatever sample she could gather from you. She smiles happily \"Anon! You're here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Twilight.\" You greeted her cordially but a bit restrained, she approaches you, a bit slow but her friendly smile turned into lewd grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you did take up on my offer. did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No actually..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, why you're here for then?\" She growls predatorily. \"It is my sweet charm, my friendly personality, or my purple gropable flanks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight...\" She giggles<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just joking Anon, I'm glad you're visiting! Hope is the promise of lifting tails and snuggling cute needy mares cough you in.\" You sighed. But the girls giggled. Twilight was the other pony that knows much about you so, She has similar views as Celestia regarding how stallion must act but are conscious enough that you come from a patriarchal society but instead of being surprised of that or even struggling to think of that, she sees it as a huge win-win for all parties involved. after all, No many Stallions aren't sexually active unless is in heat season, humans are sexually active all day, everday, especially men and to make things interesting, she was the one that discovered that you were compatible 100% with ponies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is where the flirty, mischievous part of her replaced her friendliness and the promises of sex started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she does that to mess with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm here because I'm moving in with Spoiled Rich.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh! Does this mean you are also into Older Mares?\" Twilight smirks \"Oh Anon, you're so deviant! Maybe I should warn my mother about your evil schemes but that makes her come straight after you instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I could tell Mrs. Cake! She is a super close friend with Spoiled Rich!\" Pinkie giggled \"She loves when catching stallions and colts staring her plushy rear! and loves to give them warmth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My momma might not be around but Ah can guarantee ya some fresh fertile <i>plot</i> of land that needs sum seeding!\" The Apple Mare hinted quite provocatively while swaying her flanks \"If ya catch my drift, Sugarcube.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, My mother is the adventurous type, and have quite a taste for the exotic and unique when my father is around attending his herd mates. I would watch my back if I were you, Anon dear.\" Rarity commented offhandedly. \"After all, my dear sister got her... hyperness from her and she can be quite a handful in your case. I can guarantee\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehh gals,, Ah don't wanna interrupt but where is Rainbow?\" Apple Jack<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RIGHT HERE!\" The sudden voice comes from above and landed on the front of you, the mare was blue, cyan in color with rainbow-colored mane and tail with a rainbow thunderbolt as a cutie mark. \"Never missing a party and no planni-- oh oh! Look on this dude! He is huge!\" She says straight to you, she then smirks \"Hiya, I'm Rainbow Dash! Best flyer in all Equestria and you must be that... ape male thing, what's again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human. I'm human, Nice to meet you, miss dash, names' Anon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shush, Nothing of miss, Miss is my mother, Also, You are all talking about lonely mothers? Trust me, you really don't wanna meet mine, she'll leave you crazy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, I think we should leave him be.\" Fluttershy started, seeing that some mares were staring were having some jealousy glares \"Ponies here will think we're hoarding him, especially with Spoiled sponsoring this party and you know how she'll get when mares act so pushy with her Stallions around.\" Stallions? does this mean that she has more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmyes, You're right, dear.\" Rarity agreed and looked at you then your clothes, she adopted a look of pity \"Sad, I would love to have you as my lead Stallion, even if it just put those rags you call clothes on fire so I can make you a more fashionable set.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, personally, he is wearing too much, Rares.\" The Farm mare turn to you \"Ya gotta go naked around here, Sugarcube, Else ya'll havin' a stroke with all that over your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it hides all the goods too, you teaser! You gotta let those foalmakers breathe- Off!\" She got a hoof shoved to her mouth by Twilight who gave you a sheepish smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What my friend is trying to say is that... Welcome to Ponyville and may you have a great time around here.\"She then let go but Rainbow didn't look amused on her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Twilight what gives- Oh..\" It was she noted that there were more mares looking, all having that same look of jealousy \"We should go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, See you around Anon!\" The girls went away from you, feeling a bit intimidated by the glares. Isn't that they were going away from the party but rather giving you space since there were far more ponies that likely wants to meet you. They were a nice bunch, though, a bit straight forward but seeing that Spoiled Rich was the one sponsoring this party, it means that she was nearby or at least here, alternatively, since this is a party. you could be run onto some other pony, here everyrone was colorful and telling which one is one its gonna be difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou...</span></div></div>",

You weren't mean to look for them but it seems that fate has things store for you and this particular group of ponies, You try to not be as noticeable <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hello, look who followed us, girls!\" Twilight smirked at you \"You're finally here to admit and proclaim your undying love for us?\" The rest giggled you blushed but straighten yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I was here for the snacks.\" You chuckled \"So yeah. My undying love for snacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Ah do have some snacks fer ya, right here, Sugarcube.\"Applejack winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was the one that baked, I poured a lot of love on them!\" Pinkie chirped but then rubbed her chin \"Mrs Cake added the milk though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sighs* Girls, While I apretiate the gesture and all but... isn't that too forward? like, I hadn't been here less than ten minutes and a party has been thrown on me, sponsored by Spoiled and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, pardon for the interruption, Darling but allow us to understand.\" Rarity start. \"You say you were here to meet with Spoiled Rich, correct?\" She says, you nodded \"Can you tell us for why? It might give you a hint for the answer as to why there is a party around you.\" She grins \"This isn't a normal 'Welcome to Ponyville' party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie giggles \"Yes it isn't~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Celestia told me that is important for me to... expand my bloodline.\" You say slowly without sounding vulgar \"She want to ensure that humankind doesn't die out with me and want me to a build a Herd starting with Spoiled but..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was meant to meet her on her home but this party caught me out and well..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the thing, Spoiled Rich, the very mare that expects you called this party for one reason.\" Twilight, stated, \"To build this herd sooner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! There is no even a single <i>stallion</i> here, almost all the mares of Ponyville were invited!\" Pinkie revealed, \"Spoiled Rich has been really specific for this party and went in detail that want you to feel as inclusive as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An odd strategy.\" Rarity revealed, \"Spoiled Rich's herds usually have her as the lead mare, as the first to met and mate to conceive a child that solidifies her at the position of power.\" She says \"Normally, The Cast System within Herds are outdated but it helps to micromanage, it is odd why she wants a herd formed in a party that has the highest chance for a large number of foals to be conceived and give up the leading position.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is not unless its an Open Herd.\" Twilight started \"Open herds don't have so many restrictions, You can have as many mares you want but those Mares are free to leave if they want, It is used on small towns where there are a very finite number of stallions. It also has no lead mares but head mares, those whose positions are more permanent regardless of who conceived the foals first, They help to manage the stallion, breeding, and the herd population. Since you're the last of your kind here, being an Open Herd is a must for you in order to expand your race's bloodline among many mares as possible..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that Spoiled mare will manage you for that.\" Applejack says \"Sorry Sugarcube but you now count as her propriety now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?\" Her property. doe that means that you're bound to her, You didn't like it \"Does that make me a Breeding Stud?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty Much, *Whif* Uff! a very precious and good smelling <i>Breeding </i>Stud.\" Rainbow says very close to you now. Her eyes half-open eyes. You instinctively stepped back as she approached only for her to stop, being held by the tail by Applejack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that bad.\" Fluttershy reasoned \"Lots of mares here are really friendly and supportive and would genuinely love to be with you and birth you foals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It also shows how this town is quite... desperate for male attention. Lately, all of our stallions are already in herds and there are still many mares that aren't, we included, as results, this kind of parties are made for Stallions to choose suitable mates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alternatively; However, You can have sub-herds\" Twilight noted, \"Mini Herd within herds, Most Open Herds can get too large to manage and to make it more organized, multiple mares can be elected to lead mares of a specific group within the herd.\" Twilight smirks \"So... Are you ready to accept us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We weren't looking for stallions but this party and Pinkie reminded us that.. we <i>really</i> need male company.\" Twilight confessed, \"Like needed really bad..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mah Bother has his own herd of lovely mares, folks that would make great additions to the Apple bloodline But his herd is full and even then, Ah can't be there for being siblings.\" Applejack looked down \"And Caramel left da town to tend his own, turns out that he has his own herd, also full.\" She smiles rather apologetically \"Ahh Shunks, Ah may sound like a desperate mare but I do really need some younguns in mah life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I used to be a herd with Thunderdale but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were too intense that he and his herd mates urged you to leave.\" Fluttershy added with a smile, Rainbow grumped \"And so were Soarin's and..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know.,\" Rainbow says in a hissing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in an open herd with Cheese Sandwich!\" She hopped around you like a certain cartoon skunk \"We even made Lil'Cheese Pie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheese Pie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheese and Pinkie's foal.\" Fluttershy smiles \"The most cutest thing produced on Cheese's herd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the only one!\" Pinkie happily added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And... what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still in the herd, kind of\" She shrugs \"Cheese's herdmates are very jealous of me.\" Pinkie grins as she sways her jiggling, motherly round flanks toward you \"I'm the only gal that gave him a foal~\" She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, her position on the herd is rather shaky at best but only secured because of her foal but since she is an Open Herd...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can be in another herd if I want~\" Pinkie confirmed rather openly as she leaned on you and sniffed and shuddered in delight \"Oh Nonny~ My oven is ready to put another bun if you like!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It reminds me that I really need to step up on my game, I don't want to be like one of those lone mares so consumed to their job. Oh no no no no! I would love to be in your herd, Darling.\" She growled, \"The fun things we can do together, the love we could make would be heard by the entirely of Equestria!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always wanted to be a mother.\" Fluttershy said with a smile and rosy blush adorning her face \"But can't have a little foal to pamper and dote without a stallion to do the same.\" she squee'd<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah, you're all into that lovey dubby stuff, I just want to rut with you senseless.\" Rainbow Dash started truthfully with a lustful grin \"I will never leave your side, I will show you the best moves from the Cloppasutra and if we somehow get any foal, it'll be the most awesome foal ever conceived and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gonna love it, and dote it and cling it and never leave it alone.\" Fluttershy giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Rainbow, You say that you and your parents had nothing on common but we see the contrary\" The girls giggled while Rainbow blushed in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up..\" Rainbow says rather lamely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.. what do you say Anon? Do you accept us as your sub-herd?\" Twilight winked on you, You really don't have much of a choice in the matter, besides they were openly offering themselves to you, you were having some hesitation on Pinkie, apparently, she is already in one herd and had a foal yet she seems to not mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'll never understand Pony customs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I take up your offer-\" The small group of ponies cheered and went for a group hug on you, surrounding you with their playful and soft furry bodies..</span></div></div>",

It happens similarly with Mare Predators, their ovaries would generate a special egg cell containing the Soul and DNA upon fertilization would trigger the reformation. Upon rebirth, the foal would have an accelerated childhood between 2 and 4 months before returning back to their previous age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of this lifestyle and nutrients gained, Ponies have an extended lifespan and considered this a blessing rather than a curse to the point the princesses decided to abandon the research for a cure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen ponies adopt, the colt or filly can choose to become related biologically to their new parents through another version of the spell that instead of devouring them, they eat the children through their genitalia, re-conceive and rebirth them as member of their adoptive family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were worried about coming here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the reasons why Twilight Sparkle and Shining Armor are so powerful or talented is because their parents were the most successful predators in Canterlot before getting them. Twilight was conceived when her parents reached to almost alicorn level of magical power, almost all that power went to her upon her birth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo wonder she was Celestia's student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile walking through the large cavernous tube, Celestia proudly confesses that Equestria was and still is big on flaunting their sexuality openly and is a Paradise for those that overlook their voraphile tendencies. So you shouldn't be ashamed of ogling married mares or even stallions because they wouldn't be offended but rather flattened and would see that as an invitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know what was supposed to mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I mean is that Cup Cake or any married mare would allow you to rut her if you wish..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nW-What? She is a married mare and with children, Princess, that's committing adultery!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's how you call it?\" She says and pouted \"The more I'm with you, the more I see parallels between you and the Griffins.\" She chuckles, this was a face you didn't see with Celestia in the show... well, you did, Celestia turns out to be the adventuring type while Luna wanted to have some calm vacation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever that means Anon, just to let you know that it might be a good idea to spread your kind in Equestria, might as well starting here .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP-Princess? what do you mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Anon, we're going to this mare's ovaries, tell me, don't you wanna unwind yourself there?\" She gave you a sly smile. \"Getting inside a Mare's privates, doesn't that have an effect on you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess! what are you suggesting to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here!\" The princess announced as she presented the end of the oviduct, in front of you two were a large spheroid blocking your path, there was a sphincter there, opening up.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

During ancient times when stallions were plentiful, broodmares were often sought to expand the bloodline among the elite or to breed large armies in few years as we Ponies tend to mature fast.\" She then looked at the sphincter \"Broodmares have diverse genetics as well, it is why Mrs. Cake managed to birth twins of both different tribes and not Earth Ponies.\" She smiles \"Would be that wonderful? to seed your kind within this mare?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess, won't be that rape? to force Mrs. Cake to carry a huge burden without her consent?

Although I won't say it like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carrot won't flush you through the Toilet if that happens and despite no having her consent, she'll forgive you.\" Celestia's smile again \"Broodmares find elation in pregnancy, in carrying foals, This is why the most successful and actives predators are broodmares because it gives them the feeling without the stress of pregnancy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich would turn into a real one If I get crazy and unload in her ovary, just how many are in there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possibly hundreds in this ovary alone. It's a good number.\" The Princess flared her wings \"Get on, we need to get to our final destination and how souls are transferred.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou complied and got over the princess' back, you also notices another smell coming from her flank, sweet and vanilla but strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said she was in heat and the smell and strong pheromones can incite other mares to get in heat as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Princess took flight and zoomed into the giant ovary, the sphincter closed behind, you grew alarmed by it that you tell the princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, we can always teleport.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fleshy tunnel cavern was expansive, hundreds of egg cells on every corner and inch, glowing with multicolored intensity. Through their colorful but transparent membranes, each nucleus has cutie marks no necessarily reflecting a pastry or baker talent but switch every five seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guessed that the eggs' marks could reflect what the foal would gain as a special talent. Celestia nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guessed right, Anon, Those ovas contains the magical profile of the mother and her ancestry but necessarily means that it would dictate the special talent of her possible offspring, it is why it shifts every few seconds. Twilight would give you better insight but as for now, our target lies in front of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to ask what she meant only to see an gigantic pink ova rotating and pulsing with electrical-magical arcs coursing through the flesh above and below, as a reactor of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is it, Anon, the secret of the respawn spell in a mare!\" She proudly stated \"See those electrical charges licking the flesh? its raw magic transmitting and receiving from the host to the egg and vice-versa, when the soul is contained in the mare's body, the egg will receive the soul to be contained in it, the egg will too receive the prey's genetical data and rewrite the genetical material to be almost identical to the prey's original body then this egg will roll out from the ovary and onto the uterus to wait for the sperm to begin the respawning process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded understanding, It was basically cloning the old body in the womb. you ask if it also includes the species. the Princess nods<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Devoured griffons are rebirthed as griffons, dragons, although rare, are born the same, Kirin, changelings. All are born identical... with few deviations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned but went to ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Griffins gaining horn and ability cast magic through it, Dragons with manes or hair, Kirin with Pegasis wings, Changelings with connection to the soil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould it be the same for humans?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... in theory..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...In Theory?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know, It was never done with humans, Anon. You're the first and only human here and for all we know, you might suffer a complete species change, this is why I tell you to spread your kind here, It is preferable not to render humanity extinct by accident and rebirthing you like a pony or have your genes completely replaced with Equestrians...

Some unbelievable, like she swallowing an orphanage and her husband reconceiving them anew but the local orphanage disconformed this claim as no foal was swallowed or eaten and all was accounted for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore come around but all pointed that she was pregnant for real which was... strange as they never intended to make more foals (which added to your guilt and fear, you could see Carrot angrily chasing you to eat you and never reform you.) However, they saw this as a blessing and were happy to bring more darlings to the world. You rather not to think of your possible demise, you hoped that your last moments of life weren't before the eventual birth and want them to be around, to see them grow and be raised like it should.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were the father but you were terrified to admit it, after all, it was Celestia's fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided that it was fair to visit them, especially checking on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour little trek brought you to the gingerbread-looking building, you gulped the knot you didn't know you had on your throat but sighed and making yourself a little brave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you see  upon entering was a Pink blur crashing on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anon!\" Pinkie's face stared you with a huge smile. \"You came! youcameyoucameyoucame!\" She then hugs you \"Oh I'm so happy you're finally getting out of your shell!

It started like a gasp \"Dearie! You look awful!\"<br>\r\nYou sighed again and cast your eyes \"I... I don't know, Mrs. Cake. I just don't know anymore. It seems like everything I know has just been flipped on its head and I don't know what to do next.\"<br>\r\nThere was a short pause as she considered your words and then, \"Do you want to talk about it?\" she asked softly.<br>\r\n\"I don't know if it will help, honestly.\"<br>\r\nMrs. Cake gave a small hum and smiled. \"Well, you'll never know until you try. What seems to be the problem? I promise I won't judge.\" <br>\r\n\"Well... It all started when  CelestiaaaaAAAH\u2014\"<br>\r\nYou shrieked in surprise and very nearly fell out of your chair when you turned to face Mrs. Cake and got the shock of your life.<br>\r\nMrs. Cake was now standing above you looking at you with deep concern.<br>\r\nSomehow, someway, she had grown 4 times her original size so that she now towers above you.(edited)<br>\r\n\"Holy... Mrs. Cake! w-what happened to you? Y-You're big!\" What is this? what happened to her, she was huge! You froze in fear of her bigger form.<br>\r\n Now you think she is gonna be your death instead of Carrot.<br>\r\n Was this effect of the pregnancy you -gulp- inflicted on her?<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Your bout of wild panic caused a flash of fear In Mrs. Cake's expression and her voice took on a panicked tone of her own. \"Anon? Anon! What's wrong? Tell me what's the matter. You're scaring me!\"<br>\r\n  You took several deep breaths almost to the point of hyperventilating and forced yourself to calm down.<br>\r\n \"S-sorry is just seeing in your this... b-big, kind of surprised me.. really surprised me.\" You said, in a 'calm' or at least trying to remain calm voice. \"Please, don't be scared it won't be good for the babies, right? I'm just trying to figure it how you're now towering over me when days ago, you were around my abdomen.\"<br>\r\n  Mrs. Cake's features visibly relaxed and her expression changed to a small smile.<br>\r\n  \"Oh thank goodness, you really had me going for a minute there.\"<br>\r\n  \"Yeah...\" You say, pushing away the image of a furious giantess mare coming for you from your mind. \"So... You had grown, how? does it have to do with your pregnancy?\"(edited)<br>\r\n  Mrs, Cake shrugged. \"I don't rightly know. It's pony biology I guess? I shot up a few inches when I was pregnant with the twins and slowly shrank over the next few weeks until I was back to normal.\"<br>\r\n  So her grow really have to do with her pregnancy... it does make sense since horses and ponies is too can't really birth twins without injury maybe this means that mares grow if they have more than one foal, it makes sense. \"Well... you were mentioning something about the Princess.\" She says gently. \"Before being startled by my person.\" <br>\r\n You began asking yourself, you barely noticed her coming to you and you were about to reveal the 'adventure' within her body and you didn't notice it was her until it was too late! You have to be careful about your choice of words.<br>\r\n \"Well...\" You shifted uncomfortably in your seat, unsure of how to begin your tale. \"It all started when the Princess came into my house unannounced...\"<br>\r\n  Mrs. Cake nodded encouragingly and motioned for you to continue, \"Go on.\"<br>\r\nFrom then the dam broke and the words began to flow like water.<br>\r\n You told her everything you could, how you were hiding out inside your home because you were terrified of being eaten, how Celestia broke into your home and shrank her and yourself down to the size of a speck to learn more about pony biology so you wouldn't be so afraid of ponies, how the two of you actually entered into a mare's reproductive tract and explored the cavernous spaces deep within.<br>\r\n As you spoke Mrs. Cake's eyebrows seemed to move higher and higher the longer you wet on until they had reached their apogee.<br>\r\n Still, she tried her best to remain supportive and understanding all throughout the rant and offered encouragement every time you faltered.<br>\r\n \"And... And... We went to the mare's ovaries at the final part of our tour so she could explain to me further the reformation and well... the heat affected the princess..\" You gulped, this was it, the final confirmation.<br>\r\n \"I asked to leave if she was feeling bad but the princess had other ideas, she wanted a rut, breeding and we'll but she...\" You gulped seeing the curios face of the mini-giant pregnant mare.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"The princess went into heat and she allowed you to mate with her...\" she said slowly.<br>\r\n\"Yes but she... liked for me to make sure my species survive first before anything and seed the entire ovary using a potent spell... she told me that the shadow of extinction hanging around her conscious is she could prevent it and wanted to be sure my race thrives here.\" At this point Mrs. Cake's eyes widen like saucers, her mouth gape, she finally comes to the realization that the mare in the story... was her. <br>\r\n She lifted a foreleg and slowly covered her mouth. \"Oh... oh my.\" <br>\r\n \"I feel... Horrible, Mrs. Cake. I'm sorry, just... I'm so sorry..\" You lamented that's it, you spilled the beans. Mrs. Cake had already put two and two together as well, the sudden warmth she felt weeks prior... It was you seeding her \"I deserve any punishment you and the town seem fit.\" You said you brace yourself for the lash out, the shout of outrage, the threats and... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Mrs. Cake lifted you up bodily from your chair and squeezed you in a tight hug. <br>\r\n Your face was aligned directly with her chest fluff and from that position, you could clearly hear the sound of her heartbeat. <br>\r\n \"Oh, dearie, did you think I was going to hurt you?\" <br>\r\n You felt a few drops of liquid fall onto your shoulder, and it took you a moment to figure out that they were tears.<br>\r\n She was crying.<br>\r\n You felt horrible, even more awful, your heart drops in cold realization, of course, she is not going to hurt you, her husband will. You had made her miserable, you had ruined her life, you ruined your life and-<br>\r\n\"I'm so happy..\" and she was happy- (record scratch) what?<br>\r\n \"What?\" you yelled out loud, still muffled by chest fur. <br>\r\n You struggled to push your way out of her embrace so she gently set you back on the ground.<br>\r\n \"What do you mean that you're 'happy'?\" you demanded. <br>\r\n Mrs. Cake sniffed and wiped at her eye, spilling a good amount of liquid in the process.<br>\r\n Mrs. Cake smiled gently on you and sat next to you. \"Anon, I'm not angry or mad. In fact, I'm so happy on what you did! What you did was to give me the most precious gift somepony can give me, I'm deeply honored to be able to carry your people's future and your little ones.\"<br>\r\n\"I... I don't understand. What I did is making you pregnant with an untold number! I thought I ruined your life, your family, I thought that you or Carrot would kill me for it.\" You say in disbelief and looked down, still feeling shame. \"What I did was without your consent, I could have compromised your matrimony and business, a crime.\" <br>\r\n Mrs. Cake's mouth dropped open, inadvertently allowing you to see all the way to the rear of her throat.<br>\r\n \"You.. thought... You th-th-thought we would, that I would...\"<br>\r\n Her ears folded back against her head and she turned away in shame with her eyes squeezed shut. <br>\r\n Great big tears began collecting at the corner of her eyes and began streaming freely nonstop into her facial fur.<br>\r\n She then pulls you into another tight hug but then began to kiss your face in rapid succession much to your surprise.<br>\r\n\"I would never going to hurt you, nopony will. Please don't blame yourself.\" She says \"Anon, you're welcome here whatever you want and so please, don't be hard on yourself, dearie.\"<br>\r\n To say that you were shocked at this turn of events would be an understatement.<br>\r\n You didn't expect this sort of reaction at all.<br>\r\n \"What... about Carrot, your husband?\" You emphasized the word strongly, You expected anything except for a smile gracing her lips. <br>\r\n \"He is really happy... much more than that, he is elated! he is no real fan of devouring ponies but he does enjoy the bellies it causes. He enjoys the fertile sight a bit too much and well.. it's kind of hard to spot him without being eager near me.  You made him happy as well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You guess that there nothing actually wrong happening here, and you're just going to have to live with that. <br>\r\n \" What's... What's going to happen to you?\"<br>\r\n \" I'm going to get big. Very big. So big that I won't be able to continue baking for a while. I may not even be able to fit inside the bakery. I'm also going to have... needs, needs that only certain people are going to be able to take care of. \" <br>\r\n She paused for a moment, before saying, \" I want you to be there with me. \"<br>\r\n  \"M-me?\" You gulped she gave you a smile.<br>\r\n\"You don't have to if you don't want, Dearie. But I would be happy if you did, after all, I'm carrying your precious brood in me.\"<br>\r\n  How could you say no to such a tempting offer? She was offering you free, 100% access to her body to help relieve the stress of pregnancy, even when she grows so big that you could easily fit inside.<br>\r\n  What red-blooded American (though you guess you're Equestrian now) man would turn down something so free and easy?<br>\r\n This was the start of a very weird but exciting relationship.. maybe this is not so bad after all? Though you wonder, will Celestia grow big as well?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You know we're having more confidence in going outside of your home, mostly to spend time in SugarCube Corner especially with Cup Cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer growth was progressing steadily, a mare like her needs to eat, she is having an army growing after all. A lot was explained, especially in pony pregnancy; Pony or rather mares grow twice or trice if having twins or triplets. Since she was having an untold number of hundreds. she going to become a giantess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she enters into labor, she is going to feel a few cramps but doctors would have to climb in her to get them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo.. with you going out more often, you had become a prime target for more daring predaponies, you sprint or dodge and go straight to the door of the establishment, the only thing they meet inside would be Mrs. Cake's open maw and straight to her stomach which would feed her and the huge brood in her womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings changed with this relationship with the Cakes and Pinkie.<br>\r\n For one thing, Carrot had stopped you to personally shake your hand for what you'd done and gave a heartfelt thank you. You were of course too shocked for words when that happened so all you could do was mechanically flap your arm in utter speechlessness.<br>\r\n Another thing was, funnily enough, that they started paying you for your continued service making you their second employee behind Pinkie Pie.<br>\r\n Mrs. Cake had been banned from the kitchen by her husband for the duration of her pregnancy, citing that she didn't need to overwork herself while she was with child and that he and Pinkie were perfectly capable of handling the business by themselves, and that she just needed to rest, so she didn't have much t do anyway. What went unsaid was the fact that she would eventually outgrow the kitchen and make working life for the Cakes extremely difficult.<br>\r\n So, with nothing to do and nowhere to go, both you and Mrs. Cake had started hanging out fairly often. <br>\r\n So there you were petting her blue fur while laying on her growing, round barrel, your head resting on it. \"Thank you for saving me there.\" You kissed her belly. \"I don't want to be eaten.\"<br>\r\n This was sort of a ritual you two had developed, you would give her belly rubs, scratches, and pets, showing love and affection, especially on the belly area above her growing teats.<br>\r\n She was as big as a couch so you could easily lay on her belly and feel the strong warmth emanating from her body. Her breathing was both deep and slow and she had her eyes partially closed.<br>\r\n \"You were welcome, dearie.\" She sighed, feeling your fingers and hands rubbing her barrel. \"See? There is nothing to worry about.\" She giggles \"I'm glad you're enjoying it.\"<br>\r\n Her belly made little gurgles and pops now and again to remind you of the unfortunate pony she had swallowed whole. Now that you were completely certain that you weren't ever going to be the one in there the sound was sort of relaxing and dare you to say it, kind of sexy. She explained to you that giving her belly massages  (like the one you're giving right now)  greatly aids in digestion after she'd had a large meal and feels wonderful.<br>\r\n \"Now I understand why Carrot like this.\" You say. \"You're so comfy... so gentle, so warm.\" And.. fertile, something in this woke something on you, each time you were with her, Carrot once told that she have that effect, you were excited when near her.<br>\r\n  Pinkie often says she felt a bit jealous of so much attention Cup was getting but was all happy seeing you open up more. Carrot didn't have any jealousy or any ill will at you. It because of you, his get to enjoy his fertile, big wife at nights, he does enjoy big, pregnant girls.<br>\r\nBut say something that surprised you, He hoped that his other herdmates were as open as her.<br>\r\nThe herd system did exist in this world.<br>\r\n You still had so much to learn about Equestrian culture, it's a good thing that you found a group of kind, down-to-earth ponies to help you navigate its sometimes rough stormy waters.<br>\r\n \"Mmmm, yes.\" Mrs. Cake moaned. as you scratched in a particular area. \"That's the ticket. Ah, would you mind moving your hands a little lower, dear? I'm feeling an itch between my teats that I just can't reach.\" <br>\r\n \"With pleasure..\" You went lower and lower until rubbing her huge, rounds, plump, and milky teats. You decided to scratch it in a very particular way, this might be going a bit far on the relationship and the first time since you were still hesitant to do it on a married mare but since she was pregnant with your children...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou unbuttoned your pants. If she says it is wrong you would gladly put them back on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You pulled down your pants and kicked them off, leaving you in your underwear. You then straddled her barrel in the direction facing her teats and, are hood and crawled forward until your upper body rested between two large pillowy mounds. Each breast was easily the size of your head with two magnificent nipples jutting out into open air.<br>\r\n You reached in between the valley of the two peaks and with two hands you began to scratch and kiss at Mrs. Cake's furry mounds.<br>\r\n She moaned in utter delight, laying on her back with her legs splayed out in a relaxed position.<br>\r\n \"Mmmm, more of that, dearie, please.\"<br>\r\n You obliged her wishes, taking each nipple into hand and running your thumbs across the nipples and around the areola.<br>\r\n \"Ahhh~\" She moans feeling the rather new sensation of her teats wrapped around those fingers, massaging her nipples, hooves never went this far, it was a new feeling that even Milk leaked from her nipples and juice started to come from her slit.<br>\r\n She doesn't seem to mind becoming on you slowly naked, it seems. You decided to start that scratches with your member and get your first Equestrian Boobjob.<br>\r\n You lower your bottom half so that you were on your knees and your manhood was in direct contact what does silky soft fur.<br>\r\n You are so Lean Forward so that your face was directly aligned with Mrs. Cakes juicy enticing snatch.<br>\r\n Now that you're on your hands and knees and the optimal position he began to slowly thrust.<br>\r\n She moans again, feeling your dicks thrusting between her milky teats, she giggles next, stallions were always attracted to a mares' teats, especially when engorged with milk. Her husband was the other Stallion that enjoys such teatjobs.<br>\r\nShe can see the appeal, just as hotdogging.<br>\r\nShe gasped feeling the human' mouth sucking at her clit all so suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Mrs. cake's love button was so large at this point that it could easily fill your entire mouth.<br>\r\n You trapped the clit between your lips gently ever so gently bit down and begin to suck.<br>\r\n Instantly a powerful flavor burst onto your taste buds reminiscing strongly of blueberries. <br>\r\n Mrs. Cake groaned and panted at your oral assault while her back legs began to twitch.<br>\r\n This rewarded you with even more juice to gulp down and enjoy. ()<br>\r\n You decided to go on the main attraction and please her motherly snatch, the same fleshy fold that welcomes you during that adventure, you began to nibble at it and lick her foal entrance.<br>\r\n She moans loudly now feeling your tongue probing her slit.<br>\r\n \"Oh, dearie yes! HNGH~. Lick my pussy! Drink as much as you want, dearie, it's all for you~.\"<br>\r\n Upon her command you mashed your entire face between her lovelips and began going to town, licking every part of her inner entrance from top to bottom. You even tried to press your head in a bit further to reach the innermost reaches of her canal, but alas, she was not yet big enough for you to fit.<br>\r\n You can't wait, though. You wanted to get inside of it again but in less dubious and more with the intent to please her, to rub her walls and all. You come to love her, but as a friend with benefits. She was married and with already kids but sex is so open here that isn't much of a trouble.<br>\r\nYou were tempted to flood her other ovary but that won't be fair, she likely letting this out to show trust and friendship and because you were the father of the brood in her.<br>\r\n Mrs. Cake walls tried their best to suck you in, however, wetly kissing your cheeks and forehead just as her plush clitoris pulsed against your chin.<br>\r\n She wanted you inside her just as much as you did.<br>\r\n That's not to forget you're steel hard cock that was busily humping against her luxuriously silky soft fur. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You had a job right in front of you that you needed to take care of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You rise from her snatch as you start hump faster, you pushed her teats together to increase the tightness on your dicks, you kneaded and massage her mammary globes as it leaks even more of her milk. You hissed as you were starting to get close to orgasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You groaned in ecstasy as a river of white-hot liquid forced its way up to your urethra and you spilled your dirty dirty seed onto Mes. Cakes' lower abdomen.<br>\r\n You collapsed in orgasmic fervor on her belly, panting and breathing heavily as you grew flaccid once more. <br>\r\n Mrs. Cake lifted you from the belly and carried you forward to her snout and opened her mouth wide. <br>\r\n Her intention wasn't to eat you, however, far from it.<br>\r\n Instead, she slurped up your legs and lower body all while giving you a loving gaze and began to noisily suck on your lower half like a lollipop, tasting and tickling your feet with her thick tongue.<br>\r\n You gasped seeing her eyes locking with yours, sucking your taste and she seems to enjoy it, humming dreamily at your taste, you felt her whole mouth sucking you in, her tongue licking your feet, legs and crotch area in every area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then removed you from her mouth and licked her lips. \"No wonder they want to eat you, Dearie, you taste really good, even your seed is delicious.\"<br>\r\n \"Th-th-thank you? I guess?\" You weren't sure to respond to such a compliment if it was a compliment. You were fairly sure that she wasn't serious and was just teasing you, but regardless there will always be that nagging shard of doubt stuck deep in the back of your mind. <br>\r\n Despite all of this, She left you out, your entire lower side covered on her spit. Any Pegasus looking from the clouds likely had given on up on you, you were this mare consort. No part of a herd but still able to satisfy her although you failed to make her orgasm, she says she wasn't bothered by it and that your pleasure and well being was more important.<br>\r\nShe left you next to her growing barrel, letting you feel the warm and firm roundness of her tum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you lay there you noticed something... peciliar.

You were giddy to meet with Mrs. Cake again and hang out, which had become the highlight of your day. You warily looked out for any hungry ponies as you walked as per usual, and made ready to bolt if anyone tried to rush you.<br>\r\n But as you reached to Sugarcube Corner, you saw two familiar white ponies with a stony expression and Greek-like armor guarding the entrance, Princess Celestia's branch of Royal Guard. <br>\r\n Well now, this was a surprise. Wherever they went, the Princess is sure to be not far behind.<br>\r\n Upon approach to the Bakery, one of the guards spotted you and waved a spear at you to get your attention.<br>\r\n \"Human, please step inside. The princess is expecting you.\"<br>\r\n \"Remember to be polite and respectful around the Princess, no funny business.\" the other growled.<br>\r\n \"...Right.\" You nodded to the 'stallion' guard although knowing Celestia, she'll be the one with the funny business, after all, she is the one that started it all. You entered the business and noticed rows tablets with food and some bound ponies on a plate. Captured predators that tried their luck with her or the guard.<br>\r\n Some of them looked at you with pleading eyes, begging you to untie them and let them free, but after so many bad experiences with almost being eaten you were deaf to their plight.<br>\r\n \"Ah, Anon, its good to see you!\" You heard the familiar, melodious tone of Celestia's voice, she smiles fondly and looked at the source, you gaped seeing her how much she had grown. <br>\r\n Like Mrs. Cake, she had almost quadrupled in size and now stood so tall that the tip of her horn nearly touched the ceiling. You also noticed that the space in the bakery seemed to have expanded a bit for the Princess's visit, as you could see a smiling Mrs. Cake sitting next to her on a huge velvet cushion. \"Please, come sit with us, we have much to discuss.\"<br>\r\n You smiled but you were a bit nervous, you walked on to them, there was a space between the two giant mares. But as soon you approached you bowed to her \"Princess.\" You say in a respectful tone.<br>\r\n Meanwhile, you smiled at the blue mare who smiled warmly on you.<br>\r\n She patted down a spot in the space between the two mares, and so you walked over and plopped yourself down.<br>\r\n \"There is no need to bow to me, Anonymous. You have more than proven your worth to me.\" the Princess said while smiling down at you.<br>\r\n Celestia telekinetically lifted the enormous platter of bound ponies and set them down right in front of the two mares.<br>\r\n The ponies struggled, trying to get off the bounds but were futile as Mrs. Cake and Celestia opened wide their mouths to gobble them down, like really delicious morsels.<br>\r\n You were so close to them that you could see and feel the bulges sliding down their throats before dropping into their respective stomachs.<br>\r\n You didn't know whether to be terrified or extremely turned on.<br>\r\n Both, both are good.<br>\r\n  Either way, you glad that you were on the good side of them. \"Ahh~ Celestia sighed \"Truly delicious, delectable even.\"<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\" Mrs. Cake. sighed too patting her belly.<br>\r\nYou simply decided to take some normal food in the meantime. You glance of Celestia or rather her barrel, unlike Mrs. Cale, she likely pregnant with a few but how come she is bigger, her barrel is slightly inflated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As you ate you couldn't help but steal several furtive glances at Celestia. There were so many questions swirling inside your head that you didn't know which one to ask first. Mrs. Cake softly stroked and patted at your head to help keep you calm and relaxed, while the princess waited patiently for you to finish eating before she would speak again.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n You swallowed while notice her smiling at you. \"You might've noticed that I had grown as well as did Cup Cake here.\" She states you nod at her. \"This is a normal occurrence, at least when concerning twins and triplets. I'm having octuplets \"<br>\r\n \"Ah, I see,\" That... did make some sort of sense, Mrs. Cake did mention that ponies grow regardless of how pregnant they are. \"So, what brings you here Princess?\"<br>\r\n \"I merely wanted to come to check on you to see how you were doing after our \"adventure\", and I was delighted to find that Mrs. Cake was completely understanding and took you in. She also told me  much about your daily 'sessions'.\" She grinned at you and wiggled her eyebrows.<br>\r\n \"Oh yes,\" Mrs. Cake agreed. \"He's been just a wonderful companion. I couldn't ask for any better.\"<br>\r\n \"Indeed.\" the princess uttered and then sighed deeply.<br>\r\n \"In that vein, I've decided that I, too, would like to pampered in such a way. What do you think about that, Anon?\"<br>\r\n Your eyes widen on such request, You nodded to her, you rather no anger the princess and mother of your children as well, she smiles \"That is nice, I would like some company with the father of 7 Alicorns and a human girl.\" Your eyes widen, she was having a human!?<br>\r\n \"A human, huh? I guess you're not going to end up the last of your kind after all,\" Mrs. Cake commented.<br>\r\n Celestia nodded.<br>\r\n \"You are also having humans, almost a dozen that come with the hundreds of foals of all tribes. along with an Alicorn as well.\" Her eyes widen on the revelation as Celestia smiles \"You are indeed truly blessed.\"<br>\r\n \"That brings me to my next bit of good news. As you know, after leaving you here and returning to Canterlot I haven't had a chance up until now to come and visit. That was for a very specific reason. Over the last few weeks, I've been very, very busy making preparations, signing paperwork, talking and negotiating to the nobility for one particular purpose, and recently I am proud to say my plans have bloomed into fruition, which brings me to my main purpose for visiting the both of you personally.\"<br>\r\n \"I have decided to induct both of you into the royal herd and make you my consorts.\"<br>\r\n Mrs. Cake's eyes opened wide and your mouth dropped open. Did she just say what you thought she said?<br>\r\n \"But Princess. I'm already married and in a herd, while I do love Anon as my consort, I do have a husband I love a lot and kids. That not to say I'm not Honored.\" Mrs. Cake says feeling conflicted.<br>\r\n Celestia smiled gently. \"It will be fine. Your family, will, in essence, become my family and will be able to enjoy everything that entails. You and yours will all become nobles in my court and receive titles to fit the new position, though it will mostly be honorary and you will be free to remain here if you wish.\"<br>\r\n She blinked but then looked thoughtful \"Really need to think about it, discuss it with my husband and Pinkie.\" She says. \"Thank you, Princess, for this kind offer.\" She says. \"Now... as for... our consort, Though I think the dearie would benefit more with this.\" She says smiling to you.<br>\r\n The princess dipped her head. \"Very well. I cannot force you into anything you don't want to do, the decision is entirely up to you. Now, I believe I already mentioned I came here to be pampered...\"<br>\r\n \"Don't forget about me,\" Mrs. Cake teased,<br>\r\n You gulped as the two mares mentioned their wants to you, two amazon sized mares, they smiled at you with teasing smirks.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>prerCelestia gazed at you with a deep sense of want and desire, a look mirrored by the motherly pony on her other side. It made you the tiniest bit nervous, even though you knew she would never intentionally try to harm you. \"Hmm, how to start though? How your sessions usually begin?\" Celestia asked.<br>\r\n Mrs. Cake smirked. \"Usually by a pony trying to eat Anon making a grave miscalculation and ending up in my stomach.\"<br>\r\n Celestia nodded. \"Ah yes. A fine beginning, indeed.\"<br>\r\n Celestia laid her head down low to the ground and opened her mouth wide before letting her tongue loll out.<br>\r\n It was massive, easily as thick as your entire body, and drenched with saliva. She looked at you expectedly, and it took you a moment to catch on.<br>\r\n She wanted you to feed her from the pile of bound and gagged predator mares. <br>\r\n You did it was your turn to be a waiter, You bowed and decided to heft two bound mares, they were trashing, trying to escape but you were strong and nd taller than them, they were Pegasus, the lightest of all the ponies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guided them to the hungry royal maw, the mares stared terrified on seeing the large abyss of the princess's mouth and the throat that awaits them.<br>\r\n You placed the two unlucky mares onto the tongue and the instant that happened their fates were sealed. Like a pink anaconda, the princess rolled over the ponies and drew them into her mouth and closed it while humming thoughtfully. Meanwhile, Mrs. Cake tapped at your back to get your attention and then pointed at her mouth. \"Ahhh, ahhhh.\"<br>\r\n You nodded to her and grabbed two new mares for enjoyment, a Unicorn with a suppressor ring on her horn who looked terrified and an earth pony, The earth pony was the heaviest and bigger but she wasn't struggling she looked eager seeing the slimy, huge tongue and the abyss that awaits her and the destiny that means for her. To be food for her and her huge brood. <br>\r\n She would do anything to get inside that big sexy belly.<br>\r\n You shot Celestia a questioning look.<br>\r\n Celestia simply giggled and nodded to you \"I think that mare needs some stuffing first.\" She suggested and hinted to you.<br>\r\n You nodded back and tossed the other pony into Cup's mouth, then pulled her close to you and undid the gag.<br>\r\n Immediately the mare began squealing for joy with the biggest smile on her face. \"Yeees, please eat me! I'm tender and delicious. Turn me into fat and milk for your foals. I love doing this. I love being the prey!\"<br>\r\n \"Somepony's eager,\" Cup Cake teased, wanting very much to feel that mare go down her gullet.<br>\r\n \"It's your call Anon, you get to decide what happens to her,\" Celestia said.<br>\r\n \"I think we can save this one... for later,\" you said finally. \"Since she enjoys this so much, why not prolong that enjoyment for as long as possible?\"<br>\r\n  \"Wait, no! You teaseeerrr!\" She whines at you as the two mares giggles. You chuckled as you offered the gaged unicorn who very much didn't want this, unlike her companion. Mrs. Cake saw it as a fitting tribute. \"Noo... That could've been meee!\" She says<br>\r\n \"Well, Celestia did say you needed to be fattened first,\" you said with a wink.<br>\r\n You were starting to get into this.<br>\r\n It would be far more fun and interesting to do things this way, and besides, Celestia gave you both implicit and explicit permission to do whatever you wanted with her. <br>\r\n You grabbed her flanks as she squealed and moaned feeling your touch, she shuddered. As you undid your pants and aligned your dick to her eager slit \"Ohhh~ Stuff me? Oh please stuff me! I wanna be extra delicious!\"<br>\r\n You pulled her on top of you and jammed yourself inside, instantly bumping up against her cervix. The mare screeched in utter delight and seized around your cock, forming a perfect fit.<br>\r\n Celestia picked up another pony and dangled it above the eager mare's head, saying \"Open wide.\"<br>\r\n The Mare opened her mouth wide as Celestia feed her with one, then two, and three as you continue to pound her marehood. Her belly was started to inflate with more and more of her companions some giving her betrayed looks but she didn't care, her mind was on becoming more delicious and fat, she was the main course for Mrs. Cake. She was becoming more stuffed through one side but you were about to stuff her in the other.<br>\r\n The earth pony grew heavier and heavier the more she ponies she devoured, necessitating a shift in position to relieve the pressure she was putting on you.<br>\r\n You put your hands around her even expanding barrel and could feel the roiling chaos of ponies kicking at her distended belly, struggling break free of her gut.<br>\r\n You were about to cum, Celestia saw this and with magic, she decided to give you a small push, it was the same spell she did to you when you two ventured and seeded Mrs. Cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe going to become stuffed on both sides, she was full in the stomach but her womb is going to full with your seed.<br>\r\n Aided by Celestia's magic, you gave one last thrust before; letting loose, blasting her with your nut butter and filling her womb like a water balloon. At the same time, the mare seized around you, crying out in ecstasy as she finally came.<br>\r\n Now too heavy to move on her own, she rolled off of you and onto her back, showing off her incredibly gravid belly to all who were watching.<br>\r\n You reached down and gave her a tender kiss, pressing your tongue past her lips and stroked at her belly.<br>\r\n You never even asked her name and yet she was willing to give to the cause of nourishing your children.<br>\r\n  The mare looked dreamily on you and then to Mrs. Cake who licked her lips as she eyed her \"Now, she is thoroughly stuffed, fitting for me and enough to nourish my foals.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeesh...\" She says \"Tasty Apple. That's my name.\" She somehow felt the need to say the name...<br>\r\nOh, she was an Apple? Red fur, and big apple shaped like heart cutie mark and green hair and mane, kind of give away. well, she is now going to be nourishment for the incoming brood.<br>\r\n As she was too heavy for you to lift, Mrs. Cake took the overstuffed pony into her hoof and dropped her into her mouth. She didn't bother tasting the pony instead of closing her mouth and gulping loudly, sending the fat lump down her throat to join the others.<br>\r\n There was no bound pony left now, the rest were devoured by Tasty Apple for the main course for Mrs. Cake. She patted her belly, above her growing womb area of her barrel. The acid likely dissolved the bounds but now pinned by the distended belly of Tasty Apple inside the stomach, they can't struggle anymore. Celestia giggled.<br>\r\n \"There's always one in a bunch that enjoys getting eaten instead of the other way around. We're going to make sure her egg gets fertilized so we can do this again.\"<br>\r\n Mrs. Cake nodded. \"She was an extremely satisfying meal. She's going to take a long time break down, I'll tell you that much.\"<br>\r\n \"She going to be very filling,\" you opined with a grin, The giant blue mare smiles and kissed you.<br>\r\n\"Yes but I think you have something to do.\" She says as you felt something warm, and furry sneak up, you looked up to see Celestia's face smirking on you. <br>\r\n \"Oh? And what might that be?\" you asked teasingly. You think you already know where this is going.<br>\r\n Mrs. Cake giggled herself as she pushed her barrel to your front, pinning you between two furry, warm bellies, full of life.<br>\r\nWell, time to get to work. </span></div></div>",

To aid their digestion using both ends of your body.<br>\r\n You stopped for just a moment and pulled off your shirt, and after that, your pants.<br>\r\n You really wanted to feel their fur on your bare skin.<br>\r\n  You were excited, that's for sure. It was nice to feel their silky fur, both mares noticed and gave a bit of space to undress, they both also noticed your excitement.<br>\r\n  They giggled upon seeing your hard-on.<br>\r\n  Normally you might feel embarrassed about ponies laughing about your dick hanging out, but you were too in the zone to care.<br>\r\n  You decided to focus on Celestia first since she was the one who specifically requested this meeting and you didn't want to disappoint.<br>\r\n You could feel the wriggling forms of a dozen pony souls pressing against the inner lining of her stomach, futilely struggling until they're inevitably turned into mush.<br>\r\n  Celestia cooed and moaned at your relaxing touch and rolled over a bit to give you better access.<br>\r\n \"That's it how it feels? Ohh... Magnificent!\" She cooed \"You were right, this is so nice to feel and it does aid to digestion.\" She felt the ponies in her stomach stopping fighting, the acid was finishing melting them and their souls would go straight to her womb.<br>\r\n Using both hands you stroked the entire length of her belly, moving lower and lower until you reached the lower abdomen. Just like Mrs. Cake, her teats were easily as big, if not bigger than your head, and were slightly leaking milk. The bodies of the digested ponies would be broken down and partially stored as fat reserves to make more milk, and the rest would likely to toward feeding your children.<br>\r\n You didn't ignored Mrs Cake, she was a needed as Celestia, she was bound to be bigger andnshe was bigger, her belly was full of the willing Apple Pony, she was a bit round.<br>\r\n She cooed feeling your touch and pat your head in motherly affection.<br>\r\n And so you alternated between lavishing attention on the two mares, kissing and rubbing their stomachs and teats with great care and tenderness.<br>\r\n Then Mrs. Cake rolled completely onto he back to let you rest on top of her as per usual.<br>\r\n Celestia saw this and an idea sparked inside her head.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Celestia, who didn't want to be left out, went and put herself above the blue mare and you, covered with soft warm bellies, both being similar-sized, it would make this far easier, She has been eager for some action on this side, she decided to reveal this secret to her herdmates, especially Mrs. Cake who would greatly enjoy this, she likely crave it.<br>\r\nSo she simply aligned and pushed in.<br>\r\n Mrs. Cake gasped in surprise and looked up the princess in alarm. \"I-is... Is that...?\"<br>\r\n Celestia nodded with a coy smile and leaned down to kiss her on the lips.<br>\r\n Meanwhile, you, who had no idea what just happened or what was going on, felt yourself being lifted up by magic until you were right in front of her muzzle.<br>\r\n While her lips remained locked with Mrs. Cake's, a wave of yellow energy expanded from her horn and washed over you, leaving a warm and tingly feeling.<br>\r\n While you were dangling in her magical grasp, slowly the distance between you and Celestia's snout began to recede until it looked like you take a ride on her face.<br>\r\n Eventually, the kiss was over and she licked her lips, Mrs Cake moans feeling the familiar sensation of a shaft invading her nethers overtake her. She looked at Celestia with half-lidded eyes then she noticed you over the snout. She giggled but then moans, giving you a clear view of her maw.<br>\r\n For a brief moment, you could see clearly into Mrs. Cake's mouth and the pink pulsating entrance to her throat which had claimed the lives of so many ponies.<br>\r\n That would not be your destination, however, as you were swung around and pulled back toward Celestia's backside.<br>\r\n From there, you were met with Celestia's jiggling and plumb flank, the twin sun's cutie marks that were emblazoned on her gluteus, her multicolored tail moved up revealing her royal privates; her rather puffy donut pothole and her moistened slit and winking clit but below it and her vulva, however, you gasped upon seeing a rather large and swaying nutsack as it impact repeatedly on Mrs. Cake own generous flanks.<br>\r\n The furry flaps peeled apart revealing Celestia's pink center, twitching and drooling in anticipation of what was to come.  Before you could even think the golden aura carried you forward until you impacted onto the moist, sticky vulvar lips...</span></div></div>",

This is a fact you know since the show started with Lauren Faust running it, however this is a thing when they devour. Ponies's bodies are too magical as well, even their fluids. When they digest their 'prey', The body contains the prey's spirit and set them to a area where they can reform safetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor mares, Its the Womb and for stallions, the balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in order to reform the prey, it need both. The Spirit is held on a special ovum for the mare while in the stallion, the spirit is held on the sperm cells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the reformation, however, it needs a vacant uterus and sperm to start the reformation progress, Basically being born again.. literally. Once reborn, the reformed pony will experience an accelerated childhood, growing up in days or just hours until it reach its' original age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth, the sperm and cells that contains the spirits do also contain DNA of the digested prey, so they may reform just as they were before being eaten, however, its not always perfect, sometimes, the DNA isn't completed or contain some parts of the Predator and the reformed prey will have a traits of both \"parents\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was... something to consider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't the \"My little Pony\" you know, this was a more voracious version of it with a respawn system that only acts when eating each other as snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was fascinating but also frightening. Does that work on humans too? You are from a world without magic, you don't even know if souls and spirits exist there and you surrounded by ponies that are itching for eat you and while the princess is a especial case, just like that, some other pony can enter into your house and hunt you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially the Mint Pony, what was her name? Lyrical Liverstring or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... enlightening, princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed it is Anon.\" She says \"We can continue with an demonstration in how it work or we can get out and explore more places.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe options were tempting and also fitting.

Isn't like the Princess is going let herself be digested by Carrot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there were more options to go if they explore around... perhaps going into other ponies...</span></div></div>",

Transporting you up to the sky again before diving straight to Fluttershy's' belly, going further down until passing the belly button and her round mounds being her teats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know Fluttershy would be stacked in that particular area. and just then you both saw it, Fluttershy's soft-looking nether lips open enough that you can see the inside clearly. Pearly and moist but also soft, spongy and inviting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden smell of strong vanilla hits you, it was coming from the rapidly approaching entrance which it's affected you to a subconscious level feeling a rush to your loins, hopefully, Celestia won't notice although you heard her chuckling. She likely knows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy yelped a bit when she felt the Tiny Princess and the Human entering into her foal tunnel, she looked around to make sure nopony saw her and nopony did she sighed in relief. She rose up from her seat and took the plate with her mouth to return it to the counter as she faintly felt the tinies worming their way into her deepest core.</span></div></div>",

You held on tightly to Celestia's neck, almost afraid that you would slip off and fall to your doom before she could catch you. Thankfully, her magic kept you glued to her back, however, and in short order the two of you flew close in to your destination.<br>\r\nUpon approach your eyes couldn't help but slowly slide upward in wonder at the sight.<br>\r\nThe (relatively) petite and puffy entrance to Octavia's inner sanctum inspired both feelings of awe and reverence, with the coal gray lips extending higher than any skyscraper until they seamlessly joined with the distant puffy anus,.You could detect just a hint a of floral accents emanating from her well groomed tail. It was very likely that she had just taken a shower recently...<br>\r\nThe princess angled upward and flew past the monolithic labia before she alighted on a safe landing zone nearby,  just inside the entrance tot he vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon landing you quickly dismounted the princess and stepped onto the squishy floor, and Celestia quickly cast an illumination spell to light up the darkness, which revealed a great amount of detail about the space you were in. <br>\r\nYou were standing in a  pinkish fleshy corridor that extended inward as far as you could see before fading into the darkness. The walls and floor had a wrinkled quality to it that was covered in bumps and ridges and ribs, and it was clearly alive, with the tunnel moving and expanding and contracting at a slow constant rate.<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Octavia's birth canal, Anon.\" Celestia announce, \"I do hope you're not feeling too overwhelmed by all this.\"<br>\r\nOverwhelmed wasn't quite the way you would put it, more like scared to death. You had no idea how Octavia would react to you being inside her body and desperately wanted to avoid becoming her next meal.<br>\r\nCelestia, meanwhile, remained as calm and serene as she ever was. Clearly she knew something that you didn't for her not to be in the least bit concerned about a pony that could eat her and absorb her powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked up and laid a comforting wing on your shoulder and softly nuzzled at your neck, a gesture that you reciprocated by scratching under her neck. Maybe this won't turn out all bad after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've never been inside a pony before\" Celestia noted,, \"nor engaged in sexual relationship with a pony. This must be a rather new experience for you. How does it feel?\"<br>\r\n\"I feel... like.. I don't really know how to feel.\" you admitted softly. \"Being inside a beautiful mare such as this... Is something that I never would've though could happen, never in my wildest dreams.\"<br>\r\nYou walked over to the edge of the canal and stood close to the wall, reaching out a hand to touch it before quickly pulling back. You looked over at the princess for guidance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on and touch it,\" she encouraged, \"It's very unlikely she would feel you at this size.\"<br>\r\nYou reached out and placed your hand on the textured vaginal wall and pressed into it. <br>\r\n\"Feels... soft, but not too soft. I thought it would have a lot more give, like a soft and squishy pillow, but every time I push I keep getting a little bit of resistance, like trying to compress a spring.\"<br>\r\nThe princess nodded sagely. \"Yes,  the inner muscles of a mare are quite developed and well suited for taking in the stallion's penis, or anything else she decides to stuff in here, for that matter. With Miss Melody's well known reputation as an apex predator I imagine it's quite difficult for her to get many dates.\"<br>\r\nHa, no kidding, she probably just devours anyone she doesn't like or doesn't meet her standards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip to the cervix was rather short and uneventful, with neither of you having anything to say about the current situation..<br>\r\nWith nothing to say you became lost in thought, silently reflecting on everything you'd just seen.<br>\r\nLikewise Celestia happily trotted alongside you with a big smile on her face, which only seemed to grow bigger the closer you got.<br>\r\nCelestia had a hidden agenda concerning the resident human, agenda that she would she come to pass while inside the classical musician.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they approached an enormous muscular ringed gateway that blocked their path, a gateway that appeared to be tightly shut against any intruders.<br>\r\nCelestia stepped forward. \"Well, there it is. Shall we go inside and take a look around?\"<br>\r\nYou looked at her, aghast. \"How are we supposed to do that? It looks like it's closed up tight, there's no way we'd be able to fit through it at our current size.\" you protested.<br>\r\nThe princess merely shook her head and smiled, a mirthful glint shining in her eye. \"My dear sweet Anonymous, oh ye of little faith. If the door's closed it would be only polite to knock first.\"<br>\r\nWith that Celestia reared up, charged up a spell and shot a narrow beam of light at the closed aperture, which seemed to readily absorb the light .<br>\r\nIAll of the sudden a shudder rolled through the fleshy tube, causing you to almost lose your balance, and the air began to grow slightly warmer and more moist.<br>\r\nThe cervix immediately twitched and flexed, before slowly, the muscles relaxed, allowing a small opening for you to enter into.<br>\r\nAll this happening you cast a panicked look over at the Princess, who seemed to be completely unperturbed by the tremors she just caused. \"W-what just happened? What did you <i>just do</i>?\"<br>\r\nShe, however, chose to ignore your outburst and instead cheerfully relayed, \"Ah, that's better. Now it's time for us to proceed.

It's a small that she won't go around looking for the next stallion to rut with if that's what you're worried about. It just made her release pheromones signaling of her status as a mare in heat for any stallions nearby but not enough to go on a frenzy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... we're not in danger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hardly but we're likely going to a more warmed environment due to the spell.... and seems we're here already..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, you two managed to reach to the other side, into the large expanse of Octavias' uterus, her foal making organ was large, able to take in comfortably a city with ease and likely still have space for expansions. Beyond the spongy and rather tube-like organ, it divides itself into two equally large paths. The uterine horns leading to each ovary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Incredible..\" You breathe out in awe as Celestia chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. Everything in this perspective makes things far more awe-inspiring than what we see in our normal size.\" Celestia nods and turns on you \"On this perspective, it is fairer to explain how our reformation work, however, there are things that should be noted on this particular mare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such as?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you once we reach to one of her ovaries, since it concern the souls trapped within her and the retention of DNA. of her preys which contain a certain side effect but so far, let me explain how our reformation work as we descend to the expanse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Celestia descended and walked at the spongy and humid uterine floor as Celestia begn explaining how the reformation work and the story behind it. Suffice to say that their voracious tendecies was thanks to Discord by giving ponykind the ravenous hunger of a hydra or manticore due to hilarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Luna and Celestia sealed the God of Chaos away, they were unable to revert the spell but managed to create an counterspell that would prevent Ponykind for devouring themselves to exctintion by linking their digestive and reproductive system together magically. The nutrients gained would be added up to the predator, be it magical or physical and some would return to the original owner to aid on his or her reformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a very complicated thing and the technicalities were complex but the more simplistic explanation were that ponies were able reform once devoured. For Stallions predators, the prey's soul and nutrients would go into their testicles which produces special sperms that contain the soul and their DNA, said sperm will always be the first to win the race of life and the fertilized zygote will reform the devoured pony's body almost identical to one that was digested. It happens similarly with Mare Predators, their ovaries would generate a special egg cell containing the Soul and DNA upon fertilization would trigger the reformation. Upon rebirth, the foal would have an accelerated childhood on a few months before returning back to their previous age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of this voracious lifestyle and nutrients gained, Ponies enjoyed an far extended lifespan and considered this a blessing rather than a curse to the point the princesses decided to abandon the research for a cure and indulge themselves until a certain a point<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also work similary when ponies adopt: The colt or filly can choose to become related biologically to their new parents through another version of the spell that instead of devouring them, they eat the children through their genitalia, re-conceive and rebirth them as member of their adoptive family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were even more concerned about coming here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Well, Anon. That covers all the surface of the history behind it and how our reformation works in its basic form and I believe we can continue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Continue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we need to get onto one of the ovaries, it is time to explain certain peculiarities of the respawn spell for mares and stallions that retains souls for too long.\" The Solar Alicorn added as you two continue walking on.</span></div></div>",

She is waiting for a special pony to catch her eye and do it in a \"proper\" way that, unfortunately, it can't wait any longer.\" She looked at you sadly \"I'm sorry for the deception, Anon, but I've been waiting for this opportunity, you will return back to normal after you had unloaded into this and the other ovary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guessed that.. you could understand her reasoning although there is something made you dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if Octavia get a word that I impregnated her and she attempts to eat me in rage?\" You gulped. Celestia however, gave you a reassuring smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see it that she won't do that.\" She says and her horn ceased glowing \"done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at your new, albeit temporally, enhanced and grown package, twitching and pulsing with anticipation \"What now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rut her ovary, that hole looks tight enough to please you and burst a nut straight into it.\" She noted but pointing a hoof toward the cervix-like entrance.</span></div></div>",
