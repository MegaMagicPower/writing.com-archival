Boy processing factories opened up, producing boy meat for the supermarket SHELVES. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt REPLACED beef and chicken as the main food of choice in the west. To fill the quota anyone under 18 who committed a crime, no matter <br>\r\nhow tiny, was turned into delicious meat, but that wasn't enough so soon the government began encouraging parents to sell off spare children for cash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the government began using school to teach children that becoming meat was great. Mass brainwashing some called it, but not many people complained because now their was even more delicious meat that VOLUNTEERED to be on your plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo combat the gender unbalance, some genius scientist invented a drug that when put into the water supply made sure that 80% of children born were male. 60% of boys would end up food before 18, and so population was controlled and the HUMAN race prospers to this day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're a boy in this new brave age; so how old are you?</span></div></div>",

He was born to an average family, but he inherited his good looks from his father. He has short spiked blonde hair, a smattering of freckles on his nose, light green eyes and tanned skin from long days of skateboarding or playing basketball shirtless with his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is well hung for his age, with a uncut 6\" penis and a pair of heavy balls about the size of golf balls. He discovered how it use it at only 12 and lost his virginity in the butt of his best friend Liam not long after. All the girls and boys at school swoon over him, and he's happy to please them all - he'd say he's bisexual, but his friends say he's simply \"sexual\" and would have sex with anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere shall Adam start his day?</span></div></div>",
