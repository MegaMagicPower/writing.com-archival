It's late, only two hours to sunrise.  Already I can feel the pull of the imminent light, an uncontrollable force.  Bears and frogs must feel it in the fall, a slowing of the heartbeat, a lethargy in the limbs, telling them to sleep the long sleep of winter.  In my former life, for awhile, I studied these wild creatures and had hopes to work as a wildlife researcher.  Funny, because now I am a wild creature, and every night I research humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since that first night, the night I died. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remember kissing him, a long slow kiss.  I was drunk on the wine that he plied me with all evening.  I had been drunk before, but never like that. That kind of drunk is like flying, or swimming in a warm salt sea at night. I felt free and beautiful and sexy.  I used to think he had drugged me, now I know that the drug is simply the vampire's spell. He had me tangled in his spell, like a fly in the spider's web. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI noticed he wasn't drinking.  \"Are you sober?\" I asked, emboldened by his pursuit of me.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"but I love the taste of wine on a woman's lips.\" He pulled me close, and we swayed to the music of the smoky jazz club. My friends forgotten, my fiance forever erased from my mind, my family meaningless, I gave myself to him that night. His kiss was fire, burning my mouth like hot whisky.  The club's air smothered me, so we flew open the doors into the cool October night. He took my willing hand, and lead me into the alley.  It was quiet there, secluded, and I thought that it would be a perfect place to commit a crime. That alley, behind the jazz club's dumpster, is where he killed me. </span></div></div>",

Pushed up against the wall, my dress hiked up to my waist, he masterfully fucked me there; and while he orgasmed, he bit my throat and drank my blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is always intimated that vampires are sexual, but that they never have sex. In fact, they lust after human bodies not only for the blood, but also for the sex. Vampires are animals, and copulating is something that every wild thing does. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remember a heat rushing through my veins, and then terrible chilling ice.  My throat closed, and I began to choke and cough. The vampire spell broke, and suddenly I wanted to escape, but I had no strength.  Limply, I slipped to the cold ground, the vampires' teeth still embedded in my neck.  Everything went black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, I sat up, gasping greedily for air. Immediately I was aware of the changes in my body, of a heightened awareness in every sense.  The light at the end of the alley was extra bright, the slick stone under my body vibrated with the movement of cars a block away, the metallic taste of blood in my mouth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

On his wrist, the imprints of my teeth, where I took back my life from him. On his shoulders, nothing. His beautiful head had been neatly removed, by a force unseen by me. Why my head was still firmly attached to my neck, I still do not know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, I reconstructed the events that occurred while I was unconscious.  The dead vampire, my brief lover, intended to make me his new companion.  However, while he was offering me his wrist to drink his blood, someone appeared. Someone with a score to settle descended on him, shoved me away, and dispatched him.  Thinking I was dead, or that I had not drunk enough blood to become the undead, this person or persons left me.  Or perhaps they themselves were pursued.  Perhaps they have other plans for me.  Whatever it was, they left no trace, no clue to their identity.

It must have been carved there in my back while I was oblivious to the world, while I did not have the strength yet to move.  If we had not been interrupted, the nourishing blood from my lover would have roused me from my near death.  As it was, I unconsciously drank just enough to turn me into a vampire, but in a still weakened state, I was mostly human.  The unseen killer left his mark.  Now, my body heals quickly when pierced.  I have only the scars that were there when I was human. Including the crescent moon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's spring, and three seasons have passed for me in a haze of darkness, blood, lust, and now, fear. In those first moments of confusion, sadness over the loss of my lover, and then animal hunger, I did not notice the little pain in the skin of my back.  I reached out and stroked his arm, cold and white, and pressed his hand to my lips.  Voices at the end of the alley startled me out of my reverie, and I suddenly understood that my lover had been murdered. Suddenly, every shadow held a monster, and in every corner a murderer lurked.  I ran in the opposite direction of the voices, silently on swift feet.  Loathe to the bright lights that now seemed to be everywhere, I sought out shadows.  My thoughts were a jumbled mess, visions of vampire movies competed with and were soon drowned out by a terrible hunger.  Everywhere was the smell of blood, humans, cats, dogs, rats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I know that I was like an orphan those first few nights.  My lover, had he lived, would have explained gently that those cravings I was having did not need to be fulfilled immediately, that I could take my time.  Maybe he would have even offered to make a killing for me, poured the blood into a glass to let me pretend to still be human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGradually, I would have learned otherwise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, my cravings overwhelmed me, and by the end of that night I had made my first kill.  Not a rat or a dog, but a human. A man walking alone on a bridge.  I could feel his despair, and I knew instinctively that he wanted to jump off. In the shadows of a broken lamp, I took that option away from him.  Like a monster in a dream, I leapt at him, tore his clothes from his neck to reveal the pulsing vein, and hungrily sank my long teeth into it. He whimpered, but didn't fight. Now, I had the power to cast the vampire spell over my victims.  </span></div></div>",

But the lioness will remain what she is - a perfect hunter, perfectly adapted to her environment.  My blood rage eventually wore itself out, and by winter, some of my sanity had returned.  I broke from this delirium to find myself in a foreign city.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSan Miguel de Allende, Mexico.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems that, like the migratory birds, I had fled the approaching coldness of winter by simply moving south.  How many nights, how many weeks had I fed like that lioness?  All I know is that when my vampire lover was so brutally murdered, the October leaves still rustled in the trees.  My first memories of San Miguel are of Christmas lights and Nativity scenes all illuminated in front of the churches. It was a strange sensation, less like waking up from a dream, and more like emerging from the cobwebs of childhood into the clarity and knowledge of maturity.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night air felt warm and dry as I roamed the streets of this mountain village.  It also felt safe, like a sanctuary.  Now I know that it was, that I had retreated not only from the deep freeze, but also from the fear I had encountered my first night, and subsequent nights, as a flesh eater.  Here in San Miguel, I stopped my voracious attacks on the lonely, the poor, and the insane. I remembered myself.  Images of my former life as a student, as a lover to my fiance, and all of my former passions began to infiltrate the haze of my damaged mind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after a few weeks in San Miguel, my sad, pondering soul was found by another blood sucker.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had developed a fondness for goat\u2019s blood.  Many farms outside the village raised goats, cattle, and sheep, and I tried not to burden any one farm too much because the farmers are mostly very poor. In an effort to find a goat from a farm that I had not yet visited, I found myself, quite late at night, almost twenty miles away from San Miguel.  I always walked these distances; I enjoyed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, I sensed someone walking behind me, and soon that someone caught up and was walking right next to me. I did not stop, nor even look at this person.  I knew it was a vampire.  I could smell the blood.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was white, an American, and probably from the Midwest, like myself. He was tall, and thin, with a rather weak chin, but full thick lips, a strong nose, bushy eyebrows, and thick brown hair. I couldn\u2019t tell his age, but he reminded me of someone I had once loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe caught me looking and asked, \u201cOff to kill another goat?  You better hurry if you want to get back to that hovel you\u2019ve been staying at in San Miguel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just ambush me there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like these little walks of ours,\u201d he said, \u201cI wanted to meet you properly.  Share a meal together perhaps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been stalking me for a few nights, and he was a deadly killer.  I was terrified, and I knew he could smell my fear, rising from my pores, just as I could smell his confidence\u2026 and something else.  With sarcasm and innuendo, he was trying to elicit fear from me. What did he want?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Veronica,\u201d I said, the first name that popped into my head besides my own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m famished,\u201d he said, \u201cand you can call me Oscar.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were at the goat\u2019s fence. I could hear them in there, braying nervously.  I hopped over.  The goats scattered, but I easily caught one, and quickly, mercifully, ended its life.  Invigorated, I looked around for Oscar.  He was nowhere in sight, but I could guess where he had gone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small house, shack really, held three small children, and a hardworking husband and wife. They slept peacefully in their home, surrounded by miles of cactus, dirt, and the boundless star-studded sky.  Outside, near the door, a dark shadow waited for me.  He beckoned to me.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The presence I had felt in the house receded behind us, but the terrorized yells of the small family stayed in my ears, all the way back to San Miguel.  But Oscar stayed with me, and eventually he lead me to a small house halfway up a hillside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d I asked, collapsing into a large comfortable chair near a fireplace.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOscar knelt down to light a fire.  As the flames leapt from the wood, he looked penetratingly at me.  Gone was the slightly amused, blithe look of merriment.  His dark eyes held pain, his whole body was tense and nervous.  \u201cYou\u2019re problem is, you still think you\u2019re human,\u201d he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded.  It was true.  I remembered back to my first kill, the lonely man on the bridge. How many other sad souls had I killed in the last two months?  I still don\u2019t know.  There are vague images of beams of light, bouncing through the trees, and the sound of dogs barking.  I know I felt terror.  I thought that I must have fled from the police, after committing some gruesome murder.  When I arrived in San Miguel, and began remembering myself, I vowed never to return to that animal fear.  And so I began to kill livestock, like humans do.  But it was a lonely existence, and my hermetic ways had taken their toll.  Now I was hungry for conversation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to be anything else,\u201d I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are a lot of things you don\u2019t know,\u201d he told me, standing and looking nervously toward the window. \u201cAnd I still haven\u2019t eaten.  I don\u2019t have much time, do you want to come with, or wait here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could already feel the tug of sleep.  Looking at the window, the sky was still pitch black, but I knew it would only be an hour until that sky began to tinge pink.  \u201cCan I sleep here?\u201d I asked, \u201cis it safe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hoped that distance from the evil I sensed in the hut would protect me, but instinctually I knew that the evil would someday come for me.  It was no accident that we came so close back there.  But my mind was growing increasingly clouded as dawn approached.  Oscar stood up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be safe for the day.  I know where he is, or at least the general direction.\u201d  He pointed at an inconspicuous door and said, \u201cThe basement is through that door.  You\u2019ll be safe there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not Oscar, this creature was more feral.  I was not afraid.  A match was struck, and the sudden little light illuminated the face of a woman.  She was younger than me, probably a teenager.  She licked her red lips, and regarded me solemnly.  Then, her head twitching curiously and briefly to the side, she smiled, and said, \u201cHunting time.  Are you ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was ready.  I was desperately, severely, achingly, hungry, but I said, swinging my legs off the bed I had slept on all day, \u201cThere\u2019s blood here. I can smell it.  Let me have some. Please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, and lit another candle.  She was dressed all in black, and I knew that she thought her clothes were very dramatic and romantically gothic.  It must have been a dream come true for her when she was bitten by the vampire\u2019s kiss.  I hated her immensely, from her long black hair with the short straight bangs, to her tall black Dr. Martin boots.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t really hate me,\u201d she said, pouring thick red liquid into a clear glass goblet.  She handed it to me roughly and said, \u201cI get testy, too, when I\u2019m hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgetting for the moment that she had read my mind, I drank, mindlessly allowing the blood to enter and rejuvenate my tired body. I handed the goblet back to the goth girl, and sighed, knowing that I had once again allowed myself to drink the forbidden blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hear you drink livestock,\u201d she said, tonelessly, pouring herself a cup, and drinking it down quickly.  \u201cOscar told me all about you, at least as much as he knows, which isn\u2019t much. Just that he\u2019s been following you for a few weeks, and that you had a run in with\u2026\u201d Here she trailed off.  I remembered the horror of the previous night, how something had been with us and yet we had not sensed it.  How it had attacked the family, and the screams they made as they died. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou read my mind, earlier,\u201d I said, \u201cHow did you know that I was sitting there hating you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed, a light, truly happy laugh, and I knew that my first impression had been dead wrong.  \u201cOscar will teach you,\u201d she said, sitting companionably next to me.  \u201cHe teaches everyone, all of the wanderers he brings here. He taught me.  In fact, he brought you here.  I bet you don\u2019t remember the last few months, just that you were drifting.  Well, Oscar figured out a way to send a, kind of a beacon, to bring all the wandering vampires in.  Not that all of them make it, there are just as many vamps out there killing off the uninitiated.  You\u2019re very lucky.  Now, are you going to come hunting with me, or not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI scratched a spot behind my ear irritably.  \u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201cBut I would like to talk to you more.  Will you be back soon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood, and walked to the door, \u201cNot usually, but tonight, I\u2019ll make an exception.\u201d She started to open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long have you been one?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo years,\u201d she said, and slipped out the door.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The goat's blood will keep you alive, but it won't make you relish life.  You have a mark.\" She indicated my crescent moon.  \"That mark was given to you by the Desideros.  As an ally of them, I am obliged to take care of you.  I have many enemies, and few allies.  Come with me, and you will learn what you should have learned months ago.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I looked skeptical, she added, \"What have you got to lose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was how I met Carmen.  She took me to the hilltop mansion where she lived with several other vampires.  It was a heavily guarded compound, with tall walls all the way around, topped with barbed wire.  Inside the walls though, was an extensive garden, full of cactuses and night blooming desert plants.  The mansion itself was a spawling one story affair, with different size rooms ranging from tiny nooks to large rooms with soaring ceilings and huge fireplaces.  I soon learned that being a vampire was all about fending off boredom, and creating interesting spaces was a passion of Carmen's.  Unfortunately, so was torturing humans.  Beneath the beautiful mansion, an intricate series of underground dungeons and corridors had been created.  This is where I would ultimately find my purpose - to destroy the Desideros. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>We were in the dungeon.  It was very dry and cold, with crushed rock for floors.  I was gazing through a small hole in the door of a cell.  Inside the cell was a man, or what was left of a man.  He would be dead soon.  Fortunately for him, he was unconscious.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will finish him off,\" said Carmen.  She opened the door and motioned for me to enter.  I did. The smell of the man's blood drove me into a frenzy, and I fell on him.  I drank his blood and I killed him.  When I looked up at Carmen, she smiled.  \"Good,\" she said, \"Before we dispose of him, I will teach you how to shadow.  Your brain has been rewired as a result of the transformation to vampire.  Tell me how you became a vampire.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI explained everything that I could remember, from meeting my vampire lover, to waking up and finding his body, and then the haze of the next few weeks, wandering in the wilderness, and finally regaining my senses in Mexico.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is what I expected,\" she said. \"Vampires don't make new vampires very often, as they are a terrible burden.  They are like children.  Their brains are changing rapidly, their bodies are gaining in strength, and of course, they have a terrible hunger, all the time.  Not only that, but there is a deep bond between the maker and the child.  The maker cannot just abandon her child.  Now, shadowing.  Close your eyes and think about your body.  Now, think about the wall behind you.  It is cool, and dark grey.  What is the difference between the wall and your body?  There is no difference.  Your body is the wall, make it so. Open your eyes and look down at yourself. What do you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did as she instructed. My body was transparent, or it appeared that way.  I was amazed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any good vampire will see you immediately,\" she said, \"but humans will only see a shadow, and their minds will quickly assume that you are nothing.  They are happier that way.  Especially in their homes, where they feel safest, most secure.  That is where I always grab them.  I like to see the fear in their eyes, as my teeth sink into them, and paralyze them.  You may have noticed the effects that your saliva has on living creatures.  It is a poison, that first paralyzes them, and then puts them into unconsciousness.  I like to think of it as the mercy of the predator.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you always kill them?\" I asked.  \"Can't you just take a few sips, and leave them alive?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we can do that,\" she said.  \"But like I said, I have many enemies.  This is an expedient way to deal with them. That man there, he was a drug dealer.  A rival of my men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You yourself are a drug dealer,\" I said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct.  A human who has just snorted coke has the most delicious flavor in the world.  Look at that one,\" she said, indicating the next cell.  A woman was curled up on the floor.  \"We just brought her here tonight.  We won't kill her, but she will end up in a whore house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen entered the cell. I walked away.  I was already ashamed of myself for what I had done to the man.  Knowing that he was a drug dealer did not assuage my guilt.  Despite myself, I did feel less miserable.  Carmen was right about the difference between animal blood and human blood.  Human blood made me feel, well, human.  I looked around, and determined that I could use my new shadowing skills to sneak into prisons, where I would have a ready supply of evil, guilty blood to drink. </span></div></div>",

I feel so many emotions - fear, pain, confusion, and slowly a dawning awareness of what is happening to me. I look around the alley for the Vampire, for there is no longer any doubt in my mind about his origins. I find him leaning against the opposite wall of the alley, eyes closed, and head back. With my new eyes I see every detail of his face. I see the beauty, yes, but also new things that my human eyes were too dull to see. I see the thin blue veins pulsing with blood, my blood, running in a network under is deathly pale skin. My eyes trace down the length of his lithe body, and I sense the immense power within him, like a coiled snake. When my eyes rise up to his face once again I see that his eyes are open and he is watching me intently. The intensity of his gaze is intoxicating and I am filled with desire for him once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the world of the night, my pet,\" he says with a smile that does not reach his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What.... what have you done to me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing that you didn't desire,\" he replies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't ask for this,\" I say, the heat of defiance rising in my voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hint of a smile plays along the vampires lips. He moves off the wall, coming towards me, lithe and sineus in every movement. He is lust and sexuality incarnate. \"Oh, but you did, little kitten. In the heat of our coupling you called out with your mind and said, 'take me',\" his fingers reach out and trace the line of my jaw, caressing in a way the promises violence to come. \"Look in your heart. You know you would have given me anything I desired of you. And you did, so very generously.\" He leans toward me, his gaze shifting from my eyes to my lips and back again. \"I have given you the gift of eternal life,\" he is closer now, his lips inches from my ear, so close to my neck where he took my life. \"You are mine now. Never forget that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time I realize that I can sense him, not just his presence before me, but inside me. I close my eyes and feel him. He is a part of me now. There is no denying his power over me. I realize with rising panic that he must be able to sense me as clearly as I sense him. He can even read my thoughts, though his are unknown to me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new sensation invades my mind, one that has been gnawing at the edges of my consciousness. Hunger. Intense, burning hunger. Like a junkie my thoughts become incoherent, knowing only need. Dimly I am aware that my body has begun to tremble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampire moves back from me enough to take me by both arms and lead me toward the opening of the alley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are hungry, kitten. Let me soothe your need. We must hurry though. The night grows late and you are too young to be out much longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leads me along, his strong arms around my shoulders, taking me from the alley, back towards the throbbing music and lights of the club. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I am mesmerized and enchanted by the drumming, so chaotic and primal. I am so lost within it that I do not notice my friend come up from behind and grab my arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where have you been! We've been looking all over for you,\" she says, grabbing my arm and pulling me away from the vampire's side. She looks from me to him, a look of worry changing to suspicion as she surveys our faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, um, I needed some fresh air,\" I say feebly. Looking at my friend I am overcome with memories as two conflicting worlds collide within me. I remember laughter filled days with sunshine on her face and smiles, and movies and food and shared secrets. Confusion crept into my mind and suddenly I felt unsure, unstable and afraid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, what's wrong?\" My friend inquires, pulling me closer to her, away from the vampire. I am pulled free from his embrace, and I feel the loss of connection like an electric snap. Suddenly I remember everything, every detail. My mind is crystal clear. I look around me, unsure of what to do, my hunger temporarily forgotten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to get out of here,\" I say, but even as the words leave my lips there is a part of me that knows its already too late. I feel a pulling at my mind, a compulsion, and my eyes are drawn back to the vampires face. Our eyes meet and suddenly, just as quickly as it left our connection evelopes me, warm and safe like a blanket. I lean back into him, smelling his already familiar scent, and feeling the terrible cold of his skin. Without leaving his gaze I say absently, \"I'm fine. Really. Never better.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" My friend says uncertainly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a secret smile for me the vampire speaks. \"You do look tired, my pet. Why don't you let me take you home.\" Turning to my firend he says,\" It's late and this area can be unsafe. Why don't you come with us? I'll drop you at your apartment.\" With my vampire senses I can see his spell falling over my friend easily, erasing fear and worry. My hunger rebounds with vigor and I am again aware of the thumping pulse just below her thin skin. But yet, in a tiny part of my mind the memories of my old life and past friendship remain and a tiny spark of doubt and resistance creeps into me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is my friend. Regardless of what has become of me can I let this harm befall her?  </span></div></div>",

All I can see of the woman before me is the beat of the pulse underneath the fragile skin of her nect and wrist. I am drawn to her, hungry for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sweetie, let us give you a ride home. It's really getting late. I wouldn't be able to live with myself if anything happened to you,\" I say, putting my arm around her waist and drawing her closer to myself and, therefore, the vampire. I smile up into the vampire's face as I sense his will falling over my friend in heavy waves, binding her tigher and tigher, her resistance forgotten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether we exit the club and head towards a dark underground parking garage down the street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing the guards shack at the entrance to the garage the vampire waves his hand, casting a spell over the guard who instantly falls asleep. There will be noone to disturb the dark deeds to follow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe go down, deep below the ground into the darkest reaches of the garage.  The echo of our footfalls is the only sound to be heard. We reach a dark SUV with windows tinted black and usher our dreamy prey inside. The doors closed, sealing out the world and sealing our sounds within. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy ears are ringing with the sound of my friend's pulse, so loud and strong. My eyes glaze over in anticipation and hunger and lust. I know not what comes next, only that there is a burning inside me matching the desperate rythem of her heartbeat, pounding, beating mesmerizing me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is time, Kitten. Take her,\" the vampire commands. I lean forward towards my friend. I am unsure what to do. I am dreaming about the pulse under the thin, fragile skin, but I know not how to access it. I hesitate, looking at the vampire questioningly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an unreadable look he slowly moves toward my friend, looking into her eyes as he inches closer. As he nears her her breath quickens and a small sigh escapes her. Ever so slowly he lowers himself to her rosebud mouth, open and eager for his kiss. She makes small mewling sounds that mingle with the vampires slurping ones as they kiss. Finally he raises his head and regards me with bloodstained lips. The sight of it excites me beyond measure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiss me, my Pet,\" he says, and I obey immediately. The taste of blood awakens my senses, fulfilling me... but it is only a trace, not nearly enough to fill the emmense hunger within me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More,\" I beg, sucking at his mouth, licking his lips and chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampire laughs. \"There,\" he suggests, pointing to my friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEager for more of the life-giving blood my mouth seeks out her fragile neck. I lick the pulse below the skin, the blood so near to the surface. Hesitantly I scratch with my teeth at the offending skin, and am rewarded with a trickle of pure essence, pure joy. Encouraged, I tear harder, until a flow of warm, precious, terrible liquid fills my mouth, overwhelming me, satiating me, horrorifying me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll too soon the vampire is pulling me away. I come to my senses, renewed. I look at the scene before me, and stifle a gasp. Without the haze of hunger I see clearly my long-time friend laid out, her throat torn and ravaged. Her skin is an unatural color, gray and lifeless. In a panic I push myself as far as I can away from her lifeless form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What,... .what have I done??!!\" I wail in terror and pain and fear. I look at the vampire in horror. He regards me calmly, watching without comment. </span></div></div>",

She looks around slowly, uncertain and confused. She begins to call my name, over and over, fear lacing her voice. I shut my eyes tight to fight down the fear within myself at what I had almost done to my friend. What is to become of me? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunger returns like a fist to my gut, throbbing in my ears, sirens in my head of need and want and lust and sickness. I am drunk with want, and the life pulses around me are working me into a frenzy. Overwhelmed and dizzy I am half carried by the vampire as he leads me to the darkest corners of the club. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy breath is fast and shallow and I feel as if I cannot get enough air. \"I'm suffocating,\" I say breathlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, my pet. You no longer need the air. Breathing is a habit that you will lose with time. What you do need, what you will always need, is to feed. Come, it is almost time,\" he says, choosing a seat for us on a velvet couch against the back wall, half hidden behind a gauze curtain.  On the other side of the couch is a man and a woman, locked in a passionate embrace, kissing and touching eachother hungrily. I watch them with interest and desire and I know that at last we have found our prey. With practiced ease the vampire weaves the slightest compulsion, forcing his will upon the unsuspecting lovers. The man, not much more than a boy really, looks up at us with eyes clowded and soft, a half smile on his kiss-swollen lips. His face a flushed with blood and his pulse beats fast and strong in my ears. Without conscious thought I find myself upon him, pawing at him, grabbing and licking his flesh. I kiss his eager mouth openly, as my hands work their way to his shoulders, pinning him down against the arm of the soft velvet sofa. Greedily I find his neck and without any sembalance of finesse I tear the thin skin of his neck and drink his essence into me. Instantly I am flooded with emotions, lust and pleasure, guilt and greed, triumph and overwhelming loss, but more than any of these was the taste that filled my every sense. The boys thoughts and memories flooded my mind, a flash of music, a picture of a pretty girl on a wall, a fight with a woman, his mother? A classroom, my face, and desire, and then pain, and through out it all a pounding greater than any other noise, beautiful and terrible and slowing, each beat later than the one before. It feels like an instant, it feels like a lifetime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I am ready the vampire is pulling me away, away from the boy and away from the flood of memory and sensation. \"Never drink from a victim once they are dead. Never lose yourself in them, or you will die with them,\" the vampire says in a low but urgent voice. I look at him and see that his mouth is stained with blood, as mine must also be. In the corner of my eye I notice the girl slumped over, her hair obscuring her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My victim,\" I repeat, still lost in the boy's memories, uncomprenhending. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampire looks at me, piercing me with his gaze. Like a whipcrack his will snaps me back to reality. I gasp as once again, memory overwhelms me, memory of all that has occured this evening, memory of what I have become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My victim,\" I repeat, clearer now with understanding, \"He's dead.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They both are,\" the vampire replies matter-of-factly. He turns to me now, with compassion in his eyes. I notice that he looks stronger now, vibrant after feeding. \"Much has happened and I sense you are near shock. Sleep now. I will take you somewhere safe to wait out the day.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObediently I succumb to his command, and a sleep deeper than death overcomes me. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I awake from dreamless sleep gradually, as if  surfacing from underwater. I open my eyes and watch the fading colors of twilight receed along the ceiling as I try to recall the events that have occured. I am so caught up within the struggle to understand what has happened to me that I am momentarily unaware that I don't have the slightest idea where I am. Thoughts of my old life, my work, my home, my fiance arise and batter me with regret. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn my head to look at the room around me. I am in a large bedroom. The room is well furnished. The bed I lay on is large and has four beautifully carved posts. I notice a painting on the wall across from me of a nymph, naked except for her long hair that cascades down in waves around her feet. She is smiling coyly, yet her eyes look anything but dimure. The is something vulgar about the painting, though I cannot put my finger on what. I am drawn to the nymph's naked form, and my eyes roam over her voluptuous body. I feel guilt at my admiration and turn away to look out the open balony doors. The last light of the dusk is quickly fading, the black of night invading the room. I can hear the song of the night birds outside my room, and from somewhere close by I inhale the scent of wild jasmine. As a poor girl my whole life there is a part of me that likes the quiet luxury that surrounds me and that part of me is not at all unhappy about this unexpected turn of events. Immediately I feel guilty for the thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all how I expected a vampire to live,\" I say aloud to no one.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you expect, coffins in a hidden dungeon?\" a voice tinged with amusment says from across the room. I am unsuprised by the vampire's apperance, and I realize it is because a part of me already was aware of his presence. It was beyond thought. It was instinct. Without sound he moves from his place next to the balcony door, half hidden by the billowing white curtains. A small smile plays on his lips. \"How very...gothic of you, Kitten.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sight of him all thoughts of my old life are forgotten from my mind. My god, he is handsome. My breath becomes short with desire. I drink in his form, dark almost black hair cut short and worn difiantly spiked and youthful. Blue eyes that are so expressive regard me now with amusement and something else... something carnal. His generous mouth is parted slightly, a slight smile touching only the corners. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy chest heaves with deep breaths, filled with lust at the sight of him. Is this more compulsion? As I watch his epression changes and I remember that he can read my thoughts. Embarrassed at both my desire and my doubt of him I desperately search for something to fill the silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I don't even know your name.\" I say, my voice shaking slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampire regards me for a moment, then crosses the room to me, moving slowly, stalking me. He drinks in the view of my body lying on the bed of rich white cotton sheets and fur. Someone has removed my clothes and dressed me in a white satin gown. He picks up my hand from where it rests on my stomach and kisses the tips of my fingers, his eyes never leaving mine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christose,\" he breathes between kisses and soft nibbles. The is a hint of an accent, but I cannot place it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christose,\" I repeat, enjoying the word on my lips. He turns my hand over and begins to kiss and lick my wrist, leaning closer to me. Without hesitation I reach my hand around his neck and pull him towards me, kissing him hungrily. I desperately want to feel his weight on me, crushing me to the bed. Slowly, slowly, he lowers himself down to the bed, down to me and for a long time I think of nothing but the magnificant sensations Christose delights, teases, punishes, and finally, blissfully fullfills me with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long time later we lay together on the bed, my head on Christose's unmoving chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm hungry,\" I say with a sigh as my fingers make lazy circles on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy, what vorascious appetites you have, Kitten,\" he replies playfully into my hair. \"Shall we dine out tonight or would you prefer to stay in?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Let's go out,\" I reply, remembering the intoxicating mixture of emotions and memories from my first feeding. As much as I hate to admit it, it is an experience that I am eager to have again. Not to mention the fact that I can feel my hunger returning, feel the urgency building. I know that I will need to drink soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe get up and dress quitely. I discard the satin gown and put on my clothes from the night before (my god, has it really only been one night? It feels like another lifetime!), which have been laundered and folded in a stack on top of an intricately carved dresser. \"I am going to need to get my clothes,\" I think to myself absently. Immediately I am struck by the realization of how quickly I have surrendered my old life in exchange for this new, odd world I have found myself in. Am I really ready to leave behind my job, my family, my fiance?!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With time you will forget your new life,\" Christose says while buttoning up his shirt. He ignores me while walking over to a armoir to retrieve a leather jacket and then pierces me with his gaze. \"You belong with me now.\" There is a possessiveness in his voice which allows no discussion.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI consider going to him, kissing him and telling him that I could never wish for anything else, but I know that he can read my thoughts, and would know the lie before it left my lips. I discard the idea, and finish dressing quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are very smart not to lie to me, Kitten,\" Christose says from directly behind me. I never heard him approach! His strong hands turn me to face him, and strokes my cheek, then reachs under my chin and lifts my face to look at him squarely. He waits, and finally I reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christose, this is all a huge change for me. Yesterday my life was all in place and now everything is different. I am smart enough to realize that whether I fight it or not, I have gone too far to go back to that life. But it is going to take time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe regards me for a moment, looking into my eyes, probing. Finally he smiles down at me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time, my pet, is something that we have in abundance,\" he says, then leans down to kiss me not ungently. \"Come, let's go find some prey.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he takes my hand and leads me out of the room, and downstairs, out of the house to a waiting car. It is black and sleak and the inside smells like new leather. The smell of the leather soothes me somehow, like the smell of prey. We ride together in silence, both lost in thought. As Christose drives he strokes my hand absently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe drive to an affluent area of town, and I recognize it to be only a few miles from the jazz club we met at the night before. All around us are clubs and restaurants and nightlife. The clock in the dashboard reads 10:18 and the streets are still full of people. It is a surreal feeling to me to be surrounded by people once again. I look at them differently, for I am no longer a part of them. And they can sense it. I see it in the startled looks that are shot at our car by the people we pass by. Though they don't know why, our passing causes unease, like a wolf passing by a pen of sheep on her nightly rounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look to Christose and we share small smile, as if a joke as passed between us. He parks the car and we get out and join the people on the street. We walk together arm in arm, looking, searching. Before going very far we see two pretty young girls, dressed for going out to a nightclub. They walk ahead of us, talking and laughing, unaware of our presence. I am bathed in their wake of expensive perfume, soap, beauty products and more. I can even smell the scent of one of the girl's brand new shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're turn, Pretty Kitten,\" Christose says in a voice pitched for only my ears. \"Let's try out your new vampire magic on these little ones. Will them to go into that alley up ahead with us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gather my fledgling stregnth and cast my willpower over the girls. They both jolt forward and fall to the ground. Damn! Too strongly done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly and with ease, Christose reaches the girls and leans down, offering them his arm, while casting his spell over them with practiced simplicity. \"My, that's a nasty fall you took. There must be a crack in the sidewalk. Here, allow me to help you up.\" And just like that, they were under his spell. I reach them now, and again we began walking forward, the four of us arm in arm, Christose and I on the ends, herding the women into the opening mouth of the alleyway. They go without protest, giggling and leaning against us as if drunk. Together we walk into the alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a shallow alley, with dumpsters on either side, and in the end of the alley, behind the dumpsters is where we lead the women. \"Wait against the wall,\" Christose commands one of the women, who instantly complies, a small smile on her face. He comes to the other side of the woman next to me and with his eyes locked on mine, we each take a side of her thin, lovely neck, drinking in her essence. Again the flood of emotion and memories overcome me, but through it all Christose's eyes keep me present. This time I am able to release the girl before her final heartbeat. We release her simulatinously and she drops to the ground at our feet. With passion and satiation and pleasure we kiss eachother, blood mingling on our toungs and lips. Slowly, Christose releases me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is only then that I realize an familiar scent has been building around me. \"What is it?\" I think to myself, puzzled. Then it hits me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut my realization comes too late as a man comes into view at the entrance to the alley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brad,\" the word is nothing more than a breath escaping my lips, but Christose hears it. He looks at me questioningly, then at the figure invading the alley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy fiance has found me.     </span></div></div>",

The woman\u2019s blood still in the air, my hunger unfulfilled, after only half of my last victim.<br>\r\nI paused, mid-stride as it hit me. It was really too much, and the other woman was not the human that my gaze was focused upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shuddered, knowing my current lover was dying as I swallowed, too instinctive now to focus enough to pull away.<br>\r\nBrad\u2019s last memories were of me, of the feral look in my inhuman gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I let him drop, dead, to the ground, I took in an unnecessary breath to calm myself, before falling to the cold, unforgiving cement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like hours, but it could have been just a few minutes before I felt another presence. Strong, icy arms wrapped around my shoulders, and under my knees, lifting up from the ground. \u201cCome now, Kitten. You\u2019ve had a hard two days.\u201d<br>\r\nAs I pulled myself against his chest, I felt something I never thought I\u2019d feel in this man\u2019s arms. I didn\u2019t feel anger, or fear, or even the always present lust.<br>\r\nI felt safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an odd realization; to feel safe around the man that had killed you.<br>\r\nBut as I was laid down on the soft bed, his arms pulling me close to him, as I went unconscious more than fell asleep, that\u2019s exactly what I felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up, I looked around the room, not seeing Christose. I sighed, sitting up in the bed, before getting up and looking out the window.<br>\r\nThe sky was a navy blue, lightened only by the waxing cresent shape of the moon, as it glowed irridecent, and white. I felt a serenity cross my mind as I tried to keep out the thoughts of everything that had happed the past two nights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had an odd thought cross my mind as I saw how ungodly high up the window was, and that directly below it, was a concrete drive. My thoughts, were of jumping from here, and finally ending this nightmare, or, if I survived the fall, running away from the man that was holding me from my life.<br>\r\nI took in a breath, deciding whether to jump, or stay where I was. To stay with Christose, my killer.</span></div></div>",
