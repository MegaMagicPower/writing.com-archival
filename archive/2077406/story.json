He was an intense wet dream, they been happening more and more over the past week. In his dream he was surrounded by the many gorgeous women he knew. Right now his cousins Gwen and Sunny where giving him a double blowjob. He was holding both ex-girlfriend Julie and Kai Green as he made out with both. The sexy silver hair sorceress Charmcaster, was pressing her breasts into his back as she rubbed his hands all over her chest. Drew Saturday, his mother Sandra, his aunt Lily, Julie's mother Jessica and Turbine where on their knees in front of them. They where all calling him master and said they where his for every.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Ben awoke and shot up, he was breezing heavily as he was covered in sweat. He closed his eyes, as he sighed. He gulped, as he tried to calm down. He was only where a pair of green boxers and soon felt his morning wood. He looked down and saw a giant redwood under his covers. He smirked, he was proud of his twelve inch manhood. Which wouldn't, but it was throbbing and hard as a rock. He need to fix that, so he went to his bathroom. He spend the next half an hour jerking in the shower. He climaxed five times and he was still only half hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got out, dried off and got dress. He dressed in his normal black T-shirt, green jacket, pair of jeans and sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he went to the kitchen, he gulped as he saw his mother making breakfast. She was wearing a pair of daisy ducks, a green shirt and a green apron. He couldn't help but stare. Her nice ass stuffed in those tight shorts and those long legs. He also knew she had an incredible pair if F cups breasts. She had a slender figure and a gorgeous face. Ben had to admit that his mother was a MILF. He hated to admit this as well, he peeped on her a few times before. When she was changing and forgot to close the door all the way, when she need a towel when she was in the shower and that one time she was sun bathing and didn't have a top one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head, no he shouted mentally this was his mother. Then she turned around and Ben nearly fell over. Her blouse had several buttons undone and with that low cut apron, showed off her cleavage and hints of her green lace bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Breakfast sweetie.\" Said Sandra, as she put the pancakes, eggs, bacon and hash browns down on the tables. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen blushed, and quickly sat down. They ate in silences, as Ben tried not to look at his mother. He couldn't help but took glances at her. She was sexy and couldn't help buy mentally undress her. He felt his manhood hardening again, he curse himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra ate with her son in an awkward silences. She wanted to stop thinking about those dreams she keel having. They where about her and Ben having all kinds of wild and passionate sex, heck even a few other women where in those dreams as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe should ashamed but she haven't had sex in over two years. Plus, she knew had handsome, well tone and hang his was. Ben something forgets to close his door all the way. So a few times she peeped on him. She blushed, at his chiseled chest, this powerful arms and legs and once she saw his manhood. She gulped, he was big. So much bigger then his father, she spend hours masturbating afterwords. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now she was getting wet just sitting across from him. She was rubbing her thighs, as she felt her panties getting wet. Thoughts of Ben throwing her on the table, ripping her clothes off and fucking her into submission filled her mind. No, she screamed mentally. This was her son, her little boy, her big strong handsome young man with a cock that she would do anything for. Sandra gulped, she needed a cold shower after breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: There was a knock at the door. ( R.C. on who)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Sandra started playing footsy with Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Slytherin did scared him, all that Blood Purity stuff reminded him to much of his aunt and uncle and the fact that was his house. He was told his followers where still around and their kids will be there, where their plans to assassinate him.

He had just got back from his first real mission outside of Konoha. It was a disaster, yes they won, Gato was dead and the Land of Wave was free. They quickly signed a treaty with The Land of Fire, for protection and trade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got another ninja, Haku the last of his clan. He had the kekkei Genkai Hyoton, Ice Release. Which was power no where near the power of the Sharingan, but powerful. To bad he wasn't a real girl, he looks like a girl. If was a girl, she could have an excellent choice to help him remake the Uchiha Clan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason he thought it was disaster was because he was the only one who did anything. His other two teammates if you could call them that. Sakura the pink hair Kunoichi, was useless. She was to busy fowning over him to do anything. Naruto might have helped but only when he used that red Chakra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke was furious, he thought he could do anything if he was powerful enough, but now he realized he needed a team to take down power opponents. One person can only do so much, he wanted another team. A team who took training seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slammed his fist into a wall, he was shocked when his fist went right then the wall. He felt emptyness, he quickly pulled his fist out and looked into the hole. He was stunned to fine a room behind the wall. He quickly knocked down the wall and entered the room. He lift a torch to get some light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had found a secret section of his clan library. He quickly looked over the few scrolls inside. Most where to advance for him or he felt were not worth his time. Then he found two and smiled. This two could be a big help to solving his problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne scroll had a way to make a target you slave peramently and the other can rewrite reality, changing a mle into a female peramently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke grinned, with this he can make any Kunoichi his slave. Sakura might be useful after all, once he makes her his slave. He can make her take her training seriously, reports say he was nartual for being a medic and genjutsu master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other if it really works, Haku be a great wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does Sasuke go after first ?</span></div></div>",
