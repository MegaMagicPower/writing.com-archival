David's own extraordinary situation started a few days earlier in an isolated cabin, and that book....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, no. Not THAT book. This was a different cabin and a far different  book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wouldn't have found it if he hadn't gotten himself lost, and yet it was almost faith that he came upon it. He'd been walking for miles,he'd lost his compass,  his GPS was totally non functional. Last time he'd buy anything off ebay. He was still in among the mountains so he couldn't get any cell phone service.  On top of all this it was getting dark and he saw storm clouds from the east, so when he came upon the decrepit cabin he was  glad for even that much shelter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho knows how long ago it had been built. The roof sagged, it was almost completely covered in a thick layer of moss and whatever road or trail that might've lead up to it  was long gone.  The doorknob turned easy, but the hinges refused to budge and David had to put his shoulder into it to open the door enough to squeeze through. It surprised him that the door hadn't broken apart under the weight.  The inside looked just as bad as the outside and smelled musky.  Oddly, he didn't notice any signs of animals taking up residence within the abandoned shack. Taking off his pack, David light his lamp.  The lamp illuminated  enough of the interior for him to notice the one item in the cabin that seemed to be uncorrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked to be bound in brown leather and when David touched it, it felt warm to the touch.  He concluded it must've been the light shining in through  the only window that was not covered by vegetation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd look at it later, at that moment David's concern was to set up his tent on the floor of the cabin. He could hear drops of rain on the roof and he had no way of knowing whether or not the  roof leaked. when he'd had that done and his sleeping bag rolled out he turned his attention back to the book.  The first thing he noticed as he opened the book that  the pages were made not from paper. Of what exactly he wasn't sure but he knew it wasn't paper.  Second, it was hand written and illustrated but he couldn't read the writing. About halfway through it he found a scrap of yellowed paper someone had placed there.  Holding the paper to the lamp light he read out loud what was written on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Klaatu.... barada.... nikto\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited. Nothing. Nothing at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully replacing the scrap of paper back into the book and putting the book back on the table, he blew out the lamp and climbed into the tent. Sleep though hadn't come easy, the rumble of thunder was loud, so loud that he could feel it through the ground. What David didn't know was that the Thunder Storm had covered up a far more extraordinary event. While he tried to sleep, the world around him changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when David awoke....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Cabin was gone, along with his tent, his camping gear, the shirt off his back. Then noticed his surroundings. He was lying on a leaf of an enormous tree. Only it wasn't like any a tree he had ever seen before. The branches were thick. thicker than any he'd ever seen, and among the impossibly large leaves were huge blue spheres about half his size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe those words he'd spoken out lout were not just a bunch of gibberish he'd first thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he felt the earth tremble. loud thumps could be heard growing  closer and louder. the tree shook slightly with every thump.

'What is that!?' he shouts in his mind as one good sized quake sends him flying a few inches into the air, causing him to land upon his rear. As if the ominous occurrences weren't enough, the sun light above him was entirely blocked out from some unforeseen force as the explosive movements suddenly died down. 'd-d-don't look back...' David though to himself as he felt his blood freeze all inside him. 'w-whatever you do...don't look back.' despite the requests that his mind was ordering his body, it seemed that curiosity was slowly getting the best of him. Slowly, he turned his uncontrollably shaking neck only to gaze up in shear shock at the sight before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis must've been some sort of dream for David. It just had to! ! the sight right ahead of him should've been proof of that. Standing merely a few yards away was the face of a Massive bear! brown fur adorned its face and snout, as large amber eyes gazed down upon the plant above David. This was no ordinary bear though, no. Back home, bears were commonly quadruped legged mammals, but not this one. In fact, this one appeared humanoid simply by its fur covered arms and legs as well. Surprisingly enough, this humanoid bear was also dressed like a human as well. Adored upon her torso was a bright yellow sleeveless shirt with a pair of blue shorts that stopped halfway up her thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow! a blueberry bush!\" she says in a surprisingly upbeat voice. The voice alone was a clear indication that she was still young of age, possibly that of a preteen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'b-blueberry bush?' you mutter in your head before letting out a surprised gasp. That explain the blue orbs adorned all about this huge plant. This was no tree at all! David quickly gazes up at the plethora of huge branches and leaves high above him in slight awe and shock. With just one of these blueberries, he could have a meal, let alone two for an entire week. Just then, the sounds of loud rustling immediately snapped him out of his trance as he quickly turns to gaze back at the ginormous bear girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A couple of blueberries shouldn't hurt.\" she says to herself with a smile as her large furred hand began to make its way straight towards the bush.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

He saw a huge upper body and then a face. The face belonged to an anthropomorphic grizzly bear wearing blue overalls.

The ride was rather bumpy and Nick lost a few berries as he walked. When they arrived hen  to their camp (which was really a tent made of an old cloth) they crawled in through the door  and sat crossed legged on the grass floor. A huge furry face loomed into view. David didn't think he cold see him since David was buried under some blue berries. What cloths he had been wearing  were already stained blue from the juice as was his naked upper body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other hand/paw came into view, It passed David and descended. The enormous fingers poked and prodded at the berries until David  saw it rise upward with a berry grasped between thumb and forefinger. He watched as the cub placed it in his mouth and hungrily ate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand descended again this time it picked up a berry very close to David. It suffered the same fate as the first one. David got to thinking, how would Nick react if he found him?   What if he freaked out? A worst thought came to mind, what if he doesn't notice? What if he ate the human simply because he wasn't paying any attention?<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nHe didn't like the idea of that happening. He had to get out of his palm. And when Nick picked up the berry that was just on top of him, David knew he had to do something soon.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With the giant ursine too distracted with the delectable berry, the tiny human quickly seized the opportunity to quickly scramble his way underneath the nearest mass of berries. With all the giant blue orbs rolling about due to the bear boys sudden movements, it was a simple way for David to remain concealed and unnoticed underneath the mass of giant fruit. After struggling and squirming his way past at least five or so of the massive blueberries, his eyes soon met with the moving landscape beyond the palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was gazing upon the ginormous trees passing along with each stride the bear made, David was quickly starting to have seconds thoughts about his decision. What if he miscalculated his leap and somehow ended up getting noticed by the bear giant right away? What if he even managed landing right onto something solid down below, like a rock or stick? As more of the possibilities of failure begin to envelop within his mind, so did the sounds of the blueberries moving behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith wide eyes, David's body starts to shudder as his mind revels in panic over the sudden predicament. If he didn't act now he could possibly end up getting killed, though if he was to suddenly act then it could result in the same outcome. With shaking nerves, David immediately gets to his feet before spiriting towards the horizon of the huge palm. In no time at all, he clenches his eyes close before taking a large leap over the edge of the leathery surface. While his jump was in no way graceful in terms of form, David lets gravity do it's job as he feels his body begin to descend downwards towards the earth. With the wind rushing past his form, and nerves tightening up in fear, the only possible thing David could do was wait for the inevitable collision.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David froze in utter shock and disbelief as he was soon being raised upwards straight towards the bear girls face. As if the sight of her massive furred face wasn't intimidating enough, she soon opened her massive maw to give him a view of her huge organic cavern of a mouth. Teeth like stalactites and stalagmites adorned the upper and bottom portions of the entrance as her huge slimy tongue gently moved about within. Beyond those two lied the dark gaping hole that was her throat. Immediately, David began to try and squirm his way past the huge mounds of blueberries besides him, though unfortunately for him with every struggle seemed to make a bit of the berries juice seep out and bind him in stickiness. Within just a matter of moments, his hand ended up getting stuck upon one of the berries surfaces as the girls soon had the berries positioned right before her maw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"w-wait! d-\" before even having the chance to shout for attention, she immediately tossed the cluster of fruit as well as David within her mouth. Inside, David immediately made contact with the slimy surface of her tongue before him and the berries were tossed all about. Outside, the bear girl was closing her eyes blissfully as the succulent flavor of the blueberries began to fill her taste buds. A content and happy moan emerged from her closed mouth as a smile emerges upon her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the girl was indeed enjoying this moment, David was on the opposite side of the spectrum. The tiny human was forced to frequently evade contact with the sharp teeth all about as they constantly descended and raised rhythmically. To make matters worse, the whole inside of her mouth seemed impossible to get any traction at all. While he did manage to sometimes get a good footing for about a millisecond, he was immediately sent slipping down the squishy surface of her tongue soaked in saliva and blueberry juice. After what seemed like an endless onslaught of evading the dizzying chamber all movement suddenly began to stop. With a groan David slowly sat upwards from his sitting position looking about in confusion and slight relief. Did she finally realize that he was inside her mouth? Hope slowly began to fill up his mind at the thought of actually escaping this nightmarish predicament. however, his hopes quickly vanished by the sudden feeling of movement behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"n-no..\" David stammers. To his horror the whole mouth slowly began to tilt its way upwards, sending the chewed up batch of blueberries tumbling downwards. With all his speed and strength, David attempts to clamber his way towards the tip of the tongue. Despite his incredible effort in attempting escape, the surface of the tongue was indeed too slippery to make any good traction whatsoever. \"n-n-no! please!\" he shouts trying with all his might to quickly crawl his way upwards. After barely making it a few yards upwards, a massive glob of bear saliva soon began to slide its way straight towards him, ultimately encasing him in the goo. With the quickest of motions, David pops his head out only to view the fleshy chasm that was the bear girls throat before him. \"n-no!\" with the swiftest of motions, both he and the glob of saliva were soon sent straight down the path of the blueberries with a mighty *GULP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way downwards was indeed a daunting experience for David. As he descended down the contracting fleshy tunnel that was the bear girls throat, he tried his best to grip upon the surface. Like the slimy tongue before him, his attempts proved meaningless as gravity continued to lead him downwards. In just a few seconds, a massive fleshy opening below suddenly opened up expelling a blast of hot air and putrid aroma straight into David's face. The hole eagerly accepted the tiny human as David soon ended up free falling into the belly of the oblivious bear girl. With a splash, he found himself floating upon the liquidy muck that was her digestive juices. \"this can't be happening...\" he told himself shaking his head in utter disbelief. \"t-this can't be happening!\" As hard as it was for him to face the truth...he was indeed stuck within her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"that was delicious!\" Becky says with a lick of her lip and pat of her belly. \"I bet mom and dad will just love these!\" she giggles. In just moments, her and her brother soon began to make their way home with a handful o berries in tow.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't a plane or chopper. It looked more like an enormouse blue bird.  Then came the first tremmor, and another stronger than the last, and another growing in strength and intensity.  Nobody needed to tell David what that was, he'd  seen enough Godzilla movies to know what that was. He ignored the little voice in his head that was telling him this was impossible and instead hid behind the leg of a dresser just as the huge door opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then another foot/paw and a leg swung into view as a giant towering hundreds of feet above his head came into full view. It was a Bear, or at least it looked like one. Dressed only in blue overalls. David concluded that it was male. Walking behind the first giant was a creature of equal stature. This one resembled a Puma and dressed in shorts and a t-shirt. His tail swayed back and forth behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"So, what do you want to play?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" How about Checkers?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough loud, there voices were distinctively that of children. Two young boys. Other than that, this was a dream come true for David. Being a Macrophile--<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll get it.\"<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thundering footfalls shook David out of his train of though as the Bear Cub walked over to the dresser and stopped just a few feet from where David was hiding. He studied the paw, noting the length of the claws and the thickness of the fur. He could see the grey pads under the fur, smooth and devoid of callous.  Though he had a thing for paws he had to remind himself that this was a child and nothing to get excited about. His partents on the other hand were a different matter all together. Getting the checker board and playing pieces off the dresser, the Bear Cub walked over to his friend where they sat on their knees on the floor. David watched them set the pieces together with fascination. Who wouldn't ? It was like going back in time and observing Dinosaurs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Welcome to Jurassic Park.' thought David. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething compelled him to get a closer look at the two Giants. Whether it was his macrophile or his sense of adventure or the sense or curiosity, or a combination of all three, he really didn't know. Whatever the case, he ran to the far wall and began to slowly walk along the side of it to where they were playing.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As small as he was to the two he was out in the open. David felt exposed. If either one of them glanced in the direction of the wall, he was certain they'd spot him easily. He didn't know what such creatures would do to him so he didn't dare go past the back of the Bear Cub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mountain of coarse brown fur towered upward despite being in a kneeling position. He looked almost like an Ewok that someone enlarged to battle a Gorax. His attention soon drew to the broad gray pads of the Bear Cub's feet. He couldn't help himself and he felt it was better to acknowledge they existed rather than trying to ignore them. A full un-calloused pad with oval shaped toe pads. At the end of each pad, a thick dull claw.  Without a doubt, they looked amazing and yet quite deadly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was going to back away and look for a place to hide out when something caught his attention, other than the huge paws in front of him. More specifically it was something on the part the broad pad that made up the ball of the foot. It looked out of place in a room that resembled something from the pioneer days. Just as out of place as himself. He couldn't tell what it was but if he wanted to find out what it was he was going to have to get closer. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From ten feet away he could feel the heat radiating from the appendage. When he was close enough, he reached out and touched a claw. Feeling the surface was all the evidence his mind needed to tell him that what he was seeing was real. Then came the moment of truth. Using the claw he pulled himself up onto the toe pad. He held his breath for a moment, assuming an immediate reaction. Nothing. The Bear Cub either didn't feel him or was concentrating too much on the game to care. Nonetheless, David crept quietly and as inconspicuously as he could  over the toe pad and onto the main pad toward the object. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKneeling he examined the object.  It looked like the license plate of a car. It had been pressed into the pad and remained stuck there It probably would've fallen off eventually. Though the number was unfamiliar to him the expiration date on the sticker said 1979. David pulled the plate from the damp pad. As he did so there was a sudden movement and he was thrown backward. The toes of the paw flexed and without looking the cub swung a hand behind him to scratch the itch David made  when he freed the license plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn eighteen by three foot finger scratched at the pad a few feet from where David sat on his backside holding the crumpled plate. With the itch dealt with, the hand swung back around to the front. That had been to close. Time to get off the Foot/Paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing off the paw the same way he climbed on, David headed away from the two cubs. When he was certain he was safe, he looked at what he had retrieved. If it told him anything it was that he wasn't the first one to be sent to this place, if there were others, maybe they might still be around. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Where was the rest of the car or truck this belonged to? How  did it get here? He had a pretty good idea how, the same way he got here. Looking back on it all he realized that there was a remnant of road that led up to that decrepit cabin. It was possible the owner had driven up said the very words out loud that he had said and was whisked away to parts unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing the plate in his backpack, David took out a flash light and ventured out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Boy Cub was asleep in his bed as David made his way out from under a dresser. From where he was the human could see the great mass rise and fall with each breath. He had to admit, climbing up onto that paw was accelerating. Almost arousing had it been an older giant. The more he thought about that, the more he wanted to see if he could find such a giant. More preferably a giantess or the anthropomorphic equivalent. So he decided to leave the Cub to his dreams and crawl under the great door to whatever lay beyond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout as near as he could tell what lay beyond was a very dark hallway of sorts. Like in the Cub's bedroom the floor was composed of set wooden planks held down with nails. He had to jump between gaps that were easily two feet across and three feet deep, if he had to he figured he could jump into one if anyone showed up. All around he could hear heavy breathing from areas of the home. It surprised him how much sound he was able to pick up at his current scale. It came in handy a few moments later when he heard the sound of someone getting up out of a bed. He began to hear and feel heavy footfalls coming his way. He quickly shut off his flashlight so he wouldn't be seen. In the darkness he sensed the great mass in the darkness, the claw tipped toes scraping on the wooden floor.  </span></div></div>",

From his position by the wall, and out in the open, David couldn't help but feel exposed. If either one of them glanced in his direction he was certain they'd spot him easily. Fortunately for him, the attention of both cubs centered on the checkered board. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid noted the antique look of the board with it's wooden pieces rather than the plastic red and black he was familiar with. It wasn't just the Checkered board either. Their clothes, the look of the furniture, the oil lamp. They all pointed to a pioneer time period or something along those lines. How could reading such simple words from a book send him here? Not that he had any reason to complain mind you. How often does one have a front row seat to the checkered match of Titans?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, David couldn't help but notice the broad padded paws of the Puma Cub. He couldn't help not to look, it was almost second nature. He concluded they could do a lot of Damage. 300 foot tall Anthropomorphic puma cub vs five foot eight human equals red stain on a paw pad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourse, David's priorities were not what they should've been. Instead of looking at paws he should've been keeping a close eye on the puma's tail which was now beginning to sway back and forth as the cub began to concentrate on the game.  He was completely caught off guard as he was struck by the tail in one such quick flick. The blow, while surprisingly didn't hurt him sent him flying upward in an arch. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Other than being covered in fur and looking like animals they acted like typical kids. Typical kids who happened to be hundreds of feet tall. David looked at the eyes of both giants and thought he could hear gears grinding as one tried to beat the other.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's macrophilla was in high gear, not that he was planning to do anything,  but he envisioned being grasped between finger and thumb pads of one of the kids while they giggled and planned things to do to him.

It was more than he'd ever imagine they would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause she was sleeping on her side, on paw rested on top of the other like a great wall of flesh. The pads were wide and of a dark grey. They were smooth and lacked callous The pads were surrounded by think fur and sticking out from which were  claws tips that were trimmed shorter than those belonging to the bears of his world. There was a smell, but nothing that resembled the odor of a human foot. What did a bear's foot smell like? He had no idea. In any rate, to David the smell was not overbearing. He was still breathing hard and the air he breathed was warm from the heat radiating from the paws.Thinking quickly he took his digital camera out and began taking pictures to record the moment for posterity. If he ever returned home he wanted a record.  When he finally got his breath back David stood up and decided to get closer. As he did, he noticed the pads were not perfectly smooth, but rather covered in small, bumps. David remembered they were called  papillae. Like the dermal swirls on a human, they were used for traction. He took a few more pictures, then decided he wanted to get closer. Much much closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was about to though, he was struck with a thought. He was wearing loose clothing that could tickle the pads enough to wake the bear giantess. He didn't want that. So he stripped down to his Boxers. This turned out to be a really good idea as it gave him less resistance as he crawled through the thick strands of fur to the closest toe pad. As he reached up to touch the pad, he noted the texture of soft leather that the pad had. When he was certain, she would not wake up, he climbed up upon the toe pad. Though soft, his minuscule weight barely made an indentation on the pad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the most incredible moment of his life.</span></div></div>",

While he did wish he could get a better examination from many different vantage points, he knew all too well that trying to traverse a creature this size would take quite a bit time. And apart from that, there was no telling just when she would wake up from her rest. As he was standing trying to decide just where to look first, the sounds of her slow breathing suddenly caught his attention. Turning his head to the right, he manages to spot her massive brown furred head resting upon a gigantic white pillow. With curiosity invigorating his adventurous spirit, he slowly yet carefully began his trek down the valley sized blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the blanket was quite a challenge to overcome, mainly due to the amount of loose stitching's adorning some areas, he finally managed to make his way before the Bear girls massive snout. Sanding mere yards away, David could feel her great breaths rhythmically pass in and out of her mouth sending great gusts of warm air all about his miniscule form. As his hair was swept back from a great exhale, he manages to catch the scent of an oddly sweet aroma from her breath. Judging by the smell alone, she must've had a small snack of berries or something close to that line before entering into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBombarded by the gusts of warmth, curiosity soon began to grow in David's mind as he found her mouth slightly agape from a small smack of her lips. Slowly, yet carefully, he treads down the fabric of her blanket to take a small quick peek into the bear girls colossal mouth. In no time at all, David soon stood right before the lips of the sleeping giantess before raising his head to peek into the slimy cavern. To him, it was almost as if gazing into a completely different world. The innards of the organic cave were adorned with pink slimy walls, along with pure white stalactites and stalagmites adorning the upper ad bottom sections of the entryway. Lying just on the bottom before the dark abyss that was her gullet stood her ginormous pink glistening  tongue. Gazing in Awe for several seconds, David did nothing more than scan his eyes about the alien like landscape. To his shock however, a small groan soon escaped the great figure before him followed by a large shift in surrounding. As the bear giantess began to stir, he soon found himself losing balance.</span></div></div>",

Denied his opportunity to take another look into her mouth, he decided to take a climb up further onto her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy all rights, he probably should have been more cautious.

In just moments, the other great eyelid began to raise as both great eyes were staring directly at him. From his vantage point, it was clear that the bear was surprised judging solely by how high the upper eyelids were rising. \"w-w-what?\" The giantess stammers as she remains as still as possible on the bed. Deep in David's chest, it felt as if his heart was on the verge of leaping out any second by how rapidly it was beating. To his utter horror and disbelief, he was at the mercy of tis ginormous bear girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs David was expecting an ear shattering scream, let alone a quick startled leap in response, to his confusion and surprise, the bear girl remained as still as possible as her eyes were still glued to his location.

Sure there was a high risk of death, but he was in a Freak'n Giant's Hand!

Sure the human managed to stumble into her room unscathed, but just how would he be able to make it outside the house all on his own alone? At such a tiny size, there was a plethora of dangers the human would have to face, each of which could result in horrible injuries, or even worse, death. The thought of such a tiny creature immediately passing away after mere hours or days of encountering sends a worried filled shiver run down Becky's spine. A sudden sense of determination begins to fill her eyes as she intently stares upon the miniscule being. With so many threats, especially other individuals out there who would wish to harm David, Becky took it upon herself to try and protect the human as best as she could. While she certainly wasn't no knight or hero like the fairy tales her mother use to tell, she did have one thing that each of them possessed, a strong and caring will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...David.\" Becky begins. \"Is there any place that you're staying at right now?\" she asks with a curious head tilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's eyes begin to widen by the logical question. \"huh...not really.\" he admits with one hundred percent honesty. Now that he thought about it, He really had no idea just where to head in this strange world. Sure he was safe before the company of this massive bear girl, but outside? he had no idea just where to head, let alone what would be considered a safe to stay put. This sudden realization soon sends a small frenzy coursing through his brain. Just how on earth was he going to survive all by himself? Being such a tiny size, almost everything now could be proven a dangerous hazard. Even simple tasks such as walking could be proven a challenge due to the ginormous sized residents of the world, as well as the famished birds flying about. As David tries his best to collect himself from the small panic, Becky's voice soon manages to obtain his upmost attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" She stammers awkwardly. \"you could always...stay with me.\" she insists. The idea of David staying with her seemed like the perfect plan overall. That way, if there was any danger, such as other neighbors carelessly walking about, she could quickly step in and insure he was safe. Sure, there could be many moments where he would end up in situations within her very home, but with a watchful eye could still manage to make sure no harm befell him. Besides, he did seem really adorable overall. Almost like the equivalent of a small pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Really?\" David Stammers with wide eyes. \"Are you sure?\" The idea seems to good to be true. This massive ursine was willing to watch him, despite the fact that they just recently met. Seeing as how he really didn't seem to have much options when it comes to residency, the plan did seem good. Though, despite the offer, worry begins to ensue his mind once more. \"But...it could still be dangerous.\" he retorts. \"And I really don't want to be considered some sort of handful of trouble to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you won't be trouble.\" Becky shakes her head while giving a small yet assuring smile. \"I'll make sure that you'll be nice and safe with me.\" she assures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those words said, a sweep of assurance begins to grow within David's body. \"a-Alright then.\" he says with a grateful nod. \"Thank you Becky.\" With the offer accepted, it seemed like he no longer had to worry about having to deal with larger obstacles on his own. Yet, a small voice inside his head was starting to wonder whether or not he would truly be safe around this Massive Bearess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your welcome.\" Becky says with a nod to follow. \"Now then...\"</span></div></div>",

While the humidity and constant huffs of hot breathe blowing against his sides was starting to become a nuisance, Luckily the slimy surface yet oddly comfortable surface of her huge tongue made the stay much more bearable. After what seemed to be minutes, and even possibly hours, a small wiggle of the tongue began to alert David of the giantess's movement. \"huh?\" He gazes down upon the saliva drenched muscle as it slowly began to jiggle before him. At first, David thought that maybe this would be his lucky chance of escape, To his surprise and ultimate displeasure though, it ended up being something entirely different. While he was expecting the mouth to part slightly in front of him, he soon found himself getting shaken about as the gravity within the maw began to shift all of a sudden. The Bear girl was no doubt awake, but moving her head and body about as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the Bear Giantess lets out a small groan with mouth sealed shut. Her eyes slowly fluttered open as the drowsiness that enveloped her exhausted body all but vanished after the nap. Instinctively, she slowly begins to give her shoulders and body a small shake as to wake up the possibly sleeping limbs. With that done, she soon raises her brown furred head above the pillow to enter into a sitting pose. Just as she sat up, her eyes began to widen slightly as an she suddenly began to feel an odd small form adorned upon the center of her tongue. Unsure if it was a piece of meal that got clung to one of her ever so sharp teeth, she began to use her tongue to swish and slosh the odd object all about her maw. As she was curiously tasting the odd food however, little did she know of all the slippery and dizzying motions she was putting David through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the slimy confines of her mouth, David shockingly found himself being pressed and tossed all about the slimy surface of the fleshy cave. The sudden movements and changes of direction was almost like a roller coaster back on earth, an uncontrollable and unpredictable fleshy one that is. For him, it seemed nearly impossible to get any grip on something as the tongue began to ferociously pin his body to nearly every section of pink organic wall from gums all the way to the roof of her mouth. It wasn't until what seemed like minutes did the huge muscle cease it's sudden movements. Exhausted from the struggles, David lies limp upon the fleshy surface unsure whether or not the bear giantess was able to distinguish his miniscule form. </span></div></div>",

Unfortunately though, reason seemed to be utterly lost as David's desire quickly overtook his very mind.

It was darker under the dress the further up he looked but light managed to filter in through the thick layers of material. It was almost like being in a huge tent . The air smelled differently too, the sent of Bear  where there wasn't much airflow. It wasn't unpleasant nor overbearing but noticeable. The legs  were thick, even under all that heavy fur he could see muscle ripple underneath as she stood there. She did wear underwear, or at least undergarments. He'd seen women wear that kind in old photos but his mind was a blank as to what they were called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she began to turn, her foot rose and swung over David raining down dust and debris. It came back down close to him causing an impact tremor powerful enough to knock him off his feet. He scrambled to his feet and sighed a breath of relief. That had been too close.  It had been  exciting , all the same. He wanted to be close to her, to go where she would go. To do that he would need to hitch a ride. So, which way then, climb the outside of the dress, or up one of those furry legs?

Like the beat of a drum, the steps were steady and heavy. By the sound of them, the owner must be very large, you thought to yourself in fear. Oddly, they were also somewhat soft as if the owner had some sort of padding on their foot. The steps were booming now, sending quakes through the wooden floor. The next step landed right in front of you. You jumped multiple feet in the air, not because of the quake, but because of immense surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foot you heard was not a foot, but a paw! The fur was shaggy and unkempt. Biology was always your best subject so you quickly identified the owner as a bear. What also surprised you was the size of the foot. Just one toe could fit an entire house and the foot itself was big enough for an airplane runway. If just the foot was that massive than the actual bear... You shook the thought out of your mind. The only way to find out was to look yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reluctantly stepped out from behind the leg of the dresser and made your way towards the bear. You let out a gasp when you realized it wasn't wearing any clothes, making the bear's size even more intimidating. The bear was not only large in height, but also in weight. The bear was positioned not to far away from you standing in front of a chair but hadn't sat down yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in thought, you accidentally walked right into the bear's furry foot. As you were pulling your hand out of the shaggy fur, a liquid dropped onto your head from above. It looked like water but was warm, salty, and smelled horrible. You looked to see more of the liquid coming from the bear's armpit. You let out a groan of disgust upon realizing that the substance was sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering yourself, you attempt to think up a plan of action when your stopped in your tracks by something unexpected. A deep and manly voice was coming from the bear. The voice could only be described as masculine, confirming his gender. After checking again to see if you're dreaming, you realize something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this bear is smart enough to talk than it could also be snart enough to offer you some assistance. But how to get his attention. You could attack the bear's foot until it feels you but being around the paw made you uncomfortable. The smell was atrocious and the size made you afraid of being stepped on. You could also climb the massive beast. It would be incredibly dangerous but at least you'd get to say you climbed a massive bear. Looking around, you also take note of the chair. If you got onto the seat, you'd get a vast view of the bear and his plump body, though it wouldn't be great for getting his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, you decide to...</span></div></div>",

However, once his vision finally came to focus, the familiarity quickly vanished as he gave a startled gasp.The sight before David was without a doubt a Shock. \"w-w-what the!?\" Before his very form was what appeared to look like a Kitchen, though not like any other average one. This Kitchen compared to the many so called 'average' ones he recalled so vividly was shear massive in size. Not even the greatest of skyscrapers back Earth would be able to compare to the shear height of the wooden ceiling high Above. \"w-w-where the hell am I!?\" he mutters shaking his head in utter disbelief. Was this some kind of sick twisted dream he was having? As an experiment to test whether or not this was some illusion of his imagination, he quickly pinches the side of his cheek as hard as he could. If he couldn't feel any pain than that would surely prove that this was nothing more than fake vision. After giving a cringe and small grunt as a sudden twinge of pain emerged on his face, his eyes widen in great horror. \"t-t-this isn't a dream...It's Real!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moments, the sudden sounds of explosive thumps as well as the tremors of what could only be related to an earthquake emerged towards his right. With the quickest of haste, his head spun towards the direction to only gaze in shock upon two massive beings. The first massive being to enter shockingly looked like that of a grizzly bear carrying a surprisingly humanoid body. Her height and simple blue dress gave her a similar appearance to that of a middle aged woman back on Earth. Behind her was a massive white furred wolfess garbed in a rather poofy white blouse fastened with a brown leather vest. Below she was wearing a long green skirt stopping right above the ankles of her padded, furred feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for offering to help me cook today Luna.\" The Bear woman says while making her way to the massive sink at the other side of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem at all.\" The Wolfess named Luna says in a surprisingly cheery voice. Compared to that of the Bear woman, Luna must've been a young adult of around 18 or so. As the two make their way towards the sink and cabinets of the kitchen, A nervous shudder runs down your spine as you were in the midst of the two giantesses. \"Now where is the bowl?\" Luna mumbles while opening a plethora of cabinets and peeking inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It should be on the table, I got it set up already.\" The Bear Woman responds as the sounds of massive footsteps were heard closing in towards your location. With a nervous gulp, you quickly gaze up as one of the gargantuan females soon stands before the wooden table.</span></div></div>",

Immediately, he turns his head towards the direction of her furred hand as he manage to spot it gripping a building sized red bowl. \"ah Here it is!\" Her loud voice bellows high above causing him to cover his ears from the shear volume alone. As David kneels down ever so slightly trying to recuperate his ear drums from the booming sound of the wolfesses voice, he soon slowly begins to stand upwards noticing that the shadow seemed to grow even greater than before. \"Now the blue one.\" The gargantuan canine says to herself as her large emerald eyes gaze down upon the kitchen top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen things just couldn't seem to get worse for David, The great orbs looming above him soon lock onto his miniscule form. With shocked wide eyes, his mouth goes completely agape as the green pupils of the huge wolf giantess focused on none other than his body. Believing that she was possibly looking somewhere else, he attempts to move ever so slowly slightly to the side, hoping with all his might that she was gazing at some random bowl or pan on the table. To his ever growing dread however, the huge eyes follow his movements as he slowly scuttled towards the right. Unsure whether or not the gargantuan sized wolfess was friendly, let alone if the inhabitants of this strange world would find him as some sort of delicacy, David immediately turns and high tails it down the valley sized Table top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey, wait!\" The wolfess calls out as her shadow continues to loom over his tiny form, even when sprinting at full speed.</span></div></div>",

Before even having a chance to make it a foots length (To the bear and wolf's size that is), he was soon cast in ultimate darkness as his entire form was suddenly pinned underneath something. Whether it was luck or something entirely different, he was luckily unscathed underneath the huge object as he felt no surge of injuries appearing on his body. Holding his form down, the so called 'object' was no doubt that huge wolfess's massive hand, considering the fact that he managed to feel some leathery like texture above him almost akin to a canines paw. Despite being cast and held in complete darkness, he does manage to hear what sounded like a long sigh from nearby. The wolfess was no doubt relieved from the extremely quick chase, though the only question that remained was whether or not she saw him as food or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn just a matter of moments, David feels his body get wrapped up in a surface of soft warm fur and leather as his stomach was suddenly on the verge of leaving his abdomen. It seemed like the wolfess had no idea just how to pick up something so tiny, and it was clear by the quick and sudden movements she used to lift him up form the table. As David was lifted rather harshly from the table, he soon finds his form being pulled immediately towards the right. If he had eaten a meal earlier today, then it would've surely get hurled out by the sudden and unexpected movements of the grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong?\" Another voice sounded off from outside the shadowy confines. The voice no doubt belonged to that huge bear from earlier as it carried a weight of confusion and worry with each word. With wide eyes, another shudder began to course down David's spine as he feared whether or not the massive wolfess would reveal him to the bear giantess. If one huge humanoid animal wasn't enough, he shivered at the thought of having to contend with two of the giants simultaneously.</span></div></div>",

In several instances, The great wolfess would remain standing still possibly to help assist the bear giantess with her cooking tasks. Moments later however, David soon finds himself being shaken once more about as the great wolf girl begins to walk to an entirely different area. While it was indeed soft within the insides of the deep pocket, the rocking motion and overall bounciness made it nearly impossible to remain perfectly still in one area. After what seemed like hours hidden from view, a sudden voice emanating from above immediately manages to catch David's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Welcome Beth.\" Luna says in a happy voice as the bear giantess had her head turned back to thank the canine for her assistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, You know you could always stay and have dinner with us.\" Beth says, as if rewarding Luna for her help with cooking. \"you know, we could always have an extra chair at the table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, but I think I should be heading home by now.\" Luna insists, eager to finally be able to play with her very own miniaturized human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that's a shame.\" Beth say giving a small defeated sigh. \"but still, if you ever need any help with anything just feel free to ask.\" She adds while giving a grateful smile to Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do Beth.\" Luna says nodding her head before quickly making her way out of the kitchen. \"Take care now!\" After saying her goodbyes and finally managing to make her way out of the Bears residence, Luna lets out a small excited squeal of as she clenches both hands right under her snout. With a giggle she immediately begins to make her way straight to her home, heart racing over her excitement of the whole situation. 'a human!' she shouts in her head as the smile adorned upon her face begins to grow much more wider in size. 'a real life human! I always thought they were in fairytales...but now!' a loud giggle escapes her mouth as she soon manages to finally make her way into her cabin. With quick haste, she makes her way up a stair case before entering into her room. Turning her head back at the doorway, she quickly slides the lock insuring that no one would interrupt, let alone know about this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack within the confines of the pocket, David found the entire trip a complete dizzying experience. If having to contend with the wolfess walking was enough to leave a headache, then it was a surprise that his brain was still intact by her quick running. After minutes of uncontrollable bouncing and tumbling, the whole area soon begins to calm down as the wolfess suddenly ceases her sudden movements. Before he could even manage to get a chance in catching his breath however, David suddenly notices the white furred digits from before heading straight towards his direction. Unable to even back up, his whole body was soon gripped and lifted out of the fabric confines of the pocket, ascending straight before the massive face of the wolf girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Luna finally managed to pull out the human from within her pocket, her heart flutters slightly as she gazes upon the fairy tale creature in awe. Her eyes soon begin to widen in surprise noticing that some of the human's clothing was missing from his body. With a small giggle, she cocks her had slightly to the side as she peers down his small form. \"Why hello there little human~\" she says in a sing song voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's eyes widen in surprise once he manages to hear her voice sound off before him. \"y-you know what a human is?\" he stammers in utter disbelief by the reveal. Did this world carry humans just like him? he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna couldn't help but laugh at the dumbfounded reaction the human gave by her words. \"Of course I do!\" she says with an eager nod of her head. \"Humans have always been around in our fairytales.\" she begins to explain. \"Even as a pup, I would always dream of meeting a human one day...and, what do you know?\" she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid found the explanation somewhat hard to swallow. Were humans really nothing more than made up creatures in this strange ginormous world? In just moments, a small shade of red began to emerge on his face by the last comment she made. \"w-wait...you mean, you always wanted to meet a human before?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna nods at the question as the smile on her face was as wide as could be. \"Yup!\" she chuckles. \"oh! there's just so much things we could do together.\" she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's face begins to grow an even darker shade of red by the idea of spending time with this lovely wolfess. However, by the way she was talking it almost seemed as if she was thinking of him as nothing more than a pet or something along those lines. \"h-hold on a minute.\" he quickly stammers. \"what do you mean by all that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it obvious?\" Luna smiles. \"You'll be staying with me of course!\" she beams happily. While Luna was originally thinking of keeping him as nothing more than a pet, the more she thought about the more risky it could be. If Beth or anyone else found out about his existence, then she'd have no choice but to let him go. Not only that, but if she did go a bit overboard and he managed to blurt out everything than there was no telling what this would do to her reputation. Instead of trying to straight u[ force him to stay with her, she instead decided to influence him to stay. Besides, if that didn't work that didn't mean that threat was out of the question. \"I mean, where else is it safe for a human?\" She asks with a tilted head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she mentioned it, The wolfess did seem to have a strong point. The only problem with this whole proposition was the fact that David knew absolutely nothing about her. \"How can I be so sure that you're not lying?\" David asks curiously with a slightly raised brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna was taken slightly back by the accusation. \"Wha!? me? Lie?\" she stammers trying to think of someway of gaining his trust quickly. \"Well..think about it! I just saved your life back there.\" she says while pointing a finger at herself. \"I mean, if it wasn't for me acting quick, you could've easily become a part of dinner for those bears.\" she adds hoping that this would perhaps change his mind over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemories of the massive bear woman immediately fill David's head as a nervous shudder courses down his spine. She did have a strong point. Besides, if she really did mean to hurt or eat him, then she would've done it way earlier. \"alright...you got a point there.\" he says giving a sigh. \"but...what's the catch?\" he asks. \"I find it hard to believe that you'd just let me stay here for free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive grin forms on Luna's face as she relishes over her victorious words. \"Simple!\" she says while pointing a finger out in a matter of fact way. \"All you have to do is just spend some time with me.\" she says. \"that and hide if my family tries to come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's eyes widen by the mention of others in her home. \"wait...there are more of you!?\" he stammers with wide eyes, unsure if it was a safe idea to stay now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes...But! if you stay hidden in my room, then no one will notice.\" Luna quickly interjects, which manage to calm down the human. \"so...do we have a deal?\" she asks with curious eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as how he really didn't have any other options, and fearing that he would have am extremely short life expectancy out on his own, David reluctantly agrees. \"deal.\" he replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA squeal of excitement escapes Luna as she gives a small victorious leap. \"alright then!\" she beams happily. 'Finally...' she thinks to herself. 'A  human all for myself.' she giggles. \"alright human, now let's...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the first thought that came to mind as David awoke. Through the thin material of the tent he noted that it was unusually bright. Since he'd pitched tent inside of a decrepit cabin he knew that couldn't be possible. Unless the roof was blown off in the storm, but that didn't make any sense either. The tent would've been ripped to shreds in a storm that powerful. Climbing out of his sleeping bag he unzipped the opening of the tent. What he saw made him think for a momet that he was still asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first he thought he was looking at a strange and alien tree. But upon closer inspection, and to his astonishment, he was staring up at a carrot. A carrot that was at least 20 feet in diameter, but a carrot none the less. He climbed out of the tent and looked about. He counted 22 such carrots all growing in a straight line. They weren't the only vegetables he found. He also saw  Pea pods, cabbage, Pumpkin, all growing at an enormous and impossible scale. Where the heck was he? What the hell had happened during the night? Something moved at the corner of his eye. David turned and saw a Horrifying site. A black ant, as big as he was, had crawled out from under the broad leaves of a cucumber plant. David Froze, unable to move as the ant approached. But much to his surprise, the large insect ignored him and continued on its way. Like a Borg drone from a popular TV series, the ant was a part of  a collective hive mind, and had not deemed him as a threat. He breathed a sigh of relief. That was close.Next time he might not be so lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time to go. He couldn't stay where he was, even though he didn't know where to go, but it seemed like the only course of action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly packing away his tent and sleeping bag, David  planned on which direction he would go. That decision was ultimately taken away from him with the sound of what could only be described as a door opening, followed by the earth shaking rumble of Godzilla like foot falls. It didn't take long for as to realize the one making those footfalls was heading his way. Somewhere in his brain a little voice was telling him to run, but his curiosity made him stay in place. He had to see who or what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then he saw her. She loomed above the vegetation like a rising mountain. An anthropomorphic bear of phenomenal size. She was enormous, and totally oblivious to his presence. With a wicker basket in one hand, she walked forward in his direction meandering through the vegetable garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer strides were enormous. The ground heaved with every step she took. The landscape around him shook with the force of her passage. When she was close enough David could see huge furry feet from under the long blue dress she wore. They crushed everything in her path, sinking into the sole from her incredible weight and leaving craters in their wake. He could hear her humming a pleasant tune completely unaware of the danger she was causing. Realized his danger, he thought quickly. Running wasn't an option. The ground shaking too violently now with the impact of her giant steps. Even if it wasn't, he'd have to dodge and weave and navigated the uneven ground .The Bearess would have no such limitations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no other options he climbed up into the green leaves of the nearest carrot, and hoped she wouldn't step on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth stepped out of the home she shared with her husband and two children. It was a beautiful morning, the air was crisp and the birds sang in the trees. Humming to herself she stepped off the front porch and headed towards the garden she'd planted months earlier. The vegetables had grown big enough for her to decide that a salad would be nice for breakfast. Stepping into the garden she paused to pluck a few carrots out of the ground. After depositing them into the wicker basket she held, he collected a few heads of lettuce and various other vegetables before heading back into her home. She was completely unaware of the passenger she'd picked up with the first carrot she pulled out of the ground. It had been a rather frightening experience for David, the sight of an enormous paw-like hand reaching down and closing around him would be enough to scare anyone. Sitting in the bottom of the basket among vegetables, he slid about with every sway of the bearess' arm until everything came to a stop and the basket was placed on a flat surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay, now what?' David thought to himself.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"> <br>\r\nYou are David, and you've been transported and shrunk by mysterious means and encounter a family of anthropomorphic grizzly bears. They live in a Log house in the middle of the forest with no electrical power (they use oil lamps at night, etc)   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are four members of this family to start with. Here's an idea of what they look like:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/view/12264084/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.furaffinity.net/view/12264084/</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, lets go with the characters and some character traits that could determine what happens to David<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) David is a macrophile, with a foot/paw fetish and he's into vore. Combined with his new height  this could get him into trouble as he maybe tempted to experience his fantasies no matter the risk of life and limb. In the Bear's world he's under an Inch tall but he may appear smaller  or larger depending on the size of the character he's interacting with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Nick is a six year old Bear cub. Being the shortest family member he's most likely to hear David but what would happen once David got his attention is up to you. He likes to play, but he's got a mischievous side and likes to play pranks on his older sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Becky is Nick's 12 year old sister. Her parents call her Rebecca, though she secretly doesn't like to be called that. She is kind  but because She's taller than her brother it would be harder for David to get her attention. She is also sometimes easily startled if her mind is on other things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) Beth is Nick and Becky's Mother. Thirty plus years old. A kind individual who wouldn't hurt a fly, but she's so much larger than her children and therefore more dangerous. Because of her size she is most likely not going to be aware of or can't hear David, and may mistaken him for something else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) Steve is Nick and Becky's Father. Late thirties and has similar traits as his wife. Sometimes stomps first and asks questions later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther characters can be added. If you want David to meet up with a visiting Aunt, for example, or a family friend or a complete stranger to the family that would be just fine. They don't need to be bears either. All kinds of animals live in a forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as the rules go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1)Nothing involving toilet stuff or  shit, pee ,farting, that sort of stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Vore, foot/paw play, mouth play, unaware, exploration, crush is fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3)  Sexual interaction is fine as well, but nothing  overly sexual when it comes to the younger characters. I'll allow  some things but nothing really adult. In other words,The kids are not going to use David as a sex toy. The adult characters yes, but not the kids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4)Killing off the main character is okay but it needs to be  a good death with some detail. Not the lame one line kind (David got stepped on The End) and of course no one sentence chapters unless it's a suggestion. But no twenty chapters in a row  with \"How about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso Write in the style your comfortable. First Person, third, person, etc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you add to mine, I'll do my best to add to yours.</td>",
