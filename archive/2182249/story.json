However, their recharge medium in this story is kissing mortals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the stronger they feel towards the mortal, the bigger the boost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the feeling doesn't have to be love. an example is due to how much Mara hates Keiichi, she gains a similar-sized boost that Belldandy gets when they kiss Keiichi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn chapter 69 ( <i>the battle for Keiichi </i>in the english release), Peorth finds Urd's seed of love from chapter 12 (<i>Love potion number 9</i> in the english release) and alters it into a pill that should make whoever imbibes it love Peorth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause Peorth put in in some soda when it wasn't supposed to be put in, it made whoever Keiichi looked at fall in love with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this version, whoever Keiichi looks at gets a strong desire to kiss him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow strong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPractically and addiction. One so strong, not even Belldandy is immune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nin chapter 84 (<i>Sayoko or bust </i>in the english releas), Keiichi and the goddesses are trying to find Sayoko in the transformed N.I.T. campus, so they can put a stop to the wish that Mara granted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeiichi came across Shiho, who appeared to have captured Sora. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho managed to summon a number of ghost and sent them after Keiichi. One of which appeared to be the head of a humanoid woman about to kiss someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImagine if all those summoned spirits were just like that woman head and they all wanted to kiss Keiichi forever?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeck, they could even possess Belldandy and the others to fulfill their desires.</span></div></div>",

Though she was nice enough to go along with anything, she did have a hidden jealousy streak that popped up when she hit her limit..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he met her hot older sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrd was a busty beauty, ready to party, drink, or o prank someone. Sometimes all three. She did try to take Keiichi's virginity in an attempt to teach him how to properly please a woman. Belldandy put a stop to that, much to Urd's displeasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing that Belldandy did allow Urd to do was to kiss Keiichi whenever she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeiichi asked about it and Belldandy explained why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Keiichi, a goddess can get a energy recharge and a power boost from a kiss with a mortal. The stronger the feeling that both people have towards each other, the greater the energy given from the kiss,\" Belldandy explained. \"However, demons can also get energy from kisses, so please do not kiss one unless either we give you permission or if they are in danger of dying.\"<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a perverted blush, Keiichi then thought about the kisses of the goddesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelldandy's kisses tended to quick and chaste. However, they were more than enough to keep Keiichi's spirits up for the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrd's kisses were quite different. She made sure to put all she could into it. She rubbed her body against him, felt up his body, made him feel up her body, and often went for a deep kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that thought, a blushing Keiichi went to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Anyone?\" Keiichi called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard giggling. Feminine giggling. Giggling that seemed kinda evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... I can hear you! Can you free me?\" Keiichi cried out, still trying to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill only giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut within a few minutes, a woman walked out of the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange darkness covered the upper half of her face, but her mouth was in an evil sneer and had cute little fangs. Her hair was long, blond, and slightly wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wore a black one-piece leotard with pink frills. She wore matching long gloves and stockings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well... Normally, I only make deals with women, but in your case? I'll make an exception...\" the Mystery woman said. \"Besides, this doesn't count, as it's only a dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe straddled Keiichi's hips, letting her boobs bounce and grinding her butt against his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Wait! What kind of deal?\" Keiichi yelled out in a panic. He struggled, but could only make small movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let you kiss me and you'll restore some energy!\" The mystery woman cooed before kissing him on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an odd experience. Looking into what should be the eyes of the woman kissing him was like looking into the night sky, minus the stars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeiichi would be lying if he said he didn't enjoy the experience. The woman was sex, her boobs were big, the aforementioned boobs were pressed against his chest, and she was a hungry kisser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Keiichi also would be lying if he said he fully enjoyed the experience, as he felt like he was cheating on Belldandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to shake his head away from the Mystery woman, but she held his head in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman stopped the kiss and cooed, \"You're not so bad... I might do this more in the future...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about not?\" Keiichi pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled before continuing the kiss and slipping her tongue into Keiichi's mouth. To his horror, Keiichi's tongue went into the woman's mouth and began to wrestle with hers.</span></div></div>",

Perhaps because Keiichi took a bit more time to drink the soda. Perhaps he ate some foods that altered the pill the moment the pill got to his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it may be, Peorth's pill, which originally was supposed to make him fall in love with her, changed its effect to making whoever Keiichi stared in the eyes with fall in love with him. The next change was that now his gaze made whoever he looked at want to kiss Keiichi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen two hours passed after Keiichi fell asleep in the Temple yard, Megumi biked to the temple. Seeing Keiichi sleeping against a tree, Megumi made her way over to him and woke up Keiichi by loudly uttering, \"Keiichi? C'mon,bro, wake up! Look at you, zonked out under a tree!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bent over him a little, saying, \"The pictures are ready, right? I came over to see them, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Megumi spoke, Keiichi slowly woke up, looking at her. \"Oh, it's just Megumi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeat ran through Megumi as Keiichi stared at her. She dropped her bike as the desire to kiss her brother began to override her reason. She fell to her knees,crawling towards Keiichi, saying, \"Ke-Keiichi...

I mean, you must mean that warm familial sibling love, r-right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a Peorth-like smile, Megumi answered, \"This'll answer your question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegumi quickly kissed Keiichi on the lips, causing him to freeze in place out of shock. The Morisato sister sat on her brother's lap as her tongue darted into his mouth. When Keiichi got control over himself, Megumi held his head in place with such strength, Keiichi couldn't free himself from her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeiichi froze again when Megumi began to press her boobs against his chest and rubbed her pert rear against his lap.</span></div></div>",

A part of him expected several horrifying nonhuman heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all the heads were of the same humanoid woman.

She and Sora claimed that Shiho summoned spirits that desire nothing more than to kiss and drain energy. However, we weren\u2019t able to find any,\u201d Belldandy explained as she slowly let go of Keiichi, as if she was afraid he would vanish. \u201cI do not know where they went or if they did something to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha\u2026 What do you mean?

He asked, \"Skuld, do you have Ghost-trapping gear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back with a expression of annoyed curiosity and answered, \"Sure, I do. It's one of the first things I invented when I got here because I'm afraid of ghosts. Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeiichi let out a sigh of relief before he asked, \"Because Belldandy and Urd are possessed by ghosts that want to kiss me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkuld blinked a few times before asking in a more annoyed tone, \"Okay, what makes you think they're possessed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the ghost that Shiho summoned! It kissed me to sleep and now it's possessing your sisters. I need your help to free them!\" Keiichi cried out, annoyed at Skuld's dismissive attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkuld sighed as she stood up. \"Keiichi, I have one thing to say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Keiichi asked, feeling something was off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkuld said...</span></div></div>",

Too focused on her massive kisser to think of anything else, he failed to notice the half-lustful, half-adoring look on Belldandy's face. \"Oh Keiichi, you're just too cute for me to handle! I could just smooch you all day!\" She squealed, puckering up for another kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Keiichi felt her lips cover more than half of his face in a deep, warm embrace.

She spent countless days with nothing to do but think to herself and wander around. Eventually, her living name was lost to time, and most spirits just named her after what she does best: kissing people! The first time she did anything with anyone who could stand her in <i>eons</i> was when she was found by Shiho. She was happy enough that she'd do pretty much anything for her new 'friend'. Though the ghost was elated to be of use to someone, something even more exciting caught her fancy: that cute boy she was brought to the living world to defeat! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got the chance to put her skills to use, separating herself into copies before giving the boy (what did Shiho call him again? Oh, right! Keiichi!) what she hoped was the best smooching of his life. Her clones tied him up and laid smack over smack onto his bare skin, sapping his will to resist. This was her first time successfully cornering someone! In that moment, she knew she had to have <b>more.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and her clones continued to coat him head to toe with their loving kisses even after she noticed he was unconscious, and long after he actually passed out. She didn't even notice when Shiho and Sora took their leave; it was only when his stupid girlfriend Belldandy came by that she finally stopped and hid. As she hid away and monitored the situation, she saw how close she was to Keiichi. At first, she was madly jealous, but when she thought about it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe this cow isn't so useless after all...</i> The Kissing Ghost smirked, plotting her next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoiled and waiting for a chance to strike, she possessed Belldandy when her back was turned (but not before giving her prey a playful air kiss to tease him).

I don't see anyone around...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill keeping half an eye on the now idle lips, he gave his surroundings a quick once-over. It seemed he was still in the altered N.I.T. campus, right where the then-possessed Belldandy smooched him to sleep. Meanwhile, the lips slowly moved closer, licking themselves and presenting a new sheen of dark red lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be confused, my little cutie!\" They said, giggling to themselves. \"I'll tell you what happened. When you fell asleep after I sucked all of your delicious energy out, I used the power I got from draining you to create a little world of my own. I control what happens here, Keiichi, and you can't do anything about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lips revealed the rest of their head. The Kissing Ghost appeared in front of Keiichi, still showing off her supple, shining lips. Keiichi's sinking feeling turned into a boulder dropping in his torso. Was he really trapped here forever?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe specter mused, <i>Maybe I should give him a little hope; after all, the best kind of prey is the most desperate.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe I <i>am</i> lying a little,\" The Kissing Ghost said, \"There *is* a way to get out of here, but good luck finding it! As for now, let the games begin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well now, what shall I do? Oh, I do enjoy a little cat and mouse, but what about my new abilities? Should I give my sweet little Keiichi a run for his money?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould the Kissing Ghost split herself into more clones and chase him around her dimension, trapping him if he gets caught?

I've gotta get going!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"2...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, He burst out of the door and into the hallway where he lost those weirdo cosplayers. This isn't the real world, so they shouldn't still be there, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, he wasn't wrong; they really weren't there. The problem was that, in each of their places was a clone of the Kissing Ghost, lips puckered and ready for some action! Each of them had different lipstick, which (combined with the original ghost's red lips) formed the color of a rainbow. All six of them blew him mocking kisses, as if to humiliate him for thinking she'd overlook a detail that obvious. But something strange happened as continued; the kisses they were blowing appeared in the air! They launched toward him, smacking their lips along the way. The yellow copy's kiss went straight for Keiichi's lips, and there was nothing he could do but watch, paralyzed, as he relived the moment he met this horrible phantom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\na flurry of smooches hummed and sucked his skin, peppering his body with lipmarks of all colors, and slowing him down. The one making out with him tried to coax his mouth open, forcing her tongue against his lips. Through shock, he felt his mouth open slightly, allowing the kiss to enter his mouth. Her tongue entwined around his, sucking it softly. Belying his fear, Keiichi felt his cock become rock hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorny and terrified as he was, Keiichi snapped out of his stupor when he realized that the ghost was still counting up. He began to run away from the door, trying to ignore the chuckling of the clones and ripping the headless lips off of his body. The ones kissing his own were (sadly) the first to go; he chucked the voracious mouth behind him, not caring to look where it went. He ran past the Kissing Ghost, who paused to open her eyes and send a flirty wink his way. After getting rid of what he thought was all of them, he felt a peculiar tingle in his crotch. Soon, the tingling he felt turned to pleasure as he felt a pleasant sucking sensation on his shaft. The violet pair was still in his trousers, sucking him off! Keiichi cursed, forced his hand down his pants, hesitated, and reluctantly pried the lips off his dick before disposing of them like the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly after that fiasco was when he saw where he was; all he managed to do was move slightly down the corridor to the right of Shiho's summoning circle. \"Damnit! How much time did I waste because of that?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With no other choice, Keiichi sucked it up and puckered up, closing his eyes to shield himself from what he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObserving this, the Kissy-Sayoko smiled deviously. She, like the kissing ghost\u2019s clones, had the power to create disembodied lips. With a hum, she got to work on her sleight of mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmm\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of lips, layered generously with dark red lipstick, appeared out of thin air, right in front of her own. Born with their purpose coded right into them, they puckered up and laid a thick one on Keiichi\u2019s own pair. Sayoko moved carefully, walked forward, and wrapped her arms around him tightly. She kept her face far away from her duplicate lips to keep the timer running down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeiichi, meanwhile, wrenched his eyes shut further as a pair of huge, moist lips latch onto his own. He felt the Sayoko clone\u2019s tongue poke and prod at his mouth\u2019s entrance, loosening his lips ever so slightly. He was seriously feeling tuckered out; he thought that stopping might let him get some rest, but it appeared that he underestimated how powerful the Kissing Ghost\u2019s draining powers were. His mind fogged up, and for a split second, he lost motor control. That was enough for his mouth to get invaded, his tongue being forced to play tonsil tennis once more. His crotch began stirring yet again, and his mouth started to comply with its captors demands, dancing in turn with the alien tongue it was housing. A fruity flavor he couldn\u2019t identify tickled his taste buds, causing his head to buzz warmly against his will. Then, the worst thing he could\u2019ve imagined happened:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime\u2019s up, Buttercup!~\u201d A voice echoed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shock went down his spine, and his stomach felt like butterflies were trying to burst out of it. He shoved Sayoko away, about to give her a piece of his mind, when he realized that the lips on his face weren\u2019t hers. Panicking, he pulled at them as their tongue swirled around his mouth, eking a muffled moan out of his throat. Finally, he pried them off his face, a lip mark the size of a football left around his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was completely unfair!\u201d He shouted, his eyes darting aimlessly around the sky, \u201cYou\u2019re still a clone! Those were your lips!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, ah, ahhh! I said, \u2018If you kiss me or any of my clones willingly, I\u2019ll add a minute to the timer\u2019. When did you kiss any of my clones? Those were just a lonely pair of lips. It\u2019s nice to know you\u2019re so eager for our new life together that you\u2019d practice macking on me beforehand, though~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his mind, Keiichi screamed in frustration. How could he have been stupid enough to keep his eyes closed the entire time?! He should\u2019ve known the Kissing Ghost would pull a rotten trick like that! Just as he was bemoaning his situation, he heard a low sound of wet smacking, and a terrible, familiar voice calling out to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere I co~ome, lover boy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t have time to be pitying himself, he had to run!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bolted, not missing the kiss the Sayoko clone blew at him; namely because it landed smack dab on his cheek. It pushed harder and harder against his face, sometimes parting from his skin, only to plant another one lower, trailing down the side of his face. He tried to ignore it as he sprinted down the hallway, but once it got to his neck, the twinge of arousal that pulsed through him reminded him of that sluggish feeling he got from the disembodied lips just earlier. It kissed even harder, and Keiichi gasped like he had a hitch in his throat. Shaking his head, he grabbed at his face while twisting and turning through the maze of hallways. He finally managed to get a hold on them, chucking them behind him and not looking back. It slowed him down a fair bit, but not as much as letting the lips have their way would\u2019ve.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did he know, it didn\u2019t really matter. The Kissing Ghost was already close enough to catch him if she wanted; she just thought that it\u2019d be cute to see him run a little more. She continued to kiss the air, moaning loudly and smacking her lips, letting her cute widdle mouse know that the big mean cat was on its way. As she chased him, she felt herself getting larger, boosted by the energy she was sucking from him even now. She grew and grew, becoming large enough to fill the hallway with her face. <i>This is gonna be fun.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, he was in sight, trying desperately to keep up the pace he had before. Getting close enough to make her aim impeccable, the Kissing Ghost squished her lips together, blowing a massive kiss with a thundering squelch. She watched her shining, newly-sentient lipstick go flying. It cut through the air, causing a hissing sound to reverberate through the hallway. At that moment, Keiichi had to turn a corner, the lipstick mark catching his attention through his peripheral vision. He froze up, gazing in horror upon his plump executioners. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kiss drove into his body, sending him careening towards the wall. Surprisingly, his back didn\u2019t break when he stopped moving; in fact, he felt a plush, pillowy sensation against him. If his mind wasn\u2019t preoccupied with processing the fact that he was going to be kissed to death over and over for an eternity, it would\u2019ve realized that the lips closed around him, wrapping around his entire being. This time, the lips adorning his body were different; their texture was like ballistic gel\u2014soft, sticky, and malleable, yet firm and weighty. Most importantly, ALL of their bulk was smushed thoroughly against his tired corpus. He was sinking into them like a water bed, his body relaxing and his thoughts slowing, his physique not the only thing exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he lay there, swallowed by the cushy embrace of his lip prison, an odd sensation moved throughout his body. Were his clothes always this thin? The question left his mind as soon as it came in; he surrendered himself to the heady cherry fragrance of his captors\u2019 lipstick, and was lulled to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sensation wasn\u2019t a coincidence (not that Keiichi would know, being unconscious and all that); Within the juicy gloss of the Kissing Ghost\u2019s disembodied lips was an acid, tailor-made to dissolve the fabric of their captive\u2019s outfit. A tingling feeling worked its way all around Keiichi\u2019s body, comforting him as he slipped further into unconsciousness. Eventually, his clothes were gone entirely, leaving his form softly encompassed by the lips, his prick firming and poking at the bud of the upper lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with the display of dominance she made towards her new boytoy, the Kissing Ghost goes to retrieve Keiichi, her synthetic lips dissipating and leaving his body lying on the cold linoleum. He was shivering, his mind missing the comforting warmth of its jail cell. Seeing this, she kissed him against the ground, maneuvering her real lips to accommodate his limp figure. Noticing something prodding at her lower lip, the apparition chuckled to herself; she guessed a part of him <i>wasn\u2019t</i> so limp. She let out a hum, massaging Keiichi in more ways than one, and started reshaping her little world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does it look like?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His wrists and ankles were stuck to the bench, not by straps, but by really sticky lipstick. Looking around, the boat was at some carnival that had a hearts and love theme. All the booths had their prices listed as kisses. Most of the carnival goers seemed to be either women who either were possessed by the Kissing Ghost or were copies of those women, or were genderless robots. To his right was the kissing ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh!\u201d Keiichi cried out before the ghost covered his lips with her own. Not wanting to have another tongue-wrestling sesson, Keiichi closed his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little bit, the Kissing Ghost retreated a little bit. Keiichi went to speal, but discovered that he couldn\u2019t move his lips. Since he felt the feeling of lipstick over his face, Keiichi knew that the lipstick had sealed his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow let\u2019s go through the tunnel of love, Keiichi. Perhaps once we\u2019re through it, you\u2019ll love me so much, you\u2019ll return my affections with as much intensity as I give you!\u201d The Kissing Ghost cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tunnel of Love attendant pulled a level, making the boat move into the tunnel. The further they rode into the tunnel, the darker it got. As the Kissing Ghost leaned her head on Keiichi\u2019s shoulder and sighed, \u201cThis will be so much fun\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMusic began to play, the slow romantic kind. Some lights lit up revealing mannequins. Male mannequins that looked like Keiichi and the female Mannequins whose heads looked like the Kissing Ghosts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll sorts of scenes were depicted and given some commentary by the Kissing Ghost. Scenes on a beach, ranging from applying sunscreen or volleyball.  The Kissing Ghost Kissed Keiichi on the cheek and asked, \u201cPerhaps I should create a special lipstick, one that turns into sunscreen when applied to you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScenes in a park where it was a game of catch, tag, or a simple picnic. The one of a picnic has the Kissing Ghost mannequin with food between her lips and the Keiichi mannequin leaning his head into get the food. After giving Keiichi a kiss on one of his nipples, the Kissing Ghost said, \u201cOohhh, perhaps we should visit a park? I can make one where kissing is mandatory!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA scene or two where the Keiichi mannequin snuggled up to the Kissing ghost mannequin for warmth in a wintery scene.  After rubbing herself against Keiichi\u2019s face , the Kissing Ghost shivered before saying, \u201cBurr! Makes me feel cold just by looking at them! Maybe we should take their advice and snuggle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven one of marriage. One of a Western wedding, one of a Shinto wedding, and even a Buddist wedding. Keiichi avoided looking at the Kissing Ghost because whenever he did, she was looking at the scenes with awe. She cooed, \u201cWhich one should we have? Maybe all of them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one scene depicting a Keiichi mannequin cutting a slice of cake with a Kissing Ghost mannequin, Keiichi\u2019s eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the background was the norns. All three were asleep and dressed as angels, appearing to give their blessing to the event. Keiichi noted that all three had red lipstick on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hoped that it would mean they were there and were just sleeping, not that they were really more copies controlled by the Lipstick Ghost. The Kissing Ghost merely sighed as she looked at the mannequin of herself and Keiichi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeiichi....</span></div></div>",

Not just any Love Hotel, but the one Urd had changed his room into way back when she first appeared to him and was trying to get him to have sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust where did you learn how to make this room and how strong are you?\u201d Keiichi muttered as he sat up on the silky bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sexy-yet-scary voice giggled from nowhere, \u201cI got it from your mind, silly!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked around for the kissing ghost, she continued, \u201cAs for how strong\u2026 I\u2019m as strong as I can get from my kisses!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his head and was greeted by the Kissing Ghost\u2019s oversized lips.

In fact, I think I might need some help!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her hair let go of Keiichi\u2019s limbs, the ghostly head spun around for a few moments.

The one with violet lipstick gave him a blowjob, while the pink lipstick kissed him on the lips. The ones with blue and green lipsticks kissed his nipples. The ones with yellow and orange lipsticks were kissing hisarms up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Belldandy! Help me!\u2019 </i>Keiichi thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made the Pink Kissing Ghost frown a little. So she raised herself away from Keiichi and made her lips glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then slowly-yet-repeatedly kissed Keiichi with each kiss erasing a tiny bit of Keiichi\u2019s memory of Belldandy, starting with her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Bellda-dy\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Bel-da-dy!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018B-l-da-dy!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018B---da-dy!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018B---d--dy!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018B---d---y!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018B-------y!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018B--------!\u2019<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nAfter the next kiss, Keiichi couldn\u2019t remember the name of the goddess who granted his wish for her to be with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that terrified him.</span></div></div>",

She shook her head for a few moments before the Kissing Spirit flew right out of her lips. The goddess asked, \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spirit merely giggled before she kissed Belldandy right on the lips. As she felt her own magic energy drain, the goddess tried to back away, but the kissing Spirit kept up with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce a few feet away from Keiichi, the Kissing spirit made more clones of herself.

Keiichi had the standard anime nosebleed from arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelldandy tried to shake her head free to utter a spell to exorcise the spirits or even will up a wind spell, but a number of cloned spirits joined the original spirit in kissing Belldandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey kissed her arms, legs, breasts, crotch, and ass. The ghosts covered her buttcheeks with kiss marks. They made sure to kiss her nipples, even playfully nibbling at times. They rubbed their lips against her panty-covered pussy lips. Belldandy blushed, as she both never experienced such things, the fact it was done in front of Keiichi, and the fact it all was arousing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach kiss drained a bit more of her power, strengthening the original Kissing ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that Belldandy was in danger, Keiichi tried to stand up. Alas, he was still weakened from his own kissing encounter. So he began to crawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for a stray clone head to tackle him onto his back and kiss him on the lips.

When he realized that he was laying on a wooden bed in a prison cell within a cave and that his wrists were strapped to the bed, he fully awoke. Above him was another wooden bed.

You\u2019re awake?\u201d a hissing voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoever you are, please free me!\u201d Tsukune replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re mine and not a moment before,\" the hissing voice answered before its owner walked into view. They were short, about three feet or so. Their skin was scaly like a reptile and the fingers were claws that were painted red. Their ears were long and they had big frilly ears. They had long green hair. They wore a mini skirt and a bra, both were white with black dots. They also wore high heels. Their puckering lips were big and covered with red lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Tsukune asked with fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want a boyfriend and you are cute.

Greta is perfect for you,\u201d Greta grunted as she climbed to the wooden bed above Tsukune, letting him see that she wore panties that matched her clothes.

That stays until you are good Tsukune who listens to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA still-struggling Tsukune wept as Greta began to kiss his body and left lipstick marks all over his body.

Ami thought,<i> 'That means one of three things. Either they've gotten enough energy for their scheme, they ran from Tokyo because we tried to attack them... Or we've become their target.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi sighed as she closed her latest book, muttering, \"Rei was right about us sticking together in teams.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei sat down, carrying a few more books. \"Alright, I wasn't able to find that history book on Mikos. Seriously, I am one. Why not ask me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While you are one, I do like to use multiple sources for my essays. forgive me for doing this, but I'll go doublecheck to see if the book is here,\" Ami said as she stood up. \"Please keep an eye on my books while I'm away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I will, Rei replied in a bored tone.

All that did was cause her and the male student to fall to the ground with Ami on top. Another 'coincidence' was that the two were kissing with the male student's tongue in Ami's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe disguised Youma released more of his' addicted-to-his-kisses' liquid in Ami's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn mere seconds, Ami's expression went from 'embarrassed that I'm on top of a guy and gave him my first kiss' to 'wanting more kisses'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pinned her legs together, trapping the disguised Youma's thighs under her. Ami also grabbed his head, preventing him from disengaging the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Wow, she's really into this,' </i>the Disguised Youma thought, putting his hands on her and making a toke escape attempt for appearance's sake. When Ami began to grind her body against his, he thought, <i>'Really into this. I wonder how repressed is she?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen people began to stop and stare, Rei stood up, walked over, and pulled Ami off of the disguised Youma. Rei asked, \"Are you here to study or should I find you two a room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi blushed as she replied, \"A... A room would be nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking a big show of sighing in annoyance, Rei muttered, \"Follow me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>In a locked book storage room, away from prying eyes...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Rei and Ami were kissing the Youma, who was no longer disguised as a student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei and Ami enjoyed kissing the Youma, but enjoyed the moments when he kissed them back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, The Youma held the two away and said, \"I will go back to our kissing in a moment, for I have a request...\"</span></div></div>",

Looking to her side, she saw a young man, about the age of the inner Sailor Senshi and holding a case for an expensive violin. \"I apologize for asking this, but I recently received my grandma's violin when she died and need some help making sure it is just right. I'm used to my training violin, but I wish to use my grandmother's violin in an upcoming school concert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just curious, why? From what I hear, you should know how to get your Grandmother's violin ready,\" Michiru replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I'm just a bundle of nerves and don't wish to upset my mother, who was the daughter. I mean, I know how to tune it up and make sure it is in good condition, but I'd like to get a second opinion, just in case,\" the young man replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I could help. There's a park across the street where we can practice,\" Michiru replied. \"I'll be there ina few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man gave off a bright smile and said, \"Thanks, Miss!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he left, Michiru sent a message to Haruka about if she doesn't send a message in 50 minutes, to go to the park and save her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Michiru went to the park with a violin she just bought. \"I might as well use this to tune up my newest violin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good,\" the young man replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sesson went fairly well. Michiru only had to give a few suggestions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen about 40 minutes passed, Michiru put down her violin and said,\"Well, I think we're done here. You're pretty good and won't need my help for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Miss. I really enjoyed this. Perhaps we could do this in the future?\" the young man asked as he put down his violin. he bowed a little and gently took Michiru's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the Young man gave Michiru's hand a kiss, she felt a tingle run through her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOriginally, she was going to refuse and tell him she already had a partner, but something about the kiss made her say, \"Perhaps... let me check to something. Let me see if you could be a good flutenist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" The young man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichiru smiled before she hugged the man and gave him a deep kiss. When the Youma returned her actions, Michiru fell under the youma's spell even faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, Michiru asked, \"My lover is going to come. What should we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Set up a trap,\" The Youma answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka Tenou , Sailor Uranus, soon received a message, telling her that Michiru was fine and had enjoyed a music session with a fellow violin player without incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Motorcyclist smiled as she headed to the park, just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka wandered in and saw Michiru with a new violin. \"Another one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, better to have more, just in case we get attacked at home and the invader is rather destructive,\" Michiru said as she followed Haruka back to her motorcycle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting her violin away, Michiru hugged Haruka from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What brought this on?\" Haruka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Violin session was quite good. enough that it felt a tiny bit like cheating on you,\" Michiru answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when we get back home, we'll fix that,\" Haruka replied with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not now?\" Michiru asked as she tightened her grip, pinning Haruka's arms to her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michiru?\" Haruka asked as she began to struggle. She soon stopped when someone grabbed her head, forced her to look to the side, and kissed her on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka tried to continue struggling, but something about the kiss sapped her will to fight. Soon, Michiru let go of Haruka. The Blonde felt up the young man and returned the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Michiru asked, \"So... What about Setsuna and Hotaru?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How old is Hotaru?\" The Youma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About 12 or so. She had been a baby, but she's been aged up because of an incident some time ago,\" Michiru answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I should get her under my power,\" the Youma replied, hugging both Senshi. \"Just like you ladies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru, who was Sailor Saturn, was surprised to see Haruka and Michiru bring in a man their age. She asked, \"Whose that, Papa Haruka?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Michiru found a violin friend,\" Haruka answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you must be Hotaru! Your parents told me quite a bit about you. I'm Miroku Itou,\" the man replied as he got on a knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're pretty handsome,\" Hotaru said without thinking. She covered her mouth in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently taking one of Hotaru's hands, and kissing it, Miroku said, \"Thank you, Hotaru. I like being complemented, especially by a cute girl like you. I can tell you'll be a real beauty when you grow up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Youma's kiss was  pleasing enough that Hotaru passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Youma caught Hotaru and said, \"And now for Pluto...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, Setsuna Meiou came home and sniffed the air. \"Ah... Dinner smells delicious...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichiru smiled and said, \"Thank you, Setsuna. I was inspired by a quick violin session today,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you should do it more often,\" Setsuna said as she saw down with Michiru and Haruka. \"Where's Hotaru?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Studying with a tutor that Ami suggested. Mr. Itou,\" Haruka answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they ate dinner, Setsuna began to feel sleepy. When she noticed the others were still wide awake and eating, she uttered, \"Michiru, I might be tired from wor...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka caught the passed out Setsuna and said, \"It seems Master's plan to drug her food was a success.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Setsun awoke up, she felt a wet pressure on her lips. Opening her eyes, she saw a handsome man kissing her, She first felt panicked, but soon felt like returning the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetsuna hugged the man as she did return the kiss. When she was done with the kiss, Setsuna broke off the kiss and looked around. She was lying on the couch with the others looking on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got worried when you passed out, Setsuna,.\" Michiru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, at that time, Mr Itou and Hotaru came out. Hotaru thought you fell under a spell and asked him to kiss you awake, even when we told her you were just suffering from overwork,\" Haruka answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any one else feel like calling him...\" Setsuna trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka, Michiru, and Hotaru all finished, \"Master?

But that feeling was drowned out when Usagi said, \"I'm gonna become a famous model! Yippie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first sets of clothes were ones that were cute and frilly. Both she, Minako, and Hotaru were overjoyed to wear them.The others, only somewhat. Though Michiru and Haruka playfully flirted with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next set of clothes were more adult looking. Business woman dresses, prom dresses, and even some nice looking clothes that came with aprons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi liked how adult she looked in them and even said to Minako, \"I look so grown-up in these! I bet Mamoru will just want me to be in these all the time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako merely smiled as she thought, '<i>Soon, you will forget about Mamoru and think of only master.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next round of clothes involved regular shirts and short skirts, ones shorter that what Usagi was used to.

My mother made sure to ask him not to take panty shots unless we agree to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi sighed with relief. She looked at the Photographer, who said, \"Miss Tsukino, you are a beautiful woman. So the skirts are a little small. It just means you'll be able to show off those amazing legs of yours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blushing Usagi felt up her legs as she cooed, \"They are amazing,aren't they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi made sure to do poses that showed off her legs, which began to annoy the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourth round of clothes was the swimsuit round. At first, it was one-piece swimsuits, which made Usagi feel a bit more comfortable. Then came the one-piece swimsuits that showed off the wearer's ass a bit too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the two-piece bikinis. First they were cute'n'frilly, which pleased Usagi. but they quickly became sexier and sexier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkuko looked at Saeko and cooed, \"Oh my! You look sexy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaeko reached over and groped Ikuko's boobs and said, \"You as well, Ikuko. If we were alone... the things I'd do to your girls...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi blushed and whispered in horror to Ami, \"Ami, did you hear that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi looked at Usagi with a nonplussed expression and replied, \"Thy're our parents, Usagi. What they do or say about heir free time is not our concern. But if you want me to grope your bosom, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, No! I'm fine, no need to!\" An even more red-blushing Usagi quickly answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Usagi stayed silent, while the swimsuits kept getting skimpier and skimpier. Any time she was about about to quit, the photographer told her that she was beautiful and played to her ego.

But there are so many other Jonin with more experience available that would be better suited to lead a genin squad. Why would our Kage choose you that soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still dont understand it myself\" you replied thoughfully. \"I just recently earned the promotion to Jonin. I honestly didnt expect to become a sensei for the next couple of years.

The numbers pretty much speak for themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral years ago, shortly after your own graduation, a new rule was installed to lower the casualties in the field. After too many genin died because they graduated too early and were not really ready yet for the harsh ninja life, the Hidden Villages held one of the rare Five Kage Summits and agreed on a proper age restriction. From here on out, every genin had to be at least 15 years old before he or she was allowed to graduate from the academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That just makes it worse\" you complained while running with one hand through your hair. \"It means my students are nearly the same age as myself. There is no way they will respect me. Not to mention they are all troublesome teenage girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour friend merely chuckled. \"Seriously? You take on A-Rank missions without batting an eye, but when faced with three kunoichi fresh out of the academy you suddenly chicken out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it\u00b4s not like I am afraid or anything\" you tried to defend yourself. \"And it isn\u00b4t even sure that I have to teach them in the first place. If they fail to impress me during the survival test, I send the girls straight back to the academy and that\u00b4s it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who are your potential students anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou told your friend the three names and he responded with an impressed whisle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to both of you, one of your rivals had actually listened in to your entire conversation. He was jealous because you got a genin squad while he didn\u00b4t and therefore decided to sabotage you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring that night, your rival paid a little visit to each of your upcoming students, sneaking into their rooms and placing a special seal onto them that would give them an overwhelming desire to kiss you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his own slightly crazy mind, it was a perfect plan. Either the constant kissing attacks would prevent you from properly training them and you therefore fail as a sensei; or other ninjas would eventually grow suspicious and frame you for having an illegal affair with your students. Maybe even both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an evil grin all over his face, he could barely wait for the next day when the new genin would all meet their Jonin sensei for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut some big questions remain... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn which Hidden Village do you live and who are your three students?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow shall this scenario play out?</span></div></div>",

Now it is your turn, tell me who you are and what you want to archive in the near future as members of this team.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Ino Yamanaka and I want to kiss you all day long\u201d the tall blonde to the left announced with utter confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Sakura Haruno and I want to kiss you before Ino can do it\u201d the pink-haired girl to the right shouted competitively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am H-Hinata Hyuuga and I would l-like to kiss you as well\u2026\u201d the shy girl in the middle with long blue hair replied last but not least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence as you stared at the trio dumbfolded. Whatever you expected them to say, this was not on the list at all. \u201cOk, my first impression\u2026 you are a bunch of weird hormonal teens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an attempt to dismiss their strange desire for kissing, you quickly got back to business and told them about the final test and how they are not truly genin yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood? Your job is to take these bells from me by any means necessary. Whoever does not have a bell when the time runs out will fail and get sent back to the academy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does it have to be bells?\u201d Ino asked once she got over her initial shock. \u201cThat is boring, I think we should fight for something more valuable so that we are all properly motivated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and what exactly do you have in mind then?\" you asked, faking curiousity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A kiss of course!\" the blonde shouted out immediately. \"Let us fight for your lips! Those of us who manage to kiss you within the time limit will stay on the team!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura and Hinata blushed lightly, but quickly gave their own agreements to this idea, making you think about it for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one hand, you were making the rules and they had to follow them, no matter what. Disobeying direct orders from your squad leader was a no-go in the ninja world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, the exact rules for this test didn\u00b4t really matter as long as you got enough intel about their skill level. The test was simply for you to judge if they were prepared for the ninja life or not. If they were willing to go all out for a kiss, what\u00b4s the difference? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese girls were fresh out of the academy, they were not supposed to succeed anyway.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once that was done, he walked out and headed to the Hokage tower, where he could check on what available missions there were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYo, Granny!

Because he was so low on chakra, he was forced to call upon the Kyuubi\u2019s power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when the summon cloud vanished, In front of of him was a humanoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had long pink hair, styled in a bit of a beehive with a pink feather sticking out of it. Her clothes were a green polka-dot dress, black opera gloves, black tights, and blue high heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was her features that made Naruto realize that the person in front of him was female and a humanoid toad. She lacked a nose and had green skin. Her hands had three long fingers and an equally long thumb. The lips on her face were bigger than his arms. Her breasts were huge, probably the biggest he\u2019d ever seen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the? Where are we?\u201d the toad asked as she looked around. Realizing that she was in front of a Summoner, she hugged Naruto tight to her body, saying, \u201cHold on, Chico! Mrs. Toad will save you and get us out of here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leapt towards the wall, landing on one of the spikes before rapidly walljumping upwards until she landed on the grass above the chasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere! Safe and sound! Just like I said,\u201d Mrs. Toad exclaimed as she let Naruto stand on his own two feet, but she held his shoulders, so she could look him in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiding behind a tree, Jiraiya uttered, \u201cHuh? He\u2019s supposed to summon Gamabunta! Instead, he summons\u2026 Wait, I don\u2019t recognize her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya leaned out and looked at Naruto. After a moment, the Toad sage\u2019s eyes bugged out. \u201cHow did Naruto summon that? If she was a human or just less toad-like, I\u2019d put her in one of my books!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto didn\u2019t care for Mrs. Toad holding him, especially because her oddly sticky grip was preventing him from escaping. \u201cThanks for saving me\u2026 Erh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMrs. Toad. But you can call me Mama Toad\u2026\u201d Mrs. Toad answered before fluttering her eyes, \u201c Or better yet, call me lover.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Naruto could react, Mrs. Toad kissed him. Though she was aiming for his lips, she covered the entire lower half of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter calming down, a suddenly calm Jiraiya shrugged before walking away, nonchalantly muttering, \u201cEh, she\u2019s his problem now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few steps, Jiraiya\u2019s prankster side caused him to come up with a scheme to have some fun with Naruto and the new Toad summon.</span></div></div>",

No! Stay back! I need to stay pure for Sakura!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping her puckering lips mere centimetres away from Naruto\u2019s face, Mrs. Toad frowned and said, \u201cBut I only want what\u2019s best for my husband!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen go away and let me be with Sakura!\u201d Naruto ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making a sad moan noise, Mrs. Toad smiled, scaring Naruto.

Their faces began to resemble a fusion of their own and Mrs. Toad. Their bodies began to alter to resemble her as well. Bigger bosoms, smaller waists, longer legs, bigger hips, bigger butts, and smooth green skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were more changes, here and there, but ones that Mrs. Toad deemed necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the nature of Mrs. Toad's spell, no one currently in Konoha noticed the changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-o-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Naruto was able to get into Konoha, but was completely out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he continued on, looking for Mrs. Toad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of searching the streets, Naruto thought he saw Mrs. Toad, dressed up like Mebuki Haruno. She currently was facing away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his mind raced with pranks as he snuck up his target. He barely noticed someone sneaking up on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Naruto was a few feet away, he heard Sakura say, \u201cNaruto\u2026 when have you looked so\u2026 handsome? So much better than Sasuke?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled as he slowly turned around, saying, \u201cWell, I always was like this, Sakura. I guess you just woke up to my... \u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped when he saw that Sakura looked like a younger Mrs. Toad dressing up as his female teammate. Naturo uttered, \u201cSakura?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting one hand behind her head and the other on her hips, Sakura said, \u201cThe one and only! You look outright stunned by my beauty today!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMebuki made a \u2018hn?\u2019 noise as she turned around. When she saw Naruto and Sakura, Mebuki said, \u201c Oh! I didn\u2019t know the two of you were there. How are you both?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, just was trying to find a place to relax after some personal training,\u201d Sakura answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m searching for a summon that ran here. I was wondering if anyone saw her?\u201d Naruto asked, still a bit out of breath. He began to wonder if he was under a genjutsu that made him see women as Toad women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, perhaps we all need a slight break. Let\u2019s go to a park and relax, so you can tell us about your runaway summons, Naruto?\u201d Mebuki asked.Both she and Sakura licked their lips as they looked upon the worried Uzumaki.</span></div></div>",

All because they liked to kiss and had a vaguely human appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo a number of Jynx decided to punish humans by invading lipstick factories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they snuck into the factories, they used their psychic abilities to fool the guards and cameras. Once they got to the lipstick-making machines and storage, the Jynx used their powers to curse all of it., machines and lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Jynx left the factories, they all chuckled. Anyone that used the lipstick and kissed someone would have their lips increase to the size of a jynx, have a strong desire to kiss, and drain energy from whoever they kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight at one of Saffron city\u2019s gates, Jessie and James were dressed as Hula girls They put a lei on Ash and kissed his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the disguised Team Rocket duo\u2019s lips expanded to about the size of a Jynx. The desire to capture Pikachu was dwarfed by the desire to kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had planned on stepping away from Ash and tricking them, but the pleasure that the kiss brung caused the two to hug Ash, preventing him from running away from the kisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Hey! Let me go! I got to go to the Pokemon gym here!\u201d Ash cried out, trying to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLedies, if you don\u2019t free our friend right now, Misty and I will separate the two of you,\u201d Brock said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty nodded before saying, \u201cOr we can have Pikachu do the honors of freeing Ash.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPika-pi!\u201d Pikachu added, letting out a little electricity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie and James glared at Brock, Misty, and Pikachu before freeing Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrock, were their lips that big before?\u201d Misty whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not certain, but I\u2019m pretty sure they weren\u2019t,\u201d Brock whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh hid behind Brock and Misty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie sighed, as she really enjoyed kissing Ash. She began, \u201cWelcome to Saffron city, winners! You\u2019re the one millionth millionth and first visitors!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFollow us to the grand prize room!\u201d James added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cheerful Brock, Misty, and Pikachu followed after the disguised rocket members. A nervous Ash followed them. He thought, \u2018Something about those kisses didn\u2019t seem right. It was like they were draining my energy.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie and James entered a building and walked to the sides of the door, letting the trainers enter. Jessie said,\u201dRight this way!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock, Misty, and Pikachu entered without hesitancy, while Ash as to force himself to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for Jessie and James to grab him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha-Let me go!\u201d Ash cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe told you before, let Ash-\u201d Brock began before he, Misty, and Pikachu fell in a hidden pit trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh ha ha ha!\u201d Jessie uttered before she and James hugged Ash once more, but this time delivering a flurry of kisses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh soon was weakened enough that he needed to be held up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJames, get the rope!\u201d Jessie ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight!\u201d James said, still using the fake voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie dragged the weakened Ash to a chair. James returned shortly with some rope. The two Rockets then tied Ash to a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeowth showed up and was surprised at seeing Ash, but no Pikachu. He asked,\u201cHey! where\u2019s the Pikachu? ...And what\u2019s upwith those lips, Jessie and James?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha\u2026 Team Rocket! I should have known,\u201d Ash said in a angry-yet-weakened voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe one and only,\u201d Jessie cooed before giving Ash a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeowth, we discovered we enjoyed kissing Ash here more than the idea of getting his Pikachu for Giovanni!\u201d James said in his normal voice before giving Ash a kiss as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeowth sighed in exasperation before saying, Could you at least get on your uniforms and take that lipstick off?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever,\u201d James replied before giving Ash another kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides, Ash likes it when we kiss him with this lipstick on and while we\u2019re dressed as hula girls,\u201d Jessie added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t!\u201d Ash grunted, feeling weaker with each kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jessie kissed Ash on the lips, James cooed, \u201cYou\u2019re just playing hard to get. It does make you look all the more kissable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I thought you guys looked pathetic before,\u201d Meowth muttered.</span></div></div>",

It was the day he would get his first pokemon and start his journey as a pokemon master. He ran up the stairs to the lab as fast as he could, almost tripping along the way, until he finally reached the top. Hoping he wasn't too late, he knocked on Oak's door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm? Oh, Ash! I was wondering if you were going to show up today.\" Oak says as he looks over the boy. \"You look like you're ready for bed, not pokemon.\" Ash notices that in his excitement, he left the house in his pjs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind that. I'm here for my first pokemon professor Oak.\" Ash exclaims with gusto. Oak merely sighs and shakes his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid there's a bit of a problem with that.\" He says as he leads Ash into the lab. He brings the would-be trainer to a room with a circular table with three empty pokeballs on it. \"All of our starter pokemon were taken by trainers that got here on time.\" He explains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean I can't get my pokemon?\" Ash asks with defeat in his voice. Oak puts a hand up to his chin. Then, he felt a light bulb go off in his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wait, there is one pokemon we have left.\" He presses a button on the table, and from the center emerged a pokeball with a pair of lips on it. \"This one is all we have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh reached out and grabbed the ball. \"Thanks professor Oak. Okay then, I choose you...\" He opens the ball, and out popped a pokemon with a curvaceous body and plump, pink lips. The new trainer and pokemon stare at each other in silence for a few seconds before Oak speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Jynx, an Ice/Psychic-type pokemon that...\" He was interrupted by Jynx grabbing the sides of Ash's head and pulls him into a powerful smooch that covered his entire lower face. \"can be very affectionate towards her trainer and others.\" He finishes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh starts to grunt and scream, but they are muffled by the pokemon's lips. When she finally has enough,  she pops off of the boy's face, leaving a massive lip mark in its place. \"<i>Jynx</i>.\" It says, giving him a sultry stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I have no other choice. Okay professor, I'll take it.\" He pulls Jynx's pokeball back out. \"Okay Jynx, return.\" He returns her to the ball, only for her to pop right back out and hug his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think she wants to go back in, Ash.\" Oak explains. \"And I don't think you have much say in the matter.\" Ash sighs in defeat as his gut tells him the professor is right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Alright then Jynx, let's go start our journey.\" He says with renewed gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jynx\" She replies. After a brief moment where Ash had to change out of his pajamas (during which Oak and 3 lab assistants had to restrain Jynx to keep her from entering on him), the two set out on their journey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

Now while that may sound like the dream, when you've had to spend every day in fear of some girl cornering you for a kiss, sometimes more, it was anything but. What's worse is that it wasn't exclusive to human girls either. Female pokemon would try for one too. You had a particular memory from a year ago where a flock of female spearow dive-bombed you to try and kiss you with their beaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother tried to explain this with some mysterious event that happened while she was pregnant with you. She and your father were on a boat in the ocean to witness the Lovedisc mating season. Two of them in particular chose to leap into the boat and try to connect. However, instead of finding each other, they both planted their lips on either side of your mother's pregnant belly. She says that the event charmed the unborn child (you) with such love from the opposite sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether it was true or not is beyond you. What is true is that you'll never forget the first day it kicked in. You were only five years old in elementary school. You were approached by a girl your age named Sally and her Smoochum. It was then that she outright told you that they were gonna kiss you. You being the fearful child you were, ran away as fast as you could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran and ran across the playground in circles for about ten minutes before they finally cornered you. You spent the rest of recess being mercilessly kissed by the duo, all thirty minutes left of recess. By the time you returned to class, you were covered head to toe in lip marks from the Smoochum. You were taunted by the rest of the class who called her your girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was only the start of it. Stores, playgrounds, even riding your bike couldn't happen without some pokemon trying to kiss you. This had you even more worried of today. Today was the day you were meant to go get your first pokemon and start your journey as a trainer. Problem was, you were terrified of wandering the world with this affliction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your dad was firm. He told you that this was the day you started to grow out of this fear. He pushed you outside, wished you good luck, then closed and locked the door. Great, now you were out here defenseless unless you went to get your pokemon. You turn around, preparing for your trip to the professor's place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

Come on, grit your teeth and do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn\u00b4t there anything else I could do instead?\" you begged in desperation, knowing full well that Sally and her Jynx were still waiting outside for you to come back out. \"Anything?

It was a pretty easy decision, to be honest; that Muk was giving you a look you really didn't like, and the rest of them had potential, but weren't nearly as powerful as the last two offered to you. You look to her again, and catch her clasping her claws together and giving you a hopeful look. Smiling, you turn to the professor and tell her your answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Juniper! I choose Dragonite as my Pokemon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second those words left your lips, your new partner zipped across the room, instantly putting you in a rib-crushing hug. You could barely even breath as your face was slammed into her soft, scaled chest. It didn't take long for her to stick her tongue into your hair and lick affectionately. An embarrassed blush spread across your face. Obviously, you had underestimated just how touchy-feely she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey, down girl! I don't want to brush my hair again today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Juniper chuckled and put a hand to her cheek, staring at the adorable sight in front of her. \"Oh, it's always nice to see a trainer and their partner first meet. This is so cute, it's unbearable! Make room for me, cuties!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped to your side, squeezing both you and your Dragonite tightly. The surprise thankfully made your Pokemon ease off slightly, but that lucky break was soured by the fact that she started smooching your face as well. The dragon-type didn't seem jealous at all; in fact, you could tell she was even more excited, by how strongly she was nuzzling into the both of you. You sigh in slight annoyance as this continued on for several minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you managed to break off of the extended hug by tickling your partner's sides, which made her instinctively jolt her arms towards her stomach (which had the added effect of launching Professor Juniper across the room). Her joyous giggling melted your cold, jaded, lipstick-covered heart, if only slightly. It had been a while since you didn't immediately react to this kind of physical affection with disgust. Maybe this adventure wouldn't be as harrowing as you thought...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop tickling her after a bit, instead choosing to rub her belly. She had a positively <i>adorable</i> smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? I think I'm gonna call you Daisy, girl.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Daisy' squeaked happily, pleased by her new name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor tapped your shoulder, but not before planting yet another kiss on your already-wet cheek. You groan and glance up at her from the linoleum floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I hate to see you go, Kai, but Sally's right outside the door, and she's just <i>itching</i> for a battle! Here's Daisy's pokeball, you're gonna need it to heal her at PokeCenters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hands you a basic, red-and-white pokeball. Somehow, the thought of keeping her in here feels wrong. She's just too full of energy to spend her time stuck in a small, round container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevermind that, you should be thinking about the fight with your hated 'rival' and self-declared love interest. It'll feel real good to have Daisy knock her down a peg and teach her not to stick her lips where they don't belong! You can see it now: a well-placed Dragon Tail to Jynx's face, and the battle would be over like that--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait. Dragon. Flying. Damnit! Daisy's extremely weak to ice damage; it doesn't matter how strong she is if she can't get an attack off! Looks like this'll be tricky. You only have one shot at beating her, the key metric being speed. If Sally can land an Ice Beam, you're toast, and completely at her whims for the forseeable future. If you can land pretty much any physical move, she's toast, and you're on a pretty good start to your journey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk out the doors of Juniper's Lab, partner in tow, you feel sweat beading on your brow. You can only hope Daisy's fast enough to finish this before it gets too hairy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heyyy, Kai~! I see you have a brand-new Pokemon at your side. She looks really powerful, I don't know if my Jynx can win~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's clear that Sally's trying to lure you into a false sense of security. You're not falling for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give her a fake smile, hoping you can trick her into going easy on you. \"Alright, let's start the battle! If I win, you and your Jynx leave me alone! If you win, well, I don't really need to tell you what'll happen, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour rival grins eagerly at you, expecting an easy win. Jynx blows a kiss at you, which you barely dodge in time before it slaps against the doors of the lab. You shiver, not wanting to think about how much more kiss-hungry she's become. If that one lipstick-print can cover a good third of those doors, who knows what kind of force she had behind those lips...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Here we go! Daisy, fly over to Jynx and use dragon claw! Try not to get hit by her ice moves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that Jynx was already charging up her Ice Beam, nearly ready to fire it at your partner. Daisy's gaining fast, putting a lot of power in her wings, but will she get there in time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, her opponent drops to the ground and fires off an Ice Beam, aimed directly at your Pokemon's belly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Daisy dodge it in time?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That means that wherever you were, the owner wanted you to stay., and considering your curse, you could only assume it was some love-struck lady that wanted you. It wouldn't be the first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third and final thing was a two-parter. You were in your underwear, and you felt someone snuggled up to you. Judging by the skin you felt, you guessed they shared your near-nudity. Using your chin, you nudge the blanket on top of you up so you can see underneath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you lifted it up, you were met by Sally planting a peck on your lips. \"Mwah. Good morning sweetheart.\" You recoil a bit at the kiss as she crawls on top of you. You can barely see that she is also in her underwear as she lays with you. Upon seeing her, everything clicked together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in her room. You were tied up because she kidnapped you. Now the only question is why she kidnapped you, and even then, you had a good idea why. \"Sally?! Let me go!\" You grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet Kai. First I need you to accept my love as your girlfriend.\" This again? Ever since the incident where she cornered and kissed you back in grade school, she's convinced herself that she was your girlfriend. It's gotten so bad that she's convinced your parents of it too. To the point where your they would let her into your room and joke about already planning your wedding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, Sally? Those were just a bunch of kids messing with me years ago. We aren't actually dating.\" You explain, hoping she would understand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I need you to see that my love for you is genuine. We can be mature about this, we're both sixteen. Soon you'll see things my way and we'll be together forever. Now give your girlfriend a kiss, Kai.\" She puckers her lips and leans in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

However yet again is forced to have the Maid Trio, Lemon, Marron, and Melon intend to greet him with kisses before bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taro it's our favorite part of the day. The part with K-I-S-S-I-N-G.\", they say in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh.\", Taro let out an annoyed sigh, wishing that the girl he wants to really kiss was with him, and not the lust crazed trio. Mariel was always on his mind, but he wished he could muster the courage to tell her how he felt. Instead he is forced into romantic hijinks with three girls whose total intelligence was that of a mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio grabbed Taro, and pinned him down. They puckered their lips, and began their duty to keep their master comfortable in bed, particularly \"warm\" during the evening. Their lips were always soft, but it was like being shot point blank by greedy lips. Sometimes they were more painful than pleasurable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Please don't do that so rough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh? You want it to be slower?\", one of them asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please. It hurts when you all kiss me like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then,\" one of the maid's holds up his head and softly speaks, \"Here's how we make sure you only feel good things from our smooches Master Taro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kissed Taro on the lips with her mouth wide open. Taro felt her tongue darting at his mouth, but he didn't wanna open it to find out what she had in mind. She signaled the other two maids to get in on the action. Before Taro realized, they both began licking his cheeks, which made Taro squeal in surprise, but allowed the Maid he was swapping spit with, to give him his first french kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaro gulped with the sudden intrusion of another's tongue in his mouth, he didn't know what to do. He could taste her tongue, licking his gums and wrapping around his own tongue, like a hand feeling a strange new material. The two beside him switched from licking to kissing his cheeks once they heard Taro's gulps and moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaro's eyes almost fell back behind into his head. The embarrassment and stimulation was sending his mind into shut down. Luckily the kiss ended with the trio giving him air to breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewww! What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A French Kiss Master. That was hot. So now Lemon goes ne-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please I do-oooommmmmppphhhh\", Lemon shut Taro up with a smooch before he could technically call them off. She bear hugged him and held his head tightly in her hands almost squeezing out the air in his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww he is so eager. Taro loves our services so much.\", the other two said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaro could do nothing except, accepting their over excessive service. He knew he had todo something to work on their behavior starting tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his second make out session ended, he weakly panted in exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now my turn Master Taro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melon please. I just want to go to sleep.\", Taro weakly pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio cuddled beside him, holding his arms and legs down, still using their charms to lustfully show affection to him. Taro just wanted to go to bed, not having love being made to him by a bunch of dumb bimbos. He wished he could talk to his grandfather to get out of this, but suddenly an idea hit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait? Girls, have you spent any time with your own family?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Maid Trio had their fingers to their heads, looking like they were solving calculus in their heads, until finally answering with, \"No\",  as Taro expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe what I could do is schedule time to have the staff's relatives brought here or allow more personal days? So you're not out of touch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaro's suggestion really hit a chord with the ladies. The trio each looked at one another, silently communicating and nodding, an unspoken bond between triplets maybe. But they enthusiastically agreed to the suggestion and said they'd have their cousins come in first thing tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much Taro. You are such a good master, you deserve a big wet kiss.\", Melon said resuming her earlier advances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaro tried to run, but the other two triplets went back to their cuddle positions, letting their sister get an open mouth kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually when they had their fun Taro fell asleep with the ladies spooning his body from all sides. He never found the triplets to be unfriendly or irritable beyond interaction, but always found them to be a handful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning arrived, and already at around 10ish, the maid triplet's cousins' helicopter arrived to drop them off. Taro was almost worried by the speed of their relatives made it to the estate so quickly. They had to have called no sooner than maybe when he was alseep or shortly when they woke up at an ungodly early hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they were there, so naturally Taro went to greet the new guests along with Lemon, Marron, and Melon. When the helicopter doors opened, Taro's eyes widened almost like balloons being filled with helium. The triplet's cousins were three girls who were almost totally identical to the maid triplets. Differences being these three girls had different color cloths to slightly distinguish themselves. It was as if there were three additional sisters that nobody knew about. They were even dressed in maid uniforms. Why? Who knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taro, meet Ichigo, Ringo, and Sango.\", the Maid triplets introduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh why are they in uniform?\", Taro asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we gave them an internship with our job. We knew we'd connect best by sharing what we do here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaro's mouth dropped to the ground like a rock. He realized now 6 maids were going to be invading his privacy in his bedroom. Forget that, the Triplets tried getting alone time with Taro in the middle of the day. Now with three additional cronies, this was a disaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cousins walked out with very dull looks on their faces. \"Hi. I'm Ichigo, this is Ringo and Sango. We'll be keeping the bed warm for you along with other things you want. But we're not legal, and neither do you, so don't get any ideas kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaro was confused. They acted disinterested in the job, not that it was bad, but they didn't seem happy at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls your doing it all wrong. You don't greet your master that way. You need to introduce yourselves with a strong affirmative kiss to show how attentive to your master's needs. Like so.\", Lemon held Taro's face about to demonstrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuuhhhhh! No! Hey wait if they don't want to, they don't have to.\", Taro said begging not to be kissed again.</span></div></div>",

Taro expressed sheer relief that these ladies were more sane than the lustful but well meaning ditz's their cousins are. Taro, feeling in company of the new intern Maids, personally went to show them to where they were needed. Taro showed them to the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inside I had the others set up space for you three to sleep near your cousins, and we also have a guest room in case it is uncomfortable. But really you just have to stay and make the bed. Other than that you are welcome to the food, or chip in whatever you can.\", Taro explained calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we'll stay in here. If anything to keep those three on a leash. Really we're here earning an easy credit. When we're done, we aren't staying on staff.\", Ichigo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you three need assistance with your credits please let us know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaro left to let them pack alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo, Ringo, and Sango set themselves up, while gossiping about Taro and their cousins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are they so obsessed with that kid. He's not even that good looking. And like you said, he looks like a minor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Sango, but he does have that huggable pet vibe that doesn't make him repulsive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly Ringo, he's pretty nice. Maybe his personality and attitude is what they're hot for.\", Ichigo suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft. They have the emotional intelligence of a 5 year old that knows how to get laid. I think it's blind lust. I just hope they don't drag us into that.\", Ringo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gross, I hope they leave the sock on the handle before they do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't count on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================================================ ============================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is nighttime and Taro is preparing for bed. He hoped this time might be nothing but peaceful bedrest with no girls swarming him with kisses. As usual Lemon, Marron, and Melon all gave their traditional greetings to Taro. Ichigo, Ringo and Sango said the same thing but with far less enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Master Taro, we thought maybe we could play a game before bed?\", Melon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds fine. What's the game you had in mind?\", Taro replied but had a tinge of nervousness wondering if the old trio was planning a surprise kiss attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poki. You take a piece of poki, two people chew on the opposite ends, and the winner is who chews the most before your mouths touch.\", Melon explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaro thought for a moment, it seemed harmless to him. And he found the Poki snack to be awfully tasty. He didn't think of any sneaky intent to come from the game. Though Taro was not the brightest and the Cousin Trio easily knew where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll sit this out.\", Sango said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we came up with this nice game for everyone to enjoy. Won't you join us cousins?\", Lemon said in a fake pleading tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it would be nice to participate.\", Taro innocently suggested oblivious to the game's double meaning.</span></div></div>",

She then told you about the super pheromone secreting gland and claimed that she would use a weaker version of it in you, should you accept this method. You said yes, so she took you to her home and performed an operation. Since you wouldn't be able to pay, you signed an wavier that Fran would be allowed to experiment with your body if you died or needed hospitalization <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you were done waking up, but still in bed, Fran walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you feeling, Alex?\" Fran asked as she sat besides the bed.

Two arms were holding your head in place for her to kiss and probe your lips with her tongue as she was getting ready to french-kiss you. Two more arms were rubbing the sides of your chest. The last two arms were forcing your hands to grope her butt. It felt soft, yet muscular. While you were surprised by her really unusual actions, her butt was something you wouldn't mind massaging for a day or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes were closed, preventing her from seeing your worried look. As far as you knew, Fran never showed anything like this, not towards anyone! Sure, there were those rumors about her and Veronica, but you didn't believe them. From everything you knew of Fran, she was only interested in science. Even then, it was the kind of science that bordered on horror movie stuff!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut here she was, making out with you like her life depended on it. She did have really soft lips, the kind you wanted your lover to have, so you could kiss them forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a panicked squeal as you felt her arms feeling up your sides let go.

I grant whatever wish I hear, but I want to grant either your wishes or my own for a kiss. Please wish for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo pleased that you got a kiss from a sexy woman(even if she was a ghost), you said,\"I...

Please fight it! You don't want to do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I do!\" Clover's lips cooed before pressing her lips against Sam's own lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No! Stop it! I'm not ready!\" Alex cried out before you covered her lips with the raygun's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike with Clover, it only took a few moments before Alex and Sam fell under control of their enlarged and enhanced lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were all freed, the three women all took turns kissing you on your lips with their thumb-sized lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now, Master?\" Sam's lips asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we take over WOOHP?\" Alex's lips asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or go hunting to add to your lip harem?\" Clover's lips asked before all three women kissed you once more.</span></div></div>",

You know who everyone is and how strange the majority of the people are. But today you learn of the terrifying, HORRIBLE, EEEEVVVVVIIIIIILLLLLLLL people that terrorize all of them..... The Kanker Sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kankers? Who are they?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Eds, being the designated experts, describe them in their own unique way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are the She-Demons from the darkest pits of the Inferno Maximus!\", \"They've hunted and tormented us for years. Humiliating us in all kinds of girly ways!\", \"As exaggerated as my friends may seem...THEY ARE TRUE! If you see any girls with either Yellow, Blue, or Red hair, you make a break for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what is it that they DO, to you guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well their punishment can vary from physical aggression, ruining any of Eddy's schemes, being a general nuisance, but their most deadly and prefer method of humiliation comes from them attempting to lock lips with us.\", Double D explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kissing? That's it? That's the thing that scares you guys? What is it they have cooties?\", you laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't laugh it off! They are not some sissy school girls you wanna take out on a date. They are criminal masterminds that enjoy terrorizing the citizens of the Cul-De-Sac. Me, Double D and Ed have gone suffered it before. And it's NOT what you would call romantic.\", Eddy said. His palms and head sweat buckets as if a rainstorm was showering the palpable fear in his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if you had to see to believe what they meant was all they hype, you did believe that they were scared of those girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EH! Who's been gossip'in bout us?!\", a loud roar echoed across the Cul-De-Sac, making everyone else flee in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to see A Red, Blue, and Yellow haired trio of girls radiating a foreboding presence that could be felt by everyone living being within miles. The Red-head, who seemed to be the  leader of the trio walked up to you. You felt intimidated to say the least but you were brave enough to answer them. \"I'm Reese, I'm new here, and heard you guys are pretty scary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked at each other in confusion, they were wondering if this new kid was either stupid or really brave or tough. \"Ya got some guts, I'll say that but if you think you're tough enough to beat us up-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No. I heard you were only scary because you like to kiss the Eds and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the Sisters started to giggle with a sinister tone in their soft laughter. \"Ohh, is that what you heard? Well, maybe we should give you a hands-on demonstration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get worried for a moment and feel like you should follow the other kids' lead and book it. Or do you think that whatever they have in mind is nothing scary at all.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You knew that things were looking serious, the girls began to surround you. Before you could even take a step back, all three of the girls tackled, and pinned you down. They may not look like it but they were ridiculously strong. The sisters started to giggle, a tone of sinister intent could be felt from their soft laughter. They all started to pull something out of each of their pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For this demonstration, we'll need you to volunteer for us. But before we get started, let's have ourselves a roll call so that our new friend here can be properly acquainted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were about to introduce one another to you, you realized what it was they took out from their pockets. Lipstick. As each Kanker Sister introduced themselves, they were applying it to their big, full, plump lips. The red head began, \"I'm Lee Kanker\", followed by the Blonde, \"I'm May Kanker\", and lastly the Blue dyed sister, \"And I'm Marie Kanker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their lipstick fully applied now, they were ready to begin their amorous humiliation on you. Lee sat on top of your stomach, pinning your arms side-to side with her legs. While Marie held down your head, and May was keeping your own eyes open with her fingers. You couldn't move any part of your body, except soon your mouth. You noticed Lee's teeth were a little yellowish, and one tooth was blue. From how loud and authoritative she was, you could catch whifs of her breath, smelling of unpleasant hygiene. Her breath was kicking, but knew you'd be forced to suck air with that breath in a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get ready for the smooch'n and woo'chn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLee began to lean down toward your face. Her lips were glistening from the fresh application of the lipstick she just used. As she was puckering her mouth, she kept making loud and obnoxious 'Mwah' sounds as she slowly descended down. You struggle trying to avoid her, but Marie held your head firmly, and even pressed together your cheeks hard together. Her extra restraint forced your mouth to pucker up as Lee Kanker was about to lock lips with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay kept her fingers around your eye to keep them opened so you could see clearly what would be happening. It felt scary as Lee had so much hair that her own eyes couldn't be seen in the thick layers upon layers of curly red hair surrounding her head. She looked like a lustful monster about to consume her prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the haunting wait had ended, and Lee Kanker gave you a large kiss on the lips. The force she applied to your mouth was strong, she pressed her mouth down on yours very fiercely to almost painful degrees. She rhythmicly massaged your lips in an overwhelming manner, to the point where no romantic joy could be found in this at all. The way the two other girls held you down, restraining you, and Lee's dominance making it where nothing you did allowed you to enjoy such a sweet ordeal, Lee Kanker was made ruler and master of your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer moaning was so strong it drowned out all the noises of disgust and minor moaning from struggling to breath from Lee Kanker not breaking the kiss for a moment. You felt her breath from her nose blow into your eyes. You wanted to close from having Lee's smelly breath blow directly in your eyes, but May still kept them open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were hoping this would end fast, but it got only worse, as Lee started to french you. Her strength in her mouth was equal to the strength in her legs and arms, as she managed to make your mouth open mid-kiss. In doing so, she easily slipped in her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squashed yours down, almost stepping down on it, then like a serpent slithered and  wrapped around your tongue very tightly. You felt like your whole mouth was being sucked like a lollipop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a minute, minute and a half maybe, Lee at long last broke her domineering kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't over, it was now May's turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLee and May switched places, with May now sitting on top of you preparing to give you a kiss as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put those lips together and make like a fish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Kanker lowered to give you a smooch as well, but this time you retaliated with words of disgust. \"I'm not going to kiss another of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see May's buck-teeth, however unlike Lee, May seemed to brush her teeth and took better oral hygiene. But it didn't stop you from shouting to be let go by them. Then you were cut off when Marie and Lee double-teamed you, and they each gave you strong pecks on your cheeks, forcing you to pucker your mouth again, locking lips with May.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gyyyaaaaaa--OOOMMMMMPPPPPHHHHHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike with Lee, the Kankers chose not to force your eyes open. In fact this time the kiss felt a little softer, sweeter, almost loving. May softly held the end of your chin with her finger, lightly stroking it. Her eyes were in full view, and she blinked hers flirty-like as she was sucking face with you. But her sisters weren't done smacking their lips on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were pressing against your cheeks so hard you thought they'd make kissy-shaped holes in your face, reaching your teeth. The pressure they dealt made it once again impossible to enjoy a romantic gesture under normal settings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen all three started to begin kissing you all over your entire face. From top of your hair, to whatever skin was visible atop your clothing, the Kanker Sisters smooched all over your skin and kept with the same obnoxious kissy sounds. There was no joy to be had in any of this. The Kankers were dominating you, humiliating you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made sure you couldn't escape their affection, and they made sure to make it as unpleasant as they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you could do was sit around and let them do this until they got tired of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they were beginning to end things, Marie was then the last one to give you a big wet kiss on the mouth before they all would depart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come to mama.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately started with the tongue tasting, but always kept to the massaging of the lips and frontal gums. She was more aggressive but not obsessed with dominance like Lee was. Marie was more passionate and kinetic with her snogging. She picked up your slack upper body, and held the back of your head in place so she could sink her mouth closer to yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt almost felt like she was sucking your face off, to the point you heard her snort like a pig for a couple of instances. Just the way she did it was more ravenous, and wild compared to the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd like with the two other Kankers, everytime they ended their big liplocking moment with you, it ended with a loud audible 'MWAHH' that came out of both of you. They were such masters of kissing, whatever sound or movement they wanted out of you, they could physically find a way to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kankers left giggling, feeling accomplished by the example they just made by making out with you for who knows how long it lasted. You collapsed to the ground on your own, and passed out from exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou prayed they would end it there, but you were too tired to call for help or stop them from just taking you to do more of this...</span></div></div>",

But it was your only escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nervously smiled back and said, \"How about you release me, so we can have a weekly rendezvous at your choice? So our kissing sessions won't lose its special flair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kanker sisters frowned for a moment before going into a huddle and whispering with each other.</span></div></div>",

No doubt they'll all be including a ton of kissing involved with those anyway, but at least you'd have freedom and eventually a permanent reprieve of their advances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, deal! How do you want it to be done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we look like? A travel agency?!

You prayed they wouldn't kiss you again. Especially not Lee. Her ravenous tongue was enough to bring you to the point of passing out. You felt even a soft kiss from her would put you to the fast track to another passing out session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meet us in these locations. Don't be late lover boy.\", Marie said handing you three scraps of paper. Each one resembled a map of some kind with a time marked on each one. They all left their trailer leaving you some alone time to process and breath normally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you took a look, Marie and May's map's had two different times. Guess as to let you pick who went first. Lee's allowed you enough time to date her other two siblings but she ended up last. Not sure why exactly but at least you could handle the less difficult ones first at least. But who were you going to go on a date with first?</span></div></div>",

She still is aggressive and all around obnoxious, but the lesser of the three evil siblings for sure. Figuring might as well start easy and hopefully start off with a positive impression for the others to possibly have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got out, May had set up a picnic under a tree with a basket of food ready and a tarp covering the ground. Already things seemed ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Mmm-May?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww Reese! You picked me first I'm sooooooooo glad! How about a first date kiss to celebrate the moment? MMMMMMWWWWWAAAAHHHH\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was puckering her lips making kissy noises right from the get go. You hoped the dates wouldn't be nothing but just individual make out sessions so you tried to turn attention to the food she generously had ready to avoid her deadly liplock. \"Uhhhh ACTUALLY I feel more flattered to share that meal you so kindly have ready for 'us' both May.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes! Well I was getting hungry so I made this for myself at first but split it so we could have together when you agreed to take us out. I know Marie and Lee will expect you to have something ready right away but seeing how you picked me first I won't hold against ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thank you, that was-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you looked at what food she packed you committed all of your willpower not to look disgusted by her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So generous of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it look appetizing. A Kanker burger. I added an extra layer of barbecue sauce just for you.\", May said in a genuinely sweet manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bread looked kinda wet and sloppy from the greasy meat slop that was stacked over it, and you swore that whatever meat substance sandwiched together had multiple unsanitary things going on in there. You honestly pondered if maybe it's better to just bite the bullet and have May just kiss you and avoid the meal. Or have the meal but avoid another smooch storm. Chances are she was acting nicer than the others so maybe better to try and make a genuine effort to get to know at least one of the sisters without resorting to just all of them locking lips over your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

Like she found it cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have very nice eyes.\", May complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, you have nice teeth.\", which was true since she did look like she brushed hers unlike her siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can see more int-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wwwhhhhhhaaaat else do you do besides uhhhh. Tormenting, the Eds?\", changing the topic to anything else besides whatever could lead to more kissing, you inquired what other things May did. In the hopes maybe she or the others had depth to them besides their desire to torture the kids around the neighborhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Well I practice my lines.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like to act?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am writing my own play, so that I can be a star, and adored by all the people's of the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! That's really interesting what is your play about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I kinda don't know, I know it is going to have ME as the star. Singing. Dancing. Romance for the crowds, and myself because I am such a romantic. But hopefully it will let me express my inner me person. Ya know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk couple things she said weren't grammatically accurate but you did get the point. Huh, she seemed to be really nice and creative. But lacks some self confidence. And also an actual writer maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and May spent the last hour in conversation, with no actions being taken to have her kiss you. But you didn't realize how long it was until she pointed it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy cow potatoes! Lee and Marie won't be happy I'm keeping you up. Better move it to Marie next before you end up late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah better do that. But still it was nice spending time with you. I really wasn't expecting a nice time from...well any of you at first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean you changed your mind, and want to be our new boyfriend?!\", she said gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! NO! I mean, compared to you three assaulting me, this was a total opposite end of the dating spectrum in a more positive way. I guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't be so shy, I'm still expecting a kiss goodbye.\", May said batting her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would the cheek be fine?\", dumb question perhaps, but why not? If any Kanker might actually say yes, It'd be May.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you did it for real I wouldn't mind at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay held her hands together almost in prayer, and closed her eyes waiting to receive your token of affection. Frankly you felt sympathetic enough to allow her a peck on the cheek from you. You leaned in and quickly kissed her right cheek. To May, it was the greatest thing she got on Christmas day. She squealed in utter joy, and jumped up and down clapping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sheepishly ran off to Marie's location hoping for the remote chance she'd be as easy to handle as her younger sibling.</span></div></div>",

You hoped that Marie would be just as nice as May based on how shocked you were with May's date going rather well and normal. But there was still an air of uncertainty with the Kanker. On the map it read, stop near the river. You saw up ahead the Blue Haired \"beauty\" standing near the river by a homemade boat of sorts. The boat had a giant \"K\" on the main sail with Marie wearing a pirate hat on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yooohoooo. Barnacle of LOOOOOOOOVVVVVVEEEEE!\", she called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne big gulp of nervousness later, and you went to greet your date. \"Hello Mmm-Marie. I didn't expect the date to be a pleasure cruise.\", moment you said pleasure cruise you kicked yourself in your head making sure you don't give her ideas of how literal she'd make it be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be a pleasure when you sail me across the river. But you gotta do all the work in making sure we sail there safely. Cuz if ya don't, consequences won't be good for you. Mmmmwah! Mmmwah!\", she puckered her lips threatening you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea how to sail a boat, let alone one that was made with very poor materials. But you had no choice or else.Marie slapped onto your head a pirate hat, and laid down on the port of the boat watching you. First you went to detach the rope keeping it tied to land. Then looked for what was used to steer the boat, which there wasn't any. No rudder, or wheel, nothing! You had to improvise quickly, Marie was grading you on whether she'd assault your lips or not and you had to think and act fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed some kind of garden mower on the top of the boat, on the observation perch. You climbed up to grab it thinking maybe it could act as a boat motor to steer it. Your weight began to shift the boat a bit, making you twice as anxious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you make us sink or capsize you'll get a lot worse than just smooches buster!\", Marie warned you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached up to grab the mower and just barley got it. You slid down and started it up. The mower was properly revved and you placed it at the very back of the boat. It started to gain strong momentum, which you weren't expecting. You gained balance as it was going but you nearly fell off in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, okay that fast enough for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speed was alright. But you have to do one more thing before I pass or fail ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood lord she was basically grading you on this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sing me a pirate song, and I'll decide if you're getting off this boat with or without a prize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no, you didn't know a pirate song let alone sang well. What do you do?!</span></div></div>",

Maybe we could do something else besides eating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay's face turned from excited to sudden disappointment, then morphed into fury. She threw the Kanker burger away, and was taking out something from her pocket. \"If you won't have a taste of my cooking, then you're gett'n a taste of my kissing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out her lipstick and grinned that devilish grin again like before. You noped the f* outta dodge right when you saw that but May body tackled you and completely overpowered you. She managed to hogtie you up, then started to hoist you up the tree like a pinata. You felt disoriented with the blood rushing to your head and her swinging you back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make like a fish, boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay puckered her lips, and applied on the lipstick. You couldn't believe how she was able to just perfectly apply it all on her lips from just one motion but the improbability of that was the least of your worries. She pushed you, swinging you back, and then you were coming towards her lips at rapid pace!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhh-ooommmmmppppphhhhhhhhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face smashed together with May's lips. Her mouth was soft against yours but her sucking of your lips was harder than the actual collision. She pushed you again this time spinning you around disorienting your vision. You couldn't tell where her lips were going to land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour suddenly stopped, and felt May kiss your back. Your shirt was hanging down enough where she made contact with your skin so least she didn't leave a mark of your clothing. Then she turned you around, and smooched your lips again for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sucked on your face like a lollipop, and started to lick on you like one. In between her massaging your lips with hers, she slipped her tongue in your mouth and licked your tongue as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmwah! Guhhh. Please May stop this please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll stop until you kiss away my hurt feelings. So pay the pauper buddy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pay the pip-mmmmppppphhhh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe assaulted your face with kiss marks all over, yet again. After who knows how long she let you down. You felt really dizzy and had a headache from hanging upside down for that long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay then pinned you down saying, \"Times up now, time for the end of date kiss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kissed you on the mouth, sticking her tongue right inside yours. Your mouth hung open trying to breath from the nauseousness but May took advantage and used it to give you a very deep wet kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was almost washing your gums with her tongue, her spit drooled down your mouth in between her sucking your lips running off your chin. You moaned into the kiss most likely from the almost drunken state of disorientation May left you in. Finally May broke the kiss with a loud pop and saliva trail connecting you two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun with Marie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay walked off, and you slowly got back up making your way to the next Kanker.</span></div></div>",

A safe test with some nature cartoons proved it worked. When a cartoon was on and you used the special remote, a menu appeared around the TV with all sorts of options. So many options, it was really annoying to go through even a tiny fraction of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wanted to leave, you had to press the eject button. It would open a portal back to your home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you looked around and found an easy preset option selection.

It was of the CN City, a group shot of various Nickelodeon characters, and the \u2018Who framed Roger Rabbit\u2019 Movie, hoping it would allow you the freedom to visit them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you entered the portal, you saw that you were in a warehouse.

How good of a teacher would the new DADA professor turn out to be? Was the rumor true that there was a special room hidden somewhere in the castle that would magically fit itself based on what you needed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning post arrived and pulled out of your thoughts as a mysterious package was suddenly dropped right in front of you. That was quite a surprise as you didnt expect to receive any deliveries today. Thankfully there was a letter attached to the package you could quickly read through before doing anything potentially stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hi my dear,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know you must be quite shocked right now as to why you would receive a package out of the blue that you have not ordered at all. Well, lets just say we managed to finish our newest experiment a little sooner than we expected so I decided to send you a sample of the potion for some real-life testing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know you are not the biggest fan of being our test subject, but it would mean a lot to me and I will surely remember it when your next birthday comes around, so please give it a try. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis new potion we have created should enhance your body, making it more attractive for a given amount of time. From the basic tests we made so far the potion should be giving you more captivating eyes, more kissable lips and a smoother skin among other things. The effects should last somewhere between three and five days, but we dont have enough data yet to be completely sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would help us a lot if you could drink the sample inside the package and note down all experiences you make with it over the next couple days. I have sent you three vials just in case the potion wears off too quickly and you cannot gather enough data for me in one go. They are also charmed so that only you can touch them in order to prevent others from taking it. I am counting on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLove, Mom</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat, so the research company your mother was working at has created yet another crazy potion that you should test for them. This could end up either really funny or really bad, there was no in-between when it came to testing their new products. Would you dare to take the risk?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, the effects sounded very interesting and maybe this potion could even help you to finally get your crush to notice you. Your mom would never send you a potion if the side effects were too drastic or dangerous, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looks like this school week just got a lot more exciting.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You fell and began to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll until you fell onto a large mushroom head, one bigger than a king-sized bed in an enclosed room with a single door. After you left the room, you headed to what looked like Peach's castle, though mixed with stuff from other video game series.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll unaware that whoever kissed you would become enthralled with kissing you.</span></div></div>",

Not recognizing you, he had a blank look on his face and asked, \u201cAnd you are?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath before answering, \u201cI am Y/N. I am from a world where\u2026 well, all of this was in a few video games and video game series. A faceless voice said I was to come here to help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh\u2026 I\u2019ll have to let Princess Peach and one of the Princess Zeldas know. They\u2019ll let Master Hand and Crazy Hand know,\u201d The Toad replied. \u201cThey\u2019ll probably put you in something easy, maybe working under Cooking Mama.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, \u201cEven the smallest step can be a world of difference.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toad smiled at you before gesturing to you to follow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Toad (who you learned was named Ross) predicted, you were put under Cooking Mama's watch for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hands and the princesses were surprised to meet you and even knew that you were from the Real World, but had some knowledge of who the voice was. They asked that you keep you from the real world a secret. Not many Video Game characters would understand or take it well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCooking Mama was nice enough to teach you many new dishes. Some from the real world, others from Video game worlds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking meals took pretty much all day. Luckily, the Toads, Shyguys, and all other beings were there to help you out with that, as well as some secret combat training. You doubted you'd be able to fight any of the big name fighters, but you felt like you could fight either the Small Fry Corps or the standard video game mooks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were very pleased to receive compliments about your cooking. Cooking Mama claimed it was your love and enthusiasm that made it excellent. Then again, you were in a land of people who were the stars of your childhood and thus spent most days with a smile on your face. Love and enthusiasm was rather easy for you to produce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a lot of people who came and went from The Smash Bros tournaments. Heroes, Villains, and Civilians. Even ones from other consoles, like Playstation and XBox. All were welcome as long as they obeyed the rules... or at least avoided being caught breaking them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring your breaks and days off, you were polite to everyone. Bad guy characters like Bowser were nice when not acting in character. Ganondorf was quite cultured and a great source of knowledge if one needed tips to survive in any of the video game wilds. Mario was nice, but a tiny bit thick at times. Link tended to be the silent type, but helpful, no matter the version of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, one lady decided to give you a reward for being such a good cook and a nice person. They waited in a hiding spot until you got off your shift and popped out, giving you a quick peck on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA powerful shiver of pleasure ran throughout her body. She licked her lips as you looked at her in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? You made such good food that I wanted to reward you. I enjoyed giving you that brief kiss so much, I might as well give you a deep one,\u201d the woman said before she grabbed you by your shoulders and kissed you on the lips, her tongue darted into your mouth and began to wrestle with your tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you struggled to free yourself, the lady pondered if she should tell the others that kissing you was fun and delicious or if she should keep it a secret</span></div></div>",

Nobody is around. Not even a single sound from one of those infected beasts that usually dominate every nook and cranny of this place. But right now, there is only the whistling sound of the wind, which is blowing quite much up here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that you have landed on top of one of the corner pillars, so it is not really clear to you, how you are going to get down. In the game, you are usually able to just jump down, but you aren't sure, if you can do it now that you are here for real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you just lie there and consider for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can jump down safely, if you like.\" A sort of rough, young, female voice. \"I do it all the time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognize the voice immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zoey?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, correct. How did you know, it was...?\" Zoey begins, but before she can even finish her sentence, you have already jumped down from the pillar in order to run over to her and kiss her right on the mouth. As you are holding her head between your hands, you feel her beautiful, brown, medium length hair, which is so soft that you instantly feel a shiver of lust throughout your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmph...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoey tries to say something, but you extend your tongue deeper into her mouth. As you feel her tongue, naughtily countering it, almost automatically as if per instinct you slide your left hand down to her soft neck, gently cascading down to her upper and lower back, where you feel her tight, sexy figure. This incentivizes you to slide your hand even lower, so it ends up on her left butt cheek, but now Zoey slowly pushes you away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot yet, you dirty, dirty boy!\u201d Zoey commands. This is the moment where you realize that she is actually not only pointing one of her M1911 pistols, but both of them at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearing a little for your life, you take one step back, but just then she lowers both pistols and throws one of them to the side, after which she holsters the other.<br>\r\n\u201cI want you\u2026!\u201d Zoey says in a commanding voice again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah\u2026 Wow! Seriously?\u201d You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026To kiss my belt!\u201d She finishes, while she pulls up her red sweater, so you can just barely see the bottom part of her naked breast underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe isn\u2019t wearing a bra, and you are just standing there, staring at her flat stomach. You notice the wonderful curvature of her hips, around which is the brown-grayish belt with little holes in it, she wants you to kiss, holding up her dirty blue jeans. You can\u2019t even see her underwear, if she is even wearing any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKiss it now!!!\u201d She shouts. \u201cWhat are you waiting for, nerd?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are a lot of holes in that belt, and they are all lined with little metal rings.

You want to ask Zoey to slow down, but you are kind of afraid about, what she will do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eagerly grabs your head and pulls it towards her square belt buckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face is now right in front of it, and you can see her navel a few inches above the belt buckle, while her special part is still concealed underneath her pants, but right below the belt buckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a few seconds is what you got, before something needs to happen\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For some reason, you don\u2019t really feel like going all the way around the belt to kiss every single one of those holes. No! You are only interested in ONE small hole right now, and it is already uncovered!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you quickly raise your hands on either side of Zoey to put them on her beautiful hips, while you dive your head extremely close to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoey still thinks that you are going for the belt, but not two seconds later, you aggressively put your lips around her navel and start licking the tiny crater in her skin, like you have never liked before. It tastes salty, but with a hint of sweetness. A soothing, erotic warmth spreads throughout your body, as you playfully wiggle your tongue inside her navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the feeling is overruled very shortly, as you feel Zoey\u2019s hands, violently grabbing your head, where after your head is being moved downwards, towards the belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you! The belt!\u201d Zoey shouts angrily, but with a hint of arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your head being pressed hard against her body, and your lips are smashed against the metallic belt buckle, causing your lower lip to bleed a little. Then Zoey starts to move your head from side to side, while she makes very sure that your lips are constantly on the belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope it was worth it to suck my navel for five seconds, silly!\u201d Zoey taunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she has moved your head from side to side a few times, having reached both sides of her hips several times, she pulls your head out in front of her self, standing with spread legs in a very dominating position above you, giving you an almost evil grinning look, while she still holds you by your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRochelle!\u201d Zoey shouts. \u201cCome over here! My new lover has to kiss the backside of my belt! You need to make sure that he does.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, a cold shiver of fear runs down your back, as you see Rochelle approaching, wielding a 1-meter long fire axe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n`What is she gonna do with that?\u00b4 You think fearfully to yourself, praying internally that she is not going to use it on you.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs you struggle a little to get away, you feel Zoey\u2019s hand pulling your hair even harder to the point where it hurts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing, you can do, is watch Rochelle\u2019s stylish black boots, tightly embedded in her black jeans, tapping slowly on the ground, as she walks towards Zoey and you. Almost as if she was walking for a fashion show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Rochelle starts pulling the axe behind her, scraping the ground with the metal part of the axe, which makes a terrifying screeching sound. You start crying a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, my, Zoey! What do we have here?\u201d Rochelle mockingly asks you, while she uses the axe to gently balance your chin, which she slowly pushes upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike a little Chihuahua, right?\u201d Zoey agrees. \u201cHe\u2019s just been begging me to go easy on him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, be glad you didn\u2019t meet me first.\u201d Rochelle says, directed at you. \u201cI woulda put yo world in flames, boy! Now come here!\u201d<br>\r\nBefore you can even answer, Rochelle grabs your head, puts the wooden end of the fire axe in front of your throat and holds you still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoey turns around in a 180 degrees spinning move that could easily resemble a ballet move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Rochelle\u2019s axe pulled hard into your throat and her knees pushing you towards Zoey, Rochelle forces your lips onto the belt in front of Zoey\u2019s right hip and drags you around, until your lips have been passed every single one of the little, metallic holes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted, you drop to the ground after Rochelle loosens her grip on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave fun with him during the rest of whatever you have planned for him, sister.\u201d Rochelle says to Zoey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know the half of it, girl!\u201d Zoey responds. \u201cWe got a looong night ahead of us\u2026 Me and him.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was leaning her head against her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, Amy. Are you okay?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Yes. I\u2026 I just\u2026\u201d Amy muttered, slowly turning towards you. She looked very depressed. \u201cOne of my card predictions told me that Sonic and I aren\u2019t to be more than friends anymore. My runes told me that my new love is\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused as her sadness seemed to just\u2026 vanish. You watched as her frown of depression change into a bright smile of creepiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmy?\u201d you asked. When she took a step towards you, you began to fear her. \u201cAmy? What did your rune prediction say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clasped her hands together and said, \u201cI think you are my new love! My runes told me that my new love would look upon me with the sun behind their back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked behind yourself  and saw that the hallway window showed that the sun was setting. Looking back at Amy, you said, \u201cAmy, I know you place a lot of faith in your predictions, even having a decent job doing it, but could it be that you\u2026 misinterpreted your cards and runes this time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy frowned, this time out of annoyance. \u201cI might\u2019ve, but I spent years going after Sonic and getting nowhere. I think I was reading them wrong then, but I\u2019m right about them now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecalling some of the times she read the runes for you and how they seemed accurate for the most part, Like sometimes they were how you thought they would happen and other times what occurred for you would be only the most literal interpretation of the prediction, you asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me there\u2019s many ways to interpret the runes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s\u2026 Let\u2019s just do one thing to see who is right,\u201d Amy said, now looking desperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKiss me,\u201d Amy answered before closing her eyes and puckering her lips for a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened one eye and said, \u201cYes. If neither of us feels nothing, you\u2019re right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed before deciding to play along with her. So you bent down and kissed her on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wrapped her arms around you to continue the kiss. She briefly probed your lips with her tongue, but found no way in.</span></div></div>",

They went back into their coffins, but then the bottom halves opened to allow their feet to be let out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe the coffins rose right side up, and the vampire ladies went after Copper.

The Vampires opened up their coffins, laughing at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCooper tried to make a break for it, but one of the vampire darted right at him. Cooper screamed just before she grabbed him.

The Vampire's robust breasts were pressing against his chest like two large pillows smushed against him. Her lips hungrily sucked against Cooper's, her teeth managing not to cut his for any moment of pain. The Vampire laughed in between her kisses with Cooper, maniacally enjoying the kissing and claustrophobic torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCooper was feeling dizzy, not because she was using her eyes to hypnotize him, although he feared if she would do so, but because her lovemaking was rocking around the coffin. Her kisses started off soft but then things got hotter when she began to slip her tongue into his mouth. Almost like an animal, and from the sounds she made doing so, she feasted on Cooper's lips mashing, licking, sucking on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCooper didn't know what to feel. If he found this hot or disgusted. Her pump body overwhelmed him, pressed against it so his breathing was so weak. He wasn't positive but he thought he swore the Vampire's lower half bumped against his own. Maybe just from all the erratic movements she made while they were stuck in the coffin just happened to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Cooper tried to speak, plead her to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vampire stopped for a moment but slowly had her tongue exit Cooper's mouth by licking under his, as if stroking under it like someone would with their chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please...stop....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're all mine boy. You'll learn to love me one way or another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she do next?</span></div></div>",

He was expecting it was another way to force him to be forced into another series of kisses with the big plump vampire. However things were starting to feel different the moment she spoke to him in a soft, and sultry manner, \"Look into my eyes boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a little hard to see anything besides the darkness within the claustrophobic confinement of the coffin, plus the size of the vampire's breasts were pretty much what Cooper could look at whenever the two weren't swapping spit and tongue. But for some reason now all the sudden, her eyes grabbed Cooper's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer yellow eyes now started to look less menacing and more inviting. Cooper started to feel his thoughts slipping away from his attention so easily. Like he dropped a bag full of Halloween candy but didn't care that it was all scattered on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look deeper in my eyes. You want to look. Never blinking. Never stopping. You will obey anything I tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vampire's words felt like a beautiful symphony of instructions. Cooper's mouth began to break into a smile, his mouth hanging ajar almost carrying drool. \"Ew. Boy don't drool over my dress. Drool in my mooouuuuutttthhhhh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vampire opened hers and let out a traditional Vampire hiss at Cooper. Her tongue was poking out, visually showing what she wanted Cooper to do. Cooper mimicked his mistress and let out his tongue, opening his mouth as wide as his body permitted without harming him. The Vampire's and Cooper's tongue's danced together while they sucked on eachother's lips like lollipops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCooper never broke eye contact with the vampire. Her gaze kept him feeling submissive and dazed. Her kissing only made it easier for him to not dwell on any thought besides the Vampire in only pleasurable ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vampire moaned loudly no matter if her sound traveled in the coffin or in the boy's own mouth. But she felt something touch her thigh. \"Mwah. Huh? What's tha- Ohhhhh. Well well well. Seems you like more than just my smooching. Seems like you want to be more of a man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the pleasure bombardment Cooper was getting a raging stiffy for all of this. With the Vampire noticing, she was contemplating what her next move was into torturing you in overwhelming unrequited nocturnal passion.</span></div></div>",

To Cooper, the vampire was nothing short of beauty incarnate. Every movement she made was graceful to the point of being intangible. Every breath was a gentle breeze. Every command was only an excuse to allow Cooper to bask more in her glorious presence. Now he was going to expose himself to her? Embarrassing to say the least, but how could he refuse her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know how it all works?\", the Vampire asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCooper knew, he understood what this was leading to. But he didn't mind. Under the hypnotic trance everything she told him was pure joy to Cooper. All he wanted was to do whatever she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now how do we get your engine revved?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another kiss from your sultry lips would be perfect mistress.\", Cooper answered with genuine charm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, my little slave loves my lips? Let's not disappoint. Give me a kiss lover boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so they smooched up a storm yet again. This time Cooper was feeling more aggressive, and into it. Cooper's arms rubbed around the Vampire's arm, slowly stroking it with tender care. His right continued to softly meet and interlock with the Vampire's fingers, while the other gave her boobs a firm squeeze. This brought  the Vamp to gasp a moan while her lips and tongue were joined with Cooper's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCooper took it as a sign to do the same, and moaned in a similar manner, mirroring his mistress. The Vampire broke the kiss for a moment to compliment on Cooper's advances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, you're really making this fat Vampire feel loved. Time you go a look at all of her hunny bunny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vampire took off her big blue dress, revealing all of her gargantuan bazangas to Cooper, and her exposed 'lower lips' in addition. \"Do I look pretty to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCooper took a long look at her, her chubbiness may seem repulsive to some, but men of class know when they are in the sight of a astonishingly gorgeous plump babe as this Vampire. Cooper wanted her to be hugged into her breasts for migrating season. Sleeping for countless hours in her breasts like it was survival instinct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vampire noticed his 'engine' running now, revved and ready to be kissed by her 'lower lips'. \"Let's be together.\", the Vampire said almost anticipating it as much as Cooper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't do so delicately, he thrusted into her lower lips and felt a surge of ecstasy jolting into his body. He knew to keep with the thrusting and would get better. The Vampire thrusted with him, and continued with her aggressive snogging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCooper may be in an area appearing to be a hellish landscape, but this was heaven to him. He wrapped his arms around her waist and just felt her up. Doing the best he could to make her enjoy it as much as him. In a twisted way, the pair were having very enjoyable and cute sex.</span></div></div>",

Every movement inside her was like euphoric lightning striking down on his loins in pleasurable ecstasy. Cooper couldn't muster the strength to ravenously make out with the Vampire. All the pleasure was making his mind turn more into mush. Turning him into nothing more than a living sex doll for the Vampire to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cooper obey your mistress, tell me you love me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCooper sounds were slurred like a drunk's, his body was so tired from banging this BBW of a Vampire and his mind was overstimulated to the very real chance it would hemorrhage. \"iiiiiiiiiii.....lllllooooovvvvveeeee y-yya-yoooouuuuuu\", he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cooper, tell me you are mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"uhhhhhh.....I am........ya...ahh ahhh aaahhhhh ahhhh yoursssssss...\", his moans mixed in with his answers. It was becoming clear Cooper would reach his limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me Cooper, tell me you want to be with me forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"&gt;mooooaaaaannnnnn&lt; I want &gt;moooooaaaannn&lt; to be &gt;mooooaaaaannnn&lt; with you &gt;Moooooaaaaaaannnnnn&lt; FOREVER! MMMMMmmmmmmm. Mistress I'm gonna...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no. No cumming until I say so.\", the Vampire ordered. She enjoyed Cooper's desperation to cum in her, but couldn't because she willed him not to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P--pllleeaassee. I love you. It hurts to hold in my love for you.\", Cooper begged pathetically trying to appeal to her romantic side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want your love. I want your obedience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhhh! Please mistress! UH! UH UHHHH! UHHHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vampire thrusted into Cooper with a sudden burst of speed. She wanted to see how long he'd last under this much pressure. She laughed so hard as Cooper, while still hypnotized was in so much pleasure and it was turning into pain and desperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cooper I will allow you to release, under one condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god please. Tell me! I will say anything!\", Cooper cried out still in a pleasured moan despite the torture she was making him go through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me make you a Vampire. You would be mine forever. Exist as my lover for eternity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe torture was waking Cooper up from the trance, he almost had enough will power to refuse but his body would give out from holding in his load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to be human.\", Cooper replied trying to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like I need to silence your tongue. I will make you a Vampire one way or another. But for now lets see how long before you give out. Gimme a kiss Cooper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCooper was in a mental warzone with himself. His body was suffering a need to release the pleasure welling up inside him, the stimulation of having sex with the Vampire, the order to kiss her, to not obey her, and yet wanting to obey her. As all this was being sorted in his mind Cooper just gave into the chaos and prayed by kissing the Vampire it would be enough to reach his limit and end her suffering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCooper parted his lips sucking on the Vampire's blood red lipstick mouth. He licked all over her gums and teeth just doing anything to build enough pressure for it to be impossible not to cum inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Cooper was almost gagging due to the Vampire shoving her tongue so far down his throat it felt like he was drowning. He gargled and clamored for breath but noticed the Vampire's smile. He knew she was onto his attempt to disobey her command to hold it in. Cooper tried to think of anything sexy to jog his mind into making his body go into overdrive. But due to the hypnosis and the Vampire having been in his head long enough now, it didn't matter what he thought. It was always her, and whether she allowed him to think of her a sexually provocative was for her to dictate now. He tried to picture the hottest qualities about her, but now it seemed to be a retardant for him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCooper was crying out in pain, he wanted her to stop but he couldn't voice his opinions with her deep throating tongue gagging him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack-AAAYYYY\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vampire left her tongue out of Cooper's mouth to let him clarify.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. I'll be your lover for all eternity! I'll be your Vampire slave forever and ever! Just PLEASE LET ME CUM INSIDE YOU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vampire grinned from ear to ear, she wanted to hold out just for an extra minute. \"You may cum but only if you give me another big, fat, wet, ssssucculent, long kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCooper leaned in todo that, but she purposefully leaned back away for him to try and push through her titanic breasts, and push his manhood further into her opening. He was so tired he was slowly reaching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha. C'mon now Cooper baby. I don't have cooties.\", she taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust mere inches away he puckered his lips out and tried to reach hers so this pain and pleasure may end. In a last ditch effort he planted a firm grasp of her butt causing her to squeal in pleasure forcing her mouth to move out just enough for Cooper to grab her lips with his, and with that he screamed into the Vampire's mouth, a scream of a painful yet euphoric release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahhaahhahaaa. You know I must admit the fight you gave me was fun. Maybe I won't turn you into a Vampire yet. I mean you couldn't resist at all if I turned you now. Think of all the extra fun we'd have as Vampire and Human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCooper began to pass out from all this. He couldn't answer her, he knew when he woke up he'd either bought himself time to remain human or start an everlasting life as a Vampire.</span></div></div>",

He was on a bed, with both his arms and legs chained to the bed posts. He saw himself totally naked. With all of this sinking in, Cooper could scarcely recall the Vampire sex he had the last time he was awake. Her Vampiric hypnosis didn't keep him from forgetting the sensations of her folds and bozonga breasts. But he knew he had to try and escape, however when he tried to move his body, he somehow couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You no longer control your own body Cooper.\", the Vampire said in a see through outfit. Her boobs were almost visible with the black color of her cloths concealing enough but not enough at the same time. Her boobs were so big she appeared as if she were a ghosts. Her torso and head, and arms could be seen but the bottom half was no more than an invisible tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You surrendered yourself to me. Now anytime I want to see you move it will be when only I will it so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\", Cooper wanted to speak but he couldn't. He could even move his mouth but no sound would come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's useless Cooper. I own every inch of you. Before we go another round, say that I am the most gorgeous Vampire ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the most gorgeous Vampire ever.\", Cooper answered. He felt the air in his lungs being sucked out of his mouth and his jaw moving like someone had their hands moving his mouth. A literal puppet basically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say you want to kiss every inch of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanna kiss you every inch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vampire hovered over Cooper's exposed manhood, and teased him. \"Say that I can wait an eternity to cum for you if you ever told me to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCooper wanted to fight her control but couldn't. It was liked holding back a vomit when you were ill. Simply impossible to hold in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....wwwwillllllll\u2026\u2026.wwwwwaaaaaaiiiiiiiit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoopergripped the sheets begging her not to tease him that long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's start small. Kiss for your bat bae?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCooper leaned in as much as his head could allow, and the Vampire laid a wet kiss on the mouth. Sucking his tongue and face like candy. Cooper had no choice but to lie down and accept his fate. Her breasts pressed so hard on his chest it only hurt his breathing as he was being made out with. Moans, gargling and licking could be heard in the cave.</span></div></div>",

As if the world was blocking out the moans and sounds that would be yet to come. Cooper's manhood was sore from the teasing, his vampire mistress' titanic boobies, and her hypnotic hold on his body. Cooper was her sex slave, no control over anything now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you wanna cum big boy. But you need to earn it. With every move you start getting me going, earns you one step to your ecstasy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vampire waved her hand, you felt control over your limbs, but some parts were under her control. You felt in such a need to shake the dew off the lily that frantically shaking it might force you to blow your load. Unfortunately it only served to make the pain worse as she practically had a lock and chain over that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I see your confident for needing to rev your engine in front of me. C'mon baby Cooper. Earn your release.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCooper ran to the Vampire, but she didn't make it easy. She floated upward and hung upside down like a bat. Her boobs were the only thing gravity affected. They hung downward with her big nipples revealed to him. Only serving to make his dick ache even more. Cooper could see a part of the cave that was climbable to reach her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCooper never felt so tired and sore during rock climbing, in fact he never did it period. But it had to be better than this with a Vampire woman forcing your own body to blue ball yourself. Cooper saw a set of metal bars that he could use to climb over the ceiling of the cave with. He guessed other Vampires used them for hanging upside down while in bat form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vampire made a bunch of sexual sounds to tantalize him and make him climb faster. Cooper reached with one hand out barley touching the Vampire girl's hand. \"Oooo, want me to hold your hand?\", she said mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! I'll fall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you gonna do when I hold it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give you the sweetest kisses, and the best sex you ever had in your immortal life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's a claim. Okaaayyyyy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed Cooper's hand and picked him up bringing him to her level. She held him tight with only one arm around his waist. But they still were upside down. \"H-hey! Heeeeeyyyyy?! Bring us down from here!\", Cooper pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to pleasure me upside down. Nobody has ever managed to do me like this. Well, no human has. Buuuuut if you want me to make you a vampire I could do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! I'll do it. I want to stay human please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCooper took her other hand, and started to suck each of her individual fingers. He licked around each one circling his tongue around them wildly. Then he started to kiss up her arm, making audible kissy sounds to make her more aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCooper faceplanted himself in her breasts motorboating them with his head shaking so much it almost seemed like he was having a body spasm. He followed it up with a few minutes sucking on one of her tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm. So far so good baby Cooper. Maybe I may let you leave out of mercy if you make it worth my time tonight. MMMMMMMM! Now, come over to your mama, and giver her the bestest sugar you've ever given boytoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips puckered, her eyes were half open, her finger stroked under your chin inviting you to come play with her lips. You were so sick of trading spit with her by this point, but had no other choice but to go all in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stuck out your tongue and just darted it into her mouth. Her lips felt so soft, but her own tongue was very aggressive. It felt like a tidal wave inside with hers overwhelming yours. You tried to retaliate in force, but she was leading the dance not you. Every moan within your mouths was coming out of you, with your face looking like your very soul was being sucked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Fuck me now Cooper!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still had her mouth connected to yours but commanded you via her telepathy she had over you as her vampiric master. You plunged yourself into her opening, and thrusted with no consequence. It felt both amazing and painful with you STILL not able to explode in euphoria. You did everything, rubbing, massaging, alternating, anything to please her and let you finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Cooper you want me to release you? You better get me to go first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat could he do to make her release her hold? You just knelt down, and started making out with her bottom lips. At this point what else could work?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear her moaning thing through the thunder and lightning. She was pressing your head closer, you were getting her to finish, same time you felt like she was letting you go. </span></div></div>",

Like tonight, when the room next to yours was blasting music and was sending vibrations straight through to it while you were writing up some homework. You banged your fist on the wall, hoping to cut through the song for them to turn it down, or better turn it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter repeating the same pattern of strikes, you exhaled and rose from your sitting position. \"Who was on this side again?\" you thought, slipping a white t-shirt over a black wife beater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly knowing your direct few people here including your neighbors wasn't helping you any either, as you ran through who it could be playing music this late. \"Sam was usually sleeping by now to get up for basketball practice\" you muttered to yourself trying to find your other slipper to take a small voyage next door. \"Axel dropped out to help back home. So maybe it's someone new?\" you asked no one walking out of the dorm and took one or two steps to be in the front door to the dorm filled with music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to knock, hoping some would actually hear that rather than the bangs on the wall. You could faintly hear \"Foods here.\", whatever it was seemed to work as the volume was lowered and the door opened. A blonde woman in her early 20's cracked open the door and gave you a once over, then looked up and down the hall. She then playfully asked, \"You wouldn't be the take out person would you?\" opening the door slightly more as if to say, \"bring it in\", while also showing how underdressed she was. Only in a sports bra and panties, she was clearly inviting you inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I live next to you and was asking to turn down your music.\" you started with your arm crossed, acting unphased by her appearance  \"Hey Stacey what's taking so long?\" another woman, a brunette in yoga pants and a tank top walked up behind her and slapped her bottom. Stacey turned her head to the ceiling and barely held a moan. With a burning face, you slowly turned and headed back to your room, hoping these odd interactions would end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wanna come in, I mean we just have to make up for keeping you up all night,\" Stacey said snaking her hand to yours and interlocking your fingers. \"N-no, no. I was just working on a paper.\" turning to face her again, a topless Asian woman appeared out of nowhere. \"that I should really get back to.\" you said, feeling how shaky your voice was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, \" the blonde whined, pulling you between her and her brunette friend. \"It's not like we bite, unless it's your thing.\" she closed in on your neck and gave it a peck. Stepping back, you backed right into the brunette, and her open arms. \"What do you mean, biting is my thing.\" she chuckled and leaned down to nibbled at your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey's mouth wandered upward till it hit your jawline, to which she shifted her attendance. With every kiss, she took a step front pushing you three into the dorm. \"Please stop, I won't bother you again,\" you begged not liking where this was heading. \"Don't worry, we'll let you get as much sleep as possible.\" the brunette smiled into the side of your face. \"But I was doing a paper, \" you replied, feeling the brunette digging her hands under you two layers of tops to feel your abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey released your hand and grabbed your sleeping pants. With a tug, she was inches from your face. \"Just stop struggling and let us play.\" growled before trapping her lips in hers. This emboldened the brunette to advance her touching, snaking her hands between the two bodies and your legs towards your...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Alright, This story's focus is kisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can write other stuff, but remember that the main focus on kissing. You can veer away from the main focus for a while, but do remember to go back to kissing at some point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere's the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) No killing the main character right off the bat. <br>\r\n2.) No scat or farting.<br>\r\n3.)If you're unsure about something, feel free to ask.<br>\r\n4.) I'm being really lenient here, but the amount of chapters that can be spent away from kissing can be 13-15 chapters. There can be exceptions, like if the story is that engaging or you want to have a really long amount of anticipation. Let me know if it is the latter.<br>\r\n5.) The viable target for kisses is the entire body. <br>\r\n6.) If you need to add more options and are stuck at two, I can add two more to a chapter.</td>",
