What will happen next?  Will she simply go home and write about them?  Will she actually meet one (or more) of them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor third-person, you simply tell the story as a witness to it.

Who knows?  Maybe the woman in tweed also stops in there on occasion.  I wonder where she's going to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI see her heading into this tall office building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would like to get to know both ladies.  Which one should I try to meet first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nayle!\"  my wife screams at me.  \"Watch where you're going!  You passed the street you were supposed to turn on, and, now, we will have to go all the way to the end of this street before we're able to find a decent route back to it!  Don't you have any brains in there!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know that how many brains I had mattered as long as I brought home my regular paycheck for you to spend,\" I mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing!  Never mind!\"  I knew right then how starved I was for someone to talk to.  I decided to go to the coffee shoppe around this time tomorrow just in case the people-watching lady were in there.  I really wanted to talk to her--really NEEDED to talk to her. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, I went to the coffee shoppe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, the thought of going there had also made me sexually-aroused, but I concealed my arousal as bast as I could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, I didn't want to cheat.  I was only lonely for someone to talk to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think that, perhaps, sexual arousal and respect go hand-in-hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had long lost respect for my wife, so it was difficult to even stsy focused enough to get through \"doing it\" with her--and that seemed to be okay with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she made barbs about my being a sexual flop to me, it didn't seem to me as if she really cared that much one way or the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould this change if we were really to work on our marriage?  Get counseling, perhaps?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, I was having a little problem here.  I honestly DID want what I shared with this woman to be a platonic sort of thing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how miserable my marriage was, I certainly wasn't going to cheat.  In the first place, it just wasn't right--period!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the second place, even without having yet gotten to talk to this woman, I could tell that she was too sweet to ever be put through being \"the other woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight at the moment, though, I really needed some relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been so long since I'd felt this kind of sexual tension--in fact, I don't know if I ever HAD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheena had been the first and only woman I'd ever slept with--even though she had been with at least two other guys before me--and it had happened for the first time when I'd been drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, I had convinced myself that, since I'd slept with her, she must be the one meant to be my wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to be fine by her at the time, so we became engaged and married right after high school graduation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI drove to an old cemetery about five miles out of town and found a place to park in the oldest section of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take me much time at all to get some initial relief--even though it took two more very earth-shaking sessions before I was able to finally get my urges under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I relieved myself, I was thinking about making love to this woman--should I be thinking those thioughts?  And why was I?  I didn't even know her.  She could be even more nasty than Sheena!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNO WAY!  I could tell just by looking at her that she wasn't at all like my wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew that we would be having some very pleasant converations together--and I also knew that, likely, I would probably need to drive to the cemetery first before meeting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this love at first sight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSHOULD it be with my being married and all?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould I simply begin to give up on ever getting this charade of a marriage to work without even trying to go to counseling?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost importantly, what was it about this woman that elicited such strong emotions within me--not just sexual ones but, also, ones of longing to get to know her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeelings of missing her before even meeting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that my sexual urges had been tamed for the time being, I drove to Borders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As his eyes roved from one person to the next, resting for mere seconds on each before deciding they were not she, he wondered if there was anyone here who, like him, desired to know anyone else in this place.  A few friendly souls sat with other people, speaking animatedly in quiet voices, but most sat quietly with a newspaper or book, eyes down, not wanting to meet the roving eyes of a stranger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to the glass windows he noticed a woman.  She was a small woman; even her oversized blue parka could not hide the fact.  It did not compliment her figure, nor her pale skintone, he noted as his eyes took in the pale color of her neck, and her light hands tinged pink with cold.  His eyes roved lower, taking in the erect way she sat, and the dark jeans which clung tightly to her thin, crossed legs.  Her hair matched her skin; it was that light ashy-gray-brown color that escapes colorful description mostly because it escapes most people's attention.  However, unlike most women, she'd not had her hair colored and it had a certain shine that lured his eye like the distinct sparkle of a diamond as she tilted her head to read the opposite page of a thick book she held against the table with her forearm.  It was not the curious woman he'd felt oddly attracted to yesterday, he knew, but he wondered if he should approach her anyway.      </span></div></div>",
