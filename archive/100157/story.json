            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>         Bill lived in regular city, complete with a regular skyline, behind which a regular suburbs squatted on the outskirts. His neighborhood was normal in most respects, which is why he chose to live there on the corner of St. Augustine and Rye streets. The houses were lined up rather unspectacularly, block after block, street after street as far as the eye could see. People parked their cars in the garages, walked their dogs at dusk, watered their lawns at night and went to sleep in their little beds right after Conan O'Brien. \r<br>\n  \r<br>\n     On the weekends they invited each other over for barbecue, did their yardwork or went to the movies. There was nothing that seemed out of the ordinary about any of their lives, which was exactly why Bill moved in to the house on the corner of St. Augustine and Rye. He had only been living there for a few months when everything began to change. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n     Bill took great pride in his yard and spent most weekends fertilizing or mowing or trimming or mulching so his lawn would always look its best. Sometimes he even declined invitations to barbecues in order to finish pruning or raking or whatever other yardwork he had chosen for himself. One Monday morning after a weekend of yard chores he woke up and started to go about getting ready for work and noticed that it seemed unusually dark in the house,so he went to the bedroom window to look out. Pulling back the curtains a puzzling look pinched up his forehead. Something dark green and grassy was against the outside of the window reaching nearly all the way to the frame.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Huh?\" he said aloud. \" What in suburbia is that?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe looked across the room to the other window and went over and pulled the curtains back. Again, there was something on the outside blocking his view into the yard. Something dark and grassy-looking.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Something is not right.\" he said quickly dressing. He muttered to himself while he was washing his face and brushing his teeth. He stared into the bathroom mirror quizically as if trying to find the answer there, all the while wondering what could possibly be in front of his windows. When he was completely dressed and washed and brushed he went directly to the front door, turned back the deadbolt and pulled it opened. Bill stood still in complete disbelief as he looked out into the yard, his mouth hanging open, eyes wide. The grass in the entire front yard was towering at least 4 feet above his head, waving lightly in the morning breeze. It reached halfway up the side of the house, laying against the windows, swallowed up the sidewalk completely and spilled up onto the porch. The shrubs which used to frame the edges of the house nicely as they marched in a low perfect line from porch to corner had grown to three times their size and produced a thick bramble that tangled with the freshly grown grasses of the yard. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\" Amazing...\" he said slowly, \"What have I been feeding these things?\"\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

He smiled nervously, and walked back into his house, shaking his head in disbelief. <br>\n<br>\n\" I must be dreaming.\" he thought and went back to bed.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n</span></div></div>",

They figured they must not have been paying attention. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\" Bill, you're looking a little haggard. Rough night?\" asked Rusty.

And he could swear that he only cut the grass to perfection last Saturday - as usual. So, what should he do? Hope that it will go away as it had appeared? Phone a garden service? Get the seccateurs out of the shed? Get to the bottom of this transformation first?

It was your standard aluminum shed with a small shelf on one wall that he used to store his various seeds, fertilizers, and other small items. <br>\n<br>\nThe grass in the back was just as tall as in the front and he had to fight his way through it to find the shed, which was all but buried in the thick, choking grass. He slid the door opened and ducked inside, sliding onto the riding mower and firing it up. It roared to life and he put it in gear and lurched out into the yard. Immediately the thick grass became entangled on the blades and choked the engine dead. He started it up and tried again, but each time he would only get a few feet before the engine died in the tangled mat of grass. So Bill went back into the shed (determined to finish the job) and came out with a long curved scythe. With this he began hacking at the grass, knocking it down in clumps with long sweeping strokes. Then he would start the mower up again and go back over the same area. He repeated this pattern all morning long and into the afternoon until finally he had cut all the grass back down to normal height.<br>\n<br>\nSweating and leaning on his rake in the front yard, he looked around him. The sun was just about touching the tops of the trees as it headed toward sunset a few hours away. It was casting a sort of golden glow on the piles of cut grass, and glinting off the shiny plastic of the bags of grass which were piled up all over the yard. His neighbor to the right, Rusty, came over and helped him bag the rest of the grass and stack them carefully by the street for the city to pick up in the morning. Then Rusty brought out a couple of root beers and started asking questions. <br>\n<br>\n\" Ok Bill. How about it? How'd you get your grass to grow so crazy like that?\"  Bill squinted up at him. He had given it some thought during the day while he cut and bagged all that grass. Eighty-seven bags of cut grass. He swiped sweat out of his eyes with the back of a hand.<br>\n<br>\n\" I really don't know.\" Bill said shaking his head. \" I havent done anything different than what I normally do. I water it at the same time every day, fertilize it with the same fertilizer I've always used and mulch it the same way I always have. I haven't changed a thing!\"  <br>\n<br>\nRusty looked at Bill and shrugged his shoulders. \" Go figure.\", he said.<br>\n<br>\n\" Yeah...\" said Bill. \" Go figure.\" They said goodnight and went back in their houses.\n</span></div></div>",

It was like an endless sea of faces out there.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe put his ax down and went toward whoever was talking to him, stumbling a bit as he did it.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What do you suppose is gonna happen when that tree falls?\" One of the women, Kelley said to him.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What do you mean?\" He asked her.  Bill thought that was a rather dumb question.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Well,\" Kelley said with a smile on her face, \"It's so tall.  Who knows where it will land?  It'll crush everything in its path\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nBill hadn't thought about that. </span></div></div>",

Bill notices the roots coming up out of the ground and for a moment thinks that maybe it's killing itself.  The roots are long and about as big around as Bills body.  Now the roots are completely exposed and Bill hears someone in the crowd behind him scream as it stands up, using it's roots as legs.  The rumbling stops, and for a moment the sudden silence is deafening.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe tree shakes itself and dead leaves fall to the ground.  Bill hears Justine giggle as only babies can.  The tree stops shaking and it seems to be looking straight at Him.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"You!\" It seems to bellow as one of it's branches reaches out to point squarely at Bill...\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

I CAME HERE TO SPEAK TO YOU, AND YOURS IS TO ONLY LISTEN AND OBEY.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nBill stood his ground and considered this new development. The tree spoke rather eloquently for a tree. Not that Bill could ever recall having spoken to a tree before, but nonetheless this tree was unbelievably large and rather scary when it was waving its branches about. Not to mention quite imposing when it spoke. Bill didn't care. This tree was ruining the sanctity of his neighborhood and so, like a pesky bit of garden weed it had to be dealt with.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"You'll burn nice and hot in my fireplace this winter.\" Bill said and with new vigor he revved the chainsaw and took off toward the base of the tree, mindful of the hanging overhead branches that swatted at him as he ran under them. He parried with the tree, sawing off branches that got too near as the tree screamed. Bill ducked and blocked, swinging the chainsaw madly in ferocious circles. Finally, the tree managed to grab Bill by the ankle. It jerked Bill into the air updside down and hung him there. Bill reached around with the chainsaw and sliced the offending branch off as the tree howled in pain and anger. Suddenly the chainsaw was wrenched out of his hands by a large limb and flung toward the crowd that was watching from a safe distance. Then before Bill knew it he was completely restrained by the tree and was passed upward branch by branch toward the top of the tree. His struggles to free himself were in vain, so Bill eventually relented.</span></div></div>",

The view was simply amazing. He could look down over the entire neighborhood and see each house and street as if on a game board, with little houses dotting the edges of every street, stretching as far as he could see. Bill's anger quieted and he calmed considerably as he took it all in. Then the tree spoke again.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\" YOU. \" it said. \" YOU HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES AGAINST THE FLOWERING CHILDREN. YOU HAVE WRONGED THE GRASS THAT GROWS. YOU HAVE DEMONSTRATED CONTEMPT AND ANIMOSITY FOR THE STRONG TREES THAT POPULATE OUR WORLD. YOU WILL NOW HAVE TO ANSWER FOR YOUR SELF SERVING BEHAVIOR.\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\nBill was taken aback. \"What did I do?\" he asked. \" What are you talking about?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"YOUR MACHINES THAT SAW AND CUT.

WE CANNOT APPROVE.\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\" Oh come on...We have to live SOMEWHERE. What is this some kind of joke?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nA fierce wind came up through the center of the tree, creating a swirling vortex of leaves and sticks that spun Bill around and had him teetering on the edge of the canopy, looking down. He could barely make out the crowd of neighbors far below, like a five o'clock shadow on the edge of the Upchurch's yard. Emeregency personnel had arrived for the second day in a row and a squad car's tiny blue and red lights were blinking far below. Bill righted himself and reached for  a branch to regain his balance.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Ok. Hang on a minute\" he said sarcastically, \" So is this what this shit is all about? Mother Nature gets her revenge on the stupid people of the earth? You can't be serious.\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\nBill said this in spite of his precarious postion at the top of the talking tree. The tree answered him with another blast of sticks and leaves, this time with an equal portion of pollens and molds. The force of it lifted Bill straight up in the air, spun him around and dropped him on top of the canopy, sneezing and coughing.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"OK! OK! I get it !\" he cried, squinting through burning eyes,\" What do you want me to do.\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"YOU WILL WARN PEOPLE TO STOP WHAT THEY ARE DOING OR FACE THE WRATH OF ALL THE POWER THAT IS IN THE PLANT WORLD.\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\nBill sat down in his crooked branch and wiped the sweat from his forehead and the dust out of his eyes. The pollen had gotten into his sinuses and his eyes were itchy and puffy from the irritation. This whole thing was getting out of hand and it was all just a little too far-fetched, he thought. He wiped at his swollen eyes with the back of a hand and asked the tree, \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\" Are you sure about all this? It seems kind of goofy.....\" The tree shook violently, as if in response, and an apple fell out of thin air and struck Bill on the head. \" Ow!\"\r<br>\nBill said and looked up at the clouds..\"How did that ......?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING, YOU WILL SEE THAT WE MEAN WHAT WE SAY. YOU WILL BE GIVEN NO SECOND CHANCES BILL. MAKE THEM STOP NOW OR YOU WILL SEE THE FULL FORCE OF WHAT YOU EXPERIENCED THE LAST FEW DAYS\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

He carefully creeps past his plastic covered furniture in the immaculately clean living room and hides behind the wall near the kitchen entrance. He takes a deep breath before jumping out, ready to do battle. The large tree that confronted him was stunning to behold. It was more than large. It was thick, almost 15 feet in diameter. Large vines ran down from the canopy of leaves visible through the remnants of his kitchen ceiling. It almost resembled a banyan tree, only there were rather large purple flowers attached to the vines that started from the top of the tree and disappeared into the kitchen floor. \r<br>\nBill stood in utter disbelief for a few minutes. Then a black rage took over him.\r<br>\nHe screamed in anger, thoroughly frustrated and incensed that your nearly perfect home could be wrecked so easily and for absolutely no reason. He grips the bat and swings erratically over and over again. Chunks of tree bark fly this way and that. He notices something thick and red oozing from the dents. Sap, you tell yourself. Only sap doesn't have that metallic scent that blood does. Bill recognizes the scent and stops the battering.</span></div></div>",
