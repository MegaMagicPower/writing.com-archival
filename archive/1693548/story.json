He was a tall man with blond hair and blue eyes probably in his twenties.  Jesse, who pretended to be the flight attendant asked the man what he wanted to drink.<br>\r\n\"Water.\" he replied.  As she slowly walked passed me, I secretly gave her the veil which contained the compound that would make the Russian spy fall asleep.  The plane was already in the air and the man as well as the other passengers on the plane just got their drinks.  He took a sip of his water and then set it down.  It wasn't long before he closed his eyes and fell asleep.  I casually walked over and tapped his shoulder to see if he was awake or not.  The compound worked, he was asleep.  With a nod of my head, Jesse went to the back and got the case so that we could extract the information from the Russian spy.<br>\r\n\"We don't have much time.  Jesse, Mark, Isaac, Tristan, and Lucy keep watch; the rest of you are with me.\" I told everyone.  Henry, who was the architect, got the Russian spy ready as everyone else going under with him was.  By the time Henry was ready, we all prepared ourselves to be sedated.  I gave Isaac the signal and with the push of a button, we were inside the Russian's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bright, beautiful afternoon in Washington D.C.  The spy was in plain site walking out of a hotel waving down a taxi.  I was with Henry and Wendy, who was the forger, in a BMW, while Simon, the point man, and Carl, the man who gave us this assignment were in the taxi that was to pick up the Russian spy.  They picked him up right on time as we observed from a distance.  The taxi made a wide U turn and speed away to an ally way that we met up with them and switched cars.  Henry made sure that their would be a truck in the ally way so that could take the spy out of the car.  His head was bagged so that he wouldn't see who his kidnappers were.  I didn't matter either way considering that he had no choice but to kill him.  Before setting him into the car, we the pistol that was in the driver side of the truck.  As I was getting ready to fire, we were shot at from a distance.  We didn't know who was shooting but we took no chances and shoved the spy into the car and drove off.  I was tried to make a hasty retreat, the shooter kept shooting at us.  He broke on of the windows but didn't injury or even kill anyone.<br>\r\n\"We need to break out the kit and go down to the next level!\" I yelled at Henry who picked it up from the floor.  He passed me the wire and I quickly wrapped it around my wrist.  <br>\r\n\"When your ready for the kick, place the headphones on Simon.\" I told Carl who was driving like a maniac escaping from the shooters.<br>\r\n\"Carl!\" and with that he pushed the button and we were down into the second level of the dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
