I'm afraid I don't have the whole map but take this piece of it along with this rune crystal. There's one thing you must know about the beasts and Zuna. The beasts can never be killed for they are protected by Zuna's dark magic. If you slay Zuna she will only reincarnate herself into a much more powerful form with each successive death. The only way to stop the curse is to trap Zuna in the Rosen Medallion. Only the Medallion can stop her for good for she'll be forced to wander for all eternity in the land of torment. I wish you well my friend for you will have a perilous journey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah then leaves the Church to find the next piece of the map to the Rosen Medallion.

We tried killing them but their wounds heal in a matter of seconds. What's worse is that my friends have transformed into these very beasts before my eyes. I don't know how much longer I can retain my humanity. Aah!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man then transforms into a beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foolish girl, there is no way that you'll defeat Mistress Zuna. For the age has come when she should take her rightful place as ruler of all. Prepare to submit to her majesty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast attacks Sarah. Sarah outsmarts the beast by using her sword to cut down a beehive. The angry bees start stinging the beast. Knowing that there is no way to kill the beasts or Zuna without dire consequences. When Sarah enters the town she notices that the town is empty. She then checks for survivors. She then notices that the water barrel that was by one of the houses a second ago has moved. Sarah then tips over the barrel only for a young man wearing a robe to fall out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the big idea!

They were more like a mix between werewolves and demons. Their leader was a blood red by what I call a Zurn. He lead his fellow Zurns to attack the town I hid in a water barrel to avoid death by it seems I was lucky to survive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your act of cowardice might have potentially made you a useful ally against Zuna. Will you swear to take up arms and serve your country.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure if that witch is going to destroy towns and cities then you can count me in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good we need to find the Rosen Medallion so we can return innocent people back into humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait those things were once human?!

When Sarah and her friend arrived at Sunvalacity she noticed a woman about her age dressed in priestly robes. She was none other than the priestess of Sunvalacity working to serve the Lord when the darkest hour arrived. For the sun eclipsed every few days and the rise of Zuna could mean doom to the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Praise be unto the Lord. He sent two heros to rescue us from our burden.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon me holy Mother but what are you speaking about?\" asked Nicholas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Mother Daphne carrier of the map piece that leads to the Rosen Medallion. The Lord has sent you on a quest to save the land from wickedness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Princess Sarah Rose and this is Nicholas Sparks. Tell us Mother Daphne what is troubling this fair city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every few days the sun eclipses and the people outside go into madness. Yet they do not return after the event. I know that they're alive but the Zurns must have bitten them. I pray that I do not join the ranks of the slaves of Zuna for only wickedness lies in her soul.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This looks like one mystery that we'll have to solve.\" said Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother Daphne how long has this been occurring?\" asked Nicholas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well we shall what caused this.\" said Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guide you to the library. There you should find some useful information on what you'll need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Every 100 years a creature known as a Laloopon causes the people to go mad. The Laloopon is said to feed off of this madness. Once the victim is drained they turn into statues. The statues then become Laloopons after seven months.\" said Nicholas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me get this straight. You're saying that these Laloopons feed off of insanity to procreate more Laloopons?\" questioned Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" replied NIcholas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they're similar to Zurns except they stone beasts.\" said Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly, but the stone beast part is correct.
