Don't worry, your vision is still calibrating.\" a voice answered.<br>\r\n\"Calibrating?\"<br>\r\n\"You'll see soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Artemis's vision cleared. He was in what looked like a hi-tech hospital room. He was lying on some sort of metal bench. As he sat up, he noticed he was wearing a black suit. A man wearing a lab coat, who had been standing next to the far wall walked over and addressed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how do you feel, Artemis?\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"Pretty good. And how do you know my name?\" Artemis replied, slightly suspicious.<br>\r\n\"Well, you probably don't remember this, but a few days ago you were dying from a seemingly incurable illness. We approached your family and offered to transfer your mind into an android body, thus saving your life. Your parents were desparate to help you and agreed without hesitation. Thus, here we are.\"<br>\r\n\"You're right, I don't remember.\"<br>\r\n\"You should be recalling all of your memories any second. They hadn't finished sorting themselves before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he said that, Artemis gasped as memories flooded in. He remembered it all! Being diagnosed with the illness, the weeks in hospital, the unsuccessful cures, everything. Once the tidal wave of memories was over, he looked at the man with shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true. All of it.\" The man nodded.<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Whoa. So, who are you?\" Artemis asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, how rude, I haven't introduced myself properly. My name is Dr D'Arc. I work in the Research and Development division of United Interventions, an organisation that reports directly to the UN. I'm sure you've at least heard of us.\" he replied. Artemis nodded. He watched the news regularly and had heard of this group, that was called on by the UN to intervene in various conflicts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what happens now?\" Artemis asked. D'Arc held up a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patience, you'll learn everything else soon. In the meantime, there's someone who wants to see you, they should be here any second. I'll step out and give you two some privacy.\" he replied, walking through the door, which slid open and then slid closed. Artemis sat back and waited, wondering who it could be. After a few minutes, he was jolted from his thoughts by the door opening and closing again. Looking up, Artemis saw something that filled his heart, or whatever he had now, with joy. Standing there was a girl wearing a similar outfit to his, with long black hair and emerald eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serene!\" he exclaimed. The two friends rushed towards each other, meeting in a warm hug. After they released each other, Artemis grinned. \"What are you doing here?\" Serene giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in the same boat as you, Artemis.\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so you were...\" he trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I had the same illness you had, but obviously neither of us was told about the other.\" she replied, solemnly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess they didn't want us to get depressed about it.\" he suggested. They chatted for a few minutes, when Dr D'Arc re-entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now that we're all reaquainted, come with me, and I'll explain the situation to you.\" he told them. The group then left the room and headed down a hallway. At some point Serene had intertwined her right with Artemis' left and wouldn't let go, causing Artemis to blush. The three arrived at another door, which slid aside to reveal a room with a consol and a large screen on one wall, with two pods on the opposite wall, each with a small screen and keypad. D'Arc sat down infront of the consol and pressed a button. The screen illuminated, showing a logo which cosisted of a shield with a globe on it, the letters UI beneath. The doctor then addressed the two behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, I'll explain what the situation is like. UI is an organisation that was established to end conflicts through armed intervention. We have been successful thus far thanks to our advanced technology. However...\" he told them, pressing a key, which brought up several grainy images of what appeared to be robots. \"Recently, armed forces in various combat zones have begun reporting encounters with what they described as armed combat drones. Even our forces have barely been able to deal with a few at any one time. That's where your new bodies come in. Your arms are equipped with what we call the BLADE weapons system. The system allows your arms to reconfigure themselves into various weapons, meaning that you effectively have the firepower of a small army.\" he told them. Artemis and Serene looked at each other, then back at D'Arc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you basically designed our bodies as weapons to try and stop these drones and whoever's making them, right?\" Artemis asked. D'Arc nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, however, the decision is up to you. Your parents said the same thing, they'll support you whatever you choose to do.\" he replied. The two friends looked at each other, determination in their eyes, then they faced D'Arc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, we'll help.\" they told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" he asked. They nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, now we can really help people.\" replied Artemis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it was thanks to you that we're still alive, so we do owe you a lot.\" said Serene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic! Now, it's quite late. So, tomorrow you'll both be given extensive training to get used to fighting in your new bodies, and then I'll go over your blueprints with you and show you how to engage your HUD and use the various other systems that you have. Now, let me show you where you'll be staying while you're with us.\" he replied.</span></div></div>",

He explained to them that although they no longer needed to \"sleep\", their bodies did need to shut down for a period to conserve power and to run diagnostics. He then excused himself and told them that he would be back at around 9:00 am the next day to show them around. Artemis was admiring the room, when he heard a slight rustling. Turning around, he was surprised to see Serene had already made herself comfortable in the bed. After removing his own suit, Artemis climbed in as well. Serene immediately sidled over and wrapped her arms around him. Artemis was startled when he felt her bare skin against his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Serene?! What are you-\" he asked, shocked, before she silenced him with a kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Did you honestly think I was going to sleep in a suit?\" she asked, giggling. \"Anyway, I've dreamed about this for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have?\" Artemis asked, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. At first I couldn't work out why, but...I think I've always had feelings for you, I was just afraid you wouldn't feel the same and it would ruin our friendship.\" She sobbed, tears starting to run down her face. Artemis put his arms around her, causing her to look up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serene, please. I hate having to see you cry.\" he told her, wiping away her tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how would you feel about...us?\" she asked, hopeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this answer your question?\" he asked, before capturing her lips with his own. Serene, melted into his embrace, her tongue brushing against his lips, requesting entry. Artemis complied, their tongues meeting. They both pulled each other closer as their tongues danced, as if neither could taste the other enough to be satisfied. Finally, after about 30 seconds, they broke apart, a blush on both of their faces, as Artemis caressed Serene's soft skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you are such a good kisser.\" Serene whispered, her lips still tingling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too.\" Artemis replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you really do love me?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wasn't the kiss enough? Or do I have to say it?\" he asked, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it was, but say it anyway.\" she pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Serene, I love you.\" Artemis replied, kissing Serene again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too Artemis.\" she replied, as they drifted off in each other's embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was about 8:00 am, with the sun streaming through the window. Artemis' eyes slowly opened, his vision de-pixalating. He then noticed a source of warmth next to him. Looking down, Artemis was surprised to see Serene, her arms around him, her head resting on his chest with. He smiled as he remembered their mutual confessions the previous night. He started absentmindedly stroking her silky black hair, at which she moved slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, feels good.\" Serene mumbled, her eyes opening slowly. Artemis chuckled, as they adjusted to the warming sensation of waking up together. Smiling, he gently kissed Serene on the lips, a short, meaningful kiss compared to their passion-filled kiss from last night. Serene kissed him back, then pulled away and stretched, her lean body arching. Artemis couldn't help but stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this angel I see before me?\" he asked. Serene giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you!\" she replied, playfully, as she climbed out of the bed and got dressed. Artemis then proceeded to do the same. Not much later, there was a knock at the door, which then slid open to reveal D'Arc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see we're all well rested. Well, shall we?\" he asked. Artemis and Serene nodded, following him out and along the corridor. Again Serene was hanging off Artemis' arm, but this time he just smiled. After passing a few doors, they arrived in the same room from the day before. This time however, the monitor was already on, and was displaying what looked like blueprints. The odd thing was that they were human-shaped, one obviously male and the other female. D'Arc then faced the two. \"Now then, before we begin your training, I thought you might like to get an idea of how your android bodies work. Apart from gender-specific differences, you are pretty much the same underneath.\" he told them. \"Your skin is a bio-metallic titanium aluminide alloy which is approximately 1000 times stronger than steel, whilst being able to stretch quite easily. Your skeleton is far more remarkable however. It is made from the same alloy as your skin, but has a diamond-type structure, meaning that it can withstand roughly 100,000 tons of force and temperatures up to 2,000,000 \u00b0C.\" he finished, leaving Artemis and Serene speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah.\" was all Artemis could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is quite impressive, isn't it. Moving on.\" D'Arc continued. \"The power that your bodies run on comes courtesy of a small nuclear fusion reactor. While they haven't been successful in large scale just yet, at this size they work quite well. However, the big difference is in what fuel they use. Most testing has been done with hydrogen, but the problem is that it makes up so little of the atmosphere that it wouldn't be effective. Instead, your reactors run on nitrogen, which you inhale just as humans inhale oxygen. This actually helped us. Because nuclear fusion of nitrogen requires a temperature of at least 100 million degrees Celcius to maintain the reaction, the reactors produce more than enough energy to power your bodies, roughly 10 gigawatts every second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always enjoyed physics, but I still can't believe that all this is inside us.\" Artemis replied. Serene nodded. D'Arc laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not surprised. I'm still amazed at what science can accomplish these days. Now then, on to your systems. Because your bodies have access to so much energy, it meant that we were able to give you incredible strength. At maximum output, your servo-motors can exert up to 500 meganewtons of force. As a result of this, you can lift up to 50,000 tons and run at up to 200 mph. You also have an internal radar, which is able to detect even stealth aircraft up to 200 miles away. You can see clearly at about 10 miles in good conditions, and you can see in infrared, ultraviolet and X-Rays. And that about covers it.\" he concluded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to say I'm amazed at everything you've told us, I just can't wait to try everything out.\" said Serene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, let's not keep you waiting. Follow me.\" D'Arc replied, leading them out of the room.</span></div></div>",

Both of them looked at D'Arc, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" Artemis asked. D'Arc laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you'd ask. This is is our training area, which we can use to simulate various combat scenarios. The reason it looks like a town is because most of the time, our soldiers have to street fight during an intervention.\" he explained. \"Now then, lets get started, shall we? Artemis, you're up first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Artemis replied, stepping forward. D'Arc then explained how to activate his HUD, which he did so. Immediately his vision was filled with a Head Up Display, or HUD (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2010/241/c/a/halo_prototype_hud___blue_by_entereri-d2ux0xc.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2010/2...</a>). \"Okay, what next?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Activate the Assault Rifle, we'll start off small for now.\" D'Arc replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Artemis agreed, Tthen did as D'Arc had told him. Artemis watched in astonishment as the sleeve and skin of his right forearm retracted all the way to his elbow. Then, various components began extending and linking together, to form a mean-looking gun (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://vanquish.wikia.com/wiki/File:Vanquish_weaponmax_001.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://vanquish.wikia.com/wiki/File:Vanq...</a>). When this was finished, a sight appeared in the middle of his HUD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Awesome!\" exclaimed Artemis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the Assault Rifle, the most versatile BLADE configuration.\" D'Arc explained. \"It fires 7.62 mm rounds at around 1000 rounds per minute. All the rounds are depleted uranium, meaning that they can penetrate even tank armour. All right, let's put you up against some combat drones to start off. Remember, as far as we know, no existing weaponary can harm you, so try to ignore any incoming fire and focus on accuracy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it.\" Artemis replied, readying his weapon, stabilising it with his other arm. Then, five armoured robots charged at hims from one of the buildings, guns blazing. Artemis ignored the rounds pinging off his body, opening fire on the lead. The rifle spat out a hail of DU rounds, tearing through the robot, which fell down sparking. Artemis quickly destroyed the remaining four with a few short bursts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice shooting, Artemis!\" shouted Serene. D'Arc clapped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like he's a natural.\" he commented. \"Let's move on to your other weapons now.\" For the next hour, D'Arc had Artemis try out all the different weapons he could use. There was the Heavy Machine Gun (HMG), which fired .50 cal DU rounds at 3000 rounds per minute, the Shotgun (SG), 12 guage, 300 rounds per minute, the Sniper Rifle (SR), 7.92 mm DU, 30 rounds per minute with a margin of error of just a centimetre at ten miles. There were also two launchers. The Rocket Launcher (RL), firing 100 mm guided rockets at 10 rockets per minute, and the Disk Launcher (DL), which could fire carbon-nanotube cutting disks at 20 disks per minute. The Disk Launcher could also function as a circular saw for cases like blast doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was Serene's turn. She had all the weapons that Artemis had, but while Artemis was best with the AR, HMG, SG, RL, and DL, Serene found she was best with the Sniper Rifle, preferring its surgical precision to the other weapons' brute force. When it came to the Disk Launcher, Artemis was more likely to get up close and cut the drones in half, whereas Serene tended to fire the disks at a distance.</span></div></div>",

Based on his control of the country in the past, the UN has decided to have us aid the rebels in their fight. The plan is to first clear out the Libyan Army's two main bases, then head for the capital, to capture Gaddafi, so that he may face a tribunal for his past crimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've heard of him, I'm more than happy to help. But why are you sending just us?\" Artemis asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, this is the people's fight. We are simply trying to make the revolution swift and minimise civilian casualties.\" D'Arc replied. \" Moving on. To ensure that the bases are cleared before the army mobilises, you'll be flown there in this marvel, the R-505U Stratojet.\" he announced, indicating the jet behind them. \"It can supercruise at Mach 5, so the flight shouldn't take too long. And he will be the pilot.\" At this, the man in the flight suit stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, name's Graham Acker, but my callsign's Gryphus 1.

By the time he destroyed them all, he was close to impact. He instinctively curled up, before slamming into the ground in the middle of the base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, Artemis spotted a group of soldiers approaching fast.

This is Artemis.\" he said. Soon he got a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Gryphus One here, what's the SITREP for your target?\"</i> came the reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All targets eliminated. Any further orders?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Head about two miles north of your position. That's where Serene's target was, but she hasn't replied yet.\"</i> he replied. Artemis frwoned, before running off at full speed, heading north. After a few minutes, he spotted the other base on the horizon. Slowing down outside the base to a more human speed, he could see Serene, kneeling on the ground, surrounded by bodies, clutching herself and shaking. As Artemis walked over, her sobbing became obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serene?\" he asked. No response. He knelt down beside her, putting a hand on her shoulder. \"Serene, what's wrong?\" Suddenly, she turned around and clutched at the front of his shirt, crying into his chest. Artemis embraced her in a warm hug, until Serene's crying died down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Artemis, I...I...\" she sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...I'm a monster.\" she cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you're not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, I killed all these people, and I enjoyed it!\" she yelled, her crying intensifying. Artemiskissed her softly on the head, at which she looked up at him, her eyes full of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't make you a monster. We're doing this to help people. And yes, we will have to kill. But that doesn't mean we're monsters.\" he told her, before he kissed her on the lips, at which her crying ceased, as she melted into him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After he had calmed Serene down, Artemis decided that she should stay behind while he moved to capture Gaddafi, seeing as she was probably too emotionally fragile at the moment. After Serene agreed to wait, Artemis sprinted off towards Gaddafi's location, the Libyan Army HQ, at full speed. An hour later, he arrived at the outer wall of the HQ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gryphus One, this is Artemis. Do you copy?\" he radioed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Gryphus One here, what's the SITREP?\" </i>Graham replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm outside the Libyan Army HQ, any further orders?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The target is most likely in the main control room, located beneath the main base. Recommend you take out any sentries with the SR, then breach the main building and find a way into that control room, over.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roger, moving in.\" Artemis replied. He found a spot where he could see the guard towers, which thankfully had only one sentry per tower. Switching to the Sniper Rifle (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://vanquish.wikia.com/wiki/File:Sniper.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://vanquish.wikia.com/wiki/File:Snip...</a>), Artemis proceeded to eliminate the soldiers, one by one. The rifle's precision accuracy allowed him to kill each one almost instantly, and the silencer meant that the gunshots were only audible to him. Having taken care of the sentries, Artemis swapped the rifle for him usual arm, before leaping over the wall, and dashing over to the main building. Onec inside, Artemis brought up a 3-D map of the compund on his HUD, locating the main control room  in no time. Satisfied, he began making his way through the building, taking out any personelle he encountered with a burst from the AR-S (Assault Rifle-Silenced). After a few tense minutes, Artemis found the door to the control room. A look with infra-red confirmed that Gaddafi was inside, along with four soldiers and three operators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gryphus One, I'm in psition to breach, just say when.\" he radioed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Roger that, Artemis. A UI Special Forces team is en route to take custody of the target, ETA five minutes. Secure the target without injury. You're clear to breach.\"</i> came the reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roger.\" Artemis replied, closing the link. Readying his AR-S, he kicked the thick armoured door down, bursting into the room. Inside, Gaddafi immediately moved away, as the soldiers fired, fearing this person that had kicked his way through an armoured door. Artemis dispatched them and the controllers swiftly, before turning his attention to Gaddafi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0646\u062a\u061f(Who are you?)\" Gaddafi demanded, surprisingly calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u0627\u0644\u0634\u062e\u0635 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0633\u0648\u0641 \u062a\u062c\u0644\u0628 \u0644\u0643 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u062f\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0627 \u0642\u0645\u062a\u0645 \u0628\u0647 \u0641\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0644\u062f \u0648\u0634\u0639\u0628\u0647.(The one who will bring you to justice for what you have done to this country and its people.)\" Artemis replied.

Gaddafi nodded, as Artemis awaited the UI Special Forces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Artemis was back at the UI Headquarters, watching the news on the Libyan conflict, with Serene cuddling him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"We now bring you breaking news. Yesterday, United Interventions forces took custody of Libyan Leader, Muammar Muhammad al-Gaddafi. Gaddafi went without protest, ordering his troops throughout the region to stand down. He has agreed to establish a democratic government, and voting is scheduled to take place in two months time.\"</i> announced the newsreader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you managed to end civil war all by yourself\" Serene said seductively, running a finger across Artemis' chest. Artemis responed by kissing her on the lips again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you helped out too, remember.\" he reminded her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still can't accept...that I had to kill those people.\" Serene sobbed, a few tears running down her face, which Artemis brushed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serene, you're effectively a soldier now, and soldiers have to kill. I know it's hard to accept, but just remember we only kill to help others.\" Artemis told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. I'll try to remember that. Now, where were we?\" Serene asked, winking suggestively.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two days later, D'Arc called the two into the hanger again, where he and Graham where waiting next to the Stratojet. He explained that a group of terrorists had seized control of a school in the eastern USA. They had demanded $5 million by the following day, or the children would be killed one by one. As yet, no one knew who they were or where they were from. The US government had decided to pretend to go along with the demands, allowing Artemis to infiltrate the school and eliminate the terrorists. Because of the threat to the children, Artemis was given a new weapon mode for his BLADE system; a triple-barrel .45 calibre pistol (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://snaplat.deviantart.com/art/Tripleshot-Revolver-147325350\" target=\"_blank\">http://snaplat.deviantart.com/art/Triple...</a>) to limit the amount of danger to the hostages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, he was just outside the school gates. The police had been ordered to move back whilest Artemis dealt with the terrorists. After leaping over the wall, Artemis scanned the area to formulate a plan. His scan showed the children were all gathered in the auditorium, with just three terrorists guarding them. There were five others terrorists roaming the grounds to keep outsiders at bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hmm, I'll take out the sentries first, so they don't notice anything, then I'll get rid of the three guarding the kids.\"</i> Artemis decided, switching to the AR-S. Slowly making his way around one of the classrooms, he spotted two of the terrorists talking, both had their backs to him. Artemis rolled out from behind the building, dispatching each terrorist before they could cry out. The two men slumped to the ground, as Artemis continued his progress. The other sentries were dealt with quickly, as Artemis neared the auditorium. As he paused outside the doors, he could hear the leader on a cellphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm glad we have been able to come to terms, Mr President. Deliver the money as agreed, and the children will be fine.\" </i>he said, cutting the line <i>\"Hah, fool. We'll get our money, then kill them anyway. Make sure our escape route is secure. We'll take one of them with us as...insurance.\"</i> Artemis decided to go for it. A quick thermal scan showed the three men were at the front of the auditorium, which was just inside the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This'll have to be quick.\"</i> he thought, switching from the AR-S to the TB-P (Tri Barrel Pistol). Artemis burst through the doors, drawing the attention of everyone inside. With two quick shots, the two terrorists went down in no time, leaving the leader, armed only with a pistol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?!\" he exclaimed, firing at Artemis. Artemis continued to approach, the terrorist's bullets bouncing off his metal skin. The terrorist quickly ran out of ammo, after which Artemis grabbed him by the throat, slamming him up against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?!\" he demanded, but the terrorist held his tongue, refusing to say anything. Grunting with annoyance, Artemis dropped him, turning to leave, as the police could be heard approaching the building. The terrorist however, was still defiant. Pulling out his knife, he grabbed a young girl from the group of children, holding the knife to her throat. Artemis spun around upon hearing the girl's scream, aiming his TB-P at the terrorist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, shoot. If you do, she dies.\" the terrorist threatened, his face showing signs of desparation. Artemis slowly put his arm down. The terrorist then made a fatal mistake; he dropped him guard. Artemis whipped his arm back up, and fired. The terrorist fell to the ground, the knife dropping from his grip. The girl stared in shock, as Artemis put his gun away and knelt beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you all right?\" he asked, kindly. The girl nodded, still in shock. Artemis smiled. \"Good. Well, take care.\" he said, turning to leave. As he did, the girl called out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mister.\" she said. Artemis turned back. \"Thank you.\" she told him, smiling slightly. Artemis nodded, before exiting the building, just as the police arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The terrorist situation at a school in the eastern United States has been resolved with no civilian casualties, thanks to the aid of United Interventions. However, eyewitnesses reported that the terrorists were killed by what appeared to be an 19 year old boy, who sources say transformed his right arm into some sort of gun. Is United Interventions really the good organisation it claims to be? If so, what is the explanation for this person and his connection to them?\"</i> the newsreader asked, before Artemis switched off the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew I should've used the Sniper Rifle and killed them from a distance, then this wouldn't have happened.\" Artemis sighed. Serene looked at her love, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I'm sure D'Arc and the rest of UI have a plan for this. You, on the other hand, need to relax.\" she assured him. Artemis smiled, kissing Serene again. </span></div></div>",

When they got there, a worried D'Arc stood with an equally worried Graham next to the Stratojet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the emergency?\" Artemis asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Well, approximately two hours ago, our forces stationed in Libya reported another sighting of an armed combat drone in the area. Since then there's been no word from them. You're to head there immediately and hopefully destroy whatever is there.\" D'Arc explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it.\" Artemis replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, the two androids landed near the UI soldiers' last known location. When they reached the area, they were shocked to find every single UI soldier dead. Suddenly, Artemis and Serene were forced to dodge as what appeared to be laser blasts narrowly missed them. Turning around, the saw a large robot, heavily armoured and equipped with large guns (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://shiningcin.deviantart.com/art/Sandwolf-Pose-57313619?q=favby%3Aanzac-a1%2F44650500&amp;qo=5\" target=\"_blank\">http://shiningcin.deviantart.com/art/San...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serene, let's go!\" Artemis shouted, switching to his Heavy Machine Gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" she replied, readying her Assault rifle. They opened fire simultaneously. To their horror, the DU rounds glaced off the drone's armour, not even scratching it. Then, the drone fired its laser cannons. Artemis managed to evade them, but Serene was struck in her left leg. She fell to the ground, her leg sparking. The laser had torn through her metallic skin and severely damaged the main structure underneath. The drone advanced on her, aiming its guns again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Artemis cried, dashing towards the drone. He slammed his fist into its chest, throwing the drone onto its back twenty metres away. Artemis switched to the Disk Launcher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay away from her!\" he shouted, firing a volley of disks. The drone got to its feet, ignoring the disks as they bounced off its thick armour. Artemis narrowed his eyes, switching to his Rocket Launcher. Serene realised what he was planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Artemis, don't!\" she cried, as he charged forward. The drone fired its laser cannons again. Artemis continued forward, ignoring the lasers cutting into his body. Then, he placed the muzzle of the launcher against the drone's chest once he got up close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye.\" he said. He fired two rockets, which tore through the drone's chest, exiting through its back. However, before Artemis could back away, his snsors detected a small self-destruct device in the drone. Artemis was about to move, when the device detonated. A massive wave of heat and energy tore through his body, ripping of metallic skin and more. Artemis barely registered the pain, before his body shut down completely. Serene watched in horror, before the EMP that had knocked out Artemis shut her down as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Artemis...\"</i> she thought, before her vision went dark.</span></div></div>",

He helped Serene stand, as her leg had only just been fixed, and led her into another lab. Serene gasped and covered her mouth, tears running down her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArtemis lay on a metal bench in the centre of the room. A large portion of his face on the left side was missing, revealing the machinery beneath. His left forearm was gone, along with his entire right arm. In addition, everything below his waist had been destroyed, exposing his robotic spine and lower torso. Wires, cables and tubes were connected to his empty right arm socket, as well as the base of his spine and torso. His remaining eye was closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Artemis...\" Serene sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks bad, I know. We've managed to stabilise him, but he's in a very fragile state.

They were both in the same boat, and they had to learn how to make it float.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we have to get used to using this blade system because that is what we are all about now,\" said Artemis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but all work and no play can make Serene a angry babe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm willing to play but after we get this blade down pat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them practiced changing their arms into lethal weapons<br>\r\nuntil they understood how to work them and they timed themselves<br>\r\nand took a brief moment to change the weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now can we get to know each other's body, I will examine yours and you mine that way we can know how they work properly. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a great Idea,\" replied Selene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey took advantage of having some privacy and they looked deep into each others eyes, and then Artemis took Selene in his arms and began kissing her deeply.  She enjoyed the moment.<br>\r\nHe began stroking her body until ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door flew open and in came Dr. D'arc You two are not supposed to be this friendly with one another we have a battle to fight and we need you ready not side tracked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This story is based around two teens, Artemis and Serene, who are brought back to life following terminal illness as androids by an organisation called United Interventions. They are informed that they are now capable of engaging small armies, thanks to various attachable weapons. As they go through their new lives, they discover feelings for each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Artemis</u><br>\r\n18 years old, short black hair, royal blue eyes. Thin build, even as an android. Still wears the glasses he wore as a human, as a memento. Friends with Serene since childhood. Often shy, he is ruthless in battle. His arms are each equipped with the BLADE (<b>B</b>attlefield <b>L</b>ogic <b>AD</b>aptable <b>E</b>lectronic) weapons system, which allows his arms to reconfigure into various weapons, Weapons: Assault Rifle, Heavy Machine Gun, Shotgun, Sniper Rifle, Rocket/Missile Launcher, and Disk Launcher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Serene</u><br>\r\nSame age as Artemis, shoulder length black hair, emerald green eyes. Very caring towards people, especially Artemis. Equipped with the BLADE system in each arm, with same weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Rules</u><br>\r\n1.Use decent grammar. Poor grammar will be corrected/deleted.<br>\r\n2.If you include sex, don't be super descriptive (yes, they CAN have sex, their android bodies were created to be as human as possible).<br>\r\n3.Try to develop the relationship between Artemis and Serene properly eg.dating, compassion, romance, you get the picture.<br>\r\n4.Try not to have too much gore, you know, not too descriptive.<br>\r\n5.Try to make fight scenes entertaining.<br>\r\n6.All #1 options in the first pathway are for me only to add to (i.e. 1,1,1,1 etc).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you understand, have fun and write well!!!</td>",
