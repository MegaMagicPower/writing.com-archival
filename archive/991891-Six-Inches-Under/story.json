My mother would have loved everything you're doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the meeting was over, the Fishers were escorting the bereaved woman to the door, when all of a sudden she stopped and reached into her purse. \"Oh, I almost forgot. Could you please make sure she's buried in this?\" She held up necklace, a chain with a worn silver coin dangling from the end. \"She always said she wanted to take this to the grave with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly,\" said David, holding out his hand for it. \"It's very beautiful. I'm sure it looks lovely on her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman shrugged, drying her tears. \"I wouldn't know. She never wore it, and none of us kids were ever allowed to touch it. But she was always saying she wanted to be buried with it. It's even in her will.\" When David took the necklace, he felt a tingle run up his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody seemed to know what to say for a moment, and there was a long pause. David seemed particularly distracted, and Nate said, \"Well! We'll make sure this gets where it belongs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" said the woman, walking out the front door into the Los Angeles sun.</span></div></div>",

He had no idea what was going through the giant's head as he was pressed into the giant chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing he knew, he was sprawled face-down on the sheets once again, with an enormous presence hovering over him, and enormous hand holding him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keith!\" David began to struggle. Suddenly, the hand holding him down was gone, but it was replaced by something else . . . something long and thick and heavy and almost the size of his entire body. He squirmed under it, feeling the weight of Keith's cock, the power of the body behind it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, David, you look so hot like that, under my cock. I wish I could stick it up inside you again,\" the giant chuckled. The tiny man, who really had no idea what was going on and was in no way comfortable with what was happening, struggled all the more upon hearing this, afraid that Keith would cram his manhood up inside him as much as he could and use him like a bloody condom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keith, please, you've got to help me!\" David screamed.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, the dizziness increased so much he felt as if he was falling. Something obscured his vision.

Pinching Nate's arm, David was easily able to peel him off the floor. Together, they watched the little man's flattened legs slowly reform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was simply speehless. \"Uh, Nate, that's--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm TINY and I'm SILLY PUTTY!\" Nate bawled. \"WHY THE FUCK IS THIS HAPPENING TO ME!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid brought Nate closer to see him better. \"I actually don't know what happened. I told you that we shouldn't play around with that thing before we know how to control it. ANYTHING could happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate was having none of it. \"You fucking, prissy fuck. Don't you fucking give me a lecture! You're the one who keeps doing this stuff to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnconsciously, David closed his hand tighter around Nate, leaving deep impressions on his springy body. \"I've had just about enough of your language and your ingratitude,\" he said sternly. He saw a look of fear in Nate's eyes as he stretched the tiny body out to twice its proportional length. Then, he tied it in a knot around his muscular wrist, transforming his brother into a living bracelet. \"Now I'm going to take you and that necklace home, and we'll see what we can do to fix you. But I warn you, one more outburst, and I'll throw you out into the street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate was in no condition to argue. His body was wrapped, ass-down on his younger brother's wrist. From where his head was, he could just barely see his cock dangling free, but his arms and legs were stretched and tied tightly behind his body. He saw David looking at him as if he were a wristwatch and shot him a murderous look. David's full lips smirked slightly as he lowered his arm to his side.</span></div></div>",

But that didn't stop him from screaming to vent his frustration, and screaming even louder when he felt a tremendous pressure from outside the pants. Something was squeezing him, nudging him, pressing him further into the massive flesh. He felt himself being positioned by the giant's hand and tried to fight it with every ounce of his strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept yelling, realizing that his screams where the only thing he could hear. He didn't hear David prostesting his treatment. Maybe he liked it, that faggot, Nate thought nastily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, his face arrived in a very humid, musky place. He couldn't see, but from the hairy tendrils tickling him and the feeling of giant wrinkled skin against him, he had the horrifying feeling he knew exactly where he was.

To each other, they were still normal and the world around them had suddenly gone crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColin, meanwhile, was getting stimulated by the feel of their bodies on his body. He recognized David and knew he was also gay but had never met Nate. While the hot cop was enormously interested in what had happened to these guys and was normally a very helpful and considerate person, the do-gooder in him was for some reason not quite as engaged by two little men who didn't quite register as people rather than strange little animals. And they WERE turning him on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he decided to hold off on the questions for a bit. With a subtle turn on his thigh, he knocked the tiny brothers off balance enough for them to slide between his legs. David found himself pressed against Colin's giant polyester-encased monster, which was suddenly stirring under his weight. \"Oh my god, is this real?\" wondered David, who had not only had always been a size queen but had also always been attracted to Colin.</span></div></div>",

But if not there, wondered David, then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got the answer as Colin leaned forward and pulled out the back of his pants and boxer briefs with his free hand. David and Nate got an unwelcome view of the top of the guy's round ass as it loomed closer. Then suddenly, they were pressed against its hot flesh. A musky smell filled their noses as the light vanished. David and Nate were tangled up in each other's bodies and pressed together by the underwear and polyester pants. When Colin leaned lightly back in his seat, this quadrupled the pressure on them. The little brother, pressed face to face and cock to cock, were crammed into the giant's ass crack as they heard him pick up the radio and call in sick for the rest of the day. </span></div></div>",
