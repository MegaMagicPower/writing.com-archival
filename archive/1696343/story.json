There inside the place she was looking at a vast collection of colourful ribbons that got her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, maybe I should pick this red one, nah, too predictable,\" she said to herself, wondering which of them would be perfect for her appearance and of course which one could get Sonic's attention. In the end, Amy found the perfect ribbon, a violet striped one that she immediately tied around her arm. After paying the person at the cashier, she skipped away happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Amy was oblivious that the ribbon she had purchased, is actually a curse material that will transform the wearer, creating an ironic twist that would slowly turn Amy into a fat and stupid being. While Amy continued to stroll through town, the curse began to take its effect and change Amy; making her...</div><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Happen...?\" Amy droned out as her head began to throb, the pain subsiding as a warm fog enveloped her thoughts. She could feel something was wrong, too, as her eyes crossed. \"What's...?\" Was all she could manage as her mind melted, leaving her much more confused and much, much stupider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh...\" Amy moaned, her head bobbing a little back and forth as she sat up. Anyone could tell you she looked brainless. Eyelids half lidded, drool dripping out her open mouth, and body loose and limp. Her brain, emptied of all substance, was too weak and feeble for complex thoughts, and could only really keep her alive and barely sentient. Though, she still could, technically, function, because even if her vocabulary was in the triple digits, and her education was utterly wiped, and her IQ lower than room temperature, she knew her name, her friends, and enough manners to get by in basic conversation--if her partner spoke slow enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, with her intellect ground down to nearly nothing, Amy found that...</span></div></div>",

Thinking with her stomach, she stumbled clumsily into a nearby forest. If she had the brains to do so, she would've wondered why there was such a scent of cooked food coming from the forest or why the forest was getting unnaturally dark around her, but, with her tiny mind, all she could do was drool and follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of walking, the hedgehog found a lit up clearing. In the center of the pretty looking glade, there was a massive table of meats and bread and fruits, all masterfully prepared. The setup triggered a small concern, but she was too moronic to comprehend it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly diving face first into the meal, Amy buried her face in a honey glazed ham, coating her face in sticky, sugary glaze and ravenously consuming the dish in seconds. Without a hint of grace or tact, she merely burped and kept up her feast. Unnaturally, the pink glutton stuffed herself silly, eating dish after plate after meal after fattening meal in the span of minutes what should have taken days, all the while packing on the pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind so far gone, it didn't even notice the slight jiggle in the back or the weight behind her pounces. Amy's consciousness was flipped off even to the point where her flabby arms were visibly plump and she struggled and sweated just to crawl from dish to dish. By the time her body was too stuffed to move, she began to wonder \"what feel funny...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough by then, she was too tired and heavy to move and sleepiness cloaked herself until it covered her completely like a heavy blanket. And so Amy slept. She would wake in a couple hours able to move and think much easier than now, but much slower than she should. Downgraded to a fat and heavy dunce, the ribbon knew its job was done and set off to gather more subjects.</span></div></div>",

What could he be up to now-?\" Blaze said but before she could finish her sentence, she suddenly received a headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Blazes had found the Doctor's machine, little did she know what this machine was capable of; as the signal coming out from the dish had some interesting effects on people.

Just looking at the princess would be a dead giveaway of the utterly shameful state of her brain as she had trouble summoning the mental energy to close her jaw and stop drooling all over herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile not completely useless, Peach's mind was in shambles. Any and all complex thought would overload and then short circuit her brain, speaking would pose a challenge and an idiotic droning tone, and--well, now she's on the floor.</span></div></div>",

She wasn't smart enough for this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you were always such a delight to have around!\" Daisy giggled, then waited for the ditz to return the gesture. \"That little laugh and those sweet blue eyes would always lift our spirits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess giggled.And she kept giggling.

But better!\" Daisy waited for the girl to giggle and giggle at the mention of her prettiness. \"And even with your... eating habits and girth, your pure and innocent personality would shine through! No matter how heavy you got!\" For emphasis, Daisy gently jiggled the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously, the princess poked her belly. It wasn't much, but there was certainly a little jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you were always such a soft girl, having a soft body just sort of fit.\" Daisy saw a sharpness start to return to the girl's dull eyes. \"And that's really what you are, Peach.\" Luckily, Daisy still got a giggle of confirmation as the girl's trance was starting to break. \"Soft.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soft...?\" Peach giggled as she fell out of her trance and back to consciousness. \"What're you talking about, silly~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You asked me what word best described you, Princess.\" Daisy grinned knowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Peach pouted. \"I'm sorry, I, like, forgot...\" And the punctuated the sentence with a timid giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's more than okay.\" Daisy gently let the princess down to her feet and then patted her on her pretty little head.</span></div></div>",

When she looked over her overstuffed belly and at her drooling snatch, she immediately knew what it was. It seems like the poison allowed her to remember anything related to sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ooh, me know wah is! Issa... Uh... Duh... Puss... Eh... Pusseh! Pusseh! Yay! Pusseh! Pusseh!

I'm not feeling so good,\" mumbled Peach, rubbing her forehead from the sudden dizziness. She dropped the glass onto the grass, stumbling away from the picnic to a nearby tree to sit down and ease the headache. After resting for a few minutes, Peach lifted herself off from the tree, wiped her clothes and hands and carried on with her stroll through the kingdom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing her walk, she came across a nearby town where she met with a heavenly aroma of freshly baked goods from a local bakery shop, as everyone knew in the Mushroom Kingdom the princess was a sucker for sugary treats, especially cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach followed the smell to the bakery; she walked inside and found the smell to be coming from some freshly baked icing layered cupcakes. Peach was not only lipping her lips from the smell, but also drooling slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome your highness, welcome to Glazed Sugar Boat bakery!\" said a Toad with a baker's hat behind the counter. \"Would you like to order something my dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the words of 'order something', Peach was brought back to reality and answered, \"Oh yes please, Peach would like a dozen cupcakes or so,\" not realising she just referred to herself in third person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Toad started grabbing a couple of boxes from the selves, he said \"Well since you\u2019re our princess of the kingdom, you can have not only these boxes free but another dozen as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust hearing the word 'free' Peach instantly put on the biggest smile on her face. After the Toad loaded the boxes full of cupcakes, he gave them to Peach, who piled them on top of each other and left the store, already snacking on one of the cupcakes. Once Peach found a good spot to sit down and eat, she went completely bonkers on the cupcakes, wolfing them down in seconds. Soon she was already finished, she lay down on the ground, with one hand being used licking to get any spare icing; while the other was rubbing her developing pot-belly.</div><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Something told her this wasn't a bluff. \"What happens if I win?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ding sound effect rung. \"If you get 'em all right, then we let you go!\" Then the music stopped. \"But,\" He brought up a single finger. \"If you get even <i>one </i>wrong, you have to do what I say!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. \"I don't have a choice, do I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope!\" He cried, and cleared his throat. \"First Question!\"</span></div></div>",

The ding sound played, and a green circle was projected onto the floor. It seemed there were 6 slots to fill, so six questions. \"Next question!\" He grinned. \"What is Mario's last name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He doesn't have a last name.\" Peach smiled. She'd asked Luigi if he, as a Mario brother, would be called Luigi Mario and they'd explained the whole thing to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ding played again, and Bowser stomped his foot. \"Correct!\" The next green circle filled the ground. \"But you won't be so lucky this time!

The turbulence was unpleasant The monsters holding me were not necessarily so, but did not give much to go off of as they mostly just stood there, weapons in hand, silent as death. There weren't any bars to the cell, but white mages don't train in hand to hand combat considering the rigorous mental exercises that magic required. I can distinctly remember a few days where I returned to my quarters past midnight and collapsed, exhausted. Ah, better days...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't sigh, Rosa.\" A voice called from down the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello, Golbez.\" I courteously greeted the massive warrior, standing up and craning my neck to meet his gaze. There was a miniature internal debate on whether or not to say more, though the imposing armor proved to be too much and I settled on silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have some questions for--!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Settle down, Kain.\" Golbez silenced with a relaxed wave of his hand to the, admittedly, seemingly smitten dragoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-of course...\" Kain murmured, his head bowing in... shame? Funny. Did he swear fealty to this creature? He wasn't one to go back on previous arrangements of honor, though I once thought he wasn't one to betray his friends, so I suppose assumptions aren't accurate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rosa Farrell, white mage of Baron and partner of Cecil Harvey, dark knight of Baron, I have no reason to harm you at this present moment.\" Golbez began with enough arrogant authority to sicken even the most spineless servants. \"But,\" He stared through me for a split second--probably expecting some form of petty defiance--before resuming. \"If you attempt to disobey, sabotage, or flee, then Kain will be...\" Kain shifted? Or was that the darkness of the room? \"Unsatisfied with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood.\" I nodded, knowing that this was not the time nor the place to fight. Patience and plotting would see me through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent.\" Golbez enthused with somehow the bare minimum of enthusiasm that one could put into an enthused statement. I could almost imagine what villainous smile he had under that helmet, and I couldn't stop a frown.</span></div></div>",

After a painful four tries, she burned some mana on a cure and shivered in ecstasy as the spell tingled and tickled gently around her body. Magic usually felt centered and strong, but the nature of her injuries forced the flow of magic over the whole of her person rather than the bruised knees and burnt feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaky, she sat up and grabbed the platter and glass from the nightstand. What lay there was, to her weary and starved eyes, a thing of true beauty. Soft, toasted loaf around the ends of fresh crisp lettuce, bountiful smoked pork, what looked to be some kind of mustard, grilled onions, melted cheese, and sauteed mushrooms blurred the edges of Rosa's vision and made her faint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRavenously, Rosa's breasts, legs, belly, and face puffed a bit per bite, doughy flesh bounding bouncily forward in form of fat. There wasn't enough fluff to break the spell that sandwich had had on Rosa's desperate and hungered mind, but, to an outsider, her legs plumped, her gut bulged, and her bust strained her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout halfway through the meal, Rosa grabbed the odd shaped glass and drank. It tasted sweet and warm and cozy, and, on account of the dizziness present shortly after, probably had a bit of alcohol. Though, in truth, it was merely made from her mind. Memories of love and care from family and small bits of study and training swirling around the surface of the mug and her mind were blurred. Not burned or melted away, the superficial facts and unimportant  memories merely snuggled into a blanket and hibernated for later use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a small, embarrassed burp the slowed, softened Rosa breached for air. With half the sandwich and a fraction of the drink gone, sleepiness gently washed in waves over the ditzy white mage. She was still hungry, but the meal could wait til tomorrow. Yawning, she nestled between the warm sheets and sighed.</span></div></div>",

If Cecil escaped, then he would have motioned towards Kaipo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe <i>had</i> to be there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into the hot dry sunlight, Rosa grit her teeth. She didn't have a choice, but that did not serve to help her morale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she walked for hours upon hours, expertly managing heat, salt, and water as she had read in survival training. By the time the sun set, she'd covered a good two or three miles more than she'd planned to. Not that the poor Mage could track such a thing. It just felt that way, and comforted her to think as such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, with the heat dropping off fast, she suddenly had to deal with the monster that had stalked her that last hour. Campsites near monsters were only acceptable in havens or under a teammates watch, she recalled, knocking an arrow and taking aim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny second, the Lamia would cross the hill and enter her line of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny second...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh. <i>Very well</i>.

Zelda responded with an incomprehensible string of words, worrying Mipha even more. <br>\r\n\"We need to get you home!\" Mipha said, lifting Zelda and draping her around her shoulders.

This was a job for anyone else. Why did it have to be her that found Zelda and why was the princess so dazed? Was she poisoned? What kind of poison incapacitated someone so inelegantly? Wouldn't her enemies just kill her? Was she playing into some trap--<b>what was that</b>?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhirling around, the Zora heaved wearily her polearm. This was too much. She couldn't fight for much longer. \"H-Hello...?\" Taking a trembling step back, she said again, \"H-Hello? Is any--Aghh!\" But tripped over a root and fell back on a tree. \"Ow...\" She rubbed her head, a sense of dizziness resulting from the fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda was splayed out on the ground to her left, but looked fine otherwise. What caught her attention after, though, filled her with first relief, then joy, then hunger. The rustling in the bush hadn't been an enemy, but, instead, a fruit! And not just any fruit, but a fat and juicy one. She hadn't eaten all day, and there had to be water inside...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Mipha gave a silent prayer. <i>Perhaps today is to be a good day after all.</i> She thought, smiling and picking the biggest one off the ground. With a dainty bite, she tasted a most wondrous flavor and sweetness. Perhaps she'd plant a tree of this in the domain once she got another chance to go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSavoring the taste for as long as she could, Mipha swallowed and sighed again, contented.

Why should she be the only one who gets to try Hyrule's finest food?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she wandered off, she took care of Zelda. They were in a clearing, with somewhat visible sightlines all around. Having much more sensitive ears that Hylians, Mipha would hear any would-be attackers. Grabbing Zelda, whose head rolled onto her shoulder, Mipha propped her up against a tree. Zelda babbled to Mipha, before giggling to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Mipha looked around the clearing. A quiet rustle from the right alerted her to something. Looking over, she saw another one of the juicy fruits lying on the ground, practically waving her over. Mipha smiled and started towards it, pleased that she didn't have to wander far from Zelda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had taken two steps when her her stomach rumbled loudly, causing Mipha to blush. Taking another step, she let out a groan. <br>\r\nInstantly, fat poured onto her trim frame. Her belly bulged outwards, quickly becoming a large apron of fat that hung down to her knees. Her backside swelled, stopping when each one of her ass cheeks resembled two globes of pure fat. Her small legs thickened, becoming dual columns of flab that pushed against each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer chest grew outwards, forming two breast-like spheres of flab that sat heavily atop her belly. Being a Zora, she didn't have breasts in the same way Hylians did. Theirs were just mostly for show, while Hylians breasts actually had a purpose. <br>\r\nAlso unlike Hylians, Zora's had multiple fins to help with swimming. Mipha's head fin filled with fat, becoming larger and fatter. It quickly lost its perkiness, drooping downwards towards her thick backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was, by Zora standards, much stronger than average, staying on her flabbier feet was draining her energy at a rapid pace. <br>\r\n\"What... Happened...\" She huffed, her skin flushed red. \"I can't...\"<br>\r\nMipha dropped to the ground with a fleshy slap. Her legs splayed out on either side of her, her large belly lay between them, effectively pinning Mipha to the ground.

As soon as she entered the forest, fog closed in around her, trapping her in the Lost Woods. She didn't realise this, and continued towards the source of the glitter. The fog, oddly, did nothing to impede her progress. Normally, it would prevent people from finding the hidden village within the woods, however Zelda wasn't going towards the village. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBursting through a bush, Zelda found the source of the glitter was an odd tree.

Even from across the room, the stench of it reached Zelda. It made her nose turn up, and made her feel sick to the stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the doll's legs were dipped in, Zelda groaned with discomfort. Her legs felt funny...<br>\r\nShe slowly began to shrink. Zelda wasn't a tall girl, but the changes were noticeable. The crowd around her squealed and laughed as the Princess lost almost a foot in height, leaving her the size of a Bokoblin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her stomach reached the foul-smelling liquid, Zelda's hand flew to her real stomach. She was on the verge of screaming in pain now. <br>\r\nHaving lost a foot in height, the lost mass needed somewhere to settle. Her trim belly pushed outwards, pushing her tunic up. Her pert breasts filled with her lost height, tightening the top half of her top. Her hips and backside filled out, tightening her pants and causing small rips to appear. <br>\r\nThe boss Bokoblin laughed at the shorter, fatter Princess. He pushed the majority of the crude doll in, leaving only her head visible. <br>\r\nZelda let out a cry of pain. Her pale skin began to darken. It quickly became a deep red colour, and became rough. Lost in her pain, Zelda didn't notice her new skin tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing their newest recruit forming before them, the boss Bokoblin dropped the doll. It slowly sank into the mud. <br>\r\nZelda lost her composure. She screamed out as her blonde hair fell away from her skull, which pushed outwards until she totally looked like a red Bokoblin, with a couple of visible differences. Her blue eyes held a little intelligence, while the Bokoblins eye held very little. She was also much heavier than the regular Bokoblin, her rough belly sitting in her lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel, human?\" The Bokoblin said in his own language. If the ritual worked, she should understand him...</span></div></div>",

She lay there, looking at the sky. \"Like, the stuff up there is so pretty!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised a chubby arm and pointed at the sky. Rolling onto her back, Raven joined Zelda in looking at the sky. Despite being dumber than a toddler, Zelda was right. The way the stars sparkled, how the moon was large and white... It really was pretty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey probably would've stayed there all night, had the thundering of hooves not broken the silence. <br>\r\n\"Hey, are you two okay?\" Came a concerned voice. <br>\r\nLooking away from the sky, Raven slowly realised that they were just lying in the middle of the road. <br>\r\nZelda, on the other hand, was blissfully unaware of this, and was busy grabbing at thin air, much to their discoverer's confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is... She alright?\" He asked Raven quietly, causing her to giggle. <br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Raven answered. \"She's just Silly!\"<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" The man looked away from the ditzy Princess. \"Why were you lying in the middle of the road?\"<br>\r\n\"Looking at the stars!\" Raven said dreamily. <br>\r\nThe man nodded slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you guys okay?

We're gonna get <i>soft beds...!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Zelda said, turning back to her friend giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven smiled at the girl's ignorance, and ruffled her hair.

Her fat belly was uncovered, the flesh splitting into two distinctive rolls. Above them sat two soft orbs, their flesh visible through developing rips on the tunic.<br>\r\nHer pants could no longer be described as pants. Her thick legs had caused the legs of the pants to rip apart, leaving her in a very crude set of shorts, which were on the verge of breaking apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Zelda, she was a mess. She had clearly forgotten how to eat with cutlery, instead using her hands to messily shove food into her mouth. Half the food went in. The other half was strewn around her or on her. Her tunic was stained a multitude of colours, while sauce and drool were caked onto her round cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yummy!\" Zelda cried out, burping loudly. She giggled and played with her soft tummy.<br>\r\nRaven stood up and pulled on her suit. Finally, they could go shopping! </span></div></div>",

He'd tell the guards on his way out, but there were better ways to die than young and dumb. \"M-May I leave now...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven turned to her hero and pouted. \"Aw, so soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" He nodded, neck stiff. \"I, I, I have to go and do some book... stuff at the l-library.\" Trying not to tell anymore, his body betrayed him and he couldn't stop from looking and shying away. Anyone with a brain could tell he was lying, but maybe if he screamed and ran the guards would protect--!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" Raven was walking away, hand in hand with her blonde blimp. \"Have fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a weak wave back, the young man tried to smile. Somehow, this was more unsettling than a knife to the neck.</span></div></div>",

Being an enemy of the Yiga Clan was much worse than just walking away. Plus, the Hyrule Guard was woefully inept, and even if they guaranteed his safety, he'd probably still get murdered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OhmyGod! Aren't these just the cutest?!\"<br>\r\nRaven squealed as she poked a set of amber earrings. <br>\r\n\"Or this! This would look so cute with my hair!\"<br>\r\nShe lifted a diamond circlet, which attracted the shopkeepers eye. <br>\r\n\"Be careful with that!\" He yelled at Raven, who jumped and almost dropped the near priceless accessory. <br>\r\n\"Like, sorry~\" Raven giggled, dropping the circlet back onto its stand. \"How's you, Silly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at Zelda, Raven found that her partner was staring, dopey eyed and drooling, at an odd slate. <br>\r\n\"Like, this l-looks... funny?\" She said, poking it. The shopkeeper rushed over. <br>\r\n\"Don't touch that!\" He said angrily. \"That is a replica of the Sheikah Slate used by Princess... Zelda..?\"<br>\r\nHe trailed off as he got a good look at the fat blonde's face. <br>\r\n\"Princess?\" Zelda tapped her chin, causing it to wobble. \"Yep! That's me!\"<br>\r\nZelda giggled, unaware of how she had just announced that she was Princess Zelda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven, however, had enough floating around her head to know that that probably wasn't a good idea. <br>\r\n\"Like, she's totally kidding!\" She giggled, somewhat nervously. \"She's much cuter than Princess Zelda!\"<br>\r\nZelda blushed and laughed cutely. <br>\r\n\"Yep, I super cute!\"<br>\r\nRaven nodded in agreement before grabbing Zelda's hand, blushing and leading her out of the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter explaining, with the smallest words she could use, why Zelda couldn't announce herself as the Princess, Raven led them down another alley. This one was small, and had only one market stall. Raven was about to turn her back before Zelda ran towards the stall. <br>\r\n\"Silly!\" Raven called, reluctantly following her. <br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Zelda grabbed something from the stall and pushed it into her mouth. \"G-Goodest Fruit!\"<br>\r\nCatching up to Zelda, Raven slapped a fruit from her hand. <br>\r\n\"Silly! Ya totally can't do that!\" She told Zelda, who whimpered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the owner had missed Zelda's obvious theft, and greeted the pair. <br>\r\n\"How are you two fine ladies doing?\" He asked, flashing a grin at Zelda, who responded by giggling. <br>\r\n\"The goodest fruit!\" Zelda pointed at the two fruit filled containers. <br>\r\n\"Yep, they sure are good!\" The owner let out a booming laugh, causing Zelda to jump and whimper again. \"These are only attainable in the Lost Woods. Sadly, nobody is buying them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raven!\" Zelda whined. \"Goodest fruit!\"<br>\r\nRaven let out a sigh. Sure, the fruit was good, but they had no money...</span></div></div>",

It was large, with a pretty red skin that shone in the sunlight. <br>\r\nEven looking at it made Raven hungry. She could practically imagine how tasty it was, how much juice she could get from it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, like, it looks totally tasty, but we can't afford it,\" was what Raven wanted to say. <br>\r\nInstead, she said, \"Silly! No!\" as Zelda greedily snatched the fruit away from the man and, with a number of big bites, demolished the rather large fruit. She giggled as she swallowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her giggles were quickly replaced with ominous gurgles from her stomach, and pained moaning from Zelda. <br>\r\n\"Urrp... Raven, me don't feel, like, nice...\" Zelda said, clutching her soft stomach. <br>\r\nRaven shook her head, clearly disappointed with Zelda. Sure, she was dumber than a toddler, but even she should know that stealing was wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could tell her off, Zelda turned on her heel and pushed past the man, running into the back of his stall and out of their view. <br>\r\n\"Zelda?\" Raven asked, both concerned and curious. She turned to the man. \"Like, what did you do?\"<br>\r\nThe man gave a knowing smile, rolling his sleeve up to reveal a symbol not unlike the one on Raven's suit. Had she full mental capacities, she would've recognized the symbol as a Yiga Eye. As she was, she tilted her head curiously, before looking towards the area where Zelda had run off to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClutching her stomach, Zelda felt not good. Her head was bad, and her tummy felt funny...<br>\r\nLetting out a burp, the fruit began to take its toll on the greedy royal. Her belly forced her tunic up, quickly becoming a large apron of fat that hung down over her crotch. Her breasts forced the neckline of her tunic to stretch, revealing two orbs of pure fat. Her hips and backside reopened the former rips in her pants, allowing her creamy flesh to bulge through again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her body grew, her mind shrank even further. What little knowledge she possessed quickly vanished. Falling onto her backside, Zelda's mouth hung open, drool freely running down her thick chins. Her blue eyes were completely devoid of any intelligence. Zelda looked around her, completely oblivious to her much heavier body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer changes stopped as suddenly as they came. Zelda had almost tripled in size, leaving her with a round face adorned with three thick chins. Below them sat her meaty breasts, each one soft and round. Her belly had split into three fat rolls, hanging down to her column-like thighs. The bottom of her jiggly backside was visible through her ripped pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooohhh...\" She giggled validly, staring at a wooden box with interest. Her attention was drawn away as a pang of pain shot through her empty head. \"Owie!\"<br>\r\nShe clutched her head. It was so hard to think without her head hurting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, the pain subsided somewhat, allowing the dumb Princess to look around again. <br>\r\n\"W-Wha?\" She managed to say, before clapping. \"Yay! Zelda talk good now!\"<br>\r\nEven those simple words filled her with... something. She didn't know what. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllowing her thick legs to splay out to her sides, Zelda took note of her bulging body. She poked her plump lips, giggling like a child as drool dripped onto her bigger breasts. <br>\r\n\"Zelda the best talker! Raven so proud of Zelda!\" She said happily, playing with one of her belly rolls. She poked and proded her fat, giggling as she absent-mindedly played with her boobies. She stopped after a couple of seconds, her brain buffering as Zelda looked at an odd looking eye painted on one of the crates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" She mumbled when her brain finally started working again. \"Wha was Zelda doing?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, if any of these people come around, we have special deals for them\".<br>\r\nHe pointed to two posters.

She's just delusional!\" He called out, correcting Raven. \"Yep! Like, no cause here! Just super delicious fruit!\" Raven added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man shook his head again. While she was very effective at bringing people to the stall, she wasn't very discrete. Sure, she probably couldn't remember what her cause was, but other people might twig on and bust the entire operation. Then, they'd both be in huge trouble, given that a very obese and very dumb Zelda was lying in the back of the tent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take some!\"<br>\r\n\"Me too!\"<br>\r\n\"Don't forget about me!\"<br>\r\nRaven began to sweat. There were too many people, and she didn't have enough hands. <br>\r\n\"Like, Mister?\" She called over to the man. \"Raven needs help!\"<br>\r\nThe man nodded. It was his stall, after all. And it was likely Raven wouldn't be around forever. <br>\r\n\"Alright, people!\" He shouted over the many requests of the crowd. \"Form another line over here!\"<br>\r\nA large crowd quickly formed before him. Between the pair, they just about finished all the requests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, look at all the sparkles!\" Raven squealed. She was currently holding a silver Rupee in one hand, and a sparkling gold one in the other. The way they sparkled entranced Raven, she could look at them forever...<br>\r\n\"For the cause!\" The man shouted over, dropping another gold rupee into a box filled with loads of other gold rupees. They had sold practically all of his stock, except for one box which was half empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven pouted and reluctantly dropped the two rupees into her box. Grabbing the box, the man cracked a smile. <br>\r\n\"Thanks for today,\" he said, surprising Raven. <br>\r\n\"Like, thanks!\" She giggled. \"Raven was happy to help!\"</span></div></div>",

She could barely operate, but she could identify Raven's soft touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raven...\" Zelda murmured quietly, before giggling.

It was then that she noticed a bizarre fruit near where the dog had just walked. She sprinted over there and saw several other pieces of the fruit and followed the track, until she found a strange orange tree with yellowish orange fruit hanging from it. \"This is it,\" she shouted in victory. \"Now to just take these and see what exactly they are.

The mage smiled, breaking out of her normally studious behavior for a bit of fun. She reasoned that a break from work would help, besides, she was always busy and deserved some time away from books. Jaina recalled seeing the sign in the mage district of Stormwind, over in the back. She wondered how the business would be, considering not much foot traffic goes through there, but what did she have to lose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaina walked out the door whilst fastening her cloak, a chill winter breeze still present. \"I guess a walk wad out of question anyway...\" A slight shiver running down her back. The streets were rather empty this time of day, most townspeople out for work, save a few adventurers out and about in a rush. It felt good to not be pressured and rushed for once, when's the last time she did something like this? She couldn't recall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mage mused to herself as she walked through the city, not bothering to use a teleportation spell. As she rounded the corner, Jaina could hear a sign swinging back and forth in the wind, which was really started to pick up. Sure enough, the sound was sourced as the destination Jaina was looking for, 'I hope they've got a fore going...' She thought, her skin chilled by the nip of winter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the shop door with a ringing bell sounding off her entrance, closing the door hard behind as she walked in. It looked to be empty, not counting the elderly man behind the counter who'd just turned to face his visitor, \"Lady Proudmoore! Welcome welcome!\" The man scurried, doing his best to clean up the rather cluttered desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pleasure's all mine,\" she smiled, putting her hand up to keep him from overreacting, \"There's no need to tidy up, I'm just here for a break from studies.\" Her eyes already wondering around the admittingly large store; shelves and boxes everywhere. Things from every corner of the earth and beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, even better! Let me know if you need help finding anything, id be honored to assist!\" The man piped up, a spark of excitement in his old eyes. \"I've got some special ones set off to the side just in case someone like you came in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaina laughed, \"Alright, I could use some help in that case!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Give me one moment!\" He turned his back and popped open a hatch below him, disappearing from the mage's view. Within moment however, a clattering was heard as the man climbed a stepladder back up. \"Here we are... Locked up tight.\" He drops a heavy chest atop his desk, one that doesn't seem like he'd be able to carry at his age... But before Jaina could question it, the man popped open the lock with the lid springing open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow...\" Jaina stared at the treasures before her. Everything from a shining gold crown to a small tribal looking totem. She could feel the magic radiating off each of them, their aura quite strong. \"There's a lot here, where do we start?\" Jaina leaned on the counter to peer over each trinket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have some in mind that just might fit the bill.\" He rummages through the chest, pulling aside an item or two, neatly lining them up on the counter. \"Alrighty. First we have this little beauty, known to a select few as 'The Stone of Anaa'. Not much information on this one, as I got it from an anonymous seller.\" The bauble looked to be a very smooth lack stone, almost impossibly so. It was fastened on a necklace of fine silver. It drew in Jaina's eyes as she looked at it, she had to shake her head just to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, next up...\" The shop keeper loudly rummaged through, \"Ahaa, the Circlet of Emptiness! I know it sounds ominous, but the bit of information I have on it suggests that it's not dangerous by any means.\" The circlet looked quite simple at first glance, a solid gold loop, but on a second look, you'd notice all the fine carvings of ornate swirls. Jaina felt compelled to wear the oddity, but slowly looked back up to the old man. \"Both have less than satisfactory information, especially due to my own magical limits.\" He thumbed his fingers against the wooden desk, \"So I was wondering if you'd experiment with them a bit? Considering you're a world class mage and all...\" He trailed off, unsure of how she'd answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd gladly lend my help! They look fascinating to say the least!\" Jaina answered quickly. Fast enough to even throw her off on such a hasty decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will? That's fantastic!\" The old man practically jumped in joy at her response. \"If you can figure out what they do, you can keep it, its the least I can do for someone so prestigious agreeing to aid me.\" He flipped up the desk door to meet Jaina on the other side, \"Which would you like to try?\"</span></div></div>",

If you can find anything on how it works or where it came from, you can keep it.\" He gave the metal piece a slight flick as Jaina felt it's engravings. \"It's the least I can do for someone as prestigious as yourself offering to help.\" The shopkeep flung open the counter door, walking over to Jaina's side, \"I have some sorting to do in the back room, let me know if you find anything.\" He flipped over a sign on the door, the sign now reading: 'Away for lunch.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... Sounds good.\" Jaina answered back, already deep in thought. She felt it's powerful magic radiating into het hands. She was well trained in these arts, but had never heard of such a piece. It was surprisingly light, despite being fully metal. It was certainly easy on the eyes too, Jaina was infatuated with it. The gold hardly looked tarnished whatsoever, the thin swirls patterning around were masterfully crafted. The mage put it down on the counter, running a few tests here and there, none of which affected the piece. It was enchanted with stability in mind, the aura surrounding it not fading in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaina had a few options here, she could test it on herself by putting it on, or put it on someone else's head and see how that goes. But the more she considered it looked at the piece, the more Jaina wanted to try wearing it herself. \"Oh why not, the crown could prove useful anyway, right?\" She rationalized. But if she were fully in her proper state of mind, she'd note how unsafe such an action would be. It had to be part of the magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mage lifted up the circle, brushing aside her hair. Conveniently there was a full body mirror behind her, so she took to looking at herself there. She carefully placed I on her head, the fit surprisingly comfortable. She admired how it sat on her head, she felt proud and beautiful.  \"Perhaps it makes the wearer irresistible?\" Jaina said out loud. Though there was a growing sensation in the back of her mind, only minor for now but progressing either way. It wasn't a pain ad much as it was a fog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it spread, Jaina felt a rush all at once, like an intense migraine. \"Aaghh!\" She yelped rubbing her temples.

Her head felt emptier, her thoughts simpler. \"Mmm, what's happening?\" She questioned, but soon that too faded, leaving her air-headed and low on attention span.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaina dodged her own previous question, her mind drifting to her surroundings, \"Wow, this is like, cool.\" She flicked her hair over her shoulder to get a better look at the items on the shelves.   Jaina giggled to herself. 'Giggling? I don't giggle...', but again, her mind wandered. Her gaze inevitably landed back on the counter, where the trunk of special stock sat open. The pendant that the shopkeeper showed her was the first thing that caught her attention. \"That's like, so pretty.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJaina picked up the pendant, almost hypnotized by it. She really felt like wearing it, so she slipped it over her head, the stone fitting perfectly between her breasts. She looked down and giggled, \"I look so cute!\" She felt really bubbly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Jaina started to look at herself in the mirror she felt a new sensation, not the same as before.

Where once she was reserved and polite, behavior befitting of someone with her statue; now quickly devoured anything in front of her, staining her mouth with frostings and chocolate.

She patted her taut middle, her cake laden fingers staining her robes a bit, not that it had any effect on her. She giggled with glee, knowing nothing but enjoyment at the moment. All the spells she once new are beyond uncastable in her current state, the Circlet Of Emptiness living up to it's name. Were Jaina not a dumb glutten at the moment, she'd have finally figured out it's name sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe archmage moved further down the line, greeted with eclairs and doughnuts, which she wasted no time getting started on. Even though she'd eaten more than most humans do in a month, her stomach still growled for more. \"Hehe, choclate...\" she mumbled, the word had finally returned to her. Jaina took a stack of donuts and placed one on each finger, devouring every last one. As she continued her instinctive eating, her robe began to pop a few seams on either side, finally giving in to the tightness it was faced with. The love handles she'd recently acquired were finally showing, slivers of creamy skin now peaking through the opened slits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaina showed no signs of stopping, clearing out the eclairs and doughnuts without slowing.

She'd soon test that theory, scooping up the strawberry flavored treat. It was cold, but it didn't bother her too much as she was eating much too fast. \"Ughhh, so tired...\" she grumbled, the fullness in her belly finally catching up with her. She scooped up the last bit of ice-cream, belching in victory. Now that she polished off the whole thing, the ice-cream also caught up with her, a sharp brain freeze coursing through her head. She grunted in pain, massaging her forehead until it went away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContent with her feast and feeling bloated, Jaina Proudmoore sat straight on the ground, leaning her back on the now empty food table.

She had heard of Spyro's developing relationship with Cinder. She had noticed the two dragons bonding for a while now, but she would shrug it off and assume Cinder wouldn't take Spyro away from her. She had thought wrong, and now she was paying the price. Cinder and Spyro were going out and it was because of her negligence. Luckily, Ember had planned to remedy her mistake by searching for a way to ruin Cinder and make Spyro scorn her. Ember didn't plan to harm her rival, but she did want to find a way to make her repulsive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber searched through a huge mound of scrolls, which she gathered from various other dragons across the realm. She hoped at least one of them would give a decent spell that could change Cinder for the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... There has to be a good spell here somewhere,\" Ember said as she took out another scroll and skimmed through it. She mostly paid attention to the spells effects as opposed to how to do them. No point in learning a spell if she didn't know whether it did what she wanted it to do after all. Ember had been searching for a few hours so far, her determination to win back Spyro driving her to this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after so much searching, Ember was almost ready to give up, until she found two scrolls paired up together. One scroll effected the mind. It allowed the user of the spell to control any other living being's mind, including deducting or adding IQ points, changing memories, behavior, etc. The other spell simply controlled the body. It allowed the user to change a being's weight, physical strength level, and how the organs operate. Ember chuckled evilly to herself. \"Ooh, Spyro, you will soon be mine...\" she told herself with a wicked smile ending it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber quickly went out in search of Cinder.</span></div></div>",

Butterflys zoomed over her head, flapping gracefuly in the wind. A black figure caught the pink dragoness's attention. Creeping silintly through the flowers, Ember spotted Cynder walking along the cobbled path, sniffing at a flower every now and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked so peacful, completely unaware of the pink dragoness hiding between the sweet scented plants. Now was the time to strike. Onrolling the scroll, Ember read the words quickly, loudly, and clearly. When she was finished, Ember looked up at Cynder with a evil grin, but it faded from her face. Cynder still looked completely normale, just standing there, motionless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber felt her heart race. She expected Cynder to turn around any time now, but, for some reason, she didn't. Emerging from the flowers, Ember slowly walled towards the black dragoness, saying,\"Cynder?\" There was no reply. Ember walked in front of Cynder. Her irisis where two black discs staring into nothing, her face completely emotionless. \"She's only hipnotized,' Ember realised. She waved her paw in front of her face, making sure she was correct. She was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber reached out with her paw and touched Cynder's forehead. Suddenly Ember was bombarded with strange flashes; flashes that told of a Cynder's life, the knowledge she had, the things that made her a computent dragon. Ember gasped, ripping away her paw. The flashes instantly stopped. She breathed heavely in shock. 'I was in her mind,' Ember thought to herself, looking at the paw that touched Cynder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink dragoness walked over to Cynder body and then she touched her stomach. This time there was no flashes that attacked her, but things that she felt inside Cynder. She could feel her iner workings: her beating heart, her stomace working to digest food from within her bowels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber pulled away. She stood there for some time before a evil grin spreaded across her face. She had complete control over her, to shape her body's organs and mind.

She could see and feel everything in Cinder's body now. \"Okay, what could I do to make Cinder a putrid, self-humiliating dragon?\" Ember asked herself. There were so many possibilities. Ember knew the first thing she should do is make Cinder fat, then add any extras later. Ember was about to question herself on how to do anything she pleased to Cinder, but then, immediately as the words \"Cinder\" and \"fat\" came to mind, Cinder's body suddenly expanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder grew a medium-sized pot-belly, which resided between all four of her meatier-looking limbs. Her butt and tail grew by a considerable amount, but nothing extreme (Yet). Cinder looked like she would gain a double-chin if any more weight were added. Overall, she definitely grew wider. In fact, overall she grew bigger. Cinder seemed to gain 100lbs. Ember couldn't help but gasp at how much weight Cinder already gained. She smirked wickedly as evil ideas traversed through her head. Why just make her chubby or even fat? Better to make her morbidly obese so even something as simple as breathing seems to need work!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Ember thought all this, Cinder's weight matched the order. Her butt and tail sized up to an enormous level, as her cheeks were now bigger than basketballs. Her belly grew to the point of hitting the floor. Cinder's gut would now rub against the ground whenever she would walk. Not two, but three chins, along with chipmunk-cheeks were over the dragoness's face. Cinder's limbs were very flabby, and would jiggle from even the smallest movements. Her claws were fat-looking too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder looked like she expanded up to 450lbs. now. Ember smiled and marveled at her work. Just to add the icing in the cake, Ember thought \"Maybe I should make her gassy and wet, too.\" Cinder's saliva-production would be kicked into overdrive, and her digestive system would be destroyed. When she would awake, she would be a gassy, drooling mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber spoke, \"Now for the brain...\"</span></div></div>",

She was clearly so brain-dead that she didn't even have any knowledge of potty-training. \"Heheheheheeeh... Me make boom-boom...\" Cynder giggled slowly and moronically. Ember cheered in her head.

Paw-steps grew louder and louder as Spyro approached them. \"Cynder, where are you?\" he called again. Suddenly Spyro's head popped around the corner, his golden crest shining in the sun, reflecting towards the simple-minded Cynder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shiny,\" the black dragoness said, giggling, advancing towards the purple dragon. \"Cynder?\" Spyro said, turning his head left and right. But when his eyes fell on the bloated dragoness, he exclaimed in shock. \"O, what the hell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached out with her stubby fingers to his crest, but Spyro was quick to dodge. He ran a wide arch around her, his eyes finally falling on Ember. \"Run, Ember, there's a monster here! Warn others. I'll deal with this thing,\" Spyro commanded. But Ember only giggled. \"Silly, Spyro. That's Cynder over there; all fat and disgusting. I'm sure you don't want her now, but I'm here. Take me, purple boy.\" She said that all in the heat of her excitement, but maybe she should have thought this through first. Maybe she should have raised her own IQ points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro's nostrils flared. \" You did this.\" He pointed a guilty finger at her. \"Changer her back now!\" His eyes began to glow. Ember gulped. For a half a moment Ember expected that Spyro would attack her, but he just stood there. \"O...okay, S...Spyro,\" she said in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber walked over to Cynder, who just idly stood there. She sucked in a breath of air, knowing the stench would be unbearable, but now before saying the spell's words. Cynder froze and Ember got to work. She began with Cynder body, deflating the black dragoness like a balloon, re-shaping her organs to a normal state. Next was her mind. She noticed that much of Cynder's skills where destroyed - something she knew Spyro would be furious about - but her high IQ would make up for it, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was done, Ember released the hold on Cynder, and the black dragoness dropped to the floor, unconscious. \"Come,\" Spyro ordered, his paw covering his snout,\"we need to get her to a bath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber sighed, but reluctantly did what he asked. She knew her plan failed, and she would be hated forever by Spyro now, bit she had to do something. After cleaning her, Cynder woke up, confused but as smart as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was scolded by Spyro, and she had to leave, tears streaming down her face. 'You think this is over, Cynder?

Whilst indestructible, it was indeed changeable, and the adventurers sent to tame the demon had shaped it over the centuries to be a good natured, simple minded, cuddly, lazy overlord of love rather than the ill tempered, calculating, voracious, and ambitious slave driver it once was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo by her blessing, Tharja's plots were to be halted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe space around her body was filled with whips of light and words of ancient power. \"What?!\" She cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe runes pulsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn explosion from the roots of her hair suddenly made her blonde and spread down her body, softening the features all over. Her thighs plumped, and her lips puffed, and her arms jiggled. Her clothes strained to hold together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's...?\" The sorcerer picked through her mind to find the word, but struggled. Struggled, that is, in both searching and trying. Fatigue and sloth were blanketing her body, and ignorance filled the mind. \"Going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light flashed again, and her straining, revealing outfit burst apart by a rapid expansion in bust and bottom. The fabric rearranged itself into a flowy white dress and shawl, accented with gold streaks and embroidered designs. Elegant, to sat the least, it was a soft velvet material and covered near all of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a prod and a poke, Tharja explored her new form and was left stupefied. <i>How could this be? What went wrong? She'd cast the spell good...ly... right...? </i> Once fully processed, she summoned her sharpest sneer and several choice words, but both were lost as the runes burst one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt  felt like someone had ripped a bandage off of her heart as every last bit of emotional trauma was opened up. Her thoughts ran faster than ever before to try and cope with the suppressed pain running rampant, but couldn't quite manage. The harder she thought, the slower she thought. Complex words started to fail her. Then the larger ones, and so on, and so forth. Falling to her knees, she clutched her head and shivered out tears. Right when the feeling threatened a breakdown, a soothing alien voice in her head consoled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughtlessly, she listened. For five, ten, thirty minutes, the Plegian sat on her heels and listened. Finally, when the light dimmed around her, she took a deep breath in, and then let it go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was... like a light shined on her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she didn't need intellect, power, money, or anything like that. Because she had food, and she had friends, and she was going to go eat some food WITH her friends!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, Tharja was a woman transformed. Her soul and mannerisms were the same, but much... tamer.</span></div></div>",

High and pained, the sound brought a hand to her forehead as something close to brain freeze gripped her brain.

Though, the stupefying staff, still potent as ever, clutched the trigger tight in her fingertips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having trouble, doc? That's not like you!\" Smirking, the Talon agent didn't even look back. Too busy looting the lab dry, she was oblivious to the background girl's accidental activation of the all powerful, low battery Cerebral Dampener staff. \"You're usually so, eh... how you'd say, verbo--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>ZZZAP</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSombra yelped as the pink beam struck her straight to the tush.

Turn it... aaahh...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlogging over like a mouth breathing ape, the Talon agent didn't seem too confident in words or taunts anymore. Down a third of her I.Q and near all of her formal education, she probably didn't even know why she was running anymore. More on instinct, the newly made moron was a circus monkey following whatever shiny thing caught her eye. That didn't stop her from bowling over Angela all the same, but, when she did get her hands on the staff, that panic-ridden mind just chucked it hard across the room, helpless to drain its mind-numbing battery on the wall that bordered Fareeha's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, one silver lining of it all, was that the two reasonably attractive women were left staring their vapid eyes into one another all sweaty, one on top of the other, all on the floor.</span></div></div>",

They know it and they want everyone else to know it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParticularly main character sorceresses, like Yennefer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShort, slim and striking, Yenn knows she's smarter than everyone else in the room. Her magical skills have kept her a gorgeous 20 year old for decades, earning her power, wealth and a string of lovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo how could she lose both her slim figure and her vaunted intelligence?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Baby Crazy:</b> Yennefer's always wanted to be a mother and has taken many risks to find a cure for her infertility. She finally stumbles onto a successful one, only to fail to realize that the cure will take a very...heavy toll on her figure and slow her wits significantly down. Constant cravings from eating for two will blow the slim sorceress right up, while the hormonal surges and the treatments' interactions with her youth extending potions will take Yen's wits from sharp as a razor to dull as a rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>A well earned curse:</b> Yennefer has quite a sharp tongue on her and an ability to insult when even slightly annoyed. Unfortunately for her, the fat woman she just called a \"Thick as a yard of lard and twice as dumb!\" was actually a disguised spirit that believes the raven haired woman needs a taste of her own medicine. If she wants to stop gaining pounds and losing IQ points, she'll need to say she's sorry...which means Yenn is going to get pretty fat and pretty stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>In the Harem:</b> Yennefer's been captured by Zerrikanian operatives determined to fill the southern Sultan's harem with famous beauties! The sorceress is not only depowered, but finds that the Sultan prefers his many brides slow of witt and heavy of body. She'll have to find a way to escape...before she gets too big to move and too thick to think of a way out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>A well earned break:</b> exhausted by the war against the Wild Hunt, Yen needs a vacation. So Ciri drops her mother off on a more relaxing world: ours! Yennefer's going to be staying at Vegas, learning too late that on our world she's just a normal woman. To make matters worse, with 24/7 access to luxurius buffets and no ability to magically burn the weight, Yenn's gonna get big. And because Earth has strange things like smart phones, social media, television and video games, Yennefer's going to get very vapid by the time Ciri gets back...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Convergence of the stupid, fat spheres:</b> being so close to the new convergence of the spheres has done something to magic. Every time Yenn casts a spell she gets a little fatter and a little slower, she needs to find a solution before she's...what was she doing again? Eating...right...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The nilfgardian standards of sorceresses:</b> Yennefer is captured by the Nilfgardian Empire, a nation that prefers its sorceresses to be less salacious and more obedient. Over fed to destroy her figure, psychologically tormented to wear down her wits and even worse, forced to age to a flabby, timid 45, what's Yennefer to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Youth Addict:</b> Yennefer examines her beauty one day only to see crows feet, laughlines, gray roots and unsightly sagging staring back. She desperately chuggs a youth potion and realizes she's growing resistant to their effects, requiring an ever increasing amount to stay 20. Extra bad news, the potions are very high in calories and cause appetite increases. Extra, extra bad news, they cause long term disorientation, distraction and stupidity. But Yenn can fix herself if she just makes a medical breakthrough. Now, how did that recipe go again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The voluntary change:</b> Yennefer's husband Geralt makes a confession to his brilliant, beautiful wife: he's attracted to her wits and slimness, but would be more aroused by her getting dumber and heavier. Intrigued, Yennefer decides to take a waddle on the slower side, sure she'll be able to undue any ill effects. Unfortunately its more enjoyable than she'd have guessed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr you could have a story on Triss...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b></b></span></div></div>",
