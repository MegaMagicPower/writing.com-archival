He'd always been proud of his fit body but at 42 after serving 5 years in prison for robbery, it seemed that he'd lost control.  He'd vowed to turn his life around and those five years had earned him a degree and the body of a god.  Focusing on study and weight lifting had kept him sane.  His wife had divorced him but his son was still in his life through letters and now living in the same town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily he was able to get a job in accounting with an opportunity for a career.  The new job was demanding in both time and effort which was a good thing.  Jack was appreciated and rewarded for  his effort.  But he no longer had the time or energy for the heavy workouts that had built his hard muscled physique.  And the big appetite he had developed while growing his muscles didn't go away.  He enjoyed his meals and the result was after six months on the outside Jack had packed on 59 pounds of new weight and it wasn't muscle.  At first it was mostly a basketball sized ball belly but lately his ass had grown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few chuckles at work as Jack's muscular fit body began to round out.  \"Looking more like an accountant.\" his boss had commented giving Jack's belly a finger poke.  Alex, Jack's boss was approaching 350 pounds with a soft flabby belly.  Jack was currently 225, 50 pounds over the studly 175 when he got out of prison. \"Just a few pounds,\" Jack replied. \"I'll have that gone by Christmas.\"<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say.\"  Alex replied.  Alex had seen Jack out eat him and Alex knew his way around a buffet.  It would take a famine to slim him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was in denial.  In his mind, all he needed to do was get back into serious gym work and maybe cut back on a snack or two.  For now, though, he needed to get his pants let our.</span></div></div>",

He had a trainer checking his progress each week and so far he was pleased with his progress and commitment.  \"It was like riding a bicycle.\"  Jack thought.  He checked the scale.  Still 225.  Disappointing but Rome wasn't built in a day.  He might be imagining but it seemed that his pants were't so snug.  Maybe he wouldn't be going up to 36's after all. <br>\r\n\"How's it going, Jack.\"  <br>\r\nIt was his trainer, Craig.<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Jack replied.  \"Not losing any weight yet but it feels good.\"<br>\r\nCraig grinned and nodded.  He was used to working with ex-jocks.  They were totally in denial when their metabolisms .slowed down.<br>\r\n\"You are doing good.\"  Craig told him. \"But if you want to drop the weight from your gut you need to watch how you eat.  I can set you up with a diet plan if you want to speed up your progress.  I started getting pudgy after I hit forty but with my exercise program and a better diet, I'm down to 10% body fat, working on 5%.\"<br>\r\n\"Not ready for that yet.\"  Jack replied.  \"I'll just see how it goes with the exercise.\"<br>\r\nJack showered and dressed.  Craig looked pretty fit for a forty something with a nice V shaped torso, lean abs and a firm butt but Jack was confident that he would soon look just as good.  He posed in front of the mirror and sucked in his gut.  It wouldn't be long before  he would look good without sucking it in.<br>\r\nNow for the high point of the day- dinner.

He figured that his weight would drop now that he was working out.  He rationalized that the new weight must be muscle.  He would live with being bigger so long as it was muscle and not fat.

He wasn't going to starve himself like a model or pare down to meat and vegetables like a body builder.  He' been fine until recently and he had probably been eating a bit too heartily so if he just cut back on his portion sizes and eliminated the snacks, he'd be lean and mean in no time.<br>\r\nDay one started just fine.  Jack had always been a believer in a hearty breakfast.  It should be easy to go leaner.  Jack decided that instead of fixing his own breakfast- normally two eggs, toast and a bowl of cereal, he'd eat on the way to work., get a small filling breakfast sandwich and coffee.  He'd be good until noon and calories ahead. He showed up at work feeling good and ready for his first day on the way to lean.  So fat so good.</span></div></div>",

Things were going Jack's way finally.<br>\r\n\"Jack, would you see me in my office?\"<br>\r\nJack's boss, Bob had appeared at his cube.<br>\r\n\"Sure, boss.\" Jack answered.  \"Right away.\"<br>\r\nBob had not been a fan of Jack at first, checking all his work and never giving encouragement but lately Jack was thinking that he had made the grade.  Bob hadn't been on his case for some time now.  Jack was beginning to feel secure in his place in the office.  As his confidence improved, he had focused more on losing the weight and getting in shape.  Now, following Bob back to his corner office that confidence was waning. <br>\r\nHe had never liked Bob.  Bob was everything Jack wasn't.  A college athlete, graduating with honors at State and handsome to boot, Bob had married the owner's daughter and produced 5 grandkids.  He was gold plated.  Bob didn't flaunt his perfection.  He was oblivious to it.  Never seemed to consider himself superior but never showed any lack of confidence that the world was his oyster.  Still it was important to suck up to the owner's favorite so Jack had always tried to be respectful and pleasant.  As he followed Bob he noticed, for the first time, that Bob had a nice plump ass.  Had it always been so well endowed?  Jack stopped speculating.  He was more worried about what Bob had to say.<br>\r\n\"Sit down.\"  Bob said as he shut the door and parked his luscious ass on his office chair and leaned back.  Jack notice that his studly boss seemed to have a bit of belly instead of the toned torso.  <br>\r\n\"Jack,\" Bob began solemnly, \"You'e been with us over six months now and lately, I've been impressed with your work.  Bob appeared serious and focused on Jack while unconsciously his hands.began cradled the small belly pooching over his belt.  \"You have been very thorough and inventive in handling the work and I want you to take over a unit.  I'd like to see how you can handle managing. staff. Are you ready for the challenge?\"<br>\r\n\"Ready boss.\"  Jack replied.  \"Anything you need.\"<br>\r\nOne hour later, Jack was back at his desk contemplating a new life in an office with a door and wondering about what other services might please his boss.   </span></div></div>",

Bob, it seemed, had embraced a more indulgent lifestyle.  In the past six months, Bob had moved into the serious exjock category as his gut ballooned and his chest and ass softened.  He was clearly in the range of 250, at least.  Getting properly fat.<br>\r\nBob had scheduled a mid-morning meeting with Jack.  Bob was working a more relaxed work schedule these days, getting in around 10 and leaving at 2 or so for a late lunch and then not coming back.  This worked just fine for Jack who was taking over more the office management functions.  Jack arrived promptly and Bob waved him in.  \"Shut the door.\" he said smiling.  \"have a seat.\"<br>\r\nAfter some small talk, Bob got to the point.  \"I want you to take over this office.  I'll still be in charge officially but, day to day, it's yours.\"<br>\r\nJack was dumbfounded.  He had been given a rather free hand in running his operation and over time more functions had been moved under his authority but he never expected to be in charge.<br>\r\n\"So, Bob,\" Jack said,  \"What are you doing?  Moving up to the headquarters? Prepping to take over the whole show?\"<br>\r\nBob laughed.  \"Not at all.  I'm just planning to enjoy myself more, play golf, travel.  And I'm the boss now.  I bought this division from corporate and it's all my show.  Carol and I are divorcing and part of the settlement is getting my piece of the business.  Naturally there will be a big bump in pay.  I'm going to stay close while you get comfortable with the new situation.\"<br>\r\nAt this point Bob's belly growled.<br>\r\n\"I think its time for lunch,\" he said. \"We can talk more there.

There were other contestants but the clear battle was between Bob and Jack.<br>\r\nBetween the two, Jack was the most reluctant.  His original fitness goal was lean muscle but gradually, his competitiveness took over and he dedicated himself to lift heavier.  The unintended consequence had been getting heavier himself and eventually Jack' belly grew.  Bob had long ago given up any self consciousness about being fat, in fact he seemed proud of his belly and his gluttony.<br>\r\nRick was playing up the competitiveness and now each man was ready for the measurement clad in posing shorts under voluminous robes.<br>\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" Rick announced.  \"Take your positions.\"<br>\r\nBoth men removed their robes to gasps or admiration from the staff.  Bob was round with heavy moobs and a belly that flowed over and covered his briefs.  To balance his belly Bob had a well-endowed butt.  When he paraded across the platform his body rippled and flowed like jelly in a bag.  He grinned with the attention and struck a pose on one side of the platform.<br>\r\nJack on the other had was firm.  Big bulging pecs and biceps, thick firm thighs and a tight ass set off a magnificent ball belly standing high and proud above a relatively tiny waist.
