Like a 'Hey look at me, I have short hair now.'!<br>\r\n- No, like, hey look at me 'I'm a men', kind of Bang.<br>\r\n- Never gonna happen.<br>\r\n- I know but think about it.

She wore an electric blue shirt, a boyfriend 7/8 jeans over red and white chuck tailors and got her hair loose. Her recent behaviors made her shirt feel a bit tight around the belly section, but still she couldn't herself from pigging out. <br>\r\nSuddendly a door opened.<br>\r\nHayley adjusted her attitude and her seat.<br>\r\nAppeared a strict dressed woman. In her mid 30's, wearing a grey shirt and a black dress, just as if she was going to the court. She was a tad overweight, but nothing different the usual office employee.<br>\r\n\"Miss Williams I presume.<br>\r\n- You presumed right.<br>\r\n- I'm the famous Chips girl from the phone call.<br>\r\n- Oh yes, hi.*munch* sorry it was the last one, these ones are cray.<br>\r\n- Oh Bombs, we have an agreement with them too, you'd like to meet them too?<br>\r\n- One brand at a time, plus I don't think that my body could handle both of them.\"<br>\r\nThe woman chuckles while having a tease of Hayley's belly. <br>\r\n- No problem. But still, if you're interested, you can still contact me.<br>\r\n- Sure, if one day I wanna end up in the Guiness World Record, I'll think about you.<br>\r\n- Always a good word. Now come on in, we'll talk about our agreement.\"<br>\r\nThe woman invited Hayley inside and pulled a chair for her to seat.<br>\r\nThe room was huge, maybe too big for one desk, it had different brand posters on the walls, with the differents stars appearing on it. <br>\r\nFrom old timers from the 50's to new ones like Beth Ditto or Christina Aguilera. They were all on this wall, like this room was more a museum and this lady the curator. She had tiny red desk, made of plastic, a bit cheap but made to look cool and dynamic (well for a company). <br>\r\nOn the table, three bags of chips : a green, a yellow and a red.<br>\r\nEach of thel with a different taste.<br>\r\nThe red one was a tomato veggie, the yellow one a mistard veggie and the green one a low fat veggie one.<br>\r\n\"I bet, I'm tasting the green one?<br>\r\n- Yep, that's it? But first there are some papers shit to fill. Is that okay?<br>\r\n- Yep, always my favorite part.<br>\r\n- Alright, so....<br>\r\nAfter few minutes of talk.<br>\r\n\"So to the good part.<br>\r\n- Tasting. Said Hayley, excited.<br>\r\n- You'll see, it's an intense...<br>\r\nThe other woman hadn't finished her sentence that Hayley had already opened the bag and eaten the first chips. \" OH MY GOD!\" She screamed, sounding like she had an orgasm. <br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, my bad, I let myself go.<br>\r\n- It's alright, I guess, so like it.<br>\r\n- No, I don't like it, I LOVE IT! And you say I'll have it for a lifetime?<br>\r\n- That's signed!<br>\r\n- Oh My. Now that's my kind of deal. It's like my whole life I've been waiting for this food to be created. And it's right here, in my hand.\" And she devoured the rest of the chips with passion.<br>\r\n\" You're sending me the best vibes.<br>\r\n- EMPTY already?!<br>\r\n- Would you like to taste the others?<br>\r\n- I can?<br>\r\n- They're here so... yeah. Help yourself.<br>\r\nHayley wasted no time and emptied both of the bags in record time.<br>\r\n\"Where do I sign for those?<br>\r\n- There's a lign where it says \"You can represent all of our brand for the year to come.\"<br>\r\n- Even Bombs?<br>\r\n- I can add Bombs too!<br>\r\n- I'm in.<br>\r\n- Then welcome, miss Williams, you've made a big deal.<br>\r\n- Thanks, do you have other ones?<br>\r\n - Help yourself! The room in the back is the shop, show them your card and you can have how many bags you want.<br>\r\n- Thank you so much.<br>\r\n- And remember, we take the pictures in 6 months, so you'll have time to know the product.<br>\r\n-Yeah, whatever.\"<br>\r\nHayley stood up, and shaked the woman hand and left the room.</span></div></div>",

Hayley's here. Here to tell ya I'm working on a huge project. And I mean Huge. I can't tell you about it at the moment, but you'll find you soon enough. So see ya everyone.\" The next story is a pics of her dogs napping inside her crossing legs, and Sarah doesn't exactly if that's Hayley's legs or a friend of her's cause her legs are huge. It looks as if Hayley has put on twenty pounds of fat that went straight to her legs. Back to the first vid, the fan checks what bother her and get her answer, Hayley has definitely put on weight since the last time. Her cheeks look puffed, her face looks round , and a the hint of a double chin start to show up. <br>\r\nWhen she waves goodbye at the end of the video, she swears her arms looks far bigger than before. <br>\r\nAfter the shock of the image, the young woman rewatch the stories, she always watch the stories until she knows it by heart, and finally, only the excitement of the news was important in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley had posted her lasted IG story, closed her phone and put it on a table. <br>\r\nShe stared at the mirror at her mirror, her dogs still laying between her legs, looking at her body.<br>\r\nIn the last few days, she's been gaining weight like crazy.<br>\r\nHer face indeed looked big, but it was the only part of her that grew. Her modest breast grew to a C cup, her belly that used to poke gently, was now hanging everywhere. Two rolls of fat were proudly showing where there used to be abs. Her arms were giggling at a single violent movement. But the biggest part were her ass and her legs, they were humongous. Like a Kardashian one. But she wasn't shocked, bag in hand she was starting to snack a mix of Mayos, Bombs and another tasty treats called Fluffs, chocolate with mints. <br>\r\nWhen she finished this contemplation of her ever growing frame, Hayley heard the phone ring.<br>\r\n\" 'llo!<br>\r\n- Hey, how's Ms Mayos and Cie is doing?<br>\r\n- Very Well! Like a growing girl of 30 years old.<br>\r\n- Good! I hope you keep enjoying her product!<br>\r\n- Yep! More than ever.<br>\r\nAt that exact moment, Hayley heard a noise that she wasn't used too. Like a snap.<br>\r\nShe look down, showing a good double chin while doing it. It was the button of her jean that popped.<br>\r\n\"Yep, couldn't be more happy.<br>\r\n- Good. Cause I have something to tell you about our deal...\"</span></div></div>",

She was trying to organize the mess in her head. Her last few weeks had been pretty intense. Between the DIY brand new products launch, her personal problems, the tension with some employees, the partnership with a famous beautyshop, and now with the Mayo's products. She never had this kind of moments for herself in ages. <br>\r\nIt's been so long that it was almost like she forgot how to simply take care of herself.<br>\r\nThe only island of joy, or rather the only way to escape her everyday life were those Mayo's.<br>\r\nBut where joy comes, raised another problem : Mayo's as good as they were, were as fattening as they were good. She didn't weight herself in long time, she never did, but judging from what she saw she had easily gain 30 to 40 pounds in few days. An olympic record, but one she would have prefer to avoid. <br>\r\nShe thought that taking the IG pause might be the idea of the year, she'd avoid the body-shaming and all those kind of annoyances.<br>\r\nShe always was an advocate for acceptance, when it comes to body or the person itself. <br>\r\nBut she knew that you report on the Gram is not really what you had to endure in real life.<br>\r\n\"I'll write a last message later to explain my IG \"retirement\"\" she thought.<br>\r\nAs she turn on the side to catch her phone and she felt her bigger body following the movement. She wasn't used to it and felt weird. Maybe I should try to do something about it, before I reach a dead-end point. <br>\r\nAs she looks on the table to reach her phone, she saw the black bag of Mayo's that she unbagged earlier. <br>\r\nShe was supposed to throw it in the trash can but she was too curious about it to take such a drastic decision. She wanted to investigate it later. And she felt like the moment was well chosen. After all, she'd need a little bit of crispy courage to cut her IG for some time. <br>\r\nShe reached both her phone and the bag and catch 'em in both her hands. <br>\r\nShe read the information on the bag, the calorie incount seemed  high but she thought this would be the same as the others, the rest seemed okay, the only differences weree the size and the absence chips' pic on the bag, they tried to oversell te \"Ultra taste\" as something you would never forget. \"Maybe the new packaging is the radical mesure. Maybe I should keep it intact for the shooting after all. Call Betty and tell her I agree after all.\" But this whole Never seen before and unforgettable taste truly got her attention, her curious nature overtook her mind, and she really wanted to know how it tasted. Was it this marvelous? This unforgettable taste?<br>\r\n\"After all, I said that I wouldn't accept if this bags was included, so they don't expect me to come with it. So I can have a taste. What will it cost? A few pounds? <br>\r\nNothing different from the others.\" The pression was too great, a weak \"Don't do it\" coming from her commonsense crossed her mind, but her curiosity thought \"too late\" as her hand opened the bag by tearing it up. <br>\r\nThe biggest surprise about this mysterious bag came from inside : only one white chips. <br>\r\n\"What the, where's the rest? Did they forget to put other chips in it? Don't tell me that they ate some and remember that they had to sell it so they just put one in it.\" She straighten her bust, got up from her bed, and try to investigate in the box that she opened earlier. <br>\r\nNo traces of other chips thrown randomly in the bag, just some fill.<br>\r\n\"Okay now this is weird.\"<br>\r\nShe went back to her room, sat on her bed and put the bag in front of her with a whirlwind of questions turning inside her brain. \"Should I? After all this may be the best chips I'll have in my life. And now that I opened the bag, it may go to waste. And I clearly don't want it. After all, life is all avout discovery. \"<br>\r\nShe took the bag with her right hand, and caught the chips in the other hand.<br>\r\nShe brought it to her mouth and just let a last breath out.<br>\r\n*Crunch*</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>TMZ new video teases pictures of a HUGE star that was captured walking to her job appointment. <br>\r\nThe pics is blurred on the thumbnail, but you can guess that its an over 200 pounds blond celebrity that never skipped a meal.<br>\r\n\"If any of you thought this would be another pregnancy picture of an obese Jessica Simpson, or another yo-yo effect of Xtina or Rihanna, you can go to the back of the line (well not to far, the Rihanna news is next, spoiler alert she's in the 300 club). No, this is a new and unexpected one.\"<br>\r\nWhen the picture is revealed, it shows an absolutly humongous Hayley Williams.<br>\r\nShe's unrecognisable, she totally changed from head to toe.<br>\r\nA face is now a big round ball of fat with two chins, her neck hidden by it. Her breast are now up to a D-cup, and her belly is a mountains of rolls hanging far above her waistline. Her arms are as big as a Nia Jax on fat steroid. Her ass like over inflated beach ball (Nicky minaj style but naturally), her thighs are so huge they make her feet tiny and out of place. As always Hayley is seen eating another bag of chips from Mayo's. \"What happened to the Paramore'singer? We remember her from last week, looking rather curvy \" they show a picure of Hayley looking far skinnier but her belly pushing her shirt and forming a wheel of fat over a chino, her face being round with a little double chin, her ass being really round and big, and her arms being soft and jelly. \"A source told us that she's far over 200 pounds and keeps gaining like crazy. Put down the snack piggy or soon you'll have to roll.\"<br>\r\n\"This is bullshit\" Says Mike while shutting down Youtube.<br>\r\n\"I'm cool with my weight. Says an all relaxed Hayley. I dont see what's the big deal with it. *crunch*<br>\r\n- The big deal is that they have to insult your appearance. It's a lack of respect. We're in 2018, how can they talk like that.<br>\r\n- And I still don't give a single fuck about it *crunch*.<br>\r\n- I know that, and as long as you feel good in your body, who am I to judge.<br>\r\nHayley gave him a searching look, like her eyes are trying to capture his thought.<br>\r\n- Oh my god you think I'm too big. Cried Hayley in shock.<br>\r\n- I never said that.<br>\r\n- But you thought about it so hard tou practically said it.<br>\r\n- That's not true.<br>\r\n- Yes it is.<br>\r\n- Alright you want real talk, then let's get real fatso. You aren't doing any good to your body. You may don't care about your appearance, and I know that truth hurt. But I must tell you as a friend, as a family member, you're damaging your body.\"<br>\r\nSuddendly a huge Hayley got up from a weird sat position in the chair, and faced her friend face to face.<br>\r\n\"You do not get to tell me what I should do with my body. I am my own boss, I get to know what's good for me and right now, this, *she shows Mike the snack bag* this is what's good for me. And if ya can't handle that truth, my truth, then maybe we're not close as we thought we were. <br>\r\n- On that we agree. H-Bombs.<br>\r\n- Ooooh! Take it back.<br>\r\n- He he! Not a chance fatso!<br>\r\n-You're disgusting.\" Hayley said those world with tears and anger in her eyes. It felt as if the world was crumbling one more time in front of her. She felt like the hole in her heart, thisbhole that she tries so hard to feel, suddendly growing bigger, she then found herself eating her snack with violence, crying while doing it.<br>\r\nOn her way back home, she saw paparazzo trying to capitalize on her new bigger frame. <br>\r\n\"Is it good enough for you? He! Yeah take a good hard look at your favorite fatty.\" She threw a bag at them and fell on the floor while doing it, breaking her phone in the same moment.<br>\r\n\"How could it be any worse.?\"</span></div></div>",

Like a husband and a kid?<br>\r\n- No a dog and a licorn. Of course that kind of family.<br>\r\n- After all, she looked bigger the last time we saw be the media <br>\r\n- It was an eternity ago, like six months. And how superficial to you to judge someone's body.<br>\r\n- I'm not judging, it's just a fact. She was bigger. Why? Is it a crime to state facts?<br>\r\n- That's what all the fat shamers says.<br>\r\n- I'm not a... Argh! \"Then Michelle turns to Ashley, to find some support in her conversation, but she found out that someone fell victim to her craving.<br>\r\n\"Ash! What are you doing? Dont eat that!<br>\r\n- Seriously girls, that is awesome. You should taste one. <br>\r\n- No! We're here to deliver, no to eat it. <br>\r\n- There's enough bags for an army, I don't think that she'll notice. Plus there are so good. Don't expect me to stop. <br>\r\n- When its over, we'll report you. <br>\r\n- Ain't gonna stop me.<br>\r\n- As you wish fatso.<br>\r\n- See, again you're..<br>\r\n- Usssh we're here.<br>\r\nMichelle rang the door bell. <br>\r\nAfter a good minute of earing Ashley opening and eating a second bag of \"Ultra Tasty\", the door finally opened.<br>\r\n\"Hey Mayo's girls, you're here. Right on time.<br>\r\n- Are you miss... miss Williams.<br>\r\n- Yeah that's me.<br>\r\nMichelle and Laura couldn't believe their eyes as the third one was still unphazed, still eating.<br>\r\nHayley seemed to have tripled her size. <br>\r\nMichelle was trying to compare both pictures, this one that came from trash news on the webs six months ago.<br>\r\nWhere there used to be a round face, was now a huge ball of fat with a triple chin, her former muffin top that had caused scandal at the time had now deleopped in a mountain of fat. Her arms were humongous, like two overstuffed sausages trapped in her shirt. Her thighs were so big they made her feet look out of place. Her ass was so big it looked unreal, even Nicki Minaj would have dreamed to get an ass that big.<br>\r\nThe whole made her look morbidly obese.<br>\r\n\"I've been waiting all the morning for you girls. I quit my jobs so I won't miss any of your deliveries. Oh of course, I put on a little weight this months but it's worth the while.<br>\r\n- Church. Said Ashley between two eating noises. <br>\r\nMichelle and Laura looked at her in surprise as her clothes already looked thighter on her, especially on the belly that formes a muffin top in her already less loose shirt.<br>\r\nHayley suddenly had a look of anger and frustration toward the growing girl, as she felt she was emptying her command.<br>\r\n- I'm sorry, I'm a huge fan of yourse. I wanted to taste the same thing, that's all. Rubbing her stomach.<br>\r\n- It's alright. Said Hayley in a sudden change of attitude.<br>\r\n- So, here's your command mam', have a good week. See ya next time. <br>\r\n- Thank you ladies. Have a great time.\"<br>\r\nAs they were walking back to their truck<br>\r\n\" Next time Ashley, you eat at your place, not at work. <br>\r\nAshley pull a bag from a pocket of the shirt.<br>\r\n- We'll see. <br>\r\n- Oh my god. She'll finish the deliveries obese.<br>\r\n- And I still son't give a fuck about it.</span></div></div>",

But I'm always hungry these days. Plus, I don't see the big deal with my hunger, a well fed girl is a healthy girl. <br>\r\nAnd come at me about my weight, I already had to adjust some attitude at my workplace because of it.<br>\r\n- Hay, you know me well, I don't care about your weight. <br>\r\n- Thanks.<br>\r\n- But it's quite unusual to see you eat that much. How long has it been going on?<br>\r\n- I'd say, for about three months. Or since a certain someone left me hanging on a thread, taking my heart and soul with him.<br>\r\n- Oh girl, we already talked about that, there's no use in living that day over and over again. We're not in groundhog day. That won't help. Forget him and move on. I thought that your last album and tour served as a huge therapy for it.<br>\r\n- It did, but now that it's over, I need something to fill the void.<br>\r\n- Hayley..<br>\r\n- I saw my therapist last week, she was clear, I'm not totally healed, I'm still completely fucked. And I decided to live my life to the fullest. Go out more, laugh more, cry more, sing more and eat more.<br>\r\n- But, isn't finding a balance in life the whole point of this process. I mean, living life to the fullest was never really helpful to the suffering people. Maybe you should try to live with someone to keep an eye on you.<br>\r\n- Ya wanna be my mom?<br>\r\n- No, not like a mom, maybe more like a friend, that's here to give you a hand, and help you get back on track. Like a sister.<br>\r\n- Already got one, but I can give it a shot. I'll think about that buddy.\"<br>\r\nAs they signaled to the waiter that they were about to leave the place, Mary couldn't help but notice that fat deposit under Hayley's arms that was moving at every wave. Her mouth said that she didn't care, but her eyes couldn't stop staring at Hay from head to toe. Her once slim body had now an extra pudge to it. Her face was swollen, her cheeks were fulled and a double chin was starting to show. Her modest breast had grown to a C cup, as for her belly, it looks as if she was on the early stage of pregnancy, and her recent binge didn't help *there goes the candids on the trash news*. She had developed an ass, something Hayley never truly had before, and it was becoming a sizable one. Her thighs were beginning to touch and the button of her trousers was threatening to attack someone by popping in a face or in a glass. Hayley was getting quite big, but she thought that maybe she would try to do something about it if Hayley decide to accept her offer.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a hot day in the city of angels, one of many in the long summer of LA. Seasons passed, but the weather stay the same.<br>\r\nMary and Hayley hadn't talked to each other in weeks, and the first was still waiting for a sign of her friend. No call, no messages, no snap, she even stopped using her IG. Every day, Mary kept convincing herself hat Hay was okay, but she couldn't stop this feeling in her stomach, a soft ache, a reminder that not everything was rose with her pal recently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was contemplating another slow day, writing and soaking up the sun on her terrace. Mary decided to have a little party of her own, with people from the neighborhood. <br>\r\n\"Why should I give up on my social life for one girl that refuse a helping hand? she thought. After all, I'm not the one that needs help and my life's pretty freaking amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that evening, as everyone was enjoying some classic tunes on Spot, talking about their life, and simply having a good time being with each other, a solitary being turned this whole \"feel good\" moment upside down. <br>\r\n\" Hey everyone! *munch*<br>\r\n- Hay! How are you? You look....<br>\r\n- Like a fat mess yeah I know.<br>\r\n- Why do you diminish yourself again girl? I'm so happy to have you here! I haven't see you in ages, please tell me, what's up?\"<br>\r\nHayley looked down at herself \"Do I need to tell you what's up?\"<br>\r\nThe young woman had changed again since the last time they met. She wore her now yellow hair in leia style. But they looked greasy and all messed up as if she didn't take a shower in days. Her face was round, there was no other way to say it, it was as if her face was lost into her fatness. Her cheeks were huge and she now had a permanent double chin. Her huge neck was mostly covered by it. Her arms, made her jean jacket look like a second skin, they looked big and wobbly. Her belly was now a huge muffin top hanging over a trousers by far and forming a huge tire of fat. Her shirt was far too little for her size couldn't handle her new D cup breasts. <br>\r\nAs Hayley was turning on herself to show herself off to her friend and her guests, Mary go a good view of the huge love handles and back fat that took over Hayley's body. Her ass was humongous, atleast three times its normal size and her thighs were touching by far as she was wobbling now. <br>\r\nAs she put an end to her show, Hayley laughed, grabbed the bag of snacks in her hands, wrinkled it and threw it on her friend.<br>\r\n\"Okay, come on girl, we got to talk.\"<br>\r\nMary grabbed Hayley by the arm and got her to a more pivate space, so they can have this long awaited conversation.<br>\r\n\"Hayley! what's up with you? What about that show?<br>\r\n- My point is that I feel perfectly fine, thanks for asking.<br>\r\n- I've been waiting for your call for weeks, I've been ill, worrying that something might happen to you, I offered you a hand and all you do is coming here and trying to ridicule me?<br>\r\n- Oh excuse me! I forgot how important your little person was. <br>\r\n- Are you kidding me?<br>\r\n- Either way, I came here to tell you that I decline your offer. I don't need your help. I can handl this situation all alone. After all, I manage a lucrative business on my own, and it works well for me. <br>\r\n- Hayley, seriously, I don't know what happened to you these mast few weeks, or if somebody put something in your head, but I just want to help you.<br>\r\n- I'm not a weak little poney, I can think by myself. And I came to the conclusion that I'm better off alone. I don't need anyone to try to change who I am.<br>\r\n- I'm not here to change you. I'm here to bring you back from this dark place you seem to be lost in.<br>\r\n- To you it's a dark place, to me that's freedom. I can finally be me, and show to this world my stength and my success.<br>\r\n- Hay, I'm sorry to bring that on the table, we both know that it's usually not that important, but now is radical mesure for a hard time.<br>\r\nSuddenly, Mary point a finger at Hayley's belly, to the surprise of the least, and the disgust of the first.<br>\r\n\"Are tou fat-shaming me?<br>\r\n- Hayley, this is not a sign of your success, or of a certain freedom, this, is a sign of you losing once again against your old demons.<br>\r\n- What are you saying?<br>\r\n- You are the living example of an addict Hay. At first it was music, you couldn't help but work your ass off on your music, then you got that boy, and you almost gave up on everything for him. He was your dreams and your nightmares, but most importantly, he was your life. I understand, you felt like he was your whole, that he completed you. But then, he left, he broke up with you at the worst moment. You finally healed from your addictive personality, well almost, but he shattered everything and brought you back to the darkest corner of your mind. And this, this whole weighty situation is the proof that your demons are back and that you need to fight it. That something is missing in your life and that even if you're trying to fill it with work or with food it'll always slap you back right in the face, if it's by a low selling numbers, a lack of social life or a huge weight gain. <br>\r\nAnd you can try to hide it behind a false sense of rebellion or complaisance, it won't do it and you know it. I'm sorry, but you needed to hear it.\"<br>\r\nAt that exact moment, as Hayley was looking at her feet, her eyes covered by her messy hair, she suddenly slapped the taste out of her friend's mouth.<br>\r\n\"Ouch! What the... Hay!\"<br>\r\nThe second after, the young singer was hugging her friend strongly, having big tears running across her huge cheeks. <br>\r\n\" I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do this. Why am I so weak?\"<br>\r\nShe fell on her knees like a fat kid crying after being mean to someone. Mary took her friend in her arms.<br>\r\n- Hay, it's alright, life's been pretty harsh to you. It crushed you when you least expected it and it hurts. It takes time to heal, but you can count on me and the others to try to help you. Just give us a chance.\"<br>\r\nAs she was trying to calm her friend down, Mary began to sing one of Hayley' song \"It's just a spark, but its enough, to keep me goin'.\"</span></div></div>",
