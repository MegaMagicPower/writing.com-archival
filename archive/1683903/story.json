Inside were candies and treats galore. He patted his chubby tummy and thought, \"Well after all the dancing I did tonight, I deserve to treat myself a little.\" He reached in and grabbed three Hershey bars. Justin went over to his bed and, with a lot of effort, forced  the T-Shirt he had been wearing off of his body. His tits and stomach jiggled. Slowly, he popped each corner of each Hershey bar into his eager, watering mouth. He scoffed them all down in just two minutes. <span style=\"line-height:1.2;\"></span> Feeling stuffed and satisfied, he quietly went to sleep.</span></span></div></div>",

He tried to put on his favorite pair of jeans, but couldn't get them past his kneecaps. Justin's chubby thighs wouldn't let them up. Assuming they shrunk in the laundry, he put on the largest pair of sweat pants he owned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin looked excitedly over the room service menu like a wolf hungry for prey. He called up room service and demanded a huge breakfast. When the hotel waiters arrived at the room, Justin sat at the head of the table in his room waiting like a prince. He was a celebrity after all. The waiters treated him like royalty. They gave a stack of pancakes, which he tore through, and an omelet, which he ate with great speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he lifted his chubby hand and gestured to the waiters to clear away the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then....</span></div></div>",

Dad... anyone around?\" he called out peering into various rooms on his way past until he reached the kitchen, the answering machine was flashing, \"that's a no then\" he said to himself, leaning over to push the button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justin honey\" Justin smiled at the sound of his mothers voice, \"we're not going to be able to make it to the villa this week, if you can't amuse yourself then give Sandra a call, she's got plenty of activities that you could do. Alright, lots of love... see you soon.\" It was his week of rest and relaxation, calling Sandra, his PA, sounded as attractive as watching grass grow, he smirked happily, an entire week to himself almost sounded to good to be true, he headed toward the fridge and shuffled around to see what to have: fruit, cereal or bread?  'naa', then his eyes lit up as he spied a victoria sponge, as he pulled it out of the fridge and placed it on the counter he looked at the clock - 10am, meh, whats wrong with sugar, and 'taste' in the morning, he cut a rather large slice, drenched it with double cream and took it to the lounge and sat down in front of the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis bites were surprisingly large for such a small mouth, one of the perks from being free from public view.

I'll drop this weight as soon as I go back on tour again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say Justin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was raining out so Justin suggested they chill at home. All day Justin and Ethan watched tv; Justin was pigging out on lots of junk food - cheesecake, ice cream, chocolates, fudge, candy. It was the end of the day now but he was still shirtless. Justin finally got up off the couch - full and bloated - and stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooof\" Justin as he slapped his belly. \"Whaddya think Ethan, looks like I did some damage, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan just laughed. \"Yo, my mom wants me to be home for dinner so I gotta run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright see ya later man.\" Justin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Ethan left Justin went into the bathroom. He looked into the mirror and grabbed the lower roll of his belly. \"Ehh, 10 lbs is nothin' he thought to himself. I'm hot no matter what  - I'm Justin Bieber!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTired, he got out of the bathroom, jumped in his bed and went to sleep. He woke up and looked out his window, the sun was shining - it was a beautiful summer day. Justin got up out of bed, with each step he took his belly and butt jiggled. Naturally, he was hungry. Justin thought about what he could have for breakfast; eggs, cereal, toast. \"I don't want any of that\" he said to himself. He opened his refrigerator and grabbed some milk, after he poured himself a glass Justin put back the milk. But something caught his eye <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh I still have half of my cheesecake left! Score!\" Justin ate it in no-time. When he was done he felt his shorts putting strain on his waist. \"They must've just shrunk in the wash\" Justin thought to himself. Overnight more fat developed in Justin's belly. He now had two rolls whenever he sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I do today?\"</span></div></div>",

Once around he got them on he felt pressure around his waist and his butt was causing the fabric to stretch. \"What the hell! My washing machine is shrinking everything!\" \"Ughh I cant freakin' tie this!\"Justin sucks in his gut and finally is able to tie a knot. \"There we go!\" he says with relief.

Ethan rolls his eyes, and jumps in the water. Justin finishes putting on his sunscreen and lays down on his towel. He begins to feel the sun soaking into his skin. \"Ahh, this is the life!\" said Justin. An hour as passed and since, Justin fell asleep. Ethan comes out of the water and walks up to a sleeping Justin. \"Hey, wanna go on a walk?\" But then he soon realizes his friend is passed out. \"Guess, I'm gonna half to take a walk by myself\" Ethan says with a sigh. Justin wakes up a half an hour later, and looks around for Ethan. \"Where the hell is he?\" Justin says to himself. \"Blah, it's so fucking hot out!\" he says in an exhausted tone. \"I need a drink.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walks over to the snack-shack, luckily no one is in the line so he'll be free of screaming fans. Justin approaches the counter, \"Hi, can I get a bottle of water please.\" \"Sure thing!\" the employee says. Justin takes out his wallet to pay and the employee hands him the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD, you're Justin Bieber!!! \"I'm such a huge fan, you dont have to pay, its fine!\" she exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thanks!\" says Justin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Would you like anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin glances at the menu, eyes lighting up as he sees all the different flavors of ice cream.

Have a great day!\" the employee says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin goes over to the benches and sits down. He digs into his ice cream \"Man, this is good!\" Halfway through eating his ice cream, Justin un-ties his trunks and his belly pushes out. \"Ahh that feels so much better.\" Justin says with a sigh of relief. He sees Ethan in the distance walking towards the snack-shack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan! You gotta get some of this ice cream. It's blazin'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justin, you're eating AGAIN?!\" Ethan says astonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you know how much I love cotton candy ice cream!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, but...its just that, you're beginning to really let yourself go\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'm talking about this\" said Ethan grabbing Justin's belly fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan, for the last time, it's nothing! I'll drop this weight when I go back on tour. I gotta live a litte while I'm on my break, you know? Now, stop worrying about my figure, ok?\" However, Justin didn't realize that what used to be only a little flab was now developing into a fully-sized gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright.\" said Ethan \"Well, I'm gonna go back in the water now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'm gonna finish my ice cream real quick and then I'll be right there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin finishes his ice cream.

I'm not allowed to eat like this while I'm on tour because I need to stay in shape. All this junk food isn't good for me - look\" He grabbed the lower part of his belly and shook it. \"See? I have all this extra skin now\" Justin sat up on the couch and sucked in his gut \"I used to be skinny and now im getting fat!\" he says pushing his belly out. \"My belly even jiggles a little bit when I walk\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least you still fit into your clothes\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My shorts are getting tight though and my stomach hangs over them when I sit.

I'm not even full yet!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, you can have the rest of mine\" said Ethan with slight disgust as he handed his plate to Justin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" He finished within minutes. Justin sipped his coke. \"I think I'm gonna get another five-stack of what I ordered before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ordered a second plate. Ethan was speechless, he never thought Justin could eat this much. The waitress came back with Justin's food - \"here you go\" she said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again!\" said Justin, he began to dig in. Ethan looked around trying not to stare at his friend. He noticed Justin's belly was pushing against his shorts causing them to strain. Justin finished his last pancake \"Man, those were good\" he belched. Ethan suddenly felt something hit his knee \"Ow! What the hell?\" Justin's shorts burst open and the button had hit Ethan's knee, which made his shirt ride up past his navel. He didn't even realize until Ethan said something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justin, look\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" He looked down to see his shorts burst open and his belly exposed. \"Oh my god!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's what you get for eating like, fifteen pancakes\" Ethan said in a snarky tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should go.\"Justin placed a five dollar bill on the table for the waitress as tip and then hurried out the door for his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gotta start doing some sit-ups dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shutup Ethan, those shorts were old anyhow\" Justin was really embarrassed. \"We need to go to my house so I can change\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What we going to watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got Family Guy on at the moment\" Ethan said passing Justin the remote control, he lifted his feet off the table and grabbed a packet of prawn cocktail crisps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool.\" Justin grabbed a packet of crisps himself, and glanced at Ethan before turning back to the TV, after a couple of seconds he tugged the end of the sleeve of Ethan's shirt, \"loose the shirt mate, it's boiling\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan blushed, \"you know I'm shy about taking my shirt off\" he said, it didn't seem a very practical reason, it was scorching and his shirt was making him slightly sweaty, though an excuse it wasn't a lie. He wasn't outgoing like Justin, and didn't take his shirt off unless the situation made it unavoidable, such as at the beach or pool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Eth, it's me... you're not shy with me\" Justin symbiotic pulled the end of Ethan's shirt up slightly \"don't do it if your really that bothered, I don't want you to get so hot that you make your self I'll. I can't believe you wore a hoodie out\" he chuckled slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, your quite right!\" Ethan agreed, as he pulled his striped shirt off and flicked it behind the sofa.

After a lengthy search through hundreds of channels they settled on an episode of Scrubs, neither of their favourite programme, but it's better than what else is on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin leant forward and grapped a knife and slide the cake towards him. \"Cake? Ethan..\" he asked after he cut a sizeable slice that almost included a third of the cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm... sure, thanks.\" Ethan said, he looked at Justin cut him a slice; \"Cheers\" he said as Justin passed him equally sizable slice, he took a bite out of the front, after a few minuets he finished it, unable to put it down for lack of plate, he looked to the other side of the sofa as Justin who had finished a good minuet before him. \"Great cake\" Ethan said in total honesty.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, it's store bought I think\" Justin chuckled, looking at his shirtless best friend. \"seems i'm not the only one who's gained a few pounds\" Justin said as he stretched his arm over and grabbed a small role of flab of Ethan's stomach, which to Justin's surprise looked significantly  softer than when he last saw it, though he was far from fat, Ethan's slender body's puppy fat had grown into a proper belly, though in truth, Ethan's body was still very slim. Justin shook Ethan's belly role slightly and took the opertunity to prod his finger into Ethan's stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hardly surprising, usually when you've eaten recently I've been there\" He smiled shyly, patting his stomach \"though I must admit that I thought my metabolism would prevent me from getting fat\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm only kidding Ethan, your not fat... your not even Chubby.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" Ethan said putting his arm round his best friend, \"your not really fat either, but you are chubby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...

You\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said I must be about 140 still, perhaps a couple more pounds...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly? Let's see then\" Ethan suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, gotta check at some time. Perhaps I can still drop to 130 pounds\" Justin said rising from his seat, his belly juggling as he made his sudden movement. He jogged upstairs and carried down the digital scales and placed them on the floor to the side of the sofa and stepped on. Ethan could see him tence up at the scales calculated Justin's weight, after a couple of seconds the numbers 154 appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, no wonder your shorts split\" Ethan said with completely serious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did I gain another 14 pounds in a month?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have eaten ALLOT Jusin\" Ethan replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not THAT much\" Justin said with ever so slight sense of indignation, \"you've eaten quite a bit too, your belly soft... you must have gained too\" he said walking over to Ethan. \"Come one, get up you too\" Justin grabbed Ethan's arm and attempted to pull him up, Ethan responded by smiling and pulling back. \"Ow\" Justin laughed as he fell forward onto Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"haha, I'm stronger than you\" Ethan laughed, secretly savouring Justin's bare body touching his own bare chest, Justin tilted back and place both hands on Ethan's midriff, and lifted Ethan up. Justin leant back to gain momentum and he successfully lifted Ethan off the sofa.as  \"wow, your still strong yourself\" Ethan said as he found his footing. \"Okay, okay.\" I'll step on the scales, he lifted one foot to get on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on\" Justin said as he walked toward Ethan, suddenly, and unexpectedly he pulled down Ethan's jeans from the knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oy!!\" Ethan exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I weighed myself without trousers, they add a good pound or too\" Justin said reasonably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay, then. I'm getting on\" Ethan turned slightly, after that tussle he was fully erect and he did his best to hide it with his hands. After a couple of seconds of calculations, the scales brought up 142.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, look mate. Your more than I was when you last made me weigh my self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan was genuinely shocked, he looked down in disbelief, \"I am taller than you though\" he pointed out, though still he couldn't believe it, though the amount of times he had snacked just because Justin was binging. Truth be told, he thought that Justin should have weighed more, judging by the size of his stomach and the amount he ate. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we could both do with some gym time\" Justin said with glee, prodding both his own soft belly flab, and Ethan's softening belly at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan gained into Justin's eyes, luckely  Justin hadn't noticed his slightly obvious erection, or he'd deliberately ignored it. Disappointingly, despite the intimate body contact, Justin showed no erection himself. </span></div></div>",

Upstairs Justin opened his walldrobe and tossed Ethan a pair of light shorts and a baggy shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheers\" Ethan said, almost instantaneously putting them on, the shorts were very snug at the waste but the shirt comfortably and baggy, he resisted the urge of saying anything about the shorts as he didn't want Justin mentioning his stomach fat, that he felt self-concious about, hidden bellow the long baggy shorts he could feel his belly almost over lapping the shorts. He may have more stomach fat than he'd like but he wasn't that chubby, he was sure that even when Justin and he were both skinny that these wouldn't have fitted, they must be a good few years old. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at Justin putting trying on a third pair of shorts, after struggling to do the button of the other two up. This jet black pair had no button, and just elastic, and had no chance of braking. Ethan gazed at Justin, his belly was clearly hanging over the shorts by almost an inch, and this was standing up, finally he chose a shirt from the 6 he had out, selecting a baggy white polo which complete hid his stomach, and the shape of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good choice Justin, completely hides your belly flab\" Ethan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My stomachs not that big, it doesn't need hiding\" Justin said seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That two thirds of a cake and all those pancakes you ate says otherwise\" Ethan joked, prodding Justin's belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I can loose it easily.

Ethan rubbed his own rumbling stomach, he thought of his very skinny body as it was a couple of months ago, and felt the soft belly fat, now growing slowly on his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked at Justin as he sat down, the PJ's he was wearing were clearly too small, and his belly was visable hanging over his boxer, he wondered if Justin had noticed. Looking at the Pizza Ethan thought of Justin's singing, the baby faced heart throb persona would be greatly damaged if Justin kept getting fatter, at the moment he could just about pull it off Justin thought, though... he had to talk to Justin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pizza\" Justin said, offering Ethan to dig in, as he pushed play on the film.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great\" Ethan replied putting a piece in his mouth. If he was going to talk to Justin, then perhaps Justin eating so much fatterning food before hand might not be the best idea. He chomped his piece down rather quickly and started another, whilst justin was still only half way though. To stop Justin from putting on more weight, he would eat as much of the Pizza as he could, depriving Justin of his usual majority share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, the film's creidts rolled and Ethan's stomach ached, he had had about 2/3s of the pizza, he undid the buttons on his trousers to give his bloated stomach some freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on fatty\" He joked, prodding ethans aching belly, \"and you accuse me of eating to much, you must have eaten more than me\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\" Ethan muttered, \"I was hungry\" he tried to inject some humour, so that Justin would take it lightly, as he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm already getting a bit to chubby\" Justin said, \"we don't want you to get fat too, because of me\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan could't help but see the irony. The two settled to watch another film, this time with out snacks, they both snuggled into opposite ends of the sofa, Ethan rolled his shirt up in a futile attempt to make it ache less, as Justin thew his behind the sofa.  Was this the only way Justin could relax, Ethan thought, as a simile came across his face.</span></div></div>",

What could he say to Justin to convince him that what he was doing was wrong, whether it was a truly a gesture of affection or act of depression and desperation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone began to ring as Ethan finally pressed dial, his heart pace increased at every ring as his nervousness grew, finally it went to voice mail, \"Hey... Justin. You can't give up your career, it's what your good at, it's what you love.

He was now at a loss of what to do with himself, part of him wanted to watch the news and what people were saying and speculating on the news of Justin's retirement, on the other hand it would be painful to watch. The few minuets he watched showed the lack of influence Justin's agents had in the press conference. Perhaps his Agents could convince the press and public that it was a spur of the moment decision that Justin had since gone back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan sighed, seconds felt like minuets as he waited for what seemed like hours for Justin to reply, from across the room he saw his phone screen flash and vibrate, without pause he rushed toward the phone picking it up and grasping it tightly in his hand, with great apprehension he typed in the pin and saw that the new text message was from Justin, once again his heart was racing as it opened. It was short, relatively, reading: **Srry Ethan, it nt ur fault. Pls cm to my hous. Justin**.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe breathed hard as he pondered what to do, the text message said almost what he was expecting. Should he go around to Justin's house to talk it over, or text him back.

Looking up at the door, Ethan tried to regain some composure before finally tapping lightly three times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin 30 seconds the door flung open to reveal Justin on the other side of, he didn't look as bad as Ethan was expecting. \"Hello Ethan\" he said, his tone relatively casual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aright Justin\" Ethan said as he followed Justin into the house, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should tell you Ethan, my Agents here. They're trying to figure a way to undo the mess I created with my resignation this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Ethan said, with genuine interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently my contract doesn't allow such a snap resignation\" He said with a despondent sense of sarcasm in his voice. \"Anyway, come in my Agent's in the lounge\" Justin guided Ethan to a section of the house he didn't often see, a rather formal lounge. \"Ethan, this is my agent, Clara Wintor. Clara this is my friend Ethan\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasure\" the smartly dressed women said in rather refined British accent, this women was one of the best agents there were, I can't imagine she was too impressed with Justin's sudden resignation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleased to meet you\" Ethan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've spoken a contact at the record contract, if we persuade them this is only a 'break' then we should be able to avoid a law suit\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A break, for what?\" Justin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" she reached into her bag and lifted out a promotional image taken about a year ago. \"This is quite possibly your most important picture, it represents your greatest success. It was the record company greatest income.. ever. If we can convince the record company that you intend to again return to this appearance, they would agree to a legitimate break which could then be spun to the press.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Return to that appearance?\" Justin looked at the image<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I've got that outfit and your personal details which were taken at the time. Put on the outfit, and I'll photograph you and then retake your personal details.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\" Justin said, slightly perplexed, he grabbed the outfit and stepped out of the room and slipped his shirt and trousers onto the floor. He first pulled up the red skinny jeans, he had to get this on the best he could, his weight was barely an issue and the record company should know that, he sighed. He fully loosened the elastic waste cord which allowed him to button them up though it was incredibly tight. He pulled on the shirt and walked back into the room as he buttoned it up, this too was incredibly hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan looked at Justin, the tight jeans made his Belly hang look worse than normal, and the shirt didn't hide it that well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this really necessary?\" Justin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does\" his agent replied bluntly \"this image shows the clothing really loosely fitting, and it was only taken a year ago. Now you can barely fit into them.\" After measuring his waste, height and the like she finally instructed Justin to step on the scales. The figure displayed 156. She added the new figures opposite those taken a year ago, at his last checkup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nName: Justin Bieber <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------2011 ------- 2012 -------------<br>\r\nHeight:  5'10\"         5'10\"        <br>\r\nWeight: 128 lbs     156 lbs<br>\r\nWaist:  28\"            33\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin was quite surprised by the figures, though he new he should be.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ethan had originally almost almost poked fun at Justin's 'back up dinner', but these Pizza Express takeaway pizzas were far far nicer than the takeaway pizzas he usually had. And not before time, his bad night last night had meant it had been ages since he last ate, he downed the pizza slices as a surprising pace, almost faster than Justin did. They both ate and drank with only one hand, as they had there arm around one another's waist with barely an inch between them. An arm around you is unsurprisingly not a compatible way to sit, but Ethan like Justin insisted on sitting like this regardless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*1.5 hours later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe end credits rolled up the screen as the film ended; Justin swallowed his last bit of pizza and Ethan took the final bites in his. The fast pace they had started their pizza had gradually slowed as the film went on and they savoured the food more. Justin had slowed down first, and surprisingly Ethan ended up eating one slice of Justin's pizza. A fact that Justin had noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great film, almost a year old and I hadn't seen it yet\" Ethan commented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same for me\" Justin added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for the food and everything Justin. It was great\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for my super cute boyfriend\" Justin turned his head and kissed Ethan straight on the lips. The kiss lasted almost a minuet as the two reluctantly broke away and smiled sheepishly at one another. Justin rubbed Ethan's chest soothingly as the two lent back on the sofa, Justin picked up the remote and returned to the TV guide to see what was on, as he carried on rubbing Ethan's chest the cotten shirt dragged his hand up slightly as to Justin's amazement Ethan pulled of his shirt. He wondered for a second if Ethan had taken his hint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the sitting position Justin's belly hungover his waist further than when standing, the same, he noticed, went for Ethan as Justin noticed a fairly substantial roll of flab over his waist as he sat back in to the chair. Ethan was obviously less aware of it, as he had always been shy about taking his clothes off. Didn't mean Justin couldn't poke fun, however. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See as I said earlier Eth... if you always did your cooking you wouldn't have this chubby belly\" He pinched a good inch of it and wobbled it. \"Told you I could feel your belly!\" Justin said with excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan was surprised that Justin was now able to make fun of his weight, he was shocked at the size of his belly... which could no longer be described 'skinny', he doubted he could even think of himself as slender. \"You were right! I guess I've put on a few more pounds than I thought.\" Ethan said shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your shirt may have hidden it well from everyone else, but not from me\" Justin said rubbing Ethan's soft stomach, he suddenly tipped Eithan over... they lay on the sofa, Ethan facing towards Justin and the TV, Justin facing Ethan and the back of the sofa. The two kissed briefly and Ethan started rubbing Justin's stomach. Justin thought he wouldn't poke fun any more, \"Your soft slender belly is perfect Ethan, your whole body is perfect. You're not fat really\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww... Thanks Justin\" Ethan smiled sweetly, \"I'm not silm though! This IS fat\" Ethan said poking his own belly and chuckling. </span></div></div>",

You're the one who gained, like, thirty pounds!\" Ethan exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true - Justin really had filled out quite a bit. His hips have gotten bigger and his love-handles are defined. His previously tight ass is now huge. His cheeks are bigger and he has a slight double-chin. But, worst of all, was his belly. Almost all the weight Justin had put on went straight to his gut. The pop star's once flat, toned stomach has become fat and flabby. It jiggles with every step he took. It sticks out far and hangs over his pants by a couple inches and when he sits down his gut forms into three soft rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may be getting fat but at least I don't have rolls like you!\" Ethan said as he grabbed one of Justin's squishy fat rolls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shut up\" said Justin, with slight embarrassment. \"Besides, you know you love it.\" he said, slapping his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, I can't deny that.

I could go for some desert.\" Justin had a large grin on his face now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! I <i>knew</i> you were going to say that!\" Ethan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know me too well\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause in the conversation, however, Justin soon broke the silence. \"Sooooo, yea, whaddya want?!\" he eagerly said. Ethan thought about it - he didn't have any room for desert - but he'd do anything for Justin. \"Uhh...I don't know. Whatever you want is fine with me!\" Justin grinned, \"Hmm, I want...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Justin decide to eat?</span></div></div>",

But in the back of his head, Ethan knew he couldn't eat half the cake. He was already so bloated that his belt had popped off. Plus, this cake was <i>huge</i>! It was the biggest chocolate cake he'd ever seen. It had three different layers, each one separated with peanut butter - chocolate fudge. It was entirely covered in a rich, creamy frosting, drizzled with hot chocolate sauce, and sprinkled with powdered sugar. Justin placed the cake on the table in front of them and sliced it in half, giving himself one piece and Ethan the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been saving this.\" Justin said with a large grin across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see why!\" said Ethan \"This looks delicious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Ethan could finish his sentence Justin had already started to pig out. He broke his piece in two with his hands and began eating instantly. As Justin seemed to be - what looked like - inhaling his cake, he was also making a mess of himself. He got chocolate frosting all over his mouth and fingers. Ethan cut himself a small piece to eat and took a little bite. But after he swallowed his chew he began to feel sick and quickly put the cake down. He opened his mouth to tell Justin that he couldn't eat anymore but as he looked up he saw that his friend was already pigging out on his second piece. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan's jaw dropped - astonished that Justin had already begun eating his second piece. As Justin was chowing down, Ethan stared with amazement and a strong attraction. Justin was sitting on the couch next to Ethan, devouring his cake. He'd gotten chocolate all over himself; including his belly which looked like it was getting bigger. Ethan couldn't take his eyes of Justin, especially his gut. While sitting Justin's belly formed into three soft fat rolls and hung far over his pants. Ethan loved watching Justin eat; it was a big turn-on for him - he couldn't stop thinking about how tonight's dinner and this immense chocolate cake would add more fat to Justin's belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin had now finished both pieces of his cake. He looked down at his gut realizing how much of a mess he'd made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I uh...made a big mess of myself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure did\" Ethan said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin looked over at Ethan and then at his half of the cake, which looked like it had barely been touched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not gonna eat your cake?!\" Justin asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I can't. I had a small piece - and its really good - but I can't have anymore. Im starting to feel kind of sick, and if I ate anymore of this cake I'd throw up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, ok. Well I'm not going force you to eat it\" Justin said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" Ethan replied, also with a smile. \"This is too good to go to waste though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, I know. What should we do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" There was a pause in the conversation as the two bloated boys sat in silence, both staring at the cake. Ethan then spoke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should eat it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Are you serious?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, I know you can do it - big boy\" Ethan said sticking a finger deep into Justin's belly. Justin thought about it for a little, then finally said something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dare me too?\" He said, grinning<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan leaned in and kissed him on the cheek and simply replied \"Yes\"</span></div></div>",

As he did, Ethan stared, shocked that Justin was able to continue eating. He had both ate an entire large margarita pizza and half of this enormous chocolate cake, only in a timespan of and fifteen minutes! And it looked like he was going to finish the other half of the cake as well, Justin seemed to have absolutely no problem devouring it. After five minutes - pausing occasionally to belch - he finished the first piece. \"Almost done!\" he said, then quickly began eating the last piece of cake. Ethan couldn't believe Justin was actually <i>still</i> eating! \"Wow, no wonder he gained thirty pounds so quick...\" he thought to himself\" After another five minutes had passed, Justin finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh</i>...<i>my</i>...<i>god</i>!\" Ethan exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Justin asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just ate a whole pizza and that entire chocolate cake - by yourself!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, I know.\" Justin chuckled \"I'm pretty surprised myself.\" He then looked down at his stomach - \"Holy shit Eth, my belly is huge now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kidding\" Ethan said in total honesty \"You look pregnant!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shutup\" Justin replied, however he couldn't help but smile. \"Ah, I feel so fat! I bet I just gained, like, five pounds\" he said, slapping his bloated gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not necessarily a bad thing. Just means, more to love\" Ethan said, adding a wink. \"Want me to rub your belly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan placed his hand on Justin's gut and started to massage. The fat on his belly made it feel so soft. Justin closed his eyes and soon fell asleep as Ethan continued rubbing his belly in circular motions. He paused to get up and go to the bathroom; when he came back Justin was still knocked out, sleeping like a baby. He was slouched down on the sofa, breathing heavily, legs up on the table in front of him with his head on a pillow. Standing over him Ethan gazed at Justin - he thought he looked adorable right now, asleep on the couch - then sat down beside him. Ethan patted Justin's belly and kissed him on the cheek. He laid his head on Justin's shoulder, closed his eyes and soon fell asleep<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not only did the creamy icing, chocolate source and sprinkled icing sugar make this cake incredibly rich and sickly, but his stomach was so bloated that he had unbuttoned his trousers so that his belly wasn't constrained. He could barely finish this slice, let alone the whole cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give up!\" Ethan asked with a grin on his face, he looked at Justin's bloated stomach that now appeared so round that it resembled a football. Strange that despite Justin's fatter belly, and incredibly bloated stomach, that his trousers hadn't burst open, unlike Ethan's own belt which had embarrassingly burst open, revealing a larger, podgier belly than Ethan liked to admit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet...\" Justin cried as he picked up a fourth slice and attempted to shove it in his mouth in one go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" Ethan poked Justin's belly, his figure sinking in only very slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit it\" Justin brushed Ethan's finger out the way, as he once again attempted to shove the whole slice in his mouth. He attempted to swallow, but what was in his hands just crumbled all over the place as he finally leant back and confided surrender. \"You win\" he commented with a touch of both humour and annoyance his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yey! Do I get a prize?\" Ethan said sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... as your prize you get to carry a celebrity to his bedroom\" a wide smile spread over Justin's face, \"the celebrity I've chosen is Justin Bieber!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll pass!\" Ethan replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You kidding, my fans would die for this opportunity\" Justin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they'd DIE undertaking this fantastic opportunity\" Ethan retorted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I seem to recall a fat boy's belt bursting open this evening, it wasn't mine...\" He laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touch\u00e9\" Ethan replied, slightly embarrassedly. \"Alright then\" He approached Justin and lifted him, originally going for a fireman's lift, but instead just holding in his arms. Justin put his arms around Ethan and kissed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" he said cheekily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan sidled out from the sofa, and headed slowly to the door careful not to hurt himself, or drop Justin; before he got very far his shorts fell down, he was now wearing nothing but boxers and a pair of socks. He carefully lifted his legs up as he was careful not to trip, from there he made swift progress to the top of the stares before he colapsed at the top of the stairs, causing Justin to fall ontop of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hadn't realised how heavy you are Justin\" he was breathing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you did\" Justin said. The two were lying uncomfortably on the landing and the top of the stars. Both there bellies were bloated and were pressing against one another, 'this was far more comfortable when both bellies were soft and unbloated', Justin thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Justin lay Ethan gently on his double bed, and breathed out heavily; Ethan was heavy, heavier than Justin was expecting, and putting him down was a relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got here\" Ethan said tiredly, smiling boyishly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin smiled back and sat on the bed in front of Ethan and softly placed his hand on Ethan's stomach, the bloating was going down and unlike Justin's own it was feeling soft and looking less round.

The extra fat hadn't changed him that much ironically, with all his clothes on it would be hard to notice a belly, which is almost bulging when his shirt is removed. Whilst Justin's other features had remained reasonably thin, his weight was noticeable with clothes, allot of his shirts left little to the imagination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan took Justin's hand and patted his own belly, \"I'm sorry that this extra weight stained you on the way up\" he said sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It didn't\" Justin smiled, briefly before rolling over Ethan to the other side of the bed, only to snuggle up to Ethan who turned so there bellies were touching. He had an erection, it was such a relief not to hide it.

Standing in front of the window he could see the outline of a figure; at first his common sense told him it was Justin, but this figure was bigger, dressed in garish jogging bottoms and a denim Jack.... wait, he has a camera. His heart started pounding as he came to the realisation of the presence of this intruder, he surreptitiously closed his eyes so's to pretend to be a sleep. What was this wierdo doing here? A nutjob fan of Justin's... a photographer. Paparazi! he quickly assumed, he attempted to bury his head in the pillow to obscure his identity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man had circled the room to gather a good range of photographs before he slipped back out of the window. Ethan figured their sleeping was better than him getting photographs of them challenging him. He launched himself off the bed and shut the window, in a frezi he reached inside Justin's wardrobe and lifted out a shirt and trousers and headed to the ensuite bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could see his reflection in the massive mirror, his soft flabby stomach, deepened belly button, love handels and the onset of moobs, though fortunately these were physically notable. He still felt self conscious about his weight, and now he could potentially be pictured for the world to see. Justin's weight had been publicly photographed already, while this situation was very different, it hadn't bothered him that much. Ethan let out a deep sigh as he pulled up Justin's red trousers, when they reached his weight he tried to b them up, he had expected them to fit loosely on him, but he was struggling to connect them. These must be an older pair of Justin's, after a minuet of struggling and breathing in Ethan got them on, they were tight and as they pressed down just bellow his belly they made him look fatter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan looked in the mirror once more, these trousers actually made him belly hang over when standing. \"Shit\", he muttered under his breath. After a moment of contemplation he spied a pair of digital scales under the sink and pulled them out and hopped straight on. He looked down in apprehension as the scales calculated his work. As he remembered his weight about a month back, when he last weighed himself was about 142, he could hear Justin pushing the door open as he looked down at the figure than had now appeared. </span></div></div>",

Sure he'd started getting podgy even before he got close to Justin, but he'd gained weight at a far faster rate since. So far it was only his belly that had taken the change, the rest of his body was still relatively thin, which in Ethan's eyes made his stomach look all the more bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, 151\" Justin commented placing his hands on Ethan's midriff \"finding this harder to hide\" he added jiggling Ethan's flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's much higher than I was expecting\" Ethan replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't even fit into my old trousers by the look of it now\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" Ethan croaked, placing his hand on his belly and wobbling it slightly, and looking in the mirror at himself. He looked across at his boyfriend, Ethan was comparatively thinner, though the difference wasn't as much as it once was. Justin's belly looked rounder, and as Ethan could feel as he put his arm around Justin, it was very soft.

Being chubby is far less work than working out all day, until my I return to my tour circuit. Taster too.\" Justin smiled and stepped on the scales himself, 158. Only 3 pounds, a third of what Ethan had gained, but he still weighed more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad considering how much I've eaten\" Justin joked patting his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justin....\"</span></div></div>",

He left the bathroom and went back into the bedroom, he loosely slipped on a tee shirt and slowly headed downstairs. Ethan chewed on his lip as he wondered what he was going to do. Fortunatly the earliest they would go to print was for tomorrows issue, and they wouldn't end up on the internet... the photographer would make no money that way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\nJustin combed his hair back into place and looked around to see that Ethan had left, he was behaving rather odd. It was obvious to even an idiot that Ethan wasn't comfortable with his body, the extra weight bothered him far more than it did Justin. Though Ethan had always been uncomfortable and embarrassed when showing his bare body, which explains why Justin rarely saw it growing up, even the hot and sunny climes. This was much unlike Justin of course, he had never been shy about his body; even before finding fame he'd never been apprehensive about showing his bare body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough this was duel sided, whilst Justin wasn't even close to being overweight he had gotten really chubby and seemed unable to see any significance, he seemed sure that he could loose it easily and that his fans would still love him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan...\" Justin called, he walked into his room and changed his boxers for a pair of briefs, the first underwear that came to hand. He momentarily pondered getting any more dressed, but looked out the window at the blazing sun and trotted happy down the stairs instead. \"Ethan\" He called again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep\" Ethan called from the garden; Ethan liked the garden it was secluded, free from prying eyes and there was a lovely breeze in the air, he'd seen a message from Justin's agent who was 'stopping by' this morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are\" Justin said, he held a glass of orange juice, Ethan looked at him, with divided emotions.  One one hand, he had an erection seeing his gorgeous boyfriend's almost nude body in the beautiful sun shine; on the other hand the briefs really highlighted Justin's belly... did Justin realise? While Ethan found him really attractive, he couldn't help thinking about the photo, and Justin's career. He thought back to last summer, Ethan had been really skinny, but Justin had been thin and toned.. one of the most attractive boys in the western world. He had carried of being able to where what ever he liked, and he had often worn at little as underwear in front of Ethan, long before either accepted their sexuality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justin...\" Ethan started.  </span></div></div>",

Wonder what she wants?\" Justin said as he approached the hall's intercom, he looked at the screen which showed it was indeed Clara Wintor, his agent, \"Hey Clara, come through to the lounge\" Justin followed it by buzzing her into the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan followed Justin as he expected him to go upstairs to get dressed, instead Justin lead him to the lounge where he usually met with his agent and other associates, as Ethan entered he remembered thinking how odd it felt in comparison to the rest of the town house, very cold and sterile, leather furniture and a long glass table, the wallpaper was a clean white... it felt like a corporate conference room, and with Ethan in his baggy shirt and jeans, and Justin in... in almost nothing, breifs, couldn't have looked more out of place. They look like they'd just got out of bed, which they sorta had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you not gonna put some clothes on\" Ethan asked quite sheepishly as he heard Clara entering in the side entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Eeth, relax\" He smiled, and guided Ethan onto a sofa and sat down about a foot to the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd, that didn't sound like an answer, Ethan thought. He looked at his chubby boy friend, without something around his waist Justin's belly couldn't hang, instead his stomach fat just protruded almost hiding his underpants when he leant forward.\"Alight then, can you at least lean back into the sofa. or breath in a little bit when she's here because your stomach his covering your pants, it almost looks like your naked\" he chucked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then\" Justin smiled and pecked Ethan on the cheek. \"let's get this meeting over with\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door swung open, and Clara strode in, a large carpet bag under one arm. \"Justin, hi\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Clara... you remember Ethan\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course hello\" She stretched her arm and shook both their hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what can I do for you Clara, what are you here for\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should know Justin\" Clara replied, taking a seat opposite Justin and Ethan, placing her bag lightly on the floor next to her. \"You start your tour again in less than a month; I've assured the record company you'll be ready\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I'll be ready\" Justin replied calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not entirely, you don't look like you've lost allot of weight.... if any\" she said bluntly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Justin said unsure of what to reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know your not overweight Justin, but you've so clearly put on a substantial amount of weight since your 2011 tour\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not THAT much\" Justin replied flippantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, \"Justin, if you remember I met with you several times last year when you decided to wear nothing put your underwear for our morning meetings.... your stomach was lets say, toned and slender\" she gestured with her pen, \"the rest of your body seems to have remained quite slender, fortunately, but your whole body needs improve before tour\" She lifted a clipboard out of her pen with Justin's last details on it, it read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nName: Justin Bieber <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------2011 ------- 2012 -------------<br>\r\nHeight: 5'10\"---------- 5'10\"  <br>\r\nWeight: 128 lbs -----156 lbs<br>\r\nWaist: 28\" -------------33\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up\" she demanded in a strict tone. She wrapped a tape measure around Justin's waist, and then lifted her digital scales from her bag and indicated for Justin to stand on them. \"You now weigh 158, that's an increase of two pounds, your waist is now just off 34 inches.... and it doesn't look like muscle\" She prodded Justin's flab with her pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's more difficult to lose weight than it looks\" Justin replied sarcastically, and rather pathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Especially when you eat so much\" Ethan added with a comical tone in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not surprised Justin, I know you too well\" she placed the clipboard, scales and tape measure back into her bag, and brought out a brightly coloured pamphlet. \u201cWhich is why I brought this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhmm\u201d Justin said, as he sidled backwards and perched back on the sofa taking the pamphlet from Clara\u2019s stretched out hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a detox spa centre; in the peaceful seclusion of the ????? rivene, you will spend four weeks on purities of natural foods, mountainous hiking, swimming, steam treatment and meditation. It will give you perspective on your eating habits, and help you to lose weight\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not serious\u201d Justin said harshly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the best way Justin\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not fat! I may have a few extra pounds... but, but why should... does, it matter?  How is being deathly skinny better\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re not saying you must be \u2018skinny\u2019 Justin\u201d Clara said with a hint of exasperation in her tone, \u201cyou\u2019ve never been, as you put it, \u2018deathly skinny\u2019; as you know full well, the largest portion of your revenue comes from your image. And your signed contract agreed to it\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u201d Justin grunted, he had appeared to have calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe record company has done allot of for you remember, they took out an injunction on an intrusive image of you, and your \u2018boyfriend\u2019, only this morning to protect your privacy\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat image\u201d Justin demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen it, and it\u2019s best you just forget it... it\u2019s not important.\u201d Clara responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flush of relief past over Ethan, it was something that he no longer need worry about. This detox centre would be good for Justin, his career especially, but if he accepted would he take it seriously. It wouldn\u2019t hurt Justin to lose a little bit of weight,  Ethan placed his hand on his soft belly, he also could do with losing weight, which could be easier if Justin\u2019s away. Justin was completely right, being skinny isn\u2019t much better, but unlike Justin, Ethan was more self conscious with the amount of weight he had gained, and slightly uncomfortable with his own soft flabby stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen would I go\u201d Justin asked reluctantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d leave today... so is that a yes\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Justin threw back the duvet, rubbed his eyes and swung his feet to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit it\u2019s cold\u201d Justin muttered to himself, pulling a hoodie over his pyjama top, as he cycled through his clothes, deciding what to wear. Forgetting the lack of good heating, a TV, phone and other 21st century amenities, the room was akin to a 5 star hotel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter half an hour deciding what to wear, and another 15 getting dressed Justin sat on an arm chair next to the window and looked the incredible view of the river and the mountains, it was still 15 minutes until he could go down for breakfast, and find out what the day\u2019s schedule was. Justin\u2019s stomach rumbled loudly, all he had eaten the evening before was a fillet of fish and a green salad. He was starving, but he almost feared what was for breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally it was breakfast, after a lengthy walk down a long winding staircase, and several corridors Justin entered the large dining hall; it was almost empty, it was quite eerie, the awquard silence. Justin took a seat near the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere is the menu sir\u201d a smartly dressed waiter, who more closely resembled a butler, asked in an incredibly posh and well spoken voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin opened it, but unsurprisingly the choice was lacking. \u201cErr, I\u2019ll have err... the, poached eggs\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wasn\u2019t sure what the value was, but it was undeniably relaxing. In an hour he was having his final check in, at half twelve he was catching his plane back to LA, with any luck he\u2019d be back home by around 4 o\u2019clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin was still hungry, as he had been every day, his stomach almost never stopped growling. All the lack of food and the hard exercise meant he had lost allot of weight. Whilst his stomach was still soft, his small moobs were now nonexistent, and his belly only really hung over his waist when he was leaning forward, when sitting up straight it protruded very slightly, but barely came over his waist at all. He couldn\u2019t help but think he must be close to his pre-gain weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Justin finished in the steam room, he got dressed and headed up to the nurses office.  Again he was told to remove his shirt and trousers, he could see his reflection in the mirror and he no longer looked fat, he looked very close to his former, slender self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Mr Bieber\u201d The nurse said politely as he finished measuring Justin\u2019s waist \u201cif you\u2019d like to step on the scales\u201d Justin did as he was asked, he couldn\u2019t see the number or anything, so it was hard to guess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn Imperial Standard you now weigh 10 stone and 5 pounds... that are 145 pounds in US standard. Your waist is 32 inches, a slight reduction of 0.5 inches; and your weight.... that\u2019s a further loss of 6 pounds, 13 pounds... that\u2019s 1 pound off a stone. Impressive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin couldn\u2019t believe it, he had lost almost a stone in 4 weeks. He was now only a stone and a half, 19 pounds off his original weight. He was surprised though that his belly button had remained so deep, he had expected as he got slimmer it would return closer to normal. As Justin began to put his clothes back on his stomach rumbled again... he couldn\u2019t wait until he got a proper meal inside him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodbye Mr Bieber\u201d The nurse smiled, \u201cI trust you\u2019ll keep up the good work\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin returned the smile \u201cI will do my best\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, Justin at last took his seat on a private jet, chartered to take him back to LA, other than the pilot he was the only one on the plane. He had a proper lunch, well in comparatively. He had rung his family, who were spending the summer in Europe; he would see them just before his tour started. He was relieved that he had got hold of Ethan, who had agreed to meet him at Justin\u2019s house as he arrived back. Otherwise he\u2019d been returning to an empty house. Justin couldn\u2019t wait to see his boyfriend again, Ethan had supported this detox centre and the weight loss for the sake of Justin\u2019s career.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin wondered what Ethan had done whilst he\u2019d been away, he found it funny to think that Justin, now slender, was now slimmer than Ethan. Though with Justin and his bad influence regarding food away, Ethan might too have lost weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe travel was now over, Justin\u2019s car stepped into the driveway, before the driver parked it in into. The driver took the luggage into the house, said his goodbye to Justin and left. Justin rushed into the house to find Ethan, after only a few seconds he reached the kitchin where Ethan was waiting to welcome Justin home.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After the two stopped Ethan handed Justin a glass of Coke, and the two headed into the sitting room, where Ethan had been watching TV until Justin got back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow look at you\u201d Ethan said as Justin put his drink down and turned to face him, whilst shirts were misleading, Justin looked amazingly slimmer \u201cwow, you\u2019re so slim\u201d Ethan approached Justin and pulled his shirt up and gave it a rub, he could see just how slim Justin was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks\u201d Justin replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin pulled his shirt the rest of the way off, in typical Justin style... he never wore a shirt when it was warm unless he had to. Ethan couldn\u2019t belive how slim Justin now was, as they took a seat next to each other on the sofa, Justin\u2019s stomach didn\u2019t roll over.  Justin\u2019s belly was still fairly soft, he was by no means skinny, but it was certainly impressive for four weeks. \u201cSo how much did you lose\u201d Ethan asked, gently giving Justin\u2019s belly another rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout 13 pounds\u201d Justin replied casually, \u201cI\u2019m down to 145 pounds\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u201d was all Ethan replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin couldn\u2019t help but notice that Ethan looked ever so slightly bigger, to Justin\u2019s shock it looked more than \u2018slightly\u2019. Ethan wore a sleeveless super dry shirt, and skinny jeans, as always Ethan\u2019s face still looked as slim, and his arms felt slightly softer, whilst actually looking the same. No it was Ethan\u2019s belly, the shirt he had chosen to wear did little to obscure the shape, and it looked quite round. Justin had only felt it when they hugged, he hadn\u2019t touched it at all, he didn\u2019t want to draw attention to it and embarrass Ethan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s around 10 less than me, that placed worked wonders... you can\u2019t have eaten much?\u201d Ethan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, the food was dull and the portions were small\u201d Justin chuckled. He couldn\u2019t help but think of Ethan\u2019s stomach again, he must have eaten more or less as he had when Justin had been there. Perhaps Justin\u2019s own loss made Ethan\u2019s slight gain look far bigger, by comparison. Though Justin guessed he was more than 10 pounds heavier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**Ding dong**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan whipped up, as always he was speedy, a few minutes he came back with a extra large margarita pizza. \u201cI bet your hungry\u201d he said as he walked in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJusin licked his lips, it looked like Ethan had only bought 1, so it wouldn\u2019t be a feast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you aloud to eat it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course\u201d Justin replied instantly, \u201cIt\u2019s only half a 2-person pizza! I\u2019m starved.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! I didn\u2019t want to get you into trouble\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s eat!\u201d Justin said putting his legs up on the table, and taking a slice as Ethan put the box down and took a seat next to Justin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan looked at Justin, he was glad that despite his weight loss he was still the same old person, he looked happy with 1 pizza so obviously he had learned moderation. As Ethan expected Justin was starving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them ate at record pace, within 15 minutes the pizza was gone. Justin had tried to keep true to what he had learnt and not eaten too much and to fast, but he had all but failed. Though his attempt at eating slower meant that Ethan had eaten 2 more slices than him, and he\u2019d still finshed earlier than Justin. \u201cThat was great\u201d Justin said rubbing his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI also got ice cream for pudding\u201d Ethan handed Justin a medium tub of Ben and Gerry\u2019s chocolate ice cream. The two ate there ice cream slower, enjoying the end of the film that was on when they came in. As the film drew to a close, Ethan left the room to take the rubbish to the kitchen. Justin felt bloated, a feeling he hadn\u2019t had for almost a month.. it was bliss, actually being full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst good meal in a month\u201d Justin said as Ethan took a seat next to Justin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you liked it, all my own work.... well calling the pizza restaurant was my work\u201d Ethan smiled, as he began to rub his own belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin began to get an erection; he wanted to touch and play around with his boyfriend, being discreet wasn\u2019t really Justin, and it could be suspicious. \u201cI see you\u2019ve eaten well, whilst I was away\u201d Justin immediately bit his lip, he meant to ask \u2018if\u2019 Ethan had eaten well, damn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so\u201d Ethan responded, to Justin\u2019s relief he hadn\u2019t interpret it as Justin feared. \u201cI just ate, more or less normally.... I guess it\u2019s easier at a detox centre to lose weight\u201d He joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEspecially when they give you such tiny \u2018healthy\u2019 crap\u201d Justin joined in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOdd, that I didn\u2019t expect it... I should have guessed that when you got back I would be fatter than you\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite a bit fatter, Justin thought to himself looking at Ethan\u2019s shirt covered flabby stomach, that Justin could see hanging over his waist as he leant forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should have made an effort too\u201d Ethan replied.<br>\r\n\u201cYou look gorgeous\u201d Justin smiled kindly, \u201cYou may have even began slimming down, without by bad influence\u201d Justin added tactfully, he was being partially honest, about the latter bit, but just kind about the first bit. Looking at Justin\u2019s large chubby stomach, Ethan was sure he must have gained quite abit, it was quite unkind to think it but Ethan would never actually be mean enough to say it.\t<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, let\u2019s snuggle\u201d Justin moved closer to Ethan and place his hand on Ethan\u2019s stomach and began pulling Ethan\u2019s shirt up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan placed his hand on Justin\u2019s to stop him, he was becoming self conscious again.. it was worse now that he had probably lost no weight, looking at Justin\u2019s great loss. He still had a softish stomach and a bit of belly fat but he looked as attractive as ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin looked at Ethan\u2019s face as he stopped him from pulling his shirt up, Justin could tell he was becoming self-conscious. In response to Ethan\u2019s reluctance he pulled off his own trousers, to his great relif, which were sticking. So he was only in his boxers. Seconds later he pulled Ethan\u2019s button of his trouser open, it was far tighter than last he\u2019d done it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Eeth, you can\u2019t expect me to sit in my underwear on my own... especially when your trousers are half off now\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u201d Ethan smiled in defeat and stood up and pulled his trousers off, seconds later Justin rose and trust his shirt off, At last Justin could see Ethan\u2019s body... standing up he looked just chubby on a slim body, as he pulled down to the sofa he saw lovely, soft body properly. Ethan\u2019s belly button was now really deep, and Justin now noticed that his was shallower than he had thought, especially comparing Ethan\u2019s now. Ethan\u2019s belly protruded, as Justin\u2019s had done, over his waist. They lay down to face each other, Ethan was on the inside, and whilst Ethan had plenty of room to move back, Ethan\u2019s belly was touching Justin\u2019s. They just laid there together as the next film started. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

By the sound of it, he was in the shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or so had passed Justin pulled the duvet back and swung round and gently placed his feet on the floor, gave his arms a stretch. He had gone to bed in only his boxers, and the air-conditioning did nothing to persuaded him to put further clothes on before he headed down to see what to have for breakfast. The choice was bound to be dull, baring in mind his diet, especially considering how he broke it big time last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected Justin found nothing exciting in the fridge, it had already been packed with pre-approved items. He had poured himself a large glass of orange juice whilst he sat on the breakfast bar stall and pondered what to eat for breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 10 minuets, Justin decided to top up his juice, the healthy choices in the fridge had forced him to delay deciding as long as possible. He certainly didn't look forward to putting something as disgusting as porridge in his mouth... again. He sat back down on his stall, and began sipping his juice. After about 30 seconds he heard Ethan gallop down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Ethan\" Justin smiled as Ethan quietly entered the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning\" Ethan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin glanced at Ethan, his hair was uncombed, and still damp from the shower, Ethan was very shy, but even straight out of the shower he looked really youthfully handsome. \"I've got a pair of boxers like that\" Justin mused as his eyes dropped bellow Ethan's face, to the rest of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got mine wet as I got out the shower, I hope you don't mind\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I?\" Justin asked rhetorically.

Ethan was wearing nothing but his underwear, he had just got out the shower and had nothing but his damp clothes to change into. Justin found it difficult not to look at Ethan's stomach, protruding slightly as Jusitn's had once done. This wasn't like Ethan though, sure he had put on a few pounds as Justin had gained, but he didn't look anything like this before Justin went away, he was sure of it. Ethan had always been apprehensive when revealing his body, even back when he was as skinny as a rake, his behaviour right now wasn't that much different, Justin could tell that Ethan didn't like wearing so little clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit\" Justin said casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan sat down on a stall next to Justin, despite only wearing boxers his stomach has a clear roll of flab that almost hung over his waist. At his sides, he had viable love handles. Justin still wasn't skinny himself, his belly still had a good few pounds of fat on it, but he did look noticeably thinner alongside his previously slimmer boyfriend. Ethan's belly button had gotten quite deep, as the fat grew around it. Justin's own belly button remained deep, which showed he still had flab he 'should' burn off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin finally bit the bullet as he prepared to ask Ethan about his body of late, before speaking he began by prodding Ethan's belly \"So Ethan, what's with the belly?\" he put casually, and bluntly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry?\" Ethan replied embarrassed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just noticed that it seems as if you put on a bit of weight while I was away\" Justin added, patting Ethan's stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps a little\" he conceded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never thought I'd end up being slimmer than you\" Justin joked. Fortunately beside the slight embarrassment Ethan had taken it lightly. \"When did you last weigh yourself?\" he wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A while ago\" Ethan replied after pondering for a few seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I''ve gotta keep an eye on my weight at the moment, how about we check now\" Justin lept of the stall and lead Ethan across to the home gym, which featured an electric bathroom scale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You only got weighed when you left camp?\" Ethan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.... but then we ate shit loads last night\" he chuckled, stepping onto the scale. 146 lbs, ten stone 6 pounds. That was one pound more than yesterday.\"Which I could say I was surprised\" Justin joked, giving his still soft belly a pat \"Your go\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan stept slowly onto the scale,  after a few seconds which felt like a few hours, 161 lbs, eleven stone 6 pounds , finally appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Ethan, that's like ten pounds since I went away. Your like a  stone heavier than me now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God\" Ethan muttered, patting his belly shyly,\"That's more than you've ever weighed\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must have eaten fucking allot of crap\" Justin went behind Ethan and half hugged and half rubbed his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, guess I did. I can't believe i've gotten this fat\" </span></div></div>",

His breakfast from the previous morning consisted of bland oatmeal and a banana. That was not enough to satisfy his hunger. On top of the small portions, the trainer tried to exercise Justin like crazy, which made Justin mad and exhausted. At one point, he was running until he got so winded out, he laid down on the ground, refusing to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw this! I can't do it and I won't do it!\" Justin refused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter almost a half hour of protest, the trainer decided to take Justin back to the center to eat yet another bland meal. Justin couldn't take much more of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course following his meal, the trainer tried to work Justin out more, making him go into the pool and swim laps. After an attempt, Justin just floated and refused to work out yet again, making the trainer flustered. Finally after a while, the trainer decided to let Justin hit the showers and change, hoping he could think of a way to get to the pop singer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten minutes, Justin came out of the locker area wearing very tight skinny jeans, a wife beater shirt, and a brown beanie for his wet hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justin, why are you not trying to work out?\" asked the trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that I'm not trying. It's just that it's too much for me. I used to be able to do this stuff, but I can't and don't want to anymore. I don't mind my extra pounds as much as everyone else does. I mean honestly,\" Justin said in a sincere tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, it's your money and believe it or not, you have a choice. I won't keep on doing this with you for the next few weeks. If you want to leave, that's fine. You can. If you want to stay and really try, that's fine too. You need to decide for all of our sakes,\" said the trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin thought about it. His manager may not be happy with him leaving, but then again, he knew deep down he couldn't take much more.</span></div></div>",

He looked at all of the clothes he had, noticing how many different types of clothing he had. Since he wanted to feel casual, Justin decided to put on a pair of skinny jeans with a white t-shirt, a brown sweat shirt, and a brown skater beanie that looked like it was the same color as his hair. First off, Justin changed out of his pair of pants and tried to change into the jeans. As he pulled them up to his stomach, he noticed that it was much harder to pull up his pants. He had to keep tugging until finally, the pants were up all the way on him. He then buttoned his pants with hesitation as the new weight made it harder to do so. Luckily, he got the pants buttoned, but some of his new fat was going slightly over the pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext on his clothing agenda, Just tried to put on his white t-shirt. With luck, he got the shirt on a lot easier than his pants, but it did feel more tighter than usual. Justin shook it off as he pulled his sweat shirt over his head and put it on with ease. To end his changing, Justin pulled his brown beanie over his head, making himself feel cooler. He then looked at himself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... that looks good!\" Justin said as he winked at himself in the mirror. He was trying not to focus on his small gain, even though he knew it was there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the door bell rang, getting his attention quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder who that could be,\" Justin said as he went to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened it up to see that it was...</span></div></div>",

Cole was also famous as he was a famous twin on \"The Suite Life of Zack and Cody.\" They had been friends for a while and always hung out normally. Cole was standing in front of Justin, wearing skinny jeans, a black north face, and a black beanie sported with blonde hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Justin! What's up?\" Cole asked as Justin let him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing much, man. How did you know I was here?\" Justin asked his friend curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I noticed on your facebook that you said you had a short concert break. So I figured you would be here,\" Cole said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smart, dude. Guess that's true,\" Justin said as he sat on the couch. At this point, Cole noticed that Justin had a few extra pounds on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, have you gained a few extra pounds?\" Cole asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.... yeah. I mean, it's only a few pounds, but I'll lose it before I go back and perform,\" Justin said as he tried to shake it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like more than a few,\" Cole said as he started to giggle. Justin tried to play along with the giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha. Very funny! Look who's talking, Mr. Healthy! I could say the same to you!\" Justin said to Cole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd right he was. Cole looked like he had put on around ten pounds as he looked a little wider than usual. On top of that, Cole looked like he was showing a slow start of a double chin. It wasn't much weight, but it was still sort of noticable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm still good. Anyway, what do you want to do, dude?\" Cole asked Justin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I didn't have any plans.

Justin locked up the place as his chaffeur opened up the door to Justin's limo and escorted the two famous celebrities inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take us to the mall nearby. We want to see what places are available,\" Justin said to driver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes, they were off and going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the whole time, the two teens talked about their lives and what they had been up to. They were both avoiding the topic of weight because both were slowly adding some to their frames. Cole kept on looking down at Justin's gut, noticing how his sweat shirt was used to hide the belly. He noticed how Justin's face looked a little fuller than usual. He didn't want to admit it, but he liked Justin's added weight. Some part of him wanted him to add more to his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Justin was thinking the same thing about Cole as they talked. Justin noticed how Cole's chin was developing into a double chin, which gave him puffier, fuller cheeks. Justin also didn't want to admit it, but he wanted to fatten up Cole some more as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of driving, they arrived at the mall and decide on a place to eat. All they knew was that they were in the mood to eat some sweets. Before they walked out of the limo, Cole and Justin put some sun glasses on and pulled their hats down over their heads more to disguise them. As they began to walk through the mall, they spotted a place to eat.</span></div></div>",

After some arguments, they both agreed that Justin would buy them their food. They got their food in some bags, and brought it back to Justin's house. Once inside, they went up to Justin's room and closed his door. They also shut all the blinds so people couldn't see them by any chance. They sat down on Justin's bed and started eating. Halfway through, Cole noticed Justin's belly was peaking out from under his shirt. Cole blushed and started to get hard. He was really turned on by Justin's weight gain. Justin was thinking the same thing. Justin noticed how Cole's butt was starting to get so big. Justin started to get hard thinking about what he could do to that butt. Justin and Cole made eye contact, and then Justin leaned in and started to kiss Cole. Cole was taken by surprise but once he figured out what was happening, he granted Justin access into his mouth and scooted into Justin's lap. Cole grinded a little in Justin's lap and Justin groaned manly. Justin wrapped his arms around Cole's waist and moved them down to squeeze and feel and play with Cole's fat butt. Cole moved his hands to Justin's belly and started to rub it. Cole jiggled Justin's belly and he leaned down and kissed it. Justin took off his shirt and Cole saw Justin's happy trail. Cole grabbed some of his whoopie pies and started feeding Justin. Justin groaned and started talking with his mouth full.<br>\r\n\"Mmff.. dwam...bwaby..\" Justin started, \"I dwont.... know I cwan ewat awnymwore..\" Justin swallowed the remaining bite of the 5 whoopie pies he just ate. Justin let out a really big manly burp.<br>\r\n\"BUUUUUUUURRRPPP!!!\" Justin burped. When Justin burped, the button on his jeans popped off and the zipper slid down by itself. Cole moaned and started bouncing on Justin's lap. Justin then grabbed 3 of his cakes and started feeding Cole. Cole groaned and ate them all. After, Cole let out a big fart. Cole moaned and Justin got even harder. Cole could feel Justin's manhood in his butt through his shorts. After they fed eachother, they laid down and cuddled in Justin's bed. Justin pulled the blankets up over them and wrapped his arm around Cole, revealing Justin's hairy armpits. Cole scooted closer into Justin, pressing his butt into Justin's manhood. Justin burped really loud and manly again while Cole fingered Justin's deepening belly button.</span></div></div>",

Justin passed it off for nothing at first, but a few seconds later a later there was a louder growl and he began to feel a feeling of hunger which answers why he woke up at such a late hour.<br>\r\n\u201cI really shouldn\u2019t eat this late but I\u2019ll just have a snack.\u201d Justin said.<br>\r\nHe went over to the table and grabbed a box of chocolates. Justin always has so many fans that send him love letters, fan mail, and chocolates that he ends up giving away the chocolates to some of his crew, but he always keeps a few for himself in case he wants some. He grabs the first piece of delicious milk chocolate and puts it in his mouth. As he savors the taste of the chocolate piece he quickly reaches for another one which he similarly enjoys. He keeps eating more but soon after, he realizes that he\u2019s eaten the entire box. However he still feels a little hungry so he grabs a couple more boxes and after a few minutes he\u2019s emptied those too. <br>\r\nAfter eating all of the chocolate candy he goes to the fridge for a drink, but something catches his eye. In the fridge was a large half-finished pizza that his manager and crew had leftover after the concert. After all of the chocolate, he wasn\u2019t so hungry anymore but the sight of the pizza made him forget about his comment on only having a snack and he grabbed the pizza box and ate one of the slices. Pretty soon he grabbed another slice, and another, and pretty soon the whole pizza was gone too. Soon he feels over-stuffed and quickly falls back to sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Concerned with what people were saying about him, he went into the bathroom to weigh himself. \"Ha. I can't believe I'm weighing myself...I still have the perfect body. Why do I even care?\" He says, arrogantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe steps on the scale with a big grin on his face, and to his amazement, his scale reached the number...\"TWO HUNDRED AND SIX POINT SEVEN POUNDS???!!! HOW IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE?!\" He ran down to the kitchen, upset with the most expensive, accurate consumer scale available, and said, \"They want to see fat?? I'll show them fat! Justin Bieber is not fat unless he wants to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to make himself 10 peanut butter sandwiches, as he gained a huge hunger from only the 2 hours that he's been sleeping. He used thick french toast bread for the sandwiches and put on the peanut butter so that it's an inch thick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he's shoving down the sandwiches, Justin starts gulping down the gallon of heavy cream that his personal chef had in the fridge. Only 5 minutes go by, and he's already done with his giant sandwiches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird,\" the now bulging pop sensation says, \"I'm still hungry...\" So he goes for the cakes, pies, gallons of icecream that are in the kitchen, anything fattening that he can find. Justin starts shoveling everything down his throat. And after an hour of constant stuffing, he looks down to his pants and sees the biggest boner he ever had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin, who was only wearing boxers, strips completely. His perfect nine inch long, eight inch girth, uncut Canadian cock was throbbing perfectly. He couldn't help but start jerking off. All that kept going through his mind was the thought of him being super fat. He started his jerk off session with a very slow jerking motion, just enough to make his huge, low-hanging, egg-sized balls sway back and forth, as he shoved food in his mouth. He started to precum with the most satisfied look on his face, and then started jerking faster. And as he jerked faster, he ate more food faster. His balls started to tighten up towards the base of his massive cock, but released to hang lower as he shoved more food in his mouth. He could feel his beachball belly swell up to its max with delicious fattening foods. He ate so much that his innie belly button popped to become an outie, then stretched to be the same level as his swelling gut. And his cock kept getting harder and harder, the precum became thicker and more common, his balls were tight at his cock's base, and with a sigh of relief after jerking and eating for another hour, he blew his huge, thick load all over the kitchen cabinet. He didn't stop cumming for a minute straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after the relief that he was searching for for days, Justin starts to rub his massive belly and wash all of the food he just ate down with some more heavy cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter looking around at the horribly cum-ridden kitchen cabinet with puddles of cum forming at the bottom, Justin says as he continues to rub his now massive, sexy, previously perfectly flat belly, \"...I can't believe I just came buckets of cum from eating...I think I'm gonna like the new me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe previously perfect-bodied 17 year old boy gives out the loudest, longest, and deepest belches that he's ever done, as he farts loud, long, and continually for a few minutes, yawns, places his perfectly floppy cock and low-hanging balls in a position that's just right, and falls asleep completely naked in his giant pile of food containers, two and a half hours after he woke up with the biggest appetite of his life.</span></div></div>",

He had his bodyguards dressing him instead of doing it himself or wardrobe doing it and there was a very good reason why.  His skinny jeans were huge and had to hold in a huge, fat lower body!  Justin was looking down at his massive moobs and flowing belly in a loose fitting v-neck t-shirt that covered his, what he had to assume, was a 700 pound body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis bodyguards grunted and got the jeans up over his massively fat thighs and his huge, wobbling butt.  One of them held up Justin's belly while another zipped them up and buttoned them with all the might he had in his strong arms.  All this was going on while Justin drank a big bottle of Mountain Dew to wet his throat and give him a caffeine rush he needed to perform.  He handed the bottle to an assistant after he finished it off and heaved out a huge belch, smiling proud as it finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's showtime,\" Justin said as he was cued on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Break a leg, big guy!\" said one of his bodyguards as he started to waddle his fat body out onto the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waddled ponderously and arched his back to allow himself to get the momentum up to waddle out to his microphone.  He brought up another belch as he waddled, trying to stifle it with a fat hand as he walked out onto the stage to an eruption of screams and cheers by his adoring fans of every gender, race, and creed.  Justin smiled wide, already starting to sweat from the exertion of waddling to the stage, but he took the mic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was out of breath already and a few stage hands brought out a sturdy chair for him to sit on as he started to speak, \"Hey everyone!  You ready for an awesome night?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheers only got louder as Justin sat his huge, skinny jean clad butt down onto the chair with a grunt and his mic in hand, resting against a fat moob.

The next concert was a few days away so he could afford to take some time off.<br>\r\nOn his way home he stopped by a Wendy\u2019s and ordered a few double baconators, a large bag of fries, and a few frosties to take home. He snacked on the fries on the way home. <br>\r\nWhen Justin got home, he had difficulty carrying all of the food in with him due to the large volume of food he had ordered that it took two trips to carry everything in. He took all of the food to the couch, plopped his butt down on the couch, and had a movie marathon eating his burgers, fries, and frosties the entire evening. <br>\r\nThroughout the night, Justin mindlessly ate his fast food until he finished watching the third DVD and reached for some more food. But he realized that there was no more food! Justin had eaten all of his fast food meals and felt stuffed to the breaking point. He struggled to get up off the couch and after a minute he was heavily breathing and starting to sweat from the minor exertion. <br>\r\n\u201cUgh. I give up!\u201d said Justin and afterward instead if getting up to go to his bed, he just slept on the couch full and bloated.<br>\r\nThe next day\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
