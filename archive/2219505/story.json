Her arsenal of special moves include headbutting an enemy with brute force as she can also unleash upon her enemy a more powerful variation of the butt bomb move known as the super butt bomb as she grabs her enemy as she suplexes her enemy not once but twice, leaps into the air and slams her enemy down onto the ground.\" Wisdom San said as he introduced the last member of the super duper sumo dogs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I forgot to mention that at anytime they're up against an enemy or group of enemies our four heroes can become considerably larger muscular and more stronger as well by saying in unison it's time to sumo size.\" Wisdom San explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what will happen next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mom was a scientist, and worked most mornings from her basement lab. So I got used to waking myself up, getting myself dressed, and fixing my own breakfast. On school days, though, that was when the solitude ended, because Becky would come over, and we would walk to the bus stop together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one big, but simple, rule in the house: <i>Stay out of the basement.</i> Mom didn't care what it was: if it was in the basement, I was supposed to tell her about it, and she would take care of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a fine rule when it was an inanimate object that was down there, but today was different. Today, our pet cat, Schrodinger, decided that he wanted to go down to the basement. I didn't want to listen to Mom complaining about cat hair all over the lab for weeks, so I went after Schrodinger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI found him inside a cabinet, which was empty except for a flower pot. Imagining Mom going on and on about dirt all over her cabinet (when Mom wasn't doing science, she was complaining about something), I scooped up that naughty cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could reprimand Schrodinger, however, the cabinet door closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when I noticed that, unlike other cabinets, the doors to this one were solid, not glass. I wondered: Was that to keep something from getting <i>in,</i> or <i>out?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, I got my answer, as a weird green light came on over my head.</span></div></div>",

Why was Mom putting a common houseplant under this green light?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I looked up, and I noticed that the light was getting farther away from me. And that the interior of the cabinet was becoming more spacious with each passing second... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when I put two and two together: This cabinet was a shrinking chamber. Mom was shrinking the plant. And, since Schrodinger and I were dumb enough to walk into the thing,... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How small are we going to get?\" I asked nobody in particular, and winced at how high-pitched my voice had become. \"I'm going to sound like a chipmunk before this is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the green light was turned off, and the cavernous cabinet was plunged into darkness. \"Now to wait for Mom to open this thing,\" I squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened, and my monument of a mother looked down. \"Katie?\" her voice boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dropped to her knees, and the ground shook. \"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda,\" I shouted up at her. \"I'm not sick, or hurt. But it looks like I'm down to six inches tall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you <i>doing</i> down here? I've told you <i>never</i> to come down into the basement, and <i>this</i> is why!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was following Schrodinger,\" I explained. \"I didn't want him to mess up whatever you were working on. So, now that we've been shrunk, is there a cabinet to make us big again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sadly shook her head. \"Not yet, I'm afraid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'll I do now?\"</span></div></div>",

Washing it down with a glass of milk, I found that my situation no longer seemed so hopeless. After all, Mom had figured out how to shrink matter: surely enlarging it again wouldn't be too difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strong smell of coffee outside my little house got my attention, so I returned to the window. Mom was going through a bunch of science books, looking the way I felt the night before a big test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout the time when either she or I would normally have started working on supper, Mom buried her head in her hands and cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dared her wrath by opening the door and stepping outside the dollhouse. \"How's it going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no use,\" she said. \"I can't figure this out. I can't restore your size. Your grandmother is going to show me up and put you back, and then she'll start training you, and I'll never see you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did sound like a reason to break down and cry. I almost joined her, until my stomach grumbled, prompting a memory. \"How long has it been since you've eaten?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted her head. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was feeling down this morning. But, after I had some lunch, it didn't seem so hopeless to be in this position. Why don't you fix yourself supper, and look at this again? If nothing else, taking a break might give you a fresh set of eyes to look at things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy logic seemed to make an impression. Mom wiped the tears from her eyes, then went upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went back inside the dollhouse and fixed my own supper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom came back down with a plate of food. I took my own supper, and the two of us ate together, as if I were 5', 6\" again. \"How'd you get started, doing things like this?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I snuck into my mother's basement laboratory,\" she said. \"I was a couple years younger than you are, with a boundless curiosity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, not like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't sell yourself short, Katie. If you hadn't been curious, Schrodinger couldn't have prompted you to come down here. That's the gift, you know: an inquiring mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened when you snuck down? I'm guessing you weren't shrunken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, my mother wasn't working on that. No, what I wound up doing was to change my sex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stifled a giggle, picturing my mother as a boy. \"How long did it take Grandma to change you back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wry smile formed on Mom's lips. \"Who said she changed me back?\"</span></div></div>",

After typing in a few command codes, she placed the tiny plant into the cabinet with a pair of tweezers then closed the door. \"Cross your fingers, Kate.\" Wincing, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI crossed my fingers, hoping for success as mom hit the enter key. I heard the cabinet hum for a few moments then fall silent. Once done, mom sighed then opened the cabinet to find that the plant was restored to normal.

Putting the now full-size cat upstairs, she placed me in the cabinet, and a red light fell upon me, the source of the light drawing closer as I grew. <i>No more living in a dollhouse for me,</i> I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the light went out, the door opened, and I threw my arms around Mom. \"I knew you could do it, Mom,\" I said. \"You're the...

I am hoping you will have a better head on your shoulders and not attempt anything without me present to guide you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... where do I start?\" Nervous, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"We start through book study.\" Calmly, she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then led me to her private study in the next room of the laboratory where she sat me down at a small spare desk where I found a literal mountain of books. I threw mom a questioning look only to be given an almost sinister grin. \"I want you to read every last page, young lady.\" Smiling, she said. \"Knowledge is the key to power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're joking, right?\" Scoffing, I asked. \"Isn't there a spell or device that can put all of this into memory in a heart beat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled. \"There is but there is also a device that can erase all of that knowledge just as easily.\" Amused, she countered. \"There are no shortcuts to this form of science. You must learn patience before moving on to the actual studies.\" She gave me a sinister grin. \"Remember your first lesson of impatience...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, mom quietly left the room. Judging by the grin on her face, I knew she was enjoying this. I turned to the huge stack of books and sighed. Only upon opening the first book, I realized that I had read the entire first page by merely glancing at it and turned to the second only to learn that I had read that just as fast. To my surprise and inner delight, I had read the entire book in less than a minute. What was more surprising was that I could recite the entire book page for page as if I had read it a thousand times. As I moved from book to book, my new speed reading ability became slightly faster and I was able to literally flip through the pages and have the entire book memorized. \"This is incredible!\" Smiling, I said to yourself. \"At this rate, I'll be done in a half hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI moved through the books at incredible speed and was done in forty five minutes. As I  finished the last book, mom walked in, smiling. \"I take it you found that you can speed read now that your gift has awakened.\" Grinning, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was incredible.\" Smiling, I said. \"I didn't need any fancy machine, I just had it in me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Many people in this field tend to choose to take the easy way out and use a memory machine and be done with it.\" Bemused, mom said. \"Only the side effects and the ease its benefits can be revered leave much to be desired, leaving them with literally zero training and easily defeated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed at that. \"I'm glad I didn't use the memorization machine.\" Honestly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"I know it is tempting but understand that there are no shortcuts to anything without a price...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While most girls my age were obsessed with boys and the latest fashion trends, I was focused on reading the latest science fiction or fantasy novel.  That\u2019s not to say I\u2019m not interested in boys, because I am; it\u2019s just, most of the boys I\u2019m interested in are either fictional characters or way out of my league.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just after 7:00 in the morning, I was making my way through the park on my way to school.  I always cut through the park on the way to school, despite my mom\u2019s warnings about encountering less than pleasant individuals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI probably should have heeded her warning just this once; because, just as I was about to leave the park, I was approached by what I could only assume was a homeless man.  \u201cHello, little lady.\u201d Smelling of beer, even at this early hour, the man said, \u201cYou look like you could use a pick me up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is he offering me some alcohol?</i> \u201cNo thank you, sir; I\u2019m only 14.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t offering you a drink, little lady.\u201d Looking at me, the man said, \u201cOn the contrary, I was going to grant you your deepest desire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow would you possibly know what my deepest desire is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man's expression turned serious as he looked at me.  \u201cI know more than you think, Claire Douglas.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a step back out of fear.  \u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say that I have certain...abilities.\u201d stepping closer to me, the man said, \u201cAll you need to do, is say yes; and your deepest desire will be fulfilled.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suppose I should mention at this now; despite being a social outcast at school, I always imagined what it would be like to be popular.  But there was no way this man could help me with that.  I was running late for school at this point, so I decided to play along with whatever game this man was playing.  \u201cOkay fine, fulfill my deepest desire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent; it shall be fulfilled by the end of the day.\u201d With a devilish grin, the man said, \u201cI should warn you, there will be a price to pay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d already started walking towards the park gate by that point.  Without even turning around, I yelled back, \u201cOkay, whatever you say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I got to school a few minutes later, the bell had just rung.  Had I not been in a hurry, I would\u2019ve noticed something different about my reflection in the mirror \u2013 my frizzy brown hair was becoming straightened and blonde.</span></div></div>",

Everyone was looking at me again, so I sullenly walked towards my desk.  \u201cSorry Mr. Johnson, it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Mr. Johnson went back to talking about the American Revolution, I took my notebook out and started to take notes. But as the class progressed, I found myself becoming more and more disinterested in the discussion. <i>God, this is so boring. Why should I care about any of this.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up for a moment, wondering where that thought had come from.  As I went back to taking notes, I noticed something peculiar.  Upon closer inspection, I noticed my nails, which had previously been in need of work, were suddenly trimmed and manicured.  \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMs. Douglas!\u201d turning around, Mr. Johnson said, \u201cHow many times have I asked you not to interrupt my class?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething strange was going on here, and I needed to figure out what it was.  Raising my hand, I said, \u201cMr. Johnson, I have to use the bathroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease make it quick, Ms. Douglas.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing my purse, I left the classroom and hurried down the hall to the girl\u2019s room. Running inside, I placed my stuff on the nearest sink and looked at myself in the mirror.  What I saw proved, without a doubt, that something was happening to me.  Instead of my usual frizzy brown hair and pasty complexion, I saw a girl with nearly perfect skin and blonde hair staring back at me.</span></div></div>",

A person\u2019s hair doesn\u2019t suddenly just change like this.  And then there my nails; and why they were suddenly manicured.  The only possible explanation I could think of was that I was dreaming; which, if that was the case, would make this one of my most vivid dreams yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did everything I could to wake myself up, but nothing worked.  \u201cOkay Claire, this isn\u2019t a dream.\u201d Looking at myself in the mirror, I said, \u201cMaybe you\u2019re just going crazy and this is all a hallucination.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if things couldn\u2019t get any worse, the bathroom door opened at that exact moment; and three members of the cheer squad walked in.  <i>Oh God, what now.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wished that I was suddenly invisible as one of the girls came up to the sink; touching up her makeup.  Her name was Brianna Decker, and she liked to make my life hell. So, you can imagine my surprise when she looked at me and said, \u201cHey Claire, I love that top.  Is it new?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, I saw that the faded D&amp;D shirt I\u2019d been wearing had been replaced with a rather revealing orange top.  I wanted to say that I had no idea where it came from; but instead, I looked at Brianna said, \u201cYeah, I just bought it this weekend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it looks great on you, girl.\u201d Checking her phone, she said, \u201cI should probably get back to class; I\u2019ll see you in gym class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Brianna and the others could tell I was freaking out, they didn\u2019t say anything.

I was going to take my usual seat at the bottom of the bleachers, but I saw Brianna waving at me and I was suddenly compelled to sit with her up top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I took my seat next to her, she said, \u201cLong time no see, girl.\u201d Smiling, she said, \u201cI heard you had a run-in with Bobby Collins in the hall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I tripped and he helped me up.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cHe is <i>so</i> cute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could even question why I was suddenly talking like some boy-crazed teenage girl, Brianna pointed towards the door to the girl\u2019s locker room.  \u201cGod, here comes the Queen of the Nerds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to look where she was pointing and I saw a girl standing just inside the door.  She looked familiar, but I couldn\u2019t quite place her; she was wearing glasses and her hair was a mess.  I was still trying to figure out who she was when the teacher said, <br>\r\n\u201cPlease take a seat, Ms. Hawkins; class is about to begin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy jaw dropped to the floor as the girl slowly walked towards the bleachers and took a seat.  It couldn\u2019t possibly be true, but it was \u2013 that girl was Amy Hawkins; my former best friend.</span></div></div>",

I got a few confused looks when I volunteered to be Amy\u2019s partner, but I shrugged it off.  I don\u2019t know why, but I suspected whatever was happening to the two of us was connected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suppose some back-story would be appropriate here; Amy and I had been best friends since we were 3 years old.  Then suddenly, halfway through 7th grade, her attitude changed and she wanted nothing to do with me.  We drifted apart after that, I got more interested in school; while she became obsessed with her looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce class began, I walked over to where Amy was standing in the corner.  As soon as I walked over to her, she looked at me and said, \u201cLook, Claire, I don\u2019t know why you wanted to be my partner; but I\u2019m not in the mood to be bullied right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever was happening seemed to be changing more than our appearances; apparently, it was even changing our pasts.  Where Amy had been bullying me for the last year, apparently I was now her bully.  \u201cRelax, I\u2019m not going to bully you.\u201d Looking around, making sure the coast was clear, I said, \u201cHave you noticed anything strange since you got to school this morning?\u201d<br>\r\nAmy\u2019s eyes bugged out.  \u201cW-What?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike one minute everything seemed normal, then the next it was different?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy quickly realized that I wasn\u2019t messing with her.  \u201cOh my god, yes!\u201d leaning in, Amy said, \u201cI was in my Math class when suddenly I couldn\u2019t see the board at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I guess that explains the glasses.</i>  \u201cSomething similar has been happening to me; Mr. Johnson lectured me for being late, even though I\u2019ve never been late to class.\u201d  Grabbing my hair, I said, \u201cThen I went to the bathroom and discovered that my hair turned blonde.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems like no else realizes something is wrong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the teacher came over and said, \u201cNow isn\u2019t the time for chit chat, ladies; please get to work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter apologizing to the teacher, I looked at Amy and said, \u201cWe both have study hall 3rd period; meet me in the library.\u201d Sitting down to do some sit-ups, I said, \u201cWe\u2019ll try to figure out what is going on here.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I\u2019d just walked out of the food line with my lunch in hand.  I wanted to go find somewhere to sit by myself, but something compelled me to go sit with Brianna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I got closer, I saw that she was sitting with a small group of people; including Emily Jones, Mackenzie Adams, Brianna\u2019s boyfriend Jeremy, and another guy named Eric.  Taking my seat, I was suddenly overcome by the memory of going to the movies with Eric this past weekend.  It was only made more confusing by the fact that I also remembered going to a comic book signing this weekend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pushed all those thoughts from my mind as Brianna turned her attention to me.  \u201cGirl, I think you have some explaining to do.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cWhy would you <i>volunteer</i> to be partners with Amy Hawkins?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI struggled to think of a reasonable explanation; when it suddenly came to me.  Before I knew what I was doing, I said, \u201cShe\u2019s been tutoring me in Biology, I needed to apologize for skipping our session last weekend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait a minute?  I\u2019m great at biology.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat must be torture; having to be anywhere near that loser.\u201d Looking behind me, Emily said, \u201cSpeak of the devil.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned around to find Amy, rather sheepishly, standing behind me.  \u201cH-Hi guys; can I-I join you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScoffing, Mackenzie said, \u201cWhat makes you think we\u2019d let you sit with <i>us</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy turned her attention to me; obviously in the hopes that I would side with her.

Turning to Amy, I said, \u201cGet out of here, loser; go sit with your kind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got a kick out of the pained look on Amy\u2019s face, as it was clear I hadn\u2019t done what she expected.  The part of me that wanted to help her was getting smaller; as it was overpowered by the new me.  Looking at me, Amy said, \u201cBut Claire, I...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could stop myself, I stood up and smacked the tray out of Amy\u2019s grasp.  \u201cAre you stupid or something?  I said get out of here, you loser!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the lunch stopped what they were doing; as Amy stood there covered in the remains of her sloppy joe.  I snapped back to reality just long enough to watch her burst into tears and run out of the lunchroom.  I was about to go after her when Emily came up next to me, \u201cIt\u2019s about time someone put that loser in her place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I went to sit back down, I was approached by one of the lunchroom monitors.  \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here, Ms. Douglas?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was standing up to get some more napkins when Amy walked right into me with her tray.\u201d With a fake smile, I said, \u201cI tried to apologize because it was my fault, but she ran off crying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to the others, the monitor said, \u201cIs this true?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew they would back me up, and I suspected the rest of the lunchroom was too frightened to go against me.  Sure enough, Brianna said, \u201cIt\u2019s true, ma\u2019am, Claire bumped into Amy by accident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear that the monitor wasn\u2019t buying the story, but she didn\u2019t do anything about it.  \u201cJust be more careful in the future, Ms. Douglas.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I had a feeling she wouldn\u2019t be too happy with me, but I did promise to meet her there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was walking through the hallway towards the stairs when I heard footsteps behind me.  I turned to find Jeremy walking up to me.  I\u2019d experienced weird feelings every time I looked at him during lunch but couldn\u2019t figure out what was going on.

I didn\u2019t even know why I was friends with that bitch; especially after she stole my 7th-grade boyfriend.  No, the weird feeling I had was because I had a vague memory of Jeremy tormenting me all year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we took a break from kissing, Jeremy looked at me and said, \u201cI\u2019ve thought it over, babe; and I decided to break up with Brianna.\u201d Kissing me again, Jeremy said, \u201cYou\u2019re a much better girlfriend than she ever was.

I got Corbin, my boyfriend of 2 years tickets to some football game. Who was playing I have no clue. I couldn't care less about sports. But Corbin was obsessed. Which is why I had zoned out. For  the last 2 weeks all I have heard about is..<i>This is going to be an amazing game. Or this one has this stat.</i> I mean really a girl could only take so much. Luckily the game was tonight. Surely this would be the last I heard about it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry honey,\" I soothed while rubbing his arm. \"I got lost in my thoughts.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thoughts...hah. Admit it you were probably imagining you outfit for tonight or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just smiled and collected out coffee cups to walk them over to the trash. Corbin and I were grabbing coffee before class. Both of us had  a light class day. We both attended Sterlite university. In fact that was how we met. Not in class, but on the way. I was lost and Corbin gallantly came to my rescue. Of course he was new as well and had no clue how to get around either. We both ended up lost and late to our class. But it was worth it. I don't know what was up with Corbin lately. He always has had a healthy dose of confidence, which I found attractive. But here lately he has been making jabs at me. Like that all my thoughts would be about clothing. Really!  I was a business major who has made the dean's list every year. I was well on my way to scoring a very sought after internship was a multi-million dollar company. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I knew that Corbin was in a very stress time of his college career. He was probably just stressed. That was one reason I bought him these tickets. I wanted him to have a night out where he could relax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I gotta go babe,\" he said as I came back to our both. \"Don't want to be late. I'll see you later for the game.\" He got up and rushed out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I can't wait,\" I called back.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girl,\" my best friend Moeisha called out after catching up to me after my last class that day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have I told you how jealous I am that you scored tickets to the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. Not you too. Please don't mention this stupid game. I am starting to wish I never got those tickets. These last two weeks have been torture.\" I said dramatically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah,\" she said exaggeratingly. So tough. Let's see. 1) you have a super hot boyfriend. 2) you are going to the game of the season with said hotty. 3) Not only is your love life amazing, but everyone knows you are going  to get the internship with Dreamer Inc. Yep torture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. \"Nobody knows I'm going to get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh she said unconvincingly. Well I'm just saying you better take lots of pictures. And I want all the details from the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did I know my night was going  to be so chaotic there would be no time for pictures.

Jared was the assistant professor. Most of the females in my class loved the days when Jared was the lecturer. I could understand why. Jared was an attractive man. He would definitely fall into the tall dark and handsome category with his athletic 6'4 frame, wavy dark locks, and ice-blue eyes. But in my opinion those eyes held secrets. Secrets that gave me the hebi gebis. There was something about the way he looked at you, like he was the top dog. I don't know how else to explain. Something deep in my bones told me to stay away.  So unlike the other girls in my class who were giving me the stink eye, I was not pleased to have caught his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mr. Pingleton,\" he replied as he reached me. \"I have told you to call me Jared. Mr. Pingleton makes me sound stuffy,\" He showed off perfect teeth while giving me a devastatingly handsome smile. I could feel the lingering girls melting into puddles from the sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't feel like that would be appropriate,\" I politely replied. I did not want him to get the wrong impression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look flashed across his face. Now the look could have passed off as disappointed or hurt, but I felt something more. Almost like he just expected me to be putty in his hands.  No thank you. I was not going to be one of those girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned up the charm, \"Well I am just going to have to try harder to get you to change your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot likely I thought. \"Did you need something? I am catching a game with my boyfriend and really need to be on my way.\" Yes I will admit that I might have emphasized the word boyfriend However, that apparently did not stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that is too bad. I wanted to talk with you about your possible internship with my uncle's company. You know Sterlite Inc.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe threw it out  casually, but I could totally tell he was name dropping. I just stared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean I know that it is a sought after position. I am more than willing to give you some.....suggestions to give you a edge over your competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh-uh, I thought. I just bet he had suggestions. \"I appreciate it, but like I said I really need to go because I already have plans.\" With that I began to once again walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But wait!\" he said with a mix of disbelief and frustration. \"What about the internship?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate the offer, but if I can't get the internship on my own, then it was just not meant to be.\" I had made it to the door and thought I had made my escape when he grabbed my arm. I jerked around, and saw barely contained anger in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that is a noble ideal. It seems like you would be an excellent addition to our team. Here take one our Sterlite bars as an offer of good will towards your future success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" I shakily said. By the end the anger had receded from his eyes. He was back to his normally charming self. I almost had myself convinced that I imagined the anger. I took the snack bar and quickly left the room. When I looked over my shoulder, he was still at the door. Standing and staring with an oddly satisfied look on his face. I shivered and picked up my speed. I just wanted to get this encounter over with.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n\"I am so excited babe,\" Corbin gushed. \"This is going to be epic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" I said mustering as much enthusiasm as I could. It didn't matter though because Corbin was not paying me any attention. He was so focused on the game that he wasn't listening to me. I had tried to tell him about my weird encounter earlier. He didn't seem the think it was a big deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are just being paranoid. He wasn't coming on to you. I mean really the dude is set for life. His uncle is loaded, and I'm sure he will get a part of that. There is no way he is choosing to go after you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I have to admit after all this was said, I was a little heated. I mean who could blame me. Maybe he didn't mean it the way it came out but it sounded pretty bad. I wanted to rant and rave and raise cane, but what good would it do? As angry and hurt as I was, I would probably only say things I didn't mean which I couldn't take back. I will admit Corbin was acting kinda jerkish here lately, but that was not the Corbin I had fallen hard for. At the beginning of the relationship he was so thoughtful and romantic. My parents did not have the most healthy relationship during my childhood. They eventually divorced after it came out that my dad was having an affair. He has since been in and out of relationships with a plethora of women. Mom meanwhile played the martyr. Needless to say, I was kinda wary about letting people in to close. But Corbin had been both understanding and patient. He was my friend before my boyfriend. Plus all relationships went through rough patches. We would just need to talk it out once our lives were a little less chaotic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, my stomach began to rumble. I realized I had not eaten lunch today. We still had about an hour until we got to the game location. I was not about to ask Corbin to stop and get something. I was still angry. I dug through my bag and pulled out the Sterlite bar. I really wasn't too fond of these things, but I was hungry. I opened the wrapper and took a bite. I had to admit it tasted pretty good. It was different from the other  ones I had tried. Maybe it was a new flavor. <br>\r\n~~~~~<br>\r\nBy the time we pulled up to the gate, it was packed. I really wasn't too fond of crowds but I could manage for a while. Corbin found a place to park and then came over to help me out of the car. A little of my anger faded away. He could be a gentleman. We would work things out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Man, oh man, I love this atmosphere. I wonder where are seats are?</i> I heard Corbin say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly told him how to get to our seats. He gave me a strange look, but nevertheless we headed towards our seats. Now the journey took longer because Corbin was constantly stopping to talk to someone. I was used to this however. He was a true people person. Only some of the things he said did not match up to the reactions from the people. Like  when he called an acquaintance I cheapsake for not paying back some owed money, the guy just smiled and high-fived him. Boys were weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe made it to our seats and I heard Corbin say, <i>Man I wish I would have grabbed a Dr. Pepper.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's odd,\" I said. Corbin was a die-hard Sprite fan. If not Sprite then water or gatorade. He rarely drank anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is odd?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanting Dr. Pepper,\" I said nonchalantly. \"You normally want....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know I wanted Dr. Pepper?\" he asked puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled my eyes as I replied, \"Because you just said it.\" I got up to go get a Dr. Pepper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I didn't say that out loud did I. I must have. That's crazy. I bet she is going to get me a Dr. Pepper. I should probably offer her to go but I really don't want to miss a second of this. Oh well she won't mind. She would probably insist. She always does. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared at him for a while in confusion. Why was he rambling like that. And then I noticed something. His lips weren't moving. If his lips were not moving what was I hearing. I dropped back down to my seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh I guess she changed her mind. Oh well those people who are walking up and down the isles selling snacks should be coming through soon. I just hope I'm not so focused on the game that I miss them. I can't believe I am here. This is...why is she looking at me like that. </i>\"Babe?\" Corbin said with a raised brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...\" I stammered. \"I think I just read your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately heard a series of explicatives. Which surprised me. Corbin knew how I felt about cussing and normally didn't curse around me. <i>Is she kidding?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I'm not kidding. And man that's quite some language.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes widened. Then I heard him think....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I don't know how you did it but you got me good.\" he said while wiping tears out of his eyes. <i>Read my mind. Yeah right. If she could read my mind she would not be sitting here calmly after....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly my head started aching something fierce. I had to close my eyes to fight against the pounding. The roaring crowd was too loud and the sunlight was killer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now babe, don't be embarrassed that I found out your trick. You will just have to try harder next time,\" Corbin stated while gently patting me on the back. Really! Did he even know me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hands began to shake and my eyes watered. I couldn't think about Corbin right now. I had to do something about this excruciating pain. I grabbed my bag and got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dani?\" Corbin called. Maybe he did feel some remorse. You don't have to get me a Dr. Pepper. I really think the game is about to start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sped away. If my head wasn't splitting open I probably would have him a thing or two. But there was no time for that. I needed to get to a quiet, dark place. Then I could check my purse for some aspirin. Maybe a wet cloth would help to. I decide to make my way to the bathroom. Today must have been my luck day because there was no line. I went in and proceeded to wet a paper towel. By this point the pain had started to dull a little. Maybe it would go away on its own.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI heard the door open. A few girls walked in. I had classes with a couple of them. All of a sudden my mind felt like it was on fire again. This time I was weak with the pain. I made my way out of the bathroom and barely had the energy to plop down on a bench. I placed my head in lap and just rocked back and forth. I couldn't even manage to put the wet towel up to my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt gentle hands on my back. \"Hey there, are you okay?\" The words were just as gentle and soothing as the hands. I am normally not a touchy-feely person. But right now I was not going to complain. My pain was easing just a little. Enough that I was able to raise up and look at my rescuer.

Are you okay?\" she said while continuing to rub soft small circles into my back. Professor Kawalski was a conundrum. She looked very unassuming. Her clothes were always conservative but stylish. It was almost like she did not want to draw attention to herself. Then there was the fact that not only was she a noted professor at Sterlite University, she was also on the board of adviser for Sterlite Inc. She wasn't family either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSterlite Inc was one of the oldest companies in Georgia. It started out as a small manufacturing company, but has since then continued to expand. Looking at this companies history is fascinating. Okay maybe only to a business geek like me but whatever. Somehow Sterlite Inc always managed to start a new venture before it gets big. In other words everybody wanted to be a part of this company. However, understandably, it was very picky with its hires. Most of the employers were family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Kawalski was not family however, and yet she was  able to get a coveted position. And despite all this was able to come across as real and normal. Not some business suit wearing, power-walking, no time for anyone executive. She was down-to-earth. Now don't get me wrong, she was no pushover. And her classes, I have been on her roster every chance I could, were some of the most challenging, yet beneficial I have ever been apart of. I'll admit she was kind of my hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was shocked to find her here at a game. \"I'm ok. I just got a migraine all of a sudden. I think I have some medicine in my purse,\" I said weakly. While my pain had lessened some, moving was still not a good idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind?\" she asked while motioning to my purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. Which was a bad idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to search my purse for the medicine when I heard a gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you get this?\" she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked over and noticed she had the wrapper of the bar that Jared gave me. \"Mr. Pingleton gave it to me after class.\" Maybe the pain was getting to me but I thought I saw fire flash in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext thing I knew, I heard her say..... </span></div></div>",

What did he have to do with this? And what is this. All of a sudden the pain came back in full force. I cried out in pain and doubled back over. This time I felt myself slowly fading away.<br>\r\n~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext thing I knew, I woke up in a room that was not mine. My head still felt a little fuzzy. I slowly turned my head to get a better look at the room. I was afraid the movement would bring back the pain, but it didn't. Thank goodness. I found myself in a very elegantly decorated room. The colors were bold and the bed felt amazing. Now I should probably be worried about why I was in a strange bed, but I couldn't bring myself to care. Until I heard the door open anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good you are awake,\" I heard a complete stranger utter. At this point I begin to become a little..or a lot nervous. I desperately tried to think back to the last thing I remembered. The problem was my brain was not cooperating. It was almost like I couldn't think. At least not about anything that mattered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now. Don't worry,\" the stranger said. \"You are not in any trouble and are safe. Actually there are a lot of people who would want to be in your position. In fact many would see this as an honor.\" The stranger continued to ramble about honor and destiny. What was going on and why couldn't I remember no matter how hard I tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oswald,\" a familiar voice admonished. \"I told you not to disturb our guest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No ma'am I wasn't disturbing her. I was trying to comfort her and reassure her. You see when I came in to check on her, quietly I promise, she was awake. She seemed to be rather bothered. I knew you didn't want her upset so I began telling her about what a honor she is being bestowed upon her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oswald, Oswald,\" the woman's voice interjected. \"I know you were trying to help, but I believe you are overwhelming her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOswald froze and looked at me. \"I'm so sorry miss. I didn't mean to. I was just trying to..\" his voice broke off. The poor man looked positively devastated. I was feeling bad for him, and I was the one in a compromising situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not your fault,\" I said. \"I'm just a little confused.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oswald why don't you go get her some water. I\"m sure that would make her feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOswald's face immediately lifted and he practically ran out the room.  \"You will have to excuse him. He can be a little over the top, but he means well and has a heart of gold.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just weakly smiled. I knew that her voice and face were familiar but once again, I just couldn't bring the information into fruition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must have a million questions? I promise to answer them all. I just need you remain calm and listen to everything we have to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We?\" I inquired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes. I have informed Josh Sterlite that you were rousing. He should be here any minute. But let's go ahead and start what would you like to know first?</span></div></div>",

He was dressed very distinguishable in sable colored suit. I didn't know this man, but just his presence seemed to put me at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well hello there.

At least I think I was?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, nonsense you are not a burden,\" Natasha said while giving the gentleman a pointed look. \"We just find ourselves in  a new situation and are trying to determine the best way to proceed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man didn't say anything for a long time. He just continued to stare at Natasha. Not in a creepy way of anything. It was almost like he was trying to communicate something to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was started to get a little uncomfortable. Like they were trying to keep me out of the loop. Not that they needed to try too hard. I couldn't even find the loop. \"Well you don't have to go out of your way on my account. You said the meds would wear off soon, so I should be getting my memories back. I'm sure at that point I will be able to take care of....whatever is going on. And as long as I\"m not dying I'm sure I can figure something out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a very brave offer considering the situation in which you find yourself in. However, it is not necessary. And frankly implausible. I'm afraid what you are experiencing is not like anything you have dealt with before. But don't worry...its not bad...just different. But that is enough of these vague words. Let's cut to the chase. It seems you have found yourself in the middle of some family secrets. Now I am going to do something about the mental block that was put on you. As soon as do so you might begin to feel some discomfort as your memories begin to flood back in. Normally I would say this would go away very quickly but due to some.....other circumstances it will probably lead to some serious pain. I can help, or rather give you the resources and knowledge to overcome that problem but first you have to get your memories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just stared at the man. He really wasn't making a whole lot of sense. I got the impression he knew he wasn't but needed to get through the information. He really did seem to be a little out-there, but my gut was telling me to trust him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So once you think you have your memories, then I can begin to ease the pain and work on a solution. All you have to do is take my hand to let me know you are ready?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tentatively took his hand. As soon as I did, it was like my mind became flooded with information. I saw my parents, birthday parties (or lack of), school event. My friend, boyfriends. I knew Natasha Kawalski (my low key hero). Once I had time to really process this, I would be freaking out that she saw me in this state. I also recognized Joshua Sterlite. THE JOSHUA STERLITE. I was definitely going to have a geek out later. It would have to be later though because I also remembered my altercation with Jared and going to the game with Corbin. Then I remembered feeling like I read his mind, and going to the bathroom and....then nothing because the pain was back in spades. I felt like my head was going to explode. There was too much inside and it wasn't made to control all of it. Tears were running freely down my flushed face. I couldn't do this. I couldn't take much more of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joshua I think she has had enough.\" Professor Kawalski sounded nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes. I just had to be sure or else we will have to repeat this unpleasant process\" He put his hand to my forehead and almost immediately the pain disappeared. I sighed and sagged in relief. \"Is that better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thank you\" I said weakly. I wish I could say that all my confusion cleared up immediately, but it didn't. Now was puzzled what just happened, and why I was with these 2 people. Where was I? Why was I here? What happened to Corbin? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow down, slow down.\" I will answer all your questions in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood I thought. Wait a minute I didn't say that out loud...did I?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you did not. That is one of the many things we are going to have to talk about. But first.....</span></div></div>",

This is crazy! Am I dreaming? Surely that had to be it. Otherwise how could he have stopped the searing pain with just a touch to my forehead. And really what was causing the pain? What was happening to me..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Danielle I know this is overwhelming and confusing, but I really need you to pay attention.\" Mr. Sterlite said while patiently trying to get my attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to push my panic filled thoughts away. \"I'm sorry I will try to ...no I will focus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No apologies necessary. As I was saying it is of the utmost importance that you keep the information to yourself.  I also realize what I am about to say my seem....preposterous but keep an open mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering the turn my life has taken in the last few hours I wasn't sure what to believe or not believe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So my family is not your average family. Many people attribute our family with the  founding of our town. That is mostly true. Our ancestor many many years ago were looking for a place to settle. It seems like we were drawn to this land. Once we...they got here it became apparent why. These lands were hurting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lands were hurting? What did that mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mankind has made many marvelous advancements, but those advancements come with a price. The price was that the earth was hurting it was becoming diseased.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew that both Dreamer Inc and Sterlite Inc. were very adamant about being nature conscious. I had no opinions one way or another, but I had done my homework for both companies. I only applied for an internship for Dreamer Inc. but it never hurt to be too prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might be wondering what that has to do with what is happening today.

I thought you said a deal with the fae.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave me a nonchalant smile. \"You heard me correctly. What do you know of the fae?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mean other than the fact that they are fictional, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assure you they are not quite real. They tend to stay in the shadows however because as history has proven time and time again, people are not always accepting of differences. And honestly I can't blame the fear. Fae can be very powerful creatures. Some of the things I have seen them do...well it could give you nightmares if you think about it being used against you.\" He shuddered. \"Anyways, as I mentioned before as humans became more advanced, the earth became less and less healthy. Most creatures of the fae have a very strong and spiritual connection to the earth. This angered them, and trust me when I say that their ways are not our ways. It had gotten to the point where they were ready to do real damage. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damage?\" I know what he was saying made no sense. It sounded like something from a storybook. And really there were lots of parts I could have questioned. I really wasn't even sure if I believe the words I was being told, but I was a huge fangirl. I was in awe of Josh Sterlite's companies, and his achievements. Maybe he was secretly crazy. Maybe he wasn't. Either way I might as well go with it for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile and an approving look flashed through his eyes. \"Yes well...just like people have different personalities and morals so do the fae. Some of the more volatile breeds wanted to wipe out all of humanity. Some thought it would be a good idea to destroy all factories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped. \"What stopped them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One fateful moment. Or at least that is how my family likes to think about it. This event occurred many many years ago. I...I mean on of my ancestors was taking a hike through the woods of his property. We came upon a a woodland nymph. She was the most gorgeous creature you could imagine although otherworldly in appearance. Her skins was a pale green. Ivy leaves crowned her head. But she wasn't moving. She was obviously in distress laid out on a tree stump. Once approached she had fear and despair in her eyes. Like the fight had left her. I turns out she had been injured by a rival force. She had become separated from the rest of her allies. My family gave her shelter and helped her gain her strength. At first she was hesitant. She mentioned the fact that by housing her we would be in danger. That didn't stop my family. Apparently the fae had witnessed other instances of bravery, compassion, and understanding. After lots of talks, from both ends, it was decided that certain human families would be both guards and go-betweens. My family is one of the chosen ones. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused. Not because he was finished, but like he was waiting for my reaction. How was I going to react?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I wish I could say that I reacted calmly. I took in all the information and relayed any questions I had. That would have been the dignified way to handle this situation. Afterall, I had 2 people whom I admired the most in a room with me. I really, really wanted to make a good impression. But that is not what happened. I bursted out laughing. Not a little laugh either. I guffawed so hard I had tears running down my face and I was having trouble breathing. I noticed Professor Kawalski and Mr. Sterlite were exchanging questioning looks. I'm sure they probably were wondering if I was going crazy. Let's be honest, this whole situation was crazy. Luckily I was saved from trying to relay my feeling by Oswald walking in with a tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny. Did I miss a joke. I do so love jokes. Will someone tell me the joke.\" He walked over to the bedside table and laid down his tray. It contained water, some fruit, cheese, crackers, and a Sterlite bar. \"I know you just asked for water,\" he continued not giving anyone a chance to tell him the joke, if there was one, \"but then I though you might be hungry. I'm not sure what you like to eat, and I didn't want to bring you too much in case I brought something you didn't like but were felt like you had to eat it because you didn't want to seem rude. So instead I just brought you a snack. But then I didn't know if you wanted something salty or sweet. Or if you were extremely health conscious. If figured these were good options to start out with. But if you don't like it please don't feel like you have to eat it. Or if you are really hungry tell me what you have a taste for and I will bring you some real food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was tired just listening to him. He was literally talking a mile a minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oswald,\" Professor Kawalski cut in quickly once she had a chance, \"I am sure this  is absolutely perfect. Why don't you leave this here and go see if Cookie needs any help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I will do that.\" He immediately made his way to the door when he turned back around. \"But what about the joke?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will tell you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, I had gotten my laughter under control. I took a sip of water to give myself some time to think. And to hopefully calm the redness I could feel creeping over my face. Whether what I heard was true or not (and after the day I was having who was I judge) I still wasn't sure what it had to do with me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes well. When we were elected with this honor, the question of protection was brought up. Originally some of the fae representatives volunteered to guard my family. However, the fae were unprepared for how fertile humans were. Apparently most fae breeds had one pregnancy ever 100 years or so. Then as the children grew up they wanted to go off to college so we had to revise our plan. Without protection, the breeds who deemed mankind as unworthy, could attack my family and delve the world into chaos. So it was decided that my family needed to be powerful enough to defend ourselves. Therefore we were gifted certain abilities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Abilities?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we hide the powers from other humans because you can imagine what people would do if they knew about them. The relatives who are share the same blood as the original have more varied and stronger powers which they are born with. However anyone who marries into the family also needs protection, but not necessarily to the same degree. The fae aren't as trusting. Normally they have to be vetted, and are given powers with conditions.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have to admit. I was kind of caught up in this story. It sounds pretty amazing, and a little daunting. I was trying to figure out, however, how this connected to me. I'm pretty sure I am not related to the Sterlite's and I\"m definitely not marrying one. So why would I need to know this. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The original way to get these powers included a meeting with a representative fae. We never know which breed we are going to get and trust me a meeting with any other them can be......intense. Now thanks to scientific and technological advancement's my company is experimenting with alternative way to pass on the power. Before I continue I need a little bit of information from you. Can you tell me about your day up until now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was a little taken aback by this question. I mean what did he want me to tell? Where did I even start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you begin with when you woke up this morning and just tell me what you are comfortable with. If I have any questions I will stop you and ask for more information\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this was why he was my hero. He was literally answering my questions before I even asked. I began telling him about my day. The normal stuff waking up, getting ready, meeting Corbin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corbin Watkins?\" Professor Kawalski asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes he is my boyfriend and we had plans to see the big game today...\" my voice trailed off and my eyes grew wide. \"I was at the game with him. He has got to be worried. Where is my phone\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed me my purse. I fumbled through it to find my phone. I looked and saw several missed calls. I opened up my texting app and saw he had texted a few times. At first he was just questioning where I was. Then he turn a little angry. I shot him a quick text telling him I was ok and would call him tomorrow when I checked the time stamps of the text. He did not start asking for me until right about when half time should be. It took him that long to notice my disappearance. Really. I looked up to find both sets of eyes on me. I flinched and quickly put my phone away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways after that I went to class. Mr. Pingleton was lecturing today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you have any interactions with Jared outside of class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mentally shuddered thinking about it. I know Corbin thought I was being paranoid, but Jared had really been off. \"Yes he wanted to speak to me about my internship with Sterlite Inc.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Sterlite's eyes lit up. \"Oh you applied for an internship with us? Delightful\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes..well no... kinda? I really applied for Dreamer Inc, but while they are both related they are technically different. I would have loved to have an opportunity for Sterlite Inc, but I knew it was likely they wouldn't even except applicants. Therefore I went through Dreamer instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm....is that all with Jared\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hesitated. I didn't want to mention the fact that it seemed like Jared wanted to talk about things of a more personal nature. Afterall I was talking to his grandfather. He would probably think I was just reading more into it like Corbin did. I notice him start frowning, so I continued on. \"Pretty much he just gave me a snack bar in celebration of the possibility of working  together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was this bar one of the Sterlite bars?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes although it must have been a new flavor because I hadn't tasted it before. But it was delicious.\" I didn't want to tell him I really didn't like any of the other flavors. \"Anyways its a good thing he did. Corbin was so excited to get to the game that he didn't want to stop for food. I ate the bar. Then we arrived at the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon I mentioned Jared, Professor Kawalski gave Mr. Sterlite a pointed look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you anything odd after you ate the bar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean I did start to get a head ache. And....\" I had forgotten until this point the moment when I thought I could read Corbin's mind. I thought about whether I should mention it or not, but in  the end I might a well. \"There was one thing...maybe. I really thing I was reading Corbin's mind. He of course didn't believe me and before I could explore further my headache got worse. I though to cool off for a while, so I went to the restroom to splash water on my face. For a while it eased but when some girls from school came in it got so much more intense. I barely made it to a bench outside when you found me.\" I addressed the last part to the professor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is what I feared. It seems there is one more side to this story that I need.\"</span></div></div>",
