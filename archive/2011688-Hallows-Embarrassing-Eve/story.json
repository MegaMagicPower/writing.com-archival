Kids share superstitions and scary stories- how in one school bathroom stall, a ghostly janitor waits for those who's enter alone, how a long dead little leaguer still stalks the schools diamond after dark. Stores start to stock sweets and strange ensembles, macabre pieces of plastic and other disturbing decorations. People feel tricky, mischievous grins plastered on their faces as they prepare for a night of parties and pranks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, October 31st, Halloween night. A fun night for most; not for one person though. Call it bad luck, a haunting or a curse, but they experience an embarrassing night of humiliation and nudity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat sort of night are they planning on having?</span></div></div>",

See, not a lot happened in East Weston, it being a small, suburban town, so people took a lot of fun in what they could. Namely, holidays were a big thing for their community, and the high schools Halloween dance was probably one of the biggest events of the school year, behind prom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Jack had been to a Halloween dance before. He hadn't grown as attached to Halloween as everyone else apparently had. Still, for such a big deal, he felt he should go at least once. Plus as a senior, he could enjoy something most lowerclassmen couldn't- the after parties. He'd gladly endure the chaperoned school event for a chance to be invited to one of those. He was a nice enough guy- nice enough looking too, with a lean body and brown, fair hair. He figured if he rubbed enough elbows, he could get into one easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, he felt kind of ridiculous, walking into his school at 7:30 pm, dressed as...</span></div></div>",

Still, he wasn't lazy. He didn't want to just be zombie Jack (nor did he want to ruin any of his own clothes), so he had gone to Goodwill and picked up some some duds that his friends assured him were \"classic Romero\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever that meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had found an old grey blazer straight out of the 70s, a similarly anachronistic white button up shirt, a stodgy tie, and slacks with leg openings so big you get lost in them. He figured if he cut out a few jaw-shaped patches of fabric and liberally applied fake blood, he'd at last pass for an extra in a zombie flick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn't seen his most reliable companion, Tom, on the way into school- that wasn't a big surprise. Tom had been jabbering on and on about some elaborate costume that was sure to not only boost them the necessary rungs on the social ladder to get them into a party afterwards, but that the girls would be so awe-struck that they'd go anywhere and do anything with him. Tom would describe himself as a \"visionary\", \"dreamer\", or \"iconoclast\". Jack would describe him as a \"schemer\", \"lech\", or \"person who doesn't know what iconoclast means\", but they had a long standing and strong friendship dating back to before either of them could tell time. Tom got the pair into trouble pretty regularly, but Jack's relaxed charm would usually mitigate things a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack also had yet to see Sherry, the crush of his that dated back almost as long as his friendship with Tom. Sherry was whip-smart, gentle, driven, and had a warm smile that could melt Jack from 50 paces. Jack tried not to think of himself as a push-over, but any request she made of Jack got fulfilled, by hook or by crook. She had been elusive when Jack had asked what she would be going to the dance as, saying she wanted to surprise him, a tinge of rose in her cheeks. Jack nearly swallowed his gum when she said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts swirling through Jack's mind, he pushes the doors open to the school hallways. Cheesy Halloween songs taunt his ears from the nearby gym. As he walks through the corridors, a gaggle of some of the more well-liked students file out and head deeper into the school. Where does Jack's evening go from here?</span></div></div>",

Jack's better judgement evaporated instantly and he followed the girl into the restroom. She stood in the middle of the room, modestly covering a sexy costume, blushing furiously. \"Jack, I made a huge mistake. I wanted to be something sexy for Halloween, but I... I think I got carried away. I can't be seen like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked her up and down. From the neck up, you'd think it was your standard Bride of Frankenstein costume. Below that though... The white garment seemed to be centered around a ring that was precisely calibrated over her naval. Strips of fabric pulled on the ring as they went off in various directions to (barely) cover Sherry's lovely body. Two of the strips were pulled taught over her plump breasts and smooth shoulders and then met low on her back, just above her round bottom. They co-mingled there before parting three different ways: two strips went high across her hips and down to the ring and the third narrowed between her legs before snuggly obscuring her nethers and meeting the ring. The effect left a her thighs entirely bare, and enough of her butt was visible to warrant an emergency session of the PTA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was flabbergasted. He had never seen this much of Sherry, though he had spent many a thoughtful night imagining. A voice in his head celebrated that his imagination hadn't been too far off in this case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never really tried on the costume by myself- only with Sonya and Julie and they just kept telling me how great I look and how much you would love-\" Sherry clammed up, somehow turning a deeper shade of red than she had been before. She looked away for a moment before she turned back to him. \"I can't be seen like this, not at school! They'll kick me off the student council! I'll be made a sex criminal! I won't be able to be valedictorian!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack felt this was an odd ordering of priorities, but he was not so bold as to say so. He felt for the girl and decided on a solution. She could take some of his costume.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sherry smiled a little at the warmth of his touch, meeting one of his hands. \"Hey, it's gonna be okay,\" he told her. \"Just get in my pants!\" Sherry's brow narrowed in confusion, bewildering Jack for a moment. \"Oh, oh my god no. Not like that. I mean, you can wear my pants. The lower half seems to be the skimpier part, so if you do wear these then we should be okay!\" He started to undue his belt as he was talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile welled up on Sherry's face. \"You'd do this for me? You're not embarrassed?\" she asked as the pants hit the floor with a jangle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack awkwardly tried to pull the pants down over his shoes while standing before resigning himself to sitting on the floor to do it. \"Well, it's a little embarrassing, but my boxers cover everything important. As long as nothing too arrous- err, exciting happens, I should be okay.\" He successfully removed the garment and handed them up to her. She took the pants and turned her back on him, as she slid on leg after the other. Jack was given a rather impressive show of her behind and felt his manhood stirring. He felt a sudden cold air on the tip- these boxers had lost their button, he thought with a wave of terror. If he gets aroused, his penis is gonna stick clean through!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ta-daa,\" Sherry announced as she whirled around, \"what do you think?!\" Jack did his best to obscure his genitals with the bottom of his blazer. Judging by her reaction, she hadn't noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they're a little big on you but I guess that's what the belt is for. It works though! You look like Frankenstein's Bride's Sexy Accountant!\" Sherry beamed at this remark, leaning over and giving him a quick peck on the cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, you are a life saver. Come on, I owe you a dance.\" She took his hand in hers and began to pull him towards to door. </span></div></div>",

As they made their way onto the dance floor, no one really seemed to pay them too much mind. Sure, some guys might have stared at Sherry as they passed, considering her upper half was still covered by just two strands of fabric. Sure, Jack might have gotten a few giggles and sideways glances at his lack of slacks. But it never lasted more than a few seconds- pretty much everyone was dressed in silly/skimpy attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mixed-and-matched monsters made their way though the crowd into the middle of the dance floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his credit, Jack didn't dance terribly. It wasn't great dancing per se, but he didn't really care at this point. There was something about being pantsless in the middle of his school gymnasium that kind of negated anything else making him feel ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherry, on the other hand, was really getting into it. Jack tried as best he could but it was hard not stare. The fabric covering her chest didn't offer much support, shifting as Sherry shimmied and Shook. Meanwhile, down South, his oversized slacks hung on her hips, even despite how baggy they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the shifting and staring the young zombie was doing, it wasn't surprising when 'rigor mortis' started to set in. And, as Jack continued to dance, his slowly stiffening member made its way to his fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cool breeze across his crotch caused him to come screeching to a halt. Looking down, he got a clear idea of his predicament- his semi-erect helmet had pushed its way free from his fly. Luckily the room was fairly dark, and no one seemed to have noticed. Sherry was turned away from him, still dancing, still swaying her hips as the pants drape across her backside...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a little more of his length leave its linen confines, Jack snapped himself back into focus. He brought his hands down between his legs, hoping to fix his problem.Naturally, it was then that...</span></div></div>",

With a deep baseline, and smooth, sultry tones playing over the speakers, it had gotten to that part of the night most of the student body had been waiting for.  On hearing the music change, Sherry immediately turned around, and smiled at Jack, who had removed his arms from his crotch just in time.  \"Now, how about that dance?\" Sherry said invitingly, a hint of red in her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Jack answered, only barely able to maintain composure after being caught off guard like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Sherry took Jack's hands with her own, pulling him in close.  Jack stumbled into the rhythm, anxious as the ambient air continued tickling across the tip of his penis with every turn they took.  Nervously, he tried to will his erection to go away, but it wasn't working.  If dancing with Sherry just a few feet away from him was enough to bring it up, then actually dancing together and holding hands, mere inches apart, meant that no excitement would be snuffed out anytime soon.  Maybe if he tried looking at something else? he thought, glancing in another direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack?  Is something wrong?\" Sherry asked, noticing his distracted attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no,\" he said quickly, trying to play it cool.  \"I just, uh, thought we were gonna hit someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On a slow dance?  I think everyone's too busy to do much moving around,\" Sherry said humorously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, yeah,\" Jack trailed off, looking back at Sherry once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, they picked up where they left off, Jack doing his best to ignore his lower problem.  Nearly an inch of it was free from his boxers now, or was it too inches?  Either way the tip was fully free and he wasn't going to look down to check.  He was actually dancing with Sherry after all!  Everything would be fine, and he could just adjust himself after this song with no one else the wiser.  Unfortunately, as the song was winding up to a close...</span></div></div>",

As much as he was trying to keep his situation from Sherry, he didn't need to end up surrounded by classmates while his member pointed skyward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the situation was about to become incredibly obvious to Sherry. Not only was the proximity between the two dancers virtually zero, but the general mood of having her head pressed up next to his (not to mention her breasts pressed into his chest) was only doing more to pump blood down below. And then Jack felt it; the dreadful, awful, wonderful feeling of his head prodded her legs, his knees getting weak as it brushed up against the fabric of his own pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherry stiffened, and Jack's heart sank, a million excuses and apologies coming to mind but unable to escape his throat as his would-be girlfriend...</span></div></div>",

She\u2019s been telling them for months that she would probably show up as a vampire queen, but in recent weeks she\u2019s come up with something a little more unusual that no one she knows will expect from her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLana fell in love with the idea of creating a sort of sexy werewolf costume, so she ordered an expensive full head wolf mask online.  The mask is held in place by a zipper, and while on, all talking comes out as growls and roaring sounds and the eyes glow red.  Next, she went to a great deal of trouble finding some synthetic fur the exact color of the mask, and spent a whole week leading up to Halloween diligently pasting the faux fur to a dark colored leotard.  Along with some furry gloves and footies that go over her sneakers, she is finally ready to go.  A furry tail attached to a belt with a small fanny pack (for her phone, ID, etc) finishes out her genius costume idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe party is already under way down the block, and it\u2019s exciting to traipse her way down the street sans all clothing besides the skintight, furry leotard and face-hiding mask.  Lana is enjoying the festive atmosphere of Halloween Night as kids scramble by in their cute costumes, cars slowly cruise by, and music and spooky sounds from several residences fills the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSomeone across the street lights some lady-fingers fireworks, and their sudden pop-pop-popping gives Lana a start, so that her long legs get a little quivery for a second.  It\u2019s then that she notices how itchy and annoying the costume can become when she shivers, but it doesn\u2019t feel THAT agitating, and besides, she\u2019s there now, at the stoop leading up to the Henderson\u2019s!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The party is in full swing, and she squeezes her way into the packed house.  It\u2019s chaos, and she guesses the whole neighborhood invited all their friends from the surrounding neighborhoods to come!    Their whole big downstairs is packed wall-to-wall with revelers, young and old, and Lana grabs a drink off of a tray carried by a gaunt looking zombie butler.  From what she can tell, the way down into their basement has a line moving slowly down there, and there are even more people all along the stairs and bannisters along the upstairs balcony.  The bumping and jostling gets Lana all itchy again, and she politely tries to apologize when someone bumps her into someone else.  She is next bumped right into a little boy, who holds up a huge fake spider at her which causes Lana to jump back in fear.  Unfortunately, her ass pokes right into the crotch of Mr. Handley, a neighbor she always tries to avoid during the entire year, and especially on Halloween!  She tries to apologize, but it comes out as a howl, and the laughing man dressed up as a prisoner with fake ball &amp; chain only laughs and grabs her around the waist, saying, \u201cRawr yourself, darling!\u201d.  Fortunately, Lana realizes that he doesn\u2019t recognize her, and she is about to bonk him in the crotch with her knee when his wife (as an Indian maiden) returns to his side, inquiring who his friend is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLana has already taken the opportunity of a gap in the crowd to dart away from her creep neighbor towards where she knows the downstairs bathroom is.  Her skin is itching like mad now in the leotard, though her face and head aren\u2019t, so she assumes it\u2019s something about the leotard or the glue or fur that is getting to her.  All she knows is, she really needs to strip out of this suit for a minute, to see if that relieves her itchiness any.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere is an interminable line for the downstairs bathroom, and Lana starts actively scratching the worst ticklish spots, but that only seems to make things worse.  She even sees Jill Henderson scooting through the crowd with a tray, but Jill doesn\u2019t recognize Lana when she tries to stop her, and only laughs at the great howling wolf costume before shifting out of Lana\u2019s grip on her arm and into the tight crowd of costumed partiers.  Lana then tries to remove her mask to speak to Jill\u2026only the zipper seems to be stuck!  \u201cThis can\u2019t really be happening!\u201d, thinks Lana.  Now she begins yanking furiously at the zipper, so that the mask shifts, and she can't even see.  She fights with all her might, but the zipper is jammed!  Lana is quivering from the awful itchy sensations of the leotard, and rights the mask onn her head so she can at least see again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tries to get her phone out of the small belt pack, but hadn't counted on the unwieldy costume paws getting in the way.  the costume feels increasingly prickly and uncomfortable now, and Lana is itching so bad, but can't scratch herself in this crowded house party without looking like some kind of nymphomaniac amongst people (some of whom she knows).  Almost in a total panic with the unfolding realization of her troubling situation, Lana...  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her fists were clenched as much as was possible with the restrictions of the fake paws. She pressed her arms against her sides to reduce the almost painful itching at least in a few places. Every step required effort. The stairs caused the fur covered leotard to rub against her skin at the crests where her legs met her lower body. A shivering sensation spread from there over her privates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she felt two hands grasping her around her sides. With an angry roar that came from the mask she whirled around and lost her footing on the stairway. Had those hands not held her tight she would have tripped over. \"Now that's a jumpy werewolf\" a male voice said. Lana saw that the man was still holding her wore a fake polar bear fur, which did not cover his bare chest. He squeezed himself next to the girl and made her climb the stairs further, casually leaving his arm around the girl's waist. Now the girl would have cherished a party contact if not the leotard's itching was not driving her almost mad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they reached the stairs Lana tried to break away towards the front door of the house, but the polar bear pushed her into the dining hall where some of his female and male friends were chatting. \"Hey look at this tight furry\" he shouted and squeezed the girl into her sides, making her jump with ticklishness, which caused a load noise. Everyone in this room found this very amusing. Without being able to express her protest, Lana found herself in a circle of people who made approving comments about her costume. But much worse, they started to touch the fur, making the itching in those places completely unbearable. A cocktail was offered to her, which she approved due to politeness. But she had to hold it in both paws. Now she even could not scratch herself even if she dared to. What should Lana do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Leaving on her own was ruled out for the moment unless she got serious, but that might make people suspicious about anything being wrong with her. Luckily the cocktail had a long straw supplied which even allowed the liquid to travel such a long way. She did not oppose when the polar bear put his arm around her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana's thoughts concentrated on what she would do once she could leave the house. Shed the whole furry clad tight suit into the bushes? But how to reach home? A taxi was unlikely to be available. And walking the distance would be a neverending ticklish nightmare. She decided to put her faith into the polar bear's hands. Without pondering further she got rid of the cocktail, took the polar bear's claw and pulled him under the laughing and frolicking of his crew towards the door which connected the dining room with the main hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould she drag him outside or to a quiet place (if can be found) to explain her predicament?

Her lower half was covered with a long dark purple skirt with a very high split on both sides of it, which showed off a lot of leg. She also opted to wear black heels. To keep up with the festivities, she also wore a frilly orange and black panties with a black cat design on them. Lana was finally ready for the Halloween block party.<br>\r\nWhen she showed up, many looked at her in amazement, both for her large breasts and the level of detail in the costume.

But before she could act on any of these ideas the lights suddenly went out and with the curtains drawn the party was plunged into near total darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was initially some shrieks of surprise though amusingly the loudest one didn't sound like it came from a girl.

Someone must have been holding her shoes by their high heels because she almost trips as she steps right out of them, out of her precious costume bunched around her ankles, out of seemingly any hope of regaining her modesty, even her hat abandons her as it fails to follow her momentum, and instead flies off the back of her head as if it was held in place by an unseen hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voluptuous brunette was now as bare as the day she was born in a crowded room at a popular party on halloween.

As she got closer she realized that he seemed a little nervous. Was he holding his cape to try to cover his bare chest? Was he... <i>embarrassed</i>??<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" said Lana. \"Nice costume. Are you Zorro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" he replied. \"I traded it with some guy a little while ago. I don't know why he didn't have a shirt, though.\" Clearly embarrassed, he hurriedly changed the subject. \"Who are you dressed as?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea,\" replied Lana with a grin. \"This isn't my costume either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess not,\" Zorro replied, his gaze drifting down from Lana's face to where her cleavage was peeking out between the stretching buttons of her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana put her cup down on a table with a *clunk* and took a step closer to her shy Zorro, putting her impressive chest even closer to his face. \"Dance with me,\" she murmured. Then she spun around and started dance-walking slowly away, back into the heart of the crowd. Zorro stared at her tight ass in her tight skirt, and then hurried to catch up to her before she got lost in the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lana was where she wanted to be, surrounded by a wall of dancing revelers, she turned around to find her Zorro standing right behind her. Exactly where she knew he would be. She smiled, stepped closer to him, and pressed her body against him while undulating to the beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This costume switcheroo was a brilliant idea,\" she thought. \"No matter how slutty our costumes, we can blame it on someone else. It's not MY fault there are big gaps in between the buttons of this top. It's also not my fault I don't have a bra on - how was I to know?\" Lana spun around and pressed her ass against Zorro's crotch, where there was definitely a long hard sword under his pants. \"Maybe I should keep an eye out for someone I want to trade costumes with the next time the bell rings... mmm but that can wait.\" She put her hands on her thighs and bent forward, pressing her ass even harder against the tight skirt and against Zorro's rock hard appreciation of her costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana's dancing was wild, and sensual, and not at all in keeping with how tight her costume was. If she'd been less drunk, perhaps she wouldn't have danced quite this hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe if it hadn't been someone else's costume, she would have been more worried when she felt little tears as she moved; as it was, she just relished the extra breathing room and kept dancing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe if she hadn't been in the middle of a crowd of people in a hot room, the cool October breeze would have alerted her to her predicament, even inebriated as she was. Maybe... but we'll never know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, she danced on even as one of her buttons popped off, then another. By this point Zorro - and everyone dancing around her - could see much more of her breasts than she ever intended. As they shook and jiggled and bounced, her nipples came into and out of view, much to the delight of every man (and most women) present. They could have told her, but they didn't. And Lana was in her own little world. This might have gone on all night, but then Zorro, our shy hero, decided to make a move: he slide his hands from her hips up towards her partially-bared breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd almost reached them, when he was jostled. Someone shoving their way past Lana, and then Zorro, knocked him so that he lost his balance. If this strains credulity, dear reader, remember the inebriation. Remember how ill-fitting her costume. Remember the magic. Because yes, Zorro was knocked off balance, and made the split-second decision to grab onto the sides of Lana's top as he fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final buttons popped. Lana's arms were pulled back behind her as her top followed Zorro down to the floor behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, she noticed.

It was a big deal on a campus like theirs- enough security to keep them safe but not enough to pose a threat to the party, big established sorority houses that can fit large crowds, a lax enough faculty that doesn't care about student rowdiness so long as the school's academic reputation remains intact...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, it was a perfect blank canvas for a perfect party. Her sorority sisters had offered their assistance, which she had taken happily, and it seemed that everything was ready for the big party. She gave herself a once over in the mirror. The nurse outfit was comprised of a tight white top and short white skirt with red accents, along with a nurses' cap and stethoscope. Everything underneath was also pearly white, garters running down into stockings. All of it contrasted nicely with her tan skin and dark brown hair, bound into a bun to complete the look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came downstairs, checking the time. It was already dark out, and people should have been there by now. If she took any longer, people would wonder where she was.

Amanda frowned as she looked at Loki.  \"Okay, Kyle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle pounded his staff on the ground with petulance and shouted, \"I'm not Jake.  I'm the trickstick god Loki.

It felt odd to be without a bra--and underwear, since she had been running late--so Amanda wondered if the plunging neckline and visible skin was a bit too risque for taking kids trick-or-treating.

As she walked onto the lawn, the demigod and clown attacked.  Bozo jumped up pulled down at the top of the dress while Loki pulled from the bottom.  The two boys weren't strong, but their combined efforts overcame the top material; it torn and quickly moved down Amanda's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son-of-a--\" Amanda exclaimed in bemusement.  She was slow to react as her well-formed rack was exposed.  She moved to catch the falling fabric, but Bozo and Loki pushed her pert rear and she stumbled forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda used her hands to catch herself, leaving her assaulters an opportunity to pull the dress from her legs, leaving her in only high-heeled and her blond wig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Refrench!\" Loki cried and with Bozo gathered up the dress and started to run away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda bit her lip to prevent screaming what she thought about the two boys.

Elsa had turned around and was looking confused at why and how their sitter had taken off her costume but not put anything on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda realized she had to act.  Being naked on Halloween evening was one thing, but when she was babysitting five kids was a whole other charge.

Joe, Sandra, and Allison had teamed up on him over speaker phone, apparently already partaking in some festivities. With all three of them shouting at him to come Trick or Treating with them, he had to cave eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now here he was.

It was nice that he didn't have to deal with getting a costume in less than an hour, and that he had some free time to relax before being forced out. But... maybe he hadn't asked the best people for help. Joe was an alright guy, but didn't really think things through a lot. Sandy was probably capable of putting something together quick enough... but she had difficulty understanding what people would or would not like. If the costume was left up to Sandy, Eric had a feeling he wouldn't like it. And then there was Allison. Out of the four of them, Eric and Allison probably had the prickliest relationship. They got along fine most of the time, but they did like to make jabs at each other, give the other a hard time. He wouldn't put it past Allison to give him something just to screw with his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, in what felt like an eternity and yet no time at all, Eric heard his doorbell ringing. Sighing deeply, he came downstairs and opened his door to a cry of \"Trick-or-Treat!\" from his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe was dressed pretty plainly for a Halloween costume- a baseball players outfit, with accompanying bat and mitt. Sandy was some sort of fairy; not quite Tinkerbell, but with the same sort of wings and dress. And finally, Allison, in some sort of spy suit. The gloves and boots were sleek, the catsuit tight, and even some sort of utility belt to complete the ensemble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Eric began, only to have a bag dropped at his feet.

He was standing there, a pair of sneakers on and a pair of boxers on, but bare besides, desperately trying to wind the bandages around his arm, but every time he let go to grab a piece of tape or snip something with the scissors, the gauze would loosen under just one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay in there...?\" Joe asked from the other side of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, hurry up,\" Allison said, \"it took long enough to get you to come out, lets just do it already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on!\" Eric shouted back, \"It's hard to do this with one pair of hands.\" He struggled for a second longer, but heard Allison snickering from the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need some help?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not from you!\" Eric shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me?\" Joe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric paused for a moment considering the offer. \"Eh...\" If it was Joe, he could trust him to be cool about it, but he wasn't sure Joe would have a better time than he was having.

Knock!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, I guess nap time\u2019s over.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly let her eyes open to take in the darkness that filled the janitor closet 2-B. The twenty-one-year old stood up and tried to maneuver around the various cleaning supplies as she stretched her muscles. Her bones gave a satisfying \u2018crack\u2019 telling the woman that further exercise was not required. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA yawn escaped her grasp as she checked herself over through her camera phone. God, did she look terrible. Many considered Molly to be a kind and cheerful person and she liked to support that notion with her smile; however, fatigue tended to settle in and force her eyelids to drop and brows knot, leading some to suspect her to cause misconduct. Her light-brown hair clung to her top like fur which was accentuated by her height and muscles. The word \u201cSasquatch\u201d was used freely in the workplace. The rest of her clothes were tattered and sagging from the hard labor she already put in today. She felt exhausted already and the day was only half-done. Molly looked at her phone to check the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n12:42 Pm October 31st<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh yeah. Tonight\u2019s Halloween.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe good thing about Halloween: management was obsessed with the holiday and found no \u201cviable\u201d means to stay open till the usual hour when everyone could be preparing to go out trick-or-treating. This allowed Molly to spend time with her friends, receive free candy, and get a couple more hours of sleep for the following day. The bad thing about Halloween: management still worked their employees like dogs until hours before the festivities. This prevented the twenty-one-year old from finding a good costume, or any costume for that matter, as well as the doctor-recommend amount of sleep that a young woman should have. This behavior was par for the course. Overtime was included, but the work the employees had to do was insane and slacking off was not tolerated which was rather comical since the brunette started using room 2-B for that very purpose back in July. Most people quit after two months from the stress. The one who stayed either were psychotic or, like Molly, had nothing better to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I should go back to college. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Knock! Knock! Knock!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree more knocks-the signal for second warning. Molly found it best to vacate the janitor closet for the time being. The woman grabbed hold of the door knob as she thought back to her dilemma for the evening. No costume meant no trick-or-treating, no free candy and no spending time with her friends tonight of all nights. She shrugged to herself and spoke aloud, \u201cEh..... I could just rip something off here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfidence filling her system, Molly opened the door and welcomed the terror that was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As it turns out, the food service industry was about as glamorous as could be expected. Maybe less, considering one of the waitresses had just walked out from the janitor's closet she'd been sleeping in. But Molly didn't dwell on that for too long; she had costume options to consider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Course, her options were limited. As nice as Bertacelli's was, or at least looked to patrons, it was still just some restaurant. Not really a good place to find a creative outfit; white shirt and black slacks on every last member of the waitstaff. Sure enough, as she walked through the hall between the kitchens and dining area, it was pretty much the only outfit she could see. She gave a grateful nod to the waitress who alerted her, and a slightly more forced nod to the assistant manager she'd been warned about as he rounded the corner, coming from the kitchens. She waited until he had passed to wince at the sudden fluorescent lighting, only to wince more as she stepped out into the dining area and was met with the one thing worse to a person who'd just exited a pitch black room- natural light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Friggin' place really needed to be open-air?</i> Molly groaned inwardly as her eyes adjusted to the mid-day Sun. The whole 'gimmick' of the place was that you could eat out under the sky. A great idea, except for the bugs, birds, finicky weather, and scenic sights and smells of the roads that were just next to the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she went into auto-pilo, having long since reached the perfect amount of focus/lack thereof to be able to think between orders, she continued to list the problems of finding a costume to herself. Next up was the issue of size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight was an issue- she was by far the tallest of the female staff, and taller than pretty much all of the guys. Then came the issue if muscle mass. She wasn't body-builder or anything, but Molly was no slouch when it came to her exercising. It was one of the few things she could call a hobby, honestly. But the burden of her bulk was apparent whenever she tried to find clothes. Toned muscle could still make an hourglass figure, sure, even if the curves are more like hard edges. But they'd still strain any seams sewed for a slightly smaller woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with those thoughts in mind, and a tray of drinks in hand, Molly started coming up with options. Assuming the kitchen staff today was the <i>good</i> staff, they wouldn't mind her grabbing an outfit if she wanted to be a chef. Then there was the singers. It was a more recent development for the establishment; a lady in a cocktail dress singing each nigh tended to bring in more business around cocktail hour. Assuming she could talk to one of the singers at the end of her shift, she might be able to convince them to lend her a dress. Then all she'd have to worry about was fitting into the thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of all that failed, well... A bed sheet ghost wasn't exactly the most creative costume in the world, but it was something. Molly figured a tablecloth ghost might work just as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the minutes slowly ticked by, Molly decided she would go out tonight...</span></div></div>",

However, the ginger wanted to call the entire thing off as she glared at her mother who continued to hold Francine\u2019s supposed attire by its hanger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning from ear to ear, her mother asked \u201cSo, what do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead could only respond by throwing the first object she could grab at her mother which happened to be her dress shirt from earlier today, reminding Francine that she was only wearing a bra from the waist up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to hide her blush for new reasons, Francine snapped. \u201cWHY WOULD YOU EVEN THINK THAT I WOULD WEAR THIS!?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother\u2019s smile began to fall, clearly taken aback by the volume change in her daughter\u2019s voice, but she calmly asked \u201cDoesn\u2019t this fit your criteria?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine glanced back at the outfit another time. The twenty-year old requested her mother to find a Halloween costume for her as she studied for her midterms. While the ginger had gained many acquaintances during her time at college, she was an outsider in every social circle until she met a few classmates nearly two years her junior though they sometimes acted like they were just entering high school. The classmates in question had been close friends for nine years yet they welcomed Francine with open arms. They were also hopeless in every academic activity they attempted which might have been a reason for Francine\u2019s current companionship but she really didn\u2019t care. It was nice to chat with them during their off-hours and to have people listen to her opinions that didn\u2019t revolve around calculus. Francine took every opportunity to bond with them and this year\u2019s Halloween would be no different. However, studies came first which was why the ginger relied on her mother for the costume hunt with the guidelines she provided. It needed to be interesting in its design, have some history behind it and be a little daring to Francine\u2019s standards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twenty-year old couldn\u2019t outright say \u2018no\u2019 to her mother\u2019s inquiry. Her outfit was interesting to say the least and most certainly daring but the only sense of history that Francine could see was the thin layer of dust on every square inch of fabric. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead began to pick her teeth, groaning from the question that would soon come out of her mouth. \u201cHow exactly is this related to history?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine\u2019s mother snorted a little before saying, \u201cWell, it\u2019s related to <i>our</i> history. I met your father while wearing this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEWW,\u201d Francine shouted. She resisted the urge to push her mother out of the room as her actions might result in that retched outfit brushing up against her bare skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the costume as if it were a shield, Francine\u2019s mother protested, \u201cDon\u2019t worry! I didn\u2019t do anything naughty in this and it\u2019s been washed several times since anyway. I just thought it matched what you were looking for. Plus......... It would mean a lot to me if you\u2019d wear it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine wanted to turn away from her mother but their eyes were locked. Her mother still gave the hopeful grin she was known for wearing, a little toned down from her grin earlier. Francine really didn\u2019t want to give in so easily but that smile was also known for how it could make anyone drown in guilt and Francine was no exception. The redhead also began to feel guilty about the one guideline she omitted from her request: perfection. It\u2019s understandable as to why someone would leave this out when hunting for a costume-How do you explain \u2018perfection\u2019 to another person?- yet Francine still hoped her mother would follow her unspoken rule. Unsurprisingly, her choice was far from perfect and the twenty-year old did not feel like she had the right to blame her. Her face began to heat up as she mentally beat herself over with a hockey stick and imagined what her colleagues would say tonight. Could it be deemed childish to worry so much over a simple costume? Possibly but Francine wanted this chance to finally receive what she considered a \u201cfriend\u201d for the first time since tenth grade. The twenty-year old believed that most people would side with her once they saw her mother\u2019s choice:</span></div></div>",

Her face grew redder as she could feel that her hands wouldn't be enough to cover the hole, and even if it was, walking back with her hands held like that would be a dead giveaway to anyone walking by.  So, instead of slinking away or making a mad dash for home, Tina instead began trying to free her cape from the pole, all the while afraid that someone could come up at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey, on the other hand, could barely contain her laughter.  Having remained unspotted in the bushes, she was catching all of Tina's antics on camera, desperately pulling at the stuck cape with her butt sticking out in the air.  There was plenty of time to take in as much as she wanted, as the cape was going to give well before the adhesive would.  But, priceless though this was, it was time to take it up a notch.  She couldn't let things get boring now, could she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently creeping up behind Tina, Lindsey already knew what to do next.  With camera in one hand and her bandage scissors in the other, Lindsey made sure to get a close up of Tina's booty before setting it down and taking the scissors to the upper part of the hole.  With the slack now afforded from the initial tear, Lindsey was able to tug and cut up the back of Tina's spandex without the struggling girl feeling a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach cut brought more and more of Tina's back into view, until she reached the top, just before the cowl covering Tina's neck.  With the final cut, the spandex grew slack and moved away from where it was cut, exposing almost the entirety of Tina's backside, revealing that she wasn't wearing a bra either.  The costume still held on in front, leaving Tina unaware of Lindsey's latest work.  Surveying her handiwork with both eyes and camera, Lindsey was pleasantly surprised to see that the body advertised by the tight costume did not disappoint.  She had definitely struck gold with this one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she considered what to do next...</span></div></div>",

The cloth scissors flew out of Lindsey's hand, the camera clattered to the ground, and Tina ended up sitting on Lindsey's midsection, knocking the wind from her. Scrambling to her feet and turning her back towards the lamppost once more, Tina was conflicted between an instinctual desire to run and hide from anyone who might catch a glimpse of her butt, and a desire to make sure she hadn't hurt anyone. Looking down at the ground, she saw a girl dressed as a ninja, only just sitting up with one hand clutching her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm r-really sorry, are you okay? My cape it just got stuck, and... and...\" Tina trailed off as more details about the scene in front of her sunk in. How long was this person behind her? How did she get so close without making noise? What was that on the ground next to her? A camera?! And a few feet away, glinting in the light of the street lamp; scissors?! Tina's mind was racing with questions, until she felt a chill run up her spine, a cold wind blowing not only across her toned bottom, but all the way up to the back of her neck. The pieces all clicked together, and she fixed the ninja (who was half-grinning, half grimacing behind her black mask) with a glare worthy of the costumes crime fighter she was still at least half-dressed as.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, Lindsey had reacted quick enough, she had planned for something like this.

No, all that mattered now was getting home, curling up next to a scary movie, and forgetting that the night ever happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Lindsey, stifling a curse as she crouched and had a sharp twig prick her left cheek, was not about to let an opportunity for further pranking or sweet revenge get away so easily.

She quietly started to crawl forward, but a forceful tug kept her in place. Lindsey glanced back to find what she was snagged on. To her own disbelief, her shorts were stuck right to the side of the electrical box. She reached down and touched the contact point of see what had happened only to realize that glue was streaming down her shorts from the uncapped tube in her waistband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCursing to herself, Lindsey tossed the tube of glue to the side to prevent further damage. Her glove was covered in the stuff too, so that would need to go too. Pulling the glove off with her other hand, it embarrassingly stuck to the thumb and forefinger of her other glove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, the gloves were just for show anyway,\" Lindsey justified to herself as she removed her other glove more carefully this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all good and well, but the gloves were the least of Lindsey's problems. She gave her shorts a tentative pull to confirm what she had felt earlier, but they didn't even budge. Well, if they aren't going to come unstuck, no reason to sit here worrying what to do. She placed her hands and her foot that could reach, firmly onto the box and pushed hard. Popping of threads confirmed that Lindsey was succeeding. A sudden sound of tearing fabric was followed by Lindsey making an impressive full roll backwards. She lay disoriented on her back, prank tools scattered around her. Her shorts still stuck as stubbornly as ever, but she is free of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey sat up and considered her predicament. It's not really a problem. Her shorts had been hidden beneath her top besides when she was crouching. And if everything goes well, no one will see her all night anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If my shorts were that stuck, there's no way Tina is getting her cape off that pole,\" Lindsey whispered.

She whipped her head around to find Tina fighting to steal the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina gritted her teeth and spoke, \"You thought you could just pull a prank like that and get away?

She may not like it, but careful planning is probably better thank running off on impulse. After all, acting on impulse is how she got into this predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey gathered her remaining tools and began to scheme up a way out of this mess. Her goggles are nowhere in sight, and the tube of glue is done for. Any usable tripwires are thoroughly tangled in the bushes. There is still one smoke bomb that at least <i>looks</i> usable. One undamaged noisemaker was laying near the electrical box. Liquids and paints were splattered on the ground and her shoes, but one thick tube of black paint survived. Lindsey finally discovers her scissors dug into the ground under a bush with a slight bend to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Lindsey peers over the bushes to get a better grasp on what is going on and to check for any other surprise assailants. Out under the streetlamp, she spots her final missing item: her camera. She has no idea how it ended up out there, but there is no way she can leave it behind. Without pictures, there is no evidence of her pranks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, an idea hit Lindsey. She could even use the photos she has already taken to get Tina to help her out of this predicament. Surely, Tina wouldn't want those pictures floating around. But as nice as that plan sounds, getting the camera still means going into direct visibility of anyone nearby. There's no hiding under the bright streetlamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, she <i>is</i> in a mask. Even if someone spots her, she can still make a run for it. Is that risk worth the reward?

Those pictures are her objective for the night and it's not like the camera is cheap. If she loses it now, she will have to save all year to buy a new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirm in her resolve, Lindsey scans for people nearby. A few trick-or-treaters are going from house to house. Most of them seem more interested in their candy than half-naked ninjas sneaking around. Regardless, getting the camera will require making a full trip across the open street and there are no proper hiding places on the other side. If someone spots her, things are going to get complicated real fast. The trip across the street to prank unsuspecting Tina seemed so easy now. She used to be mostly hidden in her black costume in the shadows, but now even the moonlight made her fair skin look as though it was glowing against the dark night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people around are scarce and they all are occupied for the moment. Looks like it is now or never. If Lindsey doesn't act now, she might as well just give up on her night of mischief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey takes a deep breath and vaults over the bush in front of her. She sprints towards the camera and swoops her arm down to grab it. Skidding to a stop, she changes direction back towards her comfortable hiding spot. Glaring left and right as she runs, no one has torn their attention from their candy collection to notice Lindsey yet. Reaching the protected hedge again, Lindsey vaulted back over and sat down to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waited in silence, listening for any curious people that had heard or caught a glimpse of her. If anyone has noticed, no one is searching now, so it seems she is safe for the moment. Lindsey sighs in relief and shudders from the adrenaline still running through her veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipping on the camera, Lindsey examines any damage. It has a few scuffs from being thrown so far, but it is still completely  functional as far as she can tell. A smirk stretches across Lindsey's face behind her mask. Things are about to turn around for her. Reaching into her bra, she pulls out her thin cellphone. It may not be the most comfortable place for it, but if worst comes to worst, a cellphone is imperative to getting out of a bad situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey pops out the tiny micro SD card from the camera and into her phone. There they are, plenty of clear shots of the Batgir's exposed backside under the streetlamp. With a few checks through the online school registry, club assignments, and calling in on a favor an acquaintance owed her, she finds Tina's contact information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Lindsey's sends her ultimatum to Tina: \"Bring that top back to where you stole it from immediately unless you want these images in the hands of everyone in school. Don't try bringing anyone else, I won't hesitate to send these. You have five minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow all Lindsey has to do is wait. Tina doesn't seem like a very cunning individual. Lindsey believes the Batgirl won't hesitate to come running back when her dignity is threatened, but does Tina really have all that much to lose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Lindsey spots her reverse prankster in the distance, but something seems off.</span></div></div>",

At this rate, she isn't going to get her top back and she can't even run away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was over this way Jess,\" Tina explains to her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see if our little ninja is so sneaky when she's the one being threatened,\" the girl in the Catwoman costume responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you worry Tina, even if people get those pictures get sent out, the one she sent you doesn't even look that revealing,\" the female Robin adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess speaks up again, \"Don't be so pessimistic Riley. There's no way those pictures are getting out. That's the problem with blackmail like this. If she sends them out, she has no bargaining power. If she intends on actually getting her clothing back, she'll be stuck here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n While the trio converses, Lindsey is wracking her brain for a way out of this. If she stays here, she's bound to be found. But if she runs, there's no way she can reliably escape all three of them, not to mention her state of attire. If she had even a moment, she could a run for the backyard of the house behind her. Lindsey could see a fence around the edge of the house. Can she use the tools she still has left to cause enough of a distraction to escape? Perhaps it would be better just to bargain with the girls. It was only a harmless prank to begin with. Maybe they would be willing to work with her? </span></div></div>",

She cuts out the longest piece of tripwire she can from the bushes and ties it to the release on the noisemaker. The trio is stopped momentarily examining Tina's cape stuck to the streetlamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go,\" Tina whispers to herself as she gives her damaged smoke bomb a forceful roll towards the three girls. The small canister bumped into Riley's green shoe. The damaged smoke bomb had failed to detonate. Lindsey panics as the costumed girl picked up the strange object to get a better look at it. Tina looked over to see what Riley had stumbled across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait is that...?\" Tina started to inquire before Riley started pulling at the tab on top of the canister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoke burst out of the tiny can, blinding the three girls and leaving them in a state of disarray. When Lindsey saw this, she threw the noisemaker to the side and pulled hard on the string, setting off a loud bang while she ran the opposite direction. Hopefully that will be enough to throw them off her track. She sprints frantically towards the fence. No reason to look back now, if the trio sees her, there's no getting away anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey reaches the wooden fence and grasps the top with both hands. She pulls herself up, using her feet to help make the height. Feet on top of the fence, she leaps into the safety of the dark house's backyard...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and directly into a swimming pool. Cold water greets Lindsey's entrance into the backyard. The disoriented mischief maker emerges from the pool gasping for air. She held her soaked mask in her hand as she had torn it off to help find her way to the surface. She pulls herself out of the pool and lies down to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey hears Jess's voice, \"Did you hear that? I thought the Stevensons were out of town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looks like Lindsey won't have any time to rest, and it looks like she won't be using her phone any time soon either. It won't be long until the girls find a way back here, Lindsey keep hopping backyards, but to get home, she would need to cross a major intersection, and she's already tiring out from her sprinting, jumping, and swimming after a long day of school. She could try to hide. There's a shed in the backyard and it's possible one of the doors or windows is open on the back of the house.</span></div></div>",

None of them are even budging. Lindsey starts to get frantic as the voices of the three girls get closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, a window opens for her. She throws herself inside and quickly shuts the window. After a few minutes pass, Lindsey has calmed down and observes her surroundings. She's in a bathroom on the first floor. Lindsey stands up and examines the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well as long as I'm here, it wouldn't hurt to rinse off,\" Lindsey speaks to herself as she opens the shower curtain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starts running the water while she strips off her few pieces of clothing. She is glad that she will once again be fully clothed after this. Lindsey steps into the hot shower and starts scrubbing away at the dirt and residues on her skin from her mischief so far. She finds a convenient bottle of body wash in the shower, some tangerine scented soap. After finishing her short shower, Lindsey steps out and finds a green towel folded on the counter and begins to dry herself. Now she could go search for some reasonable clothing withing the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething sounds odd though. Are those footsteps? And they seem to be getting closer. But no one should be here, the girls even pointed that out. Then it hit Lindsey. The strange car in the driveway. The Stevensons may be gone, but they must have hired someone to watch their house!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a panic, Lindsey throws the window open and vaults out. She slams it shut and runs around the corner of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later, the light in the bathroom flicks on. Someone comes to the window and opens it. They scan outside the window, but don't find anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird,\" the person says to themselves before closing the window. A soft click makes Lindsey's heart skip a beat in fear. Waiting until the light has gone off and the person is gone, she returns to the window to confirm her fears. The window is locked. This could not be worse. Now Lindsey was not only unmasked, but also only clad in a green towel. How in the world is she supposed to get home?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey picks up her black tube of paint previously forgotten in the backyard, not that it is of any use to her now. Climbing fences is much riskier now, but going back to the street would be begging for trouble now that her face is uncovered. Not to mention that the costumed trio could still be around searching for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, her plan from the start was to prank people. If she is careful, maybe she could simply steal someone else's costume. Her luck has been so awful this evening, it is bound to turn around anyway. But maybe taking more extra risk isn't such a good idea. Staring at the tube of black paint, Lindsey started to get a crazy idea. She could paint herself to look like she is wearing something. In the dark of the night, as long as she never got close to anyone, no one would probably notice, but that would require leaving the towel - her only cover - behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should Lindsey do?</span></div></div>",

The night is still young. She's just been in a streak of bad luck. It can't go on forever. She'll nab some unsuspecting person's costume and be back on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey approached the fence where she entered the yard and pulled herself up to scan the area. The coast is clear as far as she can tell. Reluctantly, she undoes her towel from her body and removes it. She isn't about to lose it climbing over. She balls it up and tosses it and her waterlogged phone over the fence before hoisting herself up. This time Lindsey climbs down gently, memories of her accidental dive into a dark pool still fresh on her mind. She picks up her towel and wrapped it back around herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey returns to her hiding spot guarded by the surrounding hedge. When she first arrived here, she had a full costume on, now none of it remains. The brisk October breeze picking up isn't about to let Lindsey forget either. She shivers each time the wind brushes across her still damp skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe towel clad prankster diligently searches for a new victim. People stroll by here and there. One person comes by in an impressive set of power armor. Stealing that would be way much too difficult. Another comes by in a bare-chested action hero costume. Lindsey isn't about to put in all the effort to steal that when it wouldn't even cover her whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she sees a girl sitting on the corner of the curb. If the green getup wasn't enough to tell, the pointed green cap made this an obviously a Link costume. White tights, a matching undershirt, and some a prop sword and shield complete the simple costume. When the girl takes a glance to the side, Lindsey recognizes her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's Ella from her math class. Unfortunately, Ella will definitely recognize Lindsey face if she's caught. On the other hand, Ella might be willing to help her. Surely she's over the swimsuit incident by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a moment of thought, Lindsey goes over her plan carefully. Ella's hat looks loose. If Lindsey pulls it down, Ella will be blinded for a moment. While she is disoriented, Lindsey will pull the green tunic off the girl's body. That's all good, but there is an obvious flaw. There is no way Lindsey can get away in the moment Ella is blinded. to solve that, Lindsey will pull Ella's over her head. That should keep her occupied long enough for a reasonable escape around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmed with a plan, Lindsey is ready to go. She carefully leaves her comfortable hideout and approaches Ella from behind. She sets down her phone and reacquired camera beside her for easy pick up during her escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey slowly reaches her arms out and yanks Ella's hat down as hard as she can. Without breaking motion, Lindsey's hands fly downwards and grasp the hem of the green tunic. By the time Ella realizes what is happening, the tunic is sliding over her arms and she reaches down to start pulling her oversized hat off her head. Suddenly, Ella's hand is stuck to her head as Lindsey wrenches her stretchy undershirt back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMission accomplished, Lindsey stands up and takes one step forward before she trips and falls. Ella had given up on fixing her undershirt and hat and is gripping Lindsey's angle tightly. Lindsey attempted to shake the girl off, but Ella held fast. If Lindsey doesn't do something, Ella is going to get her other arm out of that tangle soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking fast, Lindsey shoves the Ella's shoulder down and straddles her exposed midriff. Maybe if Ella were a bit more frantic, she would let go? Lindsey pulls of Ella's boots while she kicks and pulls on her leg. Lindsey hangs on and moves on to the tights. It's not until Ella's tights are completely removed and her panties are on their way down that she finally lets go. Without any hesitation, Lindsey hops up just in time for Ella to get her arm free and reach back up. Her hands miss Lindsey, but catch the towel hanging from her body. One forceful pull is all it takes to leave Lindsey naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed faced but free, Lindsey grabs the tunic, the tights, her phone, and her camera, only stopping for a second to take a picture for posterity. Sprinting away, she looks back to see Ella uncovering her face and tripping on the panties around her knees. Looks like Lindsey's luck might be turning around after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey stops around the corner of a house to don the clothing she had made off with. Ella is a somewhat petite girl, so the clothing isn't the best fit, but it's passable and it's still way better than nothing. Lindsey is thankful to be covered again. The white tights don't cover much. The extra stretching and the moisture on her legs isn't helping that, but the tunic will keep her decent regardless. Even without the tunic, someone would need to be fairly close to see she isn't wearing any panties. Her lack of a bra, on the other hand, is somewhat obvious. Her nipples are clearly visible poking through the thin fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well, she can always steal something else now that her options aren't so limited. The question is whether it's better to strike when the iron is hot or to quit while she's still ahead. Two successful pranks is a okay night, but she'll have to wait a whole year for this chance again. She may have four pursuers now, but three of them only knew her by costume.</span></div></div>",

She was out of tools beyond her camera and a tube of paint, she'd been stripped naked and forced to take I'll-fitting replacements from a target, and there was a good chance she had some angry trick-or-treaters out for revenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Lindsey wasn't about to let that get her down! She would just have to be <i>better</i>. And, well, considering the bright white and green clothes, a lot stealthier. The first thing would be to put a little distance between where she was (and where her half-naked quarries might still be looking for her) and her next target. It wasn't too difficult to get by; staying away from the streetlights and close to the shrubs and trees, acting natural when passing the occasional passerby, and doing her best to ignore the breeze that played at the edge of her tunic, chilled the skin under her still damp tights, and made her nipples under the fabric that much harder to miss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was a couple blocks over, Lindsey was satisfied she had a new hunting ground, as it were. It was a dark little cul-de-sac, only really lit by the front-lights of the houses around it, which suited her just fine. Plus, Lindsey had two targets to choose from; one, a tall girl  dressed simply, a black witches dress and hat accented with purple highlights across the fabric and in her hair. An unsuspecting target for sure, slowly making her way out of the cul-de-sac,and Lindsey wouldn't mind adding a bit of black back into her outfit... But that broom she was carrying would be something to look out for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her way in was an older woman, dressed in the familiar red, blue, and gold of Wonder Woman. She was sort of familiar looking; a teacher? Lindsey couldn't get a perfect look at her face, but if she could put one over on a teacher she had to take that chance, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, she'd need to work quick; the witch was leaving the block, and Wonder Woman was approaching one of the houses. She'd just have to pick one and hope she didn't attract the attention of the other while she worked.</span></div></div>",

Considering the witch's costume, the item Lindsey would most like to acquire is the long black cloak the girl is wearing over her dress. But simply stealing the cloak and running for it isn't a very solid plan. Lindsey is fast, but for all she knows, this girl could be a track champ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needs to get a bit more creative. Lindsey is great at sneaking up on people. This girl may not have anything easy to pull over her head, but Lindsey could sure get under her dress and then panties would be an easy target. Now Lindsey's plan was starting to come together. She goes big or goes home and she's not about to go home. If worst comes to worst, she'll have the panties to bargain with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlan finished, Lindsey works her way around the cul-de-sac to the witch. She tucks her phone and camera into the waistband of her tights. The long-brimmed hat also aids in concealing the trickster from the peripheral. As Lindsey nears the witch, she crouches further to prepare herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the witch can assess the situation, she can feel hands grabbing at her hips. Lindsey tears the girl's feet off the ground to remove her prize and crawls through her victim's stumbling legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>CRACK</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the broom slamming down on Lindsey's echoes through the cul-de-sac. The world is still spinning for Lindsey as she is picked up by the collar of her tunic. When her vision finally clears, she is a foot off the ground and staring straight into two angry green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty good prank, wouldn't you admit?\" Lindsey tries to placate, holding up her hands with the pair of panties still looped around her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the side, a familiar character approaches, \"What's going on over here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey can see it's Wonder Woman approaching. And with a closer look at her face, is that her phys ed teacher?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting a closer look at the situation, the teacher gasps, \"Lindsey, did you take that girl's panties?\" She takes a hard look at Lindsey's costume, \"And I just ran into poor Ella walking home half-naked and crying after someone stole her costume.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like I've caught a rat,\" the witch interjects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis turned out worse than Lindsey could have imagined. The witch, she could've handled, but she didn't take the teacher into account when planning. On the bright side, the teacher should be reasonable enough if she apologizes though, right? She's a professional, and this is outside of school so Lindsey can't even get detention.</span></div></div>",

Pulling the door open, she jumps inside. Lindsey slams the door shut and fumbles around trying to lock it. A relieving click confirms she is finally safe. The girls will probably just assume the Stevensons left it locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFootsteps can be heard outside the shed. Three girls are walking across the grassy yard. With more of her confidence back, Lindsey ignores the sounds outside and pulls out her phone to observe the damage. She's never seen any kind of water-resistance advertised for this phone. It may be time to assume the worst for the thing. But like magic, the phone starts right up when she presses the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt has become strangely quiet outside, but Lindsey is too focused to notice anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey is baffled. She didn't think it would be unharmed in her wildest dreams. That's technology for you these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer awe is short-lived however, as her phone starts ringing loudly through the shed. Lindsey drops the phone, but snatches it back up and taps to answer as quickly as she dropped it.

How did they get her phone number?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, if you're going to try to blackmail someone, you should probably not use your own phone to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey feels so stupid for making such an obvious mistake, but maybe that means the girls still don't know her identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who goes around with their name written on the inside of her clothes anyway?\" The girl pulls up the end of the top on Tina and reads aloud, \"Right here, it says property of Lindsey. Right next to a phone number and address to return it. You should really be more careful with this kind of thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey cursed silently at herself. Why does her mother have to write this kind of crap in her stuff. Looks like it's time Lindsey does her own laundry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I tell you what miss class prankster, we're fun people, and we love a good prank.

Her things are swiftly snatched away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasure doing business with you,\" the girl says from just outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFootsteps patter across the yard again as the trio leave with Lindsey's things. She is only left with shoes and stockings. They look so out of place on Lindsey's nude body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey has plenty of time to consider her options now. Getting home would certainly be a pain without any covering. She could also check out the house. If one of the windows is open, she could get some clothing and be home free!</span></div></div>",

She dishes out the pranks and embarrasses people, not the other way around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, no matter how confident Lindsey might act, that doesn't stop her from instinctively covering herself with her arms as much as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe disgraced ninja reluctantly struts across the yard to the side of the house and starts searching for an unlocked entrance. She pulls on a couple of windows and begins jiggling the handle of a back door. The handle has give to it, but the door still refuses to open. Suddenly the handle twists with a click. Looks like it wasn't locked at all. It's just an old fussy door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey takes one tentative step into the dark home, her black shoe impressing slightly into the living room carpet of the home she is invading. She has a light sense of apprehension in her chest. She may embarrass others in less than ethical ways, but something still feels very wrong about trespassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door slowly eases back into place only requiring a slight nudge from Lindsey to click back shut. Time to search for clothes. Lindsey barely knows who the Stevensons are besides that they have children, so finding clothes will be a fairly random search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey is as ignorant of the red flashing led next to her as she is of the family whose home she is in. She makes her way across the living room, still self-conscious enough to cover herself even in the safety of the walls surrounding her. Taking a glance down the hall, she decides to start at the top of the small two-story house and work her way down. Climbing the steps only acted to emphasize the awkwardness of Lindsey's lack of cover. Lindsey understands her embarrassment defies the logic of her hidden setting, but being functionally naked in someone else's house is bringing her so much anxiety. It will do her good to find something and get out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey decides to pass on the office at the end of dark upstairs hallway and move straight to the door on her right. To her luck, it looks to be a girl's room. She immediately begins investigating the room. Opening a drawer, some shorts catch her eye. Sifting through them, she finds a nice start: a pair of black shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tentatively holds them in front of her hips, examining the size. The inhabitant of the room is apparently a tad bit larger than Lindsey, noted by the couple extra inches in the waistband of the shorts. Cutting her analysis short, a high shrill rings through Lindsey's skull. She claps her hands over her ears in response. What is that? An alarm?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh shit, that is an alarm. Lindsey's house has a similar system. If someone enters while it is armed, there are a couple minutes to enter a code before it goes off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey has little time to shake off the ringing in her ears before she feels the steps of someone ascending the stairs. The presence of another person in the house shocks and confuses Lindsey. There isn't supposed to be anyone here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogic doesn't matter much now, Lindsey needs to do something. She doesn't even want to consider that she could be caught like this, or arrested... or arrested like this.</span></div></div>",

Lindsey eventually decides she can move a bit and slides the shorts onto her feet. Raising up her butt, she pulls them into place. She is thankful to be somewhat covered again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey's not out of the fray yet. It isn't long before sirens can be heard outside the house. A policeman has come to the door to check on the situation. The alarm is finally stopped and Lindsey can hear two people talking inside the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe only becomes more concerned when the mysterious tenant and the officer enter the room beside her. She catches bits and pieces of the conversation inside explaining how this is the only room not right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bumping inside alerts Lindsey of the search going on inside. They are searching for her! It surely won't be long until they check the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey has just a moment to think things over. She can climb over the peak of the house. The other side of the roof may be more visible, but she might be able to get back inside. On the other hand, maybe Lindsey made a mistake hiding. Perhaps she should just jump into the pool and make a run for it. After all, running is about the only thing she's done right tonight.</span></div></div>",

Rachel ran up to Stacy and pulled her in front of her. <br>\r\n\"Hide me,\" she pleaded. \"People can't see me like this!\" <br>\r\nStacy looked around, desperate for a way out. She looked to the other end, only to hear more people from there, too.

The people were coming closer. <br>\r\n\"Fine.\" <br>\r\nBoth of them jumped into the corn again and held their breaths. Two parties emerged from either side, just as Stacy had heard. They were a bunch of people from their school. They laughed and shared their costumes, clearly surprised to see each other. Then a guy dressed like Dracula spotted a bit of Rachel's wrappings on the ground. <br>\r\n\"What's this?\" he asked. \"Maze decorations?\" <br>\r\n\"No,\" said one of the girls. She was wearing a Wonder Woman costume. \"They don't have anything like that here.\" She took the wrappings from his hands and looked them over.

The plan was that Axeman would surprise mazegoers and block one path, and then as the terrified travellers were backing up, they would be bumping into this next monster, entering unseen from the corn walls.  Dressed similarly to the first, this one wearing a farmer's outfit stained with \"blood\" and a thick, burlap sack with eye-holes covering his face, Axeman's partner in fright was holding a chainsaw replica in midair, fitted with a tape recorder that would play the sounds of a whirring chainsaw blade on command.

Molly, in response, pulled even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*RRRIP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey, feeling a sense of immediate release, scrambled forward on all fours and then back up to two, following the path around the next corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacey!  Hold it!\" Molly cried out, picking herself up off the ground in hot pursuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the junction, Chainsawman stared after the pair in disbelief.  He then remembered Axeman, groaning down on the ground.  \"Whoa, never seen that happen before.  You alright, man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oorg,\" Axeman moaned.  \"It's okay, I'm good.  Turns out this thing actually works,\" he patted his mask, grateful he didn't skimp out on a cardboard prop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, did you see how much those girls freaked out?  That was nuts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, ha ha!\" Axeman suddenly laughed.  \"I knew this routine would pay off big time!  The others can talk about their fancy tech and gizmos all they like, but it just goes to show: you can't ignore the classics.  Wait'll they here about this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, further along the path, Stacey continued to run, and run, and run, until soon enough she reached a wall at the end of the path.  Not a plant wall, like most of the walls of this maze, but a solid structure with a door in the middle of it.  Keeling over, she finally stopped running and began to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacey!\" a voice rang out, followed by a hand clapping on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH!\" Stacey screamed again, turning around. \"OH!  Molly!  Thank goodness,\" she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness!?  You completely ditched me back there!\" Molly shouted indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-?!  Well, you were the one who ran into that guy and was wallowing on the ground in the first place!\" Stacey shouted back, shocked and angry at being argued at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would've gotten up sooner if someone stopped to help instead of dragging me through the dirt and kicking me in the face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU were the one grabbing my tail!?  I thought that was the axe guy.  Wait, what's my tail doing in your hand?\" Stacey asked, noticing the fabric clutched in Molly's hand.  Slowly, she  realized that the air where her tail was now felt a lot more brisk and chilly.  \"Eep!\" Stacey gulped, clamping her hands to her bottom, feeling the damage.  The removal of the tail had ripped out a good chunk of her leotard as well, exposing the center of her butt, cheeks and all now only covered by her thin, translucent tights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfff... Bwa ha ha ha!\" Molly began laughing uproariously, seeing Stacey's flustered expression.  \"Now we're even!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  Stop it!\" Stacey fumed.  \"You're not looking too hot either, you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha, eh?\" Molly stopped laughing and looked at herself and immediately clammed up.  Her dress had gotten torn even more during the scuffle!  The front of the dress was smudged with dirt and plant matter, and also covered with many little scratches here and there, giving her costume a more haggard appearance and exposing parts of her midriff.  Her skirt had also gotten damaged even further, becoming more frayed and losing the lowest layer.  The length now only reached down to her knees; save for her right leg, which was still just as exposed as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, um, hm,\" Molly fidgeted nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we're even!\" Stacey said snidely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, at least I'm still decent,\" Molly countered smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... yeah...\" Stacey uttered, her expression turning glum.  Her vest wasn't big enough to secure around her waist, so there was nothing she could do to cover up her nearly-bare behind.  A feeling of dread began to overwhelm her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing Stacey's spirits drop, so did Molly's stubbornness.  \"Look, Stacey...\" Molly ventured.  \"I know I really lost it back there, and I'm sorry about that.  I just was trying to get us through as fast as we could, you know?  I didn't mean for all that to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know... it's not you I'm upset at,\" Stacey replied.  \"And not Rachel either.  I just have this feeling that things are going to get even worse for us, if we can even get out of this maze.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, no thinking like that!  Just look at where we are!\" Molly pointed at the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where we are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A wall with a door like this in the middle of a corn field must mean this is someplace important.  The exit might be on the other side!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, that actually makes a lot of sense,\" Stacey said, taking a good look at the door.  There was no clue what was on the other side, but if it was something set up for the maze, it should mean that they were on the right track to getting to the exit.  There was still a chance after all!  \"All right,\" Stacey said, walking towards the door.  \"Let's see what we have here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened easily and Stacey walked through with Molly close behind, trying not to stare too much at her friend's partially-exposed posterior as she did so.  Fortunately for Stacey, there was plenty of things inside far more interesting for Molly to stare at, as they two now found themselves inside-</span></div></div>",

At this point, she wasn't bothering to cover up; simply rushing ahead towards the costumes, hung up as they were along the wall. Stacey, with her sharper eyes and naturally reserved demeanor, was less willing to celebrate immediately. (Not to mention less willing to uncover herself: her arms had once again glued themselves over her chest and crotch as soon as she had passed the last obstacle.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Molly...\" she began, eyeing her own costume, and very pointedly keeping her eyes away from her friends naked figure as Molly examined her own costume, \"does something seem... different, about my costume?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your costume?!\" Molly shouted, \"look at mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, as the two girls got over their initial excitement over completing the obstacle course and started to look closer at their costumes, they noticed that they had changed in between being removed and the girls completely the obstacle course. Presumably whoever had taken them in the first place had decided that, if the girls were going to get covered again, they weren't going to be covered as much as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had been a mostly in-tact black cat outfit had been reduced to a black cat-styled bikini, or lingerie set. The midsection of the leotard had been torn away, and the tights had disappeared entirely. Stacey was happy to see that they had at least repaired the hole that had been torn away with the tail... although, the repair job mostly consisted of cutting the bottom half of the leotard down and patching in the tail, leaving a dangerously low cut set of panties, showing off more than Stacey would have liked in the back and almost showing off everything in the front. The upper half, the \"bra\" now hung loosely across her chest; it hadn't been designed to have any slack to it, and the resulting garment was uncomfortably breezy. Aside from that, she had her cat ears, gloves and boots, and vest back, though the vest's buttons had been torn off, meaning Stacey had no sustainable way of covering her chest past her new bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly's costume was similarly trimmed down. What once was a ghoulish, vaguely old-timey dress fit for a banshee, now looked more like a banshee's undergarment, shorter both on top and at the bottom. The upper half might have been called a corset, if it had any of the rigid ribbing to slim the occupant's figure. Instead, it was more of a tattered strapless dress, with Molly's bra (if she'd even been wearing one, Stacey mused,) nowhere to be found, meaning that Molly'd be showing a lot of cleavage. The bottom half of the outfit didn't fare much better. While Molly was relieved to have her panties returned, she had to admit they weren't going to cover much, especially with the other alterations done to her skirt. Or what little of the skirt was left: it was now more or less a frill around her waist, just barely covering her crotch and leaving the bottom half of the pale expanse that was her rear end hanging out, more if she bent over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, clothing was clothing, and no matter how skimpy it was, it was an improvement. So, the two girls dressed, Stacey looking like a black cat fit for the beach and Molly looking like a banshee fit for the bedroom, and awkwardly surveyed the damage to each other's outfits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Molly started, but faltered, not being able to find the words after their red faced run and subsequent risque redressing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Stacey finished, agreeing with her friend's sentiments in a single syllable. \"So, what do we do no-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the door on the wall behind their outfits opened up, a light reading \"EXIT\" coming to life above it. With both girls thinking, or trying to avoid thinking, about who or what could be jerking them around through the maze and whether or not that who or what might be listening or watching, the two left the obstacle course in silence, adjusting to the not-quite-decent costumes they now had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, both girls were also eager to leave the maze.

Stacey was frantic, looking around, back and forth between her friends, everywhere, almost looking for a way out but still simply following in line, tail swishing on the back of her bottoms. Molly, meanwhile, was sulking and staring at the ground. Either she was saying goodbye to her costume, or Rachel's comment about 'poking through' had gotten to her, because she had one arm wrapped around her chest (only emphasizing her generous cleavage) and the other tugging the front of her skirts down (tugging the material forward, letting more of her ass hang out behind.) Speaking of behind, following the three girls was a loose gathering of onlookers. A fair number had heard Rachel's ultimatum, and were eager to see what happened next, and the group only got larger as they moved through the fair, the bare skin and promise of more acting like a beacon to the lecherous crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConveniently, the face painting booth seemed unpopular at the moment, the young man and woman manning it looking rather bored, one looking at her phone and the other off at some other fairground attraction. At a cough in front of their table, the girl on her phone briefly glanced up, then back at her phone, and then very quickly back up at the bare thighs at the edge of her table, following slowly up a toned stomach to pair of a bejeweled boobs, and finally, slowly, up to Rachel's grinning face. The girl elbowed her companion, who after a short noise of protest quickly ran through the same process, though his eyes didn't make it higher than chest level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there!\" Rachel started, leaning onto the table, giving an improved view of her cleavage, \"so I've got a bit of an odd request....\" As Rachel explained her plan, Stacey watched the two fair employee's expressions shift from confusion and awe to stifled laughter, eagerness and, on the part of the young man, a heavy blush. The two enthusiastically agreed to help. Rachel spun around and clapped her hands together (the two now gluing their eyes to her ass, the girl even snapping a picture before starting to gather her supplies), and quickly beckoned Stacey and Molly forward. \"Alright, girls, the painters are good to go. Let's give them their canvases!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharing a look, and swallowing protest, the two cornered costumes started disrobing. The crowd murmured a bit as Stacey shrugged off her jacket, baring her shoulders, but the real noise started as, with a moments hesitation, she took off her top, keeping one hand over her pert breasts. Then, with a final shudder, she let her panties slip down to the ground, kicking them off from around her boots and picking them up by the tail, holding them in a bundle with the rest of her clothes in front of her crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Molly was having a rougher time of it. The second she lifted the dress passed her head her breasts spilled out underneath it, faster than she could cover, and the face-painting boy's eyes went wide seeing her headlights. The white lace of her underwear went next, accompanied by a chorus of camera shutters as she bent down to pick them up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Rachel took their costumes aside, the actual painting wasn't much better. Most of the crowd was behind them, but there wasn't anything stopping any of them from coming around for a look at the front when they wanted. Stacey wound up with the girl doing her paint, and apparently she was having a real good time watching Stacey squirm when the brush circled a nipple, or went slowly down the inside of her thigh. The boy taking care of Molly, on the other hand, was sort of just drinking everything in, Molly fuming with her arms at her sides, the freckles dotting her chest getting covered up by white, and down to the hair between her pillowy legs. Evidently Molly offered too much of a canvas however, and the boy ran out of white paint by the time he got around back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm,\" Rachel said, pondering. She played the role of ringleader well, and as an idea crossed her mind she whispered it into the boys ear, keeping Molly in the dark as to what it was she could feel being painted across her posterior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what felt like an eternity of standing there naked, they were finished, and took a look at each other. Stacey was still the black cat, the whiskers on her face having been touched up, while an expanse went down from her upper arms and chest to her upper thighs. She still had her fake ears, boots, and gloves, and though she'd lost the tail attached to her bottoms, the girl at the booth had been kind enough to trace one going down the back of her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Molly, her front had been covered in white, to match her face paint, with a few gray and light blue wavy lines hear and there, to emulate the ruffles of the fabric she had given up to Rachel. As the two covered up- \"Careful not to smudge the paint!\" Rachel told them\"- Stacey stifled a gasp. Rachel's idea for Molly's backside evidently only concerned itself with her cheeks, most of Molly's back being bare skin. Her ass though, had been painted a bright orange, with evenly spaced darker orange lines going vertically down it. Finally, a pair of bright yellow triangle eyes and a jagged yellow smile, turning Molly's big ass into one big, wobbling Jack-o-Lantern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that everyone is dressed....\" Rachel started, seemingly sated, for the time being, \"What do you girls feel like doing now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly glanced back at Stacey, the two of them wearing similarly morose faces. Truth be told, the two of them would have rather turn tail and headed home at this point. But then something flashed across one of the girls faces, for Rachel an idea for further humiliation, for Molly an idea at revenge....</span></div></div>",

That can only be found on one route, isn't that right, George?\" Rachel called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cleopatra's right,\" a voice came from the side, along the maze wall to the side of the exit.  It was another haunter, this one dressed as some kind of man-spider, complete with bug-eyed mask, fake arachnid appendages along his body, and possible imitation webbing stuck on those ends.  \"The 18+ course can only be found on one route, which is clearly marked by a sign a little ways in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which means, there was no way for the two of you to end up on the same route, unless one of you cheated, crashing through into the other's route!\" Rachel said, striking a dynamic pose and pointing at Molly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh!\" the crowd went again, cheering louder this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well it wasn't me!\" Molly shouted back.  \"I was focusing on getting to the end so I wasn't paying much attention, but I remember seeing an \"18\" sign with light shining on it a little ways in.  I just thought it was a trail marker or something though, like a countdown.  But wait, that means-\" Molly turned toward Stacey, whose color had completely drained from her face.  \"You-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly, please, I can explain-\" Stacey pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to say anything!\" Molly said, releasing her hand and shoving Stacey away.  \"You were going to charge through to the end and throw us both under the bus if I hadn't run into you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!

Now, though, I'm not so sure!\" she glared at the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, even Molly had some plans,\"  said Rachel.  \"If that's true, I can only wonder what depraved act you would have us do if you had gotten here first, <i>cheater</i>?\" she addressed Stacey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, you idiots!\" Stacey said, finally losing her patience.  \"I was going to order you to drop the whole stupid thing, especially after what happened in the maze!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah!  Likely story!\" Rachel scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it doesn't matter, because I made it through fair and square,\" said Molly.  \"Which means I get to decide your fates!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-uh,\" Rachel wagged her finger.  \"We agreed that the <i>first</i> one who made it through was the winner, which was me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only because you cheated!\" Molly yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's called strategy!\" Rachel shot back.  \"Like Stacey's 'strategy' of plowing through the walls, which, unlike what I did, is actually against the rules here, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, can't we just drop it, already!?\" Stacey shouted.  \"We've had a horrible night already, why do you want to stick around and make it worse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we made a bet,\" said Rachel.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm... a bet.  Can't back out on that.  Honor and their friendship is on the line,\" the crowd muttered amongst themselves, agreeing with Rachel's statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we agreed on no backing out of it,\" Rachel continued. \"Besides, my original offer still stands and I think it's actually pretty fair, given that all of us will be one step away from naked instead of just me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I was the only one who played fair!\" Molly insisted.  \"You gave it up willingly Rachel, so you being naked right now is on you!

Rachel ended up crashing into one (un?)fortunate audience member, toppling the two of them and leaving them seperate from the man more or less only by the fabric of his own costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Stacey had regained some of her composure and turned to thank her friend... only for Molly to most grab her by the front of her top in a most unfriendly way. She was once again yanked forward, bit resisting the pull for fear of tearing the scrap of black fabric; as it was she was just barely covered now that the garment was being bunched up in Molly's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you cheated! Of all the--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the conversation was halted as Rachel, having been helped to her feet by many an eager pair of hands, charged in and tackled Molly to the ground, Stacey being taken with them by the front of her shirt. Words, it seemed, were getting them nowhere. As they fell to the ground, Rachel took up a straddling position on Molly's midsection, and started yanking and pulling at the hem of her dress. As her own breasts spilled forth into the open air, eliciting a cheer from the crowd, Molly released Stacey's top, trying to bat Rachel away or get a better hold on her, but her lack if a proper costume was proving to be an ironic advantage- with no real covering, it was harder to get a grip on her quickly growingly sweaty skin. Still, considering what little cover she <i>did</i> have was held on by tape, that sweat probably wouldn't help her much in the long run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey was taking her time to mull over all of this from the ground, before a few camera flagged and snickers reminded her that Milly had done a number on her top, leaving her perky breasts on display. She rushed to cover herself, feeling that her top was now looser, and shakily started to get to her feet. She was turned and ready to run when she felt a tug from behind; Rachel had apparently been keeping an eye in her, and had grabbed her tail in one hand while the other stayed firmly hanging on to Molly's dress. Molly followed up with a kick to the back of Stacey's leg- an aimed blow or the result of her flailing, Stacey couldn't tell- and this send the black cat back down to the floor; though this time, she could feel stitches popping and her bottoms sliding slightly down her hips as Rachel kept her grip on the extra appendage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying face down, effectively mooning the crowd at this point, Stacey knew she needed to end this quick, one way or another. No matter what happened, it wasn't going to be pretty... but it was either that or let what was left of her costume get ripped right off of her!</span></div></div>",

Now, aside from the obvious not-being-able-to-continue issue, it was creating a rather uncomfortable draft across her backside- with the leotard out of the way, she didn't have much covering her lower half besides her tights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on...\" Stacey groaned, tugging on her tail. She could <i>feel</i> her companions closing in on the exit. Now with herself caught caught in the cornstalks, well, the draft on her ass was lighting a fire under her ass. She thought she'd come free though, when he tail started to give some slack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was followed by an arm. A green arm, with skin peeling off, leading up to a tattered sleeve. A tattered sleeve leading up to the horrible, rotting visage of a zombie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as she knew that it wasn't real, Stacey couldn't help herself; she screamed. Trying to run proved futile at first, the tail still head fast in the 'zombie's' grip. In just a few seconds of blind terror and struggling to run away...</span></div></div>",

This was disconcerting to her at the very least since that vest had her house keys and wallet too (It was the only article that she had been wearing that had pockets), but her problems don't end there as without the warmth that her vest had provided her her nipples have erected and hardened in the cold air and are now rather visible poking out from under her leotard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the race still on her mind Stacy doesn't waste a moment and springs back into the wall of corn looking for her vest lest her evening be ruined by her having to spend hours looking for it later in order to get home or worse its disappearance tips off the others that she has cheated. She thinks maybe it just slipped off or got caught on something as she squeezed through the thick walls of corn in her reckless haste. An innocent, and easily correctable blunder that she could rectify and be back on track in no time, but unfortunately it turns out there is something much more nefarious going on which she doesn't realize until she emerges on the other side of the wall, and by then its to late...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit... stupid corn maze... where is it?... ugh that was a new phone... maybe its in the other patch I plowed thro-*gasp* <b>EEEEEEii!</b>\" Stacey's Leotard was gone much to her horror. She hadn't even noticed till she had looked down and saw her bare breasts with their cold erected nipples hanging in the breeze and her semi-sheer tights doing a poor job of hiding her pussy(and not the feline kind). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how? oh my god this can't be happening!\" She cried in panic putting an arm across her bosom and a hand between her legs as she squats low to the ground in a futile bid to preserve modesty as she looked around frantically for some sign of her missing clothes, or what could have caused their disappearance, or even that this was just a bad dream. She comes up empty on all accounts, and has to face that she is stranded completely topless and effectively bottomless in a halloween corn maze race. \"Crap the race!\" She hissed to herself when she remembered her other two friends racing for the privilege to humiliate the loser of this three way race. If she loses they will probably make this unimaginably worse for her, but if she wins that may be a way out as she just needs to swallow her pride, and be seen like this only long enough to claim one of the other girls costumes as her prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh no thats crazy I-I can't be seen like this I'll never live it down even if I won\" Stacy then says to her self reflexively recoiling at the thought of stepping out in front of someone naked, but what other choice did she have that didn't involve being seen? Just keep looking for her clothes in the corn and pray she doesn't lose anything else? To say it didn't sound promising was an understatement, but if it meant getting out of this unseen Stacy was willing to consider it.</span></div></div>",

The first reason she didn't was that, if the fate of her jacket and leotard indicated, going through the maze walls again would only cost her her tights, as little cover as they provided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second reason was fear. Fear at being seen as she was, fear at what her friends might make her do if she found them waiting for her at the finish line. It was bad enough that she'd have to walk back into the crowd like this. She didn't need add whatever humiliating stunt either of them had planned into the mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with a heavy heart and stinging skin, she continued on along the trodden dirt path. In between the shivering, ad the constant glancing around for anyone else around her, a small part of her kind wondered if she still looked like a black cat.

Stacey wound up alright, still holding on, but across from her she could see Molly as having slid on top of Rachel, nearly smothering the smaller woman, and Abby had fallen off her perch completely, both leaving her legs splayed on the floor of the cart, but the horses totally out of her control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the time it took the farmgirl to scramble back to her seat, the horses had put them on an unavoidable course....</span></div></div>",

She also instantly regretted stitching the long strip of fabric to the wrappings that covered her lower body and torso who in turn were stitched to the wrappings that covered her other limbs if this continued her whole costume would be pulled off! But no matter what she did the flexible fabric would not yield or tear in any way and she had to let it slip off bit by bit to save herself from injury by constriction or wagonwheel, and as a result this trend of unstoppable unraveling was already working its way up to her waist and simultaneously down her right leg exposing more upper thigh and her bare butt and womanhood as she had opted to go commando today because she thought underwear would be noticeable through her costume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all happening so fast they hardly had time to think, and both girls were beginning to panic both out of fear for their health should they get sucked into the wheel or their modesty should they not. Thankfully before either brings themselves to say anything Molly comes to the rescue having finally noticed their predicament herself (Rachel and Stacy's mostly bare bottoms are a hard thing to miss when you are not focused on the road) Though in her haste to help her friends she unfortunately doesn't think to get Abby's attention and simply stop the cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly will come to regret not doing that because almost as soon as she approaches to help her friends free themselves the hem of her long dress also gets caught in the wheel which immediately starts pulling the whole garment down off the support of her full bodied curves, and shows the girls Molly's lacy white bra as her dress slips off her large lingerie clad breasts. \"EEEK!\" Molly reflexively shrieks grabbing the neckline of her dress in a futile attempt to pull it back up but its no good the dress won't tear free of the wheels and its being pulled down whether molly likes it or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is when Abby notices what's going on having been prompted to look behind her by Molly's shriek much to the three friends embarrassment  \"What in tarnation!?\".

Aside from the obvious pain of being swatted with branches and scratched by twigs as they passed through and under the boards of their hay ride's carriage, one could ear the distinct and familiar sound of tearing fabric amidst the sound of shrieking and wood-hitting-wood. Eventually, industrious and persistent as she was, Abby was able to grab hold of the reigns and calm the horses down before they got themselves or their passengers hurt. They were already in pretty rough shape as it was, though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey, with such a protective hold over her lower half, had lost her vest. The buttons were wrenched open by one branch, the vest torn off by the next, leaving Stacey sitting completely topless and effectively bottomless, the sheer, now somewhat hole-riddled garment clinging to her legs not offering much in the way of modesty or comfort. Still, after what she and her friends had just been through, she needed to make sure everyone was alright, so she swallowed hard, covering her chest and crotch, and asked, \"I-Is everyone alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel, in something of a mixed blessing, hadn't lost anything to the branches besides an odd bangle or two. Of course, this was only because the black girl had lost the main component to her costume to the wheels, leaving her smooth skin open to a largely harmless but rather irritating barrage of scrapes and scratches from the trees. She met Stacey's gaze and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo!\" the familiar cry of their mutual friend had Stacey and Rachel whipping their heads around, and at the sight of her thankfully unharmed form, they could still understand Molly's cry of despair. Already on her knees, Molly had seen the tree branches coming a split-second before the other cart-riders, and flopped forward onto the ground, hands over her head. This protected her upper half quite nicely from any thwacks from the trees, but it had the unintended effect of jutting the large girl's generous backside up into the air, where it was a prime target for any wayward twigs. There was a second or two of an uncomfortable wedgie, a second of immediate relief as the tugging stopped, and a final few seconds of terrible realization as the wind played across her bulbous cheeks and nether regions. Now, with a blush on all three friends faces, Molly was sitting with her back to her friends, looking over her shoulder with one hand trying in vain to cover her cushiony canvas of pale ass, and another deep between her pillowy thighs, keeping her privates as such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Abby started, out of breath, \"I- I regret to inform you that we'll have to cut this ride a mite short...\" the farm girl trailed off, noticing her passengers staring at her. Looking down with a short \"eep\", she covered her freckled chest. Evidently, in the process of calming the steeds, she'd failed to notice the branches claiming the two jack-o-lantern patterned cups that comprised her bra. \"A-as I was saying,\" Abby resumed, climbing out of the cart, \"we have a bit of a problem.\" The other girls looked over the side of the cart at their drivers indication to find a busted wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not getting this cart turned around like this.\" Abby scratched her head, \"Don't feel right leaving the horses out here though...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!\" Rachel laughed, a short bitter bark. \"You can have fun doing that! There's no way I'm headed back there looking like this!\" Molly nodded in agreement, each girl tightening the hold over their exposed areas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can't rightly take them both back myself! Riled up as much as they are, I'd end up chasing them down across the whole farm in just my drawers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'll help.\" Stacey said after a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure about that, Stacey?\" Molly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She needs help, and it's not like the carts doing us any good.\" Stacey ginger climbed out of the cart, thankful for her friends averting their eyes. \"Look just... we'll head back, get the horses tied to some post or something where a different farmhand can find them. We'll grab some clothes, and head back without being seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... what are we supposed to do then?\" Rachel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know!\" Abby, having unhooked the horses from the cart, offered Stacey the lead for one of them. After a moment's deliberation, Stacey kept one hand between her legs, baring her chest to take the horse back to where it belonged. Shivering at the cool air, Stacey continued. \"Just... look through the trees for our clothes! Anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few exchanged words later, talk of \"what do we do if someone else comes?\" and \"what if someone sees you with the horses\", and Stacey and Abby were off, leaving Molly and Rachel back at the cart.

Not that the idea didn't sound fun, as a joke, but he doubted he'd get many opportunities, even if it <i>was</i> October. No, Chris wasn't used to participating in stuff like that, or in most things in general, aside from hanging out with some friends every now and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then one of his friends, Harriet, told him about this Haunted House/Halloween Fair thing the town was running. Now, Chris didn't go to a lot of fairs, but Halloween was a fun time of the year, so it caught Chris's attention. Harriet was working there as a makeup artist; both at a face-painting booth for the kids, and also helping the volunteers in the haunted house get all ghouled-up to do their jobs. She told him that they needed another volunteer or two, and Chris, being a decently tall, decently fit guy with a lot of free time, fit the bill perfectly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, a couple times a week, with a few more as it got closer to Halloween, Chris showed up at the Town Manor. It was a big building, made to be a home a long time ago, but some things happened, a bunch of legal stuff that no one really bothered looking into, and it sort of just ended up being owned by the town. So, with the decent amount of land surrounding the house itself, the township used it a couple times a year for big public events. When October came around, they spookified the place, and held a big fair around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, it wasn't a bad deal. The clothes were a little itchy, not to mention tight in a few... uncomfortable places, and he was spending a lot of time in dusty cramped spaces helping to set up the decorations and mechanical scares, but it was all in good fun, and he was excited for the night itself. All it really came down to was the costume and the place he'd be hiding. He was excited to be...</span></div></div>",

It was easily the scariest room in the house, with a really naturally spooky atmosphere. In a big house like this, it was nice and spacious too, for an attic. Chris was surprised when no else wanted to take that spot. When he took a better look at the room, having already volunteered to cover that room, he suddenly understood why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot of effort was going into making the house look decrepit and haunted. The attic didn't take nearly as much effort to decorate, because it was <i>already</i> ancient and broken down. It was already cluttered, dark, full of old cracked wood and creaky floorboards. Most of the work went into make it less scary for the sake of people's safety; things like sanding down splintery wood, and clearing any loose nails that they could find. Still, aside from the cobwebs and dust, Chris got over his problems with the room pretty quickly once he heard how he'd be scaring people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet showed him his costume the night before the Halloween Fair opened for business. It was a heavy, gray bodysuit, with a bunch of tattered strips of white fabric hanging off of it. The mask it came with was all gray, with a jagged pair of eye holes and a mouth torn in, with a layer of black, see through material that would hide his eyes and keep the illusion while allowing him to see out. The idea was that he would hide up in the rafters, and jump down to scare anybody who walked that far into the attic. It sounded fun to him; it was easy enough to get back up, even if the creaking wood made him a little nervous every time he practiced...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, finally, the big night came, and a huge crowd was running around the property, playing games, drinking cider, bobbing for apples; all the Halloween standards. They had set up a changing tent behind the house for the volunteers to use; the body suit was heavy enough that wearing more than a pair of boxers underneath sounded like Hell, so he shoved his street clothes into a backpack and left it in the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe performers had all gotten into their positions, just as a line had started outside the main doors. Chris couldn't wait... except he was going to have to. Turns out, in a two story building with a basement and an attic, people are going to take a while to work their way up that far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's what I get for choosing the spot farthest from the entrance</i>, he thought to himself. He could feel his legs falling asleep under his weight, crouched up on the rafter as he was. He was considering finding a better, more comfortable spot to pop out from when he heard the attic door open. He waited; there were a number of footsteps traveling across the room, and the whining of the floorboards was only getting louder as whoever it was got closer. Finally, Chris could hear whispering, just in front of where he would drop down. He took a deep breath, before shoving off the rafter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, his somewhat poorly thought out plan failed when...</span></div></div>",

For a spook junkie like Harriot this was the perfect place to spend halloween abandoned enough that there are no grounds keepers or guards to chase people off, well built enough to not be a death trap, old enough to have spooky myths floating about, close by enough that she wouldn't need to spend her night driving way out into the boonies, and obscure enough that no ones tried to buy the place and ruin it by filling it with zombie props or whatever the latest fad was. Nothing but a pure genuine creepy old house to explore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriot had started her evening at a costume party but they were never her thing she found them boring it was halloween after all she wanted to be scared, but as much as she hated them she hated staged haunted houses more.

The outfit is comprised of a short white jacket with a pink interior and a long pleated tail reaching down to her butt, and brown pants with a matching belt the three colors of the flavor of icecream \"Neo\" is themed after. Under her jacket is a black corset, curved in the middle of the bottom, exposing her sides. She's also accessorizing with a haphazard mess of necklaces around her neck, black fitted gloves, a lacy pink parasol, and white knee high boots with large heels something she was rather accustomed to wearing already due to her small size. And as a finishing touch just like the character she's dyed half her long brown hair pink with white streaks and had it styled into a similar loose swirl and finally she's wearing a contact that is turning her left eye pink. all in all she makes it look like the character has actually stepped out of the show, to the point that she's even tried to stay in character and act as mute as possible. Time will only tell if she can keep that up as her costume falls apart...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gets inside easily enough the front door wasn't even locked the first room is a foyer, and its already creepy looking in here with moon light, cobwebs, peeling paint, unexplained creaking noises, and a thick layer of dust.

That place is condemned, you're lucky you didn't get hurt!\" Victoria said as she bent over to remove her pantyhose.  \"But I'm glad you're alright.\" She said as her panties were tugged off absentmindedly.  Finally she notice the hat. \"Where'd you get that hat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet laughed \"Found it and a bunch of watches in the mansion.  Want one?\"  The hat produced a watch-necklace in her hands for the officer now wearing only her hat and belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria nodded, smiling \"Sure, looks like an antique.\"  She slid it on as she began to leave, \"Be safe and have a happy Halloween!\" She called as her full moon was the last thing Harriet saw of her as the disrobed officer rounded the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo we continue with Harriet, or follow Victoria?</span></div></div>",

Letting it drop, she walked back to her patrol car where her partner, Officer Christine, was waiting.  She opened the passenger door and slid into her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to go Chris?\"  Victoria asked her partner and friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine looked over at Victoria and was shocked at her nudity, \"Victoria!  What hap...end...\". The ticking of the clock had already begun its magic on Christine's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chris?\"  Victoria snapped her fingers in front of her partner.  \"You ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"  Christine shook her confusion off. \"Yeah, I'm fine.  Everything ok with Harriet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria nodded.  \"Yeah, she was just alone because she's busy enjoying watching the trick-or-treaters.\"  She buckled up and sighed \"Lets get this patrol done with.  Oh, before I forget, here's a gift from Harriet.\"  She handed her another police badge watch necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine nodded as she put the watch necklace on and started patrolling.  They saw several parties, a handful of trick-or-treaters, and no real need for their patrol.  Then they got a call to head to a house reporting a noise ordinance violation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice place.\"  Victoria said as she got out, her breasts swinging free as she got out of the car.  The yard was clean cut, and a white picket fence around the yard, \"Very picturesque.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine nodded as her skirt slipped off her legs, \"Yeah, reminds me of my grandparents place.\"  Victoria knocked on the door and waited.  Christine was looking around the neighborhood, just keeping an eye out, and failed to notice her shirt finding its way on the rose bushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"  Mrs. Winters opened the door and saw perhaps the most shocking thing she'd seen in her life, but she too fell to the spell.  \"Officers, the house behind mine has even throwing a loud party, could you tell them to quiet down or go home?\"  Nobody noticed as her nightshirt was discarded on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria nodded.  \"Of course ma'am.\"  As she turned to leave, she notice Victoria's shirt on the rose bushes, \"Mrs. Winters, is this yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs.  Winters shook her head.  \"No.  Some prankster from that party must've dropped it off.  And look!  There's more on my yard!\"  The two police women saw a skirt, two pairs of shoes (Victoria's and Christine's), socks, and a pair of panties on the yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll gather this up ma'am, oh, looks like there's onother one here on your porch.\"  She picked up Mrs. Winters' nightshirt and pants as she handed her another watch necklace.  \"Have a good night ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just throw that stuff in the garbage can on your way out!  And thank you for the watch!\"  Mrs. Winters called as she closed the door.  \"George!  Come look at this beautiful watch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria dumped the clothes into the trash can, scanning the yard for anything else.  \"Missed one!\"  Christine called as she came back around  for other drivers side of the patrol car.  \"Some prankster put this on my door, punks, they'll never stop.\"  The two police officers agreed on this as they made there way into the car, naked except for their watches, hats and belts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they pulled up to the party and wlked up to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah!\"  The young man said before he zoned out staring at the naked cops in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir.\"  Christine started, snapping the man out of his trance.  \"We received a noise complaint, if you don't turn it down, everybody here's getting a ticket.  Not noticeing the man removing his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing officers!\"  He nodded his head, but was topped by Victoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go sir!\"  Handing him a watch, Victoria smiled and bid him goodnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two policewomen made there way to their car, they were notified that their patrol was up.  Celebrating, Victoria asked Christine, \"Do you wanna eat?  Or head over to Harriet's party?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine thought about it.  \"Definitely lets go to Harriet's party, I think one of her friends is hosting it, we can call after we get out of the station.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria and Christine got to the police station without problems, and made there way inside.

I've had it with these two doing these kinds of pranks!\" She said.  Paging her secretary \"Emily, please have Officers Victoria and Christine in my office after they get out of the locker room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Ms. Aran\" Emily said cheerily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two officers put their two remaining uniform items in their lockers (leaving their civilian clothes in there too), the intercom buzzed \"Officers Christine and Victoria report to the Chiefs office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine and Victoria were confused, but decided best not to make the chief wait too long.  As they walked to the chiefs office, they passed Emily typing on her computer, not even looking up.  Christine put a clock necklace on the desk and walked in after Victoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n======<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the door closed, Chief Aran turned around and began her tirade \"Girls, you should...know....\". The melodious ticking of the two clock necklaces had already begun their work, but before either Victoria or Christine could snap her out of it, Aran continued \"...that you have to file a report before heading back to the locker room.  That way everything is filled out accurately!\"  As she gestured with her arms, her shirt slowly became unbuttoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up and turning around to face the window behind her desk \"So lets go over your patrol now before you two are off for the night.\"  By now her shirt was completely unbuttoned, revealing a bra with a jack o' lantern over each breast (very seasonal).  She walked in front of her desk and leaned back, arms straight, and her shirt slid right down.  \"Did you encounter anything of interest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria decided she should go first \"No ma'am.  We did our patrol route, solved a noise complaint, but other than that, completely quiet.\"  She stopped for a moment as the Chief tripped out of her shoes Andy pantyhose. \"Although we did encounter a prank where several random articles of clothing were scattered all over Mrs. Winters' yard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChief Aran's eyebrows went under her bangs \"That is interesting.  Any possible leads?\"  As she walked over to the file cabinet, her skirt had begun to slip down, revealing Hello Kitty panties, but not quiet far enough to fall off just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine shook her head. \"No ma'am, Mrs. Winters believes it was a prank by some kids.  No property damage done, she had us throw the clothes away in her trash can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChief Aran simply nodded as she went through a folder, her skirt finally giving way to gravity, leaving her in only her bra and panties.  \"I have a report here from last year.\"  She said rolling her shoulders as her bra clasp undid itself.  \"The report says that this same prank was reported in several hundred residences across town, and even here in the police station!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat grabbed all their attentions, more than the bra which had now slipped off her left shoulder and was going down fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would somebody do this?\"  Victoria asked.  \"What would they gain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chief shrugged, her bra finally falling to the floor, her D-cup breasts swinging and bouncing freely as she shrugged.  \"Who can say?\"  Her panties by now looked thoroughly stretched out, as though the elastic had been worn away, and were now sagging.  \"I'll alert the patrols currently out, but with only the skeleton crew on board we might miss them, unless you two are up for a little undercover overtime?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria looked at Christine and both of them smiled and nodded, \"We'll do it!\" They exclaimed in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChief Aran nodded, her panties barely holding on as Shen walked over to the door with them.  \"Then get to it!\" She smacked both of them on their bare buns hard enough to leave a hand mark, just as her panties decided to follow the skirt and join it on the ground.  \"You two, wait!\" Victoria and Christine turned around, showing their bosses hand prints to the empty office behind their behinds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in the Cheifs office, they noticed that there were random clothes on the ground in there too!  \"How'd they get there chief?\"  Victoria asked as she approached the office again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Victoria!\"  Christine was over at Emily's desk \"There's clothes here too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chiefs face turned red with anger that such a prank could be pulled under her watch.  \"You two, run out and see if you can find who did this, they can't have gotten far!\"  Victoria and Christine saluted and ran out the door, their breasts swinging high and low while their behinds bounced furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily, where'd you get that necklace?\"  The chief asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked down.  \"Oh this thing?\"  She grabbed her breasts and pushed them up to bring the necklace to her boss.  \"I found it on my desk, you want one?\"  She offered another badge shaped clock necklace to Aran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason Aran couldn't place, the watch seemed so beautiful, and its ticking sounded so lovely.  \"Of course I'd like one!\" She grabbed it and put it on before grabbing her purse and heading out the station.  \"I'm heading home!  See you tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily waved in the vague direction of her boss as she typed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo we follow the two brave investigators Victoria and Christine as they prowl the city for a prankster, or do we follow Emily, as her clock spreads its chaos throughout the police force?</span></div></div>",

Eventually the mysterious girl entered a nearby twenty four hour gym, and the two cops waited to make sure that she wasn't about to head out.

In fact, so had the others in the treadmill room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course officers\". She said as her tank top found itself sliding off her and getting shot off by the treadmill.  \"I'm Gwen, how can I help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria got in front of Gwen's treadmill and planted her breasts on the panel while she began her questioning.  \"Ma'am, on your way here, did you do anything else while you walked down the street?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen shook her head as her sports shorts worked their way down with each step \"No ma'am,\" by now she was only in her sports bra and her panties.  \"I was checking frequently to make sure that nobody was following me or threaten me, you know how it is these days.\"  Victoria nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine was keeping an eye on the rest of the gym, not noticing the other joggers clothing falling off at the same rate as poor Gwen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't do anything else on your way here?\"  Victoria continued her questioning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGene shook her head as her breasts popped out of her sports bra, which she grabbed and threw aside as it got too uncomfortable.  \"No ma'am, I came right here.\"  Her panties began to tease their way down, revealing the top of a neatly trimmed triangle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright ma'am.\"  Victoria nodded as she offered Gwen a clock necklace.  \"Have a good night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too!\" She called as her panties finally gave out and found themselves being swept up by the now naked janitor with the other clothes that had been finding there way to the floor<br>\r\n<br>\r\n======<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine sighed as she rubbed her butt where Aran had smacked her earlier, \"Well, that was a dud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria nodded. \"We might as well back track, let's head back to Mrs. Winters' and see I feel we can find any similar pranks over there.\"  Christine nodded as they made their way back to the station to grab a car.</span></div></div>",

Driving by the Winters house again, Victoria saw that someone in the neighbors house had a camera setup pointed straight into the Winters living room window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling into the driveway, the two naked officers knocked on the door, ignoring the bouncing of their bared breasts, and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helloooo......\" the lady, looking no more than thirty said at the door, drawn under the trance of the clock necklaces worn by the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, do you have anything to do with the camera that's currently setup to look into your neighbors house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady shook her head.  \"I think my daughter does though, she's always filming things.  Please come in officers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you ma'am.\"  Victoria said as they walked in.  \"For our reports, what is your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady smiled as she turned the corner, oblivious to the fact that she'd stepped out of her socks, \"Ms. Mullens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey heard some brief argument down the hall, followed by a door slam, and Ms. Mullens and her 18 year old daughter walked into the living room.  Her daughter was wearing a t-shirt and shorts, not that they'd be on her for much longer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first the daughter just seemed to stare off into space, falling under a trance, before her mom poked her, getting her attention and bringing her back to the officers in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my daughter Lydia.  Lydia, these lovely officers have a few questions for you.\"  Ms. Mullen said as her pants slid neatly off her legs, exposing her lace panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-of course, what can I do for you officers?\"  Lydia asked, feeling very nervous, not noticing that her t-shirt had somehow slipped off her body, showing off her bra, strained from containing such massive beauties underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lydia,\" Officer Victoria started, \"we saw a camera pointed into your neighbors window, care to tell us what that's all about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia looked down, realizing she'd been caught, nobody in the room noticing that her shorts slid off, revealing a pair of panties with a picture of a bunny on the back, or her mom's shirt sliding off as well, leaving her mom only in her lace panties, as Ms. Mullens had defied to go braless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw our neighbors wearing some cool costumes, and I wanted to get them on camera.\"  Her story hadn't been altered, as with her now under the spell, she didn't see her neighbors naked, even in her memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lydia's bra straps snapped, freeing her D-cup breasts, the bra flung forward, landing on Officer Christine's face, who merely brushed the offending garment off, and Ms. Mullens' panties dropped, exposing her fairly large bush, dwarfing Victoria's own decently sized hedge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, next time, just ask the neighbors for a picture, or their permission.\"  Victoria said as Lydia's panties fell to the ground gracefully, forgotten with the rest of their wardrobe.  \"Here.\"  Victoria handed them a pair of hypno-clock necklaces, as the magic compelled them to do, \"Have a happy Halloween!\"  She said as she and Christine left the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Christine said, \"that was a bust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria nodded.

Once she has enough of the full body mirror cleaned to be used, she backs up and looks herself over in the mirror, there's no funny warping in the reflection, but she just can't put her finger on with what's wrong with it.  \"Ok.  From the top down\". She says to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair is fine, still dyed, no spiderwebs, noting wrong there, her chest is fine, her D-cups aren't dirty, nothing wrong there, her navel is good, and her cleanly shaven crotch is fine too.  Turning around, she sees that she's fine, it must be the dark atmosphere in the mansion, she decides.  Grabbing her lantern, she starts to walk out of the mansion when she notices something, the paintings all have people on them, but they aren't normal.  They're covering their bodies with some weird drape-looking things!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This must've been a cult house of some kind!\" She says to herself.  \"I wonder what kind of secrets they have hidden here?\"  As she walks back to the front door, her friends Lilly and Danni walk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harriet?\" Lilly calls out \"You here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet walks down the stairs, lantern held high. \"Yep, right here.\"  Neither friend notices anything off about Harriet, and why would they?  Nudity is normal.  Danni was wearing cat ears and a belt with a cat tail while Lilly was wearing a tiara, fairy wings, and carrying a wand in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet beckons them up the stairs. \"You guys will never guess what I found!\"  Harriet leads them down the hall, discussing the pictures. \"Look, each person here has some weird drapes over their bodies, this clearly must've been a cult of some kind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly nods excitedly. \"Yeah!  Maybe they were squid-people working to summon the old ones!\" Danni and Harriet look at Lilly weirdly.  \"Or they were just creepy people...that works too.\"  She sighed, nobody seemed to like Lovecraft like she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet smiled at her two friends.  \"Lets explore this place and see what we can find out about this cult!  Maybe we'll even become famous for discovering this!\"  Her friends agreed, and so the three naked girls trekked ever deeper into the shadows of the mansion of the \"drape cult\" (Danni's name for them).  Their bare little bums inching evermore into a darkness that's had, unknowingly to them, warped the entire world already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do they search first?</span></div></div>",

The girls looked at one another, dying to figure out who should go first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harriet you should lead.\"  Danni said, nudging the short girl forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Harriet wasn't having this, she rose up to her full height of 4'10\" (four foot ten inches).  \"Oh no, I already explored upstairs, one of you should lead this time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly shook her head, at five feet, she was, in her opinion not the ideal leader.  \"Danni, why don't you lead, you're the tallest one, you could see somethings that we can't.\"  Deciding to play up Danni's height of 5'11\" (five feet eleven inches), the girl practically towered over her diminutive companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanni, seeing that she wasn't winning ne conceding the point, took Harriet's lantern and lead them through the darkness into the next room.  They came to a living room which had all the furniture covered in sheets, and more paintings of these weird drapes-wearing cultists.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanni pointed off to the side of the room with a bookshelf, \"You girls search over there, I'll look over here by these shelves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls split up in two, Lilly and Harriet looking through the shelves at books of all kinds, thin ones, fat ones, old ones, new ones, some were even written in weird glyphs that looked like the drapes the cultists had on their bodies.  Danni meanwhile was looking though the upper shelves and saw a card with actual English on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look what I found!\" Danni called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls crowded around the paper, holding the lantern up to see what it said.  Harriet read the outside of the card.  \"The teks-ti-lee cult protection ward.  Speak the words within to gain protection from the world.\"  The girls all looked at each other, and Harriet slowly opened the card, and saw the ward within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we read it?\"  Harriet asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say we read it\" Danni said looking at it, \"it says we gain protection from the world, the worst that happens is we get thrown out of th mansion because we're not cultists.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly bit her lip, thinking hard, then quickly nodded, wantin to get this over with as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet nodded.  \"Alright, here we go: Rit-en vords bee-com oon-red-abel.\"  Immediately the ward lit up, glowing like a fire, and just as quickly as it happened, it stopped.  The ward, once readable, was no longer readable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.  I guess I realized that we aren't cultists.\" Danni guessed.  \"Do we keep looking at these weird paper things?\"  She gestured to the books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah.\"  Harriet threw the card aside. \"They must've put more spells somewhere else.\"  She picked up a book and opened it to the first page, and realized that it too, was unreadable.  \"That spell must've changed the symbols in these books so we can't figure out what they mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly nodded, holding a \"1-2-3, A, B, C's\" book upside down.  \"These don't make any sense!\"  She put the book back.  \"Let's keep going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==========<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girls walked ever deeper into the mansion, they didn't hear two shadowy voices whispering from the bookshelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd you do to them?\" The deep voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lighter voice laughed \"I took their literacy\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deep voice growled, \"Why would you do that!?  Their lack of decency is funny, but how to we get them to make even more mistakes if they can't READ?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Didn't think that one through.\" The lighter voice admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll fix this...somehow.\" The deep voice groaned.  And once again the room grew silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=========<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with the three naked, now illiterate, girls, Lilly was taking the lead this time, when they heard a clanking behind them.  The girls turned and saw a rusty suit of armor clanking toward them with arms outstretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensibly, the girls decided to scream and run away.  As they ran down the hall they came to a split in the hall.  Left, or right?  And the knight is getting closer....</span></div></div>",

They all sat there, Harriet and Danni leaning up against the door to keep the walking suit of armor out.  They heard the clanking walk slowly down the hall, and continue past their door and the footsteps faded into the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.\" Harriet gasped out, trying to calm herself down from that mad dash for her life. \"That happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we?\" Lilly asked looking around the room.  Danni held up the lantern, and an immaculate kitchen, with tile floors and stainless steel tables  and cabinets was revealed.  \"A kitchen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like.\"  Danni said as she made her way to the cabinet she before slowly opening it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you doing!?\"  Harriet whisper-yelled, \"do you want to let that thing know we're here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanni didn't need even turn around to look at her friends as she continued through the cabinet \"I'm hungry, running for your life is hunger-inducing.\"  She pulled out a pringles tube.  \"Anybody want some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly just sighed and plopped her bare ass on the floor.  Looking over at Harriet she asked \"I don't think we should've done that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet raised an eyebrow \"The looking through the house or doing the thing with the ward?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly just sighed and buried her head in her hands \"Both\" she was exhausted, scared, and her belt-tail fell off in the mad dash for safety.  All she had left of her costume was her cat ears.  Danny had lost her tiara and wand, but her fairytale wings were still on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three naked friends decided to look and see what other rooms were attached to the kitchen, the first two were a bathroom and a closet, but the third opened up into a grand dining hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\"  All of them said as they looked at the extravagant nature of it, showing wealth far beyond any of their families, or anyone they knew.  Looking at the wall, they'd saw another one of those weird cultists in a picture, a very large picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This must've been the leader!\"  Harriet deduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you figure?\" Danni asked.  Even though she was also curious about this weird mansion and the cult, they should be trying to find a way out, not get invested anymore than they already are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just look at the size of the picture!\"  Harriet exclaimed gesturing at the massive portrait.  \"He looks so important with his fancy drapes and colors decorating him.\"  They heard a clatter of metal in the kitchen behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should go.\" They all said in unison as they bolted for the door at the other end of the dining hall.  Opening the door, they quietly snuck down the hall looking for any way out a thing this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys?\"  Lilly asked as they passed a window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"  Harriet asked back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd we end up on the third floor?\"  Lilly's question caused them all to stop and look out the window, and they could see just how high up they were.  But they never took any stairs since running from the knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" Danni said, seeming to get pretty nervous \"this place is officially haunted, let's just look for a way out and be done with it!\"  The other two agreed, but there was another split in the hall, either continue down the dark hall without windows and only their lantern for light, or through another door, this one marked with weird glyphs (if they still had their literacy they'd be able to read 'coat room') that reminded them of the wards in the paper things downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich do they take?</span></div></div>",

She tried putting her legs through the tubes attached, but that didn't work, but putting her arms though did.  She swirled around, but it just felt...wrong somehow, and she ripped it off and kicked it aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was weird.  Let's not do that again.\"  They all nodded, not only had it felt weird for Harriet, but it looked so bizarre to her friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked slowly down the coat room looking for another mysterious door, when the batteries in the lantern finally gave out and enveloped them in darkness.  Lilly stifled a scream, and the three girls inched slowly down the room, feeling out for any other doorknobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanni inched her way, keeping her arms locked with her friends so that they wouldn't get separated, when she felt something hard.  It felt like a handle, \"Guys, I think I found a way out.\"  As she turned the handle, the floor underneath the three gave out, and they'd spilled out into a bedroom.  A master bedroom, from the decor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.\"  Harriet said dryly \"That gets us down a floor, one to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three naked girls opened the bedroom door and saw a staircase going back upstairs, and a dark hall without windows going as far as they could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do they go?</span></div></div>",

Inching their way down the dark hallway, Danni rotated the group to make what looked like a turn in the darkness, but as she did, something cold had found its way to her bared butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaahhh!\"  Danny yelled as she jumped forward, landing on top of her friends and practically smothering them with her breasts.  \"What was that?!\"  Her friends eventually got her reoriented and all of them got back on their feet as they approached the metal object, and discovered that it was a doorknob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet giggled at the events \"It's just a doorknob Danni.\"  She said as she turned the knob and they all peeked into the doorway.  It was a bedroom with a whole wall of windows, but little else.

Upon realizing this, she sighed and shivered in place.  <i>\"Nothing like a sudden noise to nearly scare me out of my pants,\"</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting her lantern on the sill, she walked to the window and took a deep breath.  That had been one long hallway.  She hadn't realized the wing of the house was so large; even looking at the surroundings from this window it didn't seem like her trek should have taken as long as it did.  Maybe it was just one of those places that just felt bigger on the inside?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Achoo!\" she sneezed, and started rubbing her hands together.  She must've been more spooked than she realized, why else would she feel so cold?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached to close the window, when she thought she saw some movement out of the corner of her eye.  Something in the overgrown foilage along the house beneath her.  She paused, then shook her head.  It could've been anything, after all.  Not enough noise to be a person, but perhaps the wind, or an animal, or maybe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet's curiosity began to wander as she held her hand against the window panel...</span></div></div>",

Am I right Neo?\" (since she acting like a mute she hadn't told the girls her real name)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriot meanwhile was frozen in a state of shock here she was suddenly stripped naked by what must be mysterious and very scary means with two girls who she had won the praise of admiring her nude body. She didn't want to admit she was scared but this place now seemed really dangerous if it could do something like this to her, and as a result she wanted to run out screaming. On the other hand she can't get home like this she doesn't even have her keys now, she can't drive home, she can't get inside if she could get there, and if she tried she's probably get arrested for indecent exposure and thrown in the drunk tank like this or something she had to keep most of her cool and find her things or at least something to cover herself with before making a possibly swift exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also Ashley and Jill to consider she had enjoyed their admiration up till her modesty got in the way they would be expecting her to act confident and like this was intentional and most importantly mute leaving her unable to warn them of the danger of exposure they also face, but if she keeps up the act maybe they will help her find something to wear or get home with out her losing face and keeping up the act might distract her from her crippling embarrassment.

This is just too embarrassing, and what if the same thing happens to them would she really recklessly endanger them to whatever spookiness is afoot tonight just to save a little face and appear bold attractive and confident?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt really all boils down to does she act like Neo, strike a sensual pose. and play along with the girls expectations despite what this haunted mansion has thrown at her with the hope that only they will help her and that only they will ever know about this humiliating event, or does she act like Harriot, hide behind her open parasol, try to warn them, and hope they don't abandon her and make this situation worse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimatly Harriot swallows and she...</span></div></div>",

It was all going so smoothly just minutes before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the mansion was abandoned enough that there were no guards or groundskeepers to worry about, there was a tall, stone wall lined with spikes on top surrounding the grounds.  The only way in was a metal gate which was locked by a metal lock wrapped with heavy chains that had long since rusted, preventing normal access.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot one to be stopped by total lockdown, however, Harriet had quickly found her method of entry: a tall tree outside the fence that had a branch overlooking the grounds.  Climbing the tree was simple enough, even with her old lantern hanging on her hip, but the branches were covered in thorns, which picked all over her body and pulled at her costume: a japanese schoolgirl uniform worn by the heroine of a recent anime.  She liked the character well enough and had decided on the costume for maneuverability (as well as appreciating how she looked in it,) but had she had known that there would be so many thorns, Harriet probably would've dressed in the character's casual clothes instead, which offered a bit more coverage.  At least there was a glove as part of the costume that offered at least some protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Harriet made it to the end with only a few tears along her costume.  She was now above and slightly in front of the wall.  It would be a bit of a drop, but nothing she wasn't prepared for.  Unhooking the lantern from her skirt, Harriet tossed it over the wall into the yard, hearing a subdued rustle as it landed.  \"Should be safe,\" she said to herself as she readied her jump and leapt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, when rocked back and forth to prepare for her leap, her skirt had gotten snagged and hooked onto a thorny branch on the upper side of the one she was on, slightly behind her.  The branch held strong as Harriet leapt forward, causing her to leap out of her own skirt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah?\" she uttered as she felt the tug, followed by fabric moving down her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Harriet had no time to worry about her skirt, that tug had lowered her speed, setting her on a crash course for the top of the wall and its sharp, pointy spikes.  Harriet flinched and closed her eyes, bracing herself for the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, miraculously, it was only the sides of her costume the got impaled by the spikes, with her landing right in the middle, leaning over the edge of the wall.  Harriet sighed in relief, only for her costume to give way again, sending her spilling out of the shirt and into the lawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking herself up off of the ground, Harriet saw her lantern a few feet in front of her.  Scooping up the lantern, she turned back to her shirt, stuck on the spikes too high for her to reach.  She was shocked and disgusted to see that it was the shoulder seams that had given way completely, which hadn't been damaged at all during her climb earlier.  \"Last time I go with that costume maker,\" she said, as she turned toward the mansion, now wearing only her personal blue-and-white striped bra and panties, as well as the costume glove, shoes, and socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, being stripped to her underwear just as her adventure was beginning probably should have been a warning sign, but Harriet wasn't too concerned.  First, this was an abandoned mansion, there shouldn't be anyone besides her there at this time of night.  Second, and more importantly, walking around in her underwear should be way more scarier than walking around fully clothed.  She could swear that with more of her skin exposed to the elements, her senses were heightened too.  The chill of the night air, the silence and dread of the old mansion, the wetness of the rain...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Harriet gasped.  It was suddenly starting to rain!  When did that happen?  Doubling her pace, she booked it up the rest of the overgrown path to the front door of the mansion.  Seeing no locks or bars like the front gate, Harriet tugged on the handle.  The door opened up with a loud creak, and Harriet quickly dashed inside, shutting the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew,\" Harriet sighed, catching her breath.  Realizing that it was very dark inside the mansion, Harriet brought forth her lantern to look at her surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was in a foyer, with stairs going up and down in front of her and rooms off to the sides.  She could see that there was a second and third floor that could be reached by going up, but the light beam wasn't strong enough to see any further.  Aside from her somewhat narrow light beam, everything else was shrouded in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet smiled, her heartbeat quickening.  An entire old mansion all to herself.  Where to begin?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Achoo!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's right, she was soaked!  Her short hair would dry out soon enough, but she could feel her damp underwear clinging to her body.  She needed to take care of this problem first before she could enjoy the frights of this mansion, but there was no way she was going to be walking around a place like this naked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet shivered, looking back and forth at her available paths.  There was no way she would be going to the basement first, that's where the scariest stuff would be, after all.  What she needed to do instead was to explore...</span></div></div>",

Little did she know, of course, that tonight would be one of the most humiliating experiences of her life. She was suddenly jerked out of her thoughts by the sound of footsteps outside the bathroom, in the hallway. Amy's heart stopped. Who was there? Her family were all out, so it couldn't be them. A burglar, maybe? But why would they be out on the most crowded night of the year? Still hardly daring to breathe, Amy turned the water off and called out, placing her arms over her chest as the water began to cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello! Is someone there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence seemed to stretch for an eternity, then an answer came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, hi Amy. It's me, Trent. Blake spilled some punch on my ghost costume at the party-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! It was an accident!\" came the sound of Blake, Trent's friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you must have been too distracted by Jessica.\" said another of Trent's friends. Tony? Trevor? Amy couldn't remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent ignored the other two. \"-So we came back to get another one. Do you know where my zombie from last year is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you stuffed it under your bed. Y'know, like all the others.\" Amy called with an eye roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! Thanks sis.\" Trent called back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy let out a sigh of relief. Just her idiot younger brother and his dumb friends (although 'lackeys' might have been a better word). Nothing to worry herself about. In fact, she thought with a smile, this was pretty good. It gave her a reason to stay in the shower for longer. She'd left her clothes outside the door, and she wasn't about to go walking out in front of Trent's friends in just a towel. All was ... wait. Amy suddenly remembered. Her clothes were outside the door, including the pair of embarrassing heart panties she'd been wearing. Trent and his friends hadn't seen them yet, otherwise they'd already be making fun of her, but they might notice any minute! She'd die of shame if they did! What could she do? An idea suddenly occurred to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Trent, since you're putting your costume in the washing machine, could you stick my clothes in there, too? I was going to after my shower, but if you're going anyway...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutes, sis. Don't worry about it.\" came Trent's reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Amy called, confident her brother wouldn't notice the panties bundled up in his costume, and turned the water back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the door, Trent turned to his two friends and whispered to them, his voice hidden to his sister by the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright guys, I think we might have another shot at this. After you-\" he nodded to Travis, \"-let her know we were here by bounding along the hallway, I thought the plan was over. But, ever the genius, I've only gone and come up with another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two others perked up.<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" whispered back Travis, \"Yeah, sorry for being loud, just excited, I guess.\"<br>\r\n\"Y'didn't have to throw me under the bus, though,\" said Blake, \"You made me sound like a buffoon, spilling drinks on people. Your sister'll think I'm an idiot!\"<br>\r\n\"Look Blake,\" Trent said \"Firstly, you <i>are</i> an idiot. Secondly, trust me, by the time tonight's over, you won't be the one looking stupid.\"<br>\r\n\"Speaking of,\" Travis said, \"What's the new plan?\"<br>\r\n\"Glad you asked,\" Trent said with a smirk. \"Peeking is off, but I have another great idea. First, we just need to...\"</span></div></div>",

Through the window she can see ripped curtains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the background of the house she can see a greenhouse filled with unkempt plants, the glasses are broken and some wines grown out of the greenhouse.

As she started down the hall, the front door shut itself with a <b><i>SLAM!!!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping in surprise, Lauren turned and (thankfully) didn't see anyone there, \"Must've just been the hinges, or the wind.\"  She said to herself, her heart racing in her chest as she approached the door to try and open it, but to no avail, it was wedged shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, guess I'll be leaving out the back door.\"  She said as she faced the hall, her flashlight for some reason not lighting up as much as it was a second ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere in the mansion, the ghost of the dirty old geezer that used to own this place cackled and silently moved toward her, let the fun begin!</span></div></div>",

Outside, the night was dark and clear, the moon shining brightly down onto the streets below. People went from door to door, house to house, filling their bags and containers with various bits of candy. From goblins to princesses, witches and ghosts to cowboys and superheroes, they were all enjoying the frightening festival to the fullest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one house, sitting at the far end of a cul-de-sac, Jason Crane sat watching some low-budget horror movie. With all the lights on, a bowl of popcorn in his lap, and his phone in his hands. He'd hoped to just enjoy a night alone, but his friends had hoped for something else, going by the texts they had been sending him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>u sure you wont come?</i> He read on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah. Stop asking</i>, he texted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>just one year wont kill you</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>still not going</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>if ur worried about that while skeleton thing noone even remembers that</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was then that, Jason turned his cellphone off. If Amanda had hoped to get him out on Halloween, reminding him of the reason he was still inside, and had in fact spent the past few years spending Halloween inside, was not the way to do it. He'd been 13, the last time he'd gone out on Halloween. A little old for trick or treating, maybe, but not too old that he was looked down upon. All he really wanted was one more year of it, and then he'd be content to take the first steps into young adulthood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd dressed up in a body suit with bones drawn on, a spooky skeleton wandering from door to door. Of course, one family had taken their dog out with them for the night, and this dog really, really loved bones. So, it was understandable that he'd get a little excited once he saw Jason. Ultimately, it wouldn't have been so bad, if they been walking by a house party. Between the flimsy fabric, the canine's sharp canines, and the riled up, raucous laughter of the onlooking party goers, any find memories of Halloween Jason had were eclipsed by a the complete embarrassment of being stripped in front of a crowd. So, no, he didn't like to go out on Halloween any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he'd only told that story to a select few people. Most people <i>had</i> forgotten, but Jason never could. His friends had been disappointed, though understanding, but it seemed like they were at their limit; being seniors and 18 years old now meant they'd probably being going separate ways for college, and they wanted to enjoy at least one Halloween with him. But still he refused. He felt bad, but he was content to celebrate in his own way. Alone. Fully dressed and in normal, hard to tear clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned back with a sigh, sinking into the cushions of the couch. The movie he was watching was pretty bad, actually, but he was fine to keep on watching it, when...</span></div></div>",

There: her car, down at the end of the long yard. She got to the vehicle, her salvation, the keys fumbling in her shaky hand. Tortuously slowly, she started to unlock the door; but wait!

It was Halloween night, and while her friends were out having fun and going to all the great parties being held that night, she was stuck at work, waiting on customers she was certain were not going to show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie, at 20 years old, still loved the night more than any other day of the year. She enjoyed the scares, the creativity, and of course, dressing up. This Halloween was no exception. She was dressed in a costume she had made herself, as what she called a Victorian Vampire. She wore a black top with red leather straps wrapped around it just under the bust, complete with mesh, bunched sleeves to give it a little more flair. While no cleavage was shown, it was clear from the tightness of the top she was proudly showing off her size C bust. Her skirt was a mix of black and red satin trim, carefully ruffled into a classy look. The skirt stopped at mid thigh, showing off her long fishnet stocking clad legs with a pair of black heels to help show them off more. To complete the look, she had a red mini top hat placed upon her pixie cut, raven hair. Even if she wasn't out partying, she couldn't have let that costume go to waste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome night, huh...\u201d Her co-worker walked into the store. \u201cSorry I'm late, needed to get into costume.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries, Angie.\u201d Natalie looked over at the 26 year old blonde, who in contrast to herself, had gone with a lazy approach to dressing. Angie wore a simple dalmatian onesie and black converses. The woman's golden locks spilled from the costume's hood, which naturally sported floppy ears at the top. \u201cNice costume.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, the boss likes us wearing the merchandise.\u201d Angie shrugged. \u201cAnd this is the most comfortable thing I could find.\u201d She walked over to counter to examine Natalie's costume closely. \u201cWent all out this year I see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was supposed to be for going out partying tonight. But we see how that turned out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I was supposed to watch some horror movies with my boyfriend. Amazing how everyone else suddenly got sick on us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey'll all be sick tomorrow... with hangovers...\u201d Natalie shook her head as she walked around from behind the counter. \u201cCan you watch the register a bit? I need to use the bathroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake you time.\u201d Angie said as she took Natalie's place. \u201cNot like anyone's stopping by tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie made her way towards the backroom door. She thought about how boring that night was going to be. How her Halloween would more and likely lack any kind of thrills or scares. It didn't cross her mind how wrong she would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will Natalie find in the backroom and cause a lot of trouble tonight?</span></div></div>",

It wasn't like Angie'd be overwhelmed without her, after all. Bored as she was, even rummaging through surplus props and unpopular costumes sounded like a fun diversion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the beginning of the season, the storeroom had been crammed full of things ready to be sold off. Now, while not empty, it was definitely a lot easier to get through. For the licensed costumes, all the popular characters were gone, leaving behind the unpopular side characters and villains whose appeal had been over-estimated by their marketers. Long sold were the realistic, bloody cleavers and axes, now only cheap, neon plastic swords and daggers sat on the shelves collecting dust. Plastic spiders, cartoony ghost standees, etc. In short, it was a bunch of trash at this point. But it was different trash than what was out on the shelves, so Natalie was giving it a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just standing back up (she'd seen some gag \"sexy janitor\" costume on a bottom shelf- not really that funny, but she just wanted to make sure she'd seen right), when Natalie banged her head on the shelf above her. Beyond the throbbing in her head, the loud metal clang, and her own swearing, she heard the clatter of something falling to the ground. Looking over, she saw a piece of costume jewelry- a crimson gem pendant, sitting in a dull silver that seemed to sparkle in even the dim light of the back room. Natalie tapped her fingernail against the gem, only hearing the \"clack\" of hard plastic in return- but, wow, did it look real! In fact, a blood red gem on a subtle silver chain fit right in with the rest of her costume. Natalie looked around, despite knowing it was just her and Angie on duty- it wasn't like she'd get in trouble, right? A trinket, just wearing it for the night. She could give it back tomorrow, if anyone even said anything at all; if not, it'd just sit unsold in some warehouse for a year, so what was the harm. With a grin, she clasped the plastic necklace around her neck, surprised at how well it fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, what Natalie couldn't have seen was the weak pulse of red light coming from the gem as she started back towards the store's main room. As such she had no idea what happened to cause her misfortune as....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh no....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally, sitting by the window in her living room, was not very happy. She had been happy, yesterday, when she was preparing to go out and celebrate Halloween with her friends. She was worried that morning, when clouds started to roll in over the town. And now, with the rain pouring down, and the weather reports saying that it was only going to get worse, Sally was in complete despair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally loved Halloween; getting to dress up in costume, getting to go around town with her friends, getting free candy. Some people might say that, as an adult, she should have outgrown these things, but that didn't matter to her! She was responsible, eager to try new things and expand her horizons, if a little overenthusiastic at times.  Why shouldn't she get to celebrate a holiday how she liked? After all, it was only one night. But, while Sally felt good giving that explanation to people who frowned at her for her festivity, there was little she could say to make the clouds stop raining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made an interesting sight, like many people would on Halloween night. The room looked like a normal living room, the weatherman on the TV looked so normal as to be rather boring, but Sally herself was, of course, in costume. She was a fairy that year, not exactly scary but Sally was prone to doing whatever felt right. The green dress was a little short, close to her knees but still above, and it ended under her arms in a tube top. It was a little tight on her curvy frame, but the green looked nice against her light-brown hair. On her back, attached to the dress, was a pair of 'wings' made of a light but sturdy fabric, and she had a pair of accompanying shoes. Every part was glittery, which seemed a little gaudy, but Sally brushed it off. Literally. The glitter got everywhere, so Sally had to keep brushing it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally had just about given up for the night, not content but resigned to changing back into pj's and curling up in front of the TV, when she saw a pair of headlights blaring through the window as a car pulled into her driveway. It was hard to make out the figures past the lights, and two of them bolted to Sally's front door as soon as the car stopped moving. Sally jumped to her feet and hurried over as someone pounded on the door and her doorbell was pressed over and over again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trick-or-treat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Happy Halloween! Now let us in already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally started beaming, even as her guests pushed past her out of the rain. They were both friends of hers; the first, a black girl named Tanya. She was wearing a heavy jacket, but Sally could see a red skirt and red boots underneath, and a blue top with a Supergirl logo on it as she unzipped. Tanya was a smart girl, if a little shy, but she always had Sally's back! They were supposed to go out trick-or-treating, something that Sally had spent a long time convincing her friend to do with her, but this was just fine too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her was Amanda, white with dyed red shoulder length hair. She was outgoing, probably even more than Sally, but could go a little far sometimes. And not like Sally could, where she got tunnel vision and got too into something, but in an abrasive, insulting sort of way. Still, she (usually) knew enough to apologize when she really screwed up. Here, she was dressed in a devil costume; a pair of plastic red horns on a headband, a low cut red top and tight red shorts, and black gloves and boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing close behind them was Jennifer, catching up just in time before Sally shut the door. She was Asian, taller than the rest of them and more muscular too; one of her hobbies was spending time at the gym. Her long black hair was pulled into a ponytail, getting wet in the rain, and she went for a very subtle vampire costume. Some might say \"lazy\" instead of \"subtle\", given that the costume seemed to just be a pair of fake vampire fangs and an all black outfit, including a shirt with a cartoon bat on the front. But, Jen was a reserved lady, and Sally appreciated even the small effort; she probably wouldn't have bothered at all if it wasn't to make Sally feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you guys doing here?\" Sally asked, once everyone was inside and starting to dry off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we knew how much you were looking to going out tonight, before it rained,\" Tanya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we figured we'd bring Halloween to you, if the weather was going to keep you from Halloween!\" Amanda finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like we planned on doing anything without you tonight,\" Jen added, and only put up a little resistance when Sally went to hug her, and then the rest of them in turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You girls are the greatest!\" Sally said, before frowning. \"I don't really have anything planned, though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say no more!\" said Amanda, and Sally grinned, eyes widening, as Amanda reached into a bag she had brought and pulled out...</span></div></div>",

It was meant to go to any trick-or-treaters that showed up before she left, but  the deluge outside had made that point useless. No, as the four costumed girls filed into Sally's living room, their host popping the disc into the player as Jen walked into the kitchen with a bowl of popcorn, they all decided that they were going to indulge themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">--------------------------</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well,\" John Marshall said, pulling his car into the driveway of his girlfriend's house, \"I'm sure glad we lost that creepy hitchhiker who was following us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're telling me,\" Jane Watson said, arms folded over her chest, \"I'm shivering just thinking about him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn grinned at her as they left the car and walked to her front door. \"Would it made you feel better if I stayed the night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis girlfriend huffed, and exasperated smile creeping onto her face. \"Nice try, pal. I'll see you tomorrow.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda, lying across the seat of an armchair, feigned gagging. Sally giggled as she lied on the floor in front of the couch., but shushed her as the boyfriend's car pulled away from the house. The camera cut to a shadowy silhouette walking down the road, and Tanya whined. Jen, sitting next to her on the couch, put a hand on her shoulder, which seemed to calm her down some. The camera cut to the bathroom, showing Jane from the knee down climbing into the shower, her clothes crumpled on the tile floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jane let the hot water rush over her, steam rising as the dirt was scoured from every pore on her body. She was humming; softly, but the acoustics of the bathroom made it seem louder to her. Loud enough that she couldn't hear the lock on her door being forced, anyway.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" Tanya whispered, and Sally shushed her this time, getting a glare from Jen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Softly, the door to her bathroom opened. Jane felt a cold breeze, but just turned the water up hotter in response. The hitchhiker could see her silhouetted through the shower curtain. Slowly, he raised an arm- a shiv held tight in his gloved fist! Slowly, he reached for the curtain. Jane frowned: was that... breathing she heard? Suddenly, the shower curtain swung open! Jane turned, covering herself up, and screamed. The hitchhiker shouted, a instinctual, guttural roar, the shiv trembling as he held it high in the air!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flash of light came in through the window. Sally had just enough time to register that fact, when a second later, a loud clap of thunder crashed down, shaking the whole house.

She felt drops pass down her stomach and she shivered. \"No, it's cool, it's fine,\" she said, pushed Tanya's hand away as she went to dab at her friend's chest with a napkin. \"I'm going to just... I need to clean myself off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, cool,\" Amanda said, \"We'll keep the movie paused until you get back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure it's fine?\" Tanya asked.

Her soggy dress lied in a heap on the floor, a harness with plastic fairy wings lying next to it, along with a strapless bra and pair of panties. She knew she was taking a while, but she figured it was better to be thorough than to let the soda form a sticky film on her body. Besides, those ice cubes had been really cold! The hot water was just the cure, and she didn't want to leave it quite yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe calmed down about Tanya quick; Sally was never one to hold grudges. The shower would take care of the soda on her, and the soda would wash out of the costume quickly enough. They'd all come here to cheer her up, so Sally felt bad for getting so annoyed with them. She'd have to apologize once she got out of the shower... whenever that would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe froze for a moment, thinking that she'd heard the door open, but when she looked past the curtain, there was no one else in the room. Sally laughed at herself. The movie was getting to her; the only other people in the house were her friends, and she'd locked the door... right? She brushed it off, resolving that she'd save getting scared for when she was back out there watching the movie with her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat resolution not to get scared didn't last long when...</span></div></div>",

Everyone was accounted for- light sparkling off Sally's glittery costume, Tanya whose phone light was shivering nervously in her hand, a large shadow being cast Jen's bulky black-clad form, and Amanda.... who was suddenly showing a lot more skin under the lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amanda, what the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you guys... Oh my god!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda's phone light was pointed straight at the floor as she flung her hands over herself. Her low cut top and tight shorts were gone, leaving her in a visibly straining red strapless bra and, from the small triangle of fabric in the front, what the other girls could only assume was a thong in the back. She still had her horns, gloves, and boots, leaving the naughty devil looking more like a sexy, skimpy succubus. \"Who the hell took my clothes?!\" she asked, face turning red to match her missing outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh- we didn't take anything!\" Sally said, \"I mean... I didn't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look at me,\" Jen said, followed by an \"I would never!\" stammered out by Tanya. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I didn't just decide to strip down!\" Amanda started glancing around, searching for her clothes. \"Seriously, this isn't cool you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We already said we didn't do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Someone</i> had to have!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally frowned. This wasn't really how she thought her evening would go, even when she was still moping around, but even more upsetting was how things didn't make sense. Amanda could get a little weird in her jokes, but the only victim here was herself, and no one was laughing. She blushed as Amanda turned and started pushing pillows away, looking for her lost outfit, confirming to the other three that she was in fact wearing a thong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Look, Amanda,\" Sally started, looking away, \"you're not going to find anything half-naked in the dark.

She rounded the bend in the staircase, her batman-boyshorts being the last thing Sally saw before she disappeared. Sally rushed around the turn\u2026 and slammed right into Jen, who had stopped cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha\u2026 what happened?\u201d Sally said, complete confusion in her voice. \u201cI thought that was Amanda shrieking. Where\u2019d everyone go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the lights had come on, there was neither a trace of Tanya nor Amanda in the living room. Nothing except for a lone red thong lying on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s Amanda\u2019s underwear,\u201d Jen said, still shaken from her sudden stripping. In the basement she\u2019d felt a pair of hands pass over her body, but she\u2019d assumed that was just Sally trying to feel her way around her in the tightly cramped basement. If it hadn\u2019t been her, it had to be Amanda\u2026 but if Amanda\u2019s was the one in trouble, and her thong was here, then there had to be something else at work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of a supernatural stripper in the house chilled Jen to the bone. No, that was wrong. Ghosts didn\u2019t exist! She tried to convince herself it was just the cold of being reduced to her bra and panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmanda? Tanya?\u201d Sally called out. When she didn\u2019t get an answer, she walked over to the couch, the last place she\u2019d seen them. She picked up the red thong and held it out in front of her. It was the same thin cotton she\u2019d seen clinging to Amanda\u2019s \u201ckiller\u201d curves a minute ago. Though Amanda loved to show off her hourglass figure, Sally doubted she\u2019d go so far as to go streaking around the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDefinitely Amanda\u2019s,\u201d said Sally. Sally hadn\u2019t seen her friend naked before, but there was a first time for everything, she supposed. Somewhere in the house, Amanda was completely bottomless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither hearing nor seeing Amanda around, she decided her friend would probably appreciate having her underwear back once they met up. Sally didn\u2019t have pockets, but she did have the old chest locker!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally stuck Amanda\u2019s thong inside the cleavage of her costume, tucking it between her ample breasts. She turned to face Jen, who was trying to appear as if standing around in her underwear was the most normal thing in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019d better go find them,\u201d Sally said. \u201cI mean\u2026 hopefully, they\u2019re just playing a prank on us. Right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight,\u201d Jen said, nodding. \u201cOf course. Just a prank. They're hiding somewhere in the house.

The other half was piled high with things that wouldn't fit or didn't belong in the house proper. Lawnmower, holiday decorations, etc. Along one wall was a set of gardening tools; a hobby of Sally's that she was always a little sad to put down when the cold autumn months came rolling in. Still, autumn had all of her favorite holidays, and even looking at the tools she brought back all the good memories they held. Right now though, they held something quite different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen flinched as Sally put a hand on her shoulder, her other hand raising a finger to her mouth. Slowly, she pointed first to a figure hunched behind a couple of trash cans, next to the rack of gardening tools. Then, to the spade that was lying on the floor, likely the source of the noise they had heard. Slowly, they crept forward, closer and closer to the figure, just barely visible in the dim light of the garage. They were almost upon it, hearing a low frantic muttering, when Sally's foot bumped the shovel. There was a short, loud scraping noise, and then three distinct shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" cried Tanya, springing up from her hiding place, eyes wide and a hand rake held high in her arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" went Sally, spying the implement as her frantic friend jumped out at them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tanya!\" shouted Jen, guard dropping.

Not only that, but her inner labia were poking out to say hello!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jen realized that her \u201coutie\u201d was showing, she nearly dropped the rake on Tanya\u2019s head. The normally composed athlete struggled to get free and pull her panties up- but fate had other ideas. Her batman boyshorts had caught on the blades of a nearby mulcher. With a horrible tearing noise, Jen\u2019s panties were reduced to ribbons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen swore. Loudly. Then she clamped her hands over her crotch like her life depended on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God, I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d Tanya said, seeing what she\u2019d done to Jen\u2019s boyshorts. \u201cI\u2019m the worst friend ever\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally stepped in for Jen, who was still in a state of shock. \u201cI\u2019m sure Jen\u2019s fine\u2026\u201d she said, waving her hand. She had to calm Tanya down. \u201cJust calm down. Everything\u2019s fine. Why\u2019re you hiding out here, anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya sniffled. \u201cRight before you turned the lights back on, Amanda said she felt something squeezing her butt, and\u2026 and then she screamed\u2026 and then the lights came back on, and all that was left was her thong! It was horrible!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe could just be messing with you,\u201d Sally said, determined to keep things upbeat. There were no such things as ghosts, anyway. Jen could have just taken off her clothes in the basement to mess with her, too. Right? \u201cCome on, let\u2019s just go back and make some more popcorn. Amanda will realize she can\u2019t fool us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm.\u201d Jen, still uncomfortable, was staring at the remains of her underwear. \u201cAbout that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry! Just wait a sec\u2026\u201d Tanya apologized again. She quickly shuffled out of her red Supergirl skirt, leaving her with just the blue Super-leotard and red Super-cape. \u201cHere. You can have my skirt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Jen snatched Tanya\u2019s skirt and turned around to put it on, baring her tight ass to her friends. A moment later she\u2019d slipped her friend\u2019s skirt on, leaving her in an odd outfit of just a grey bra and a red skirt cannibalized from another costume- but it was definitely better than nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Tanya slightly calmer and Jen slightly less embarrassed, the girls were set to go back to the kitchen. Unfortunately\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
