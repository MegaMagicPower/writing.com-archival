Hey questo \u00e8 giochi della sede dopo tutti.-I think I'm going to like it here.

Just as things could not get any worse for Carolina, the waste explodes all over her, and her body is entirely covered in radioactive waste.<br>\r\n\"Crap dell'OH! Che cosa l'inferno ha accaduto appena? Uomo dell'OH, ci\u00f2 realmente sta andando rimettere le mie preparazioni, e quello \u00e8 il senso piacevole di dirlo.-Oh crap! What the hell just happened? Oh man, this is really going to put my preparations back, and that's the nice way of saying it.\" The driver of the truck in front of her has just realized that someone has crashed into his truck and goes to see if that person is all right, not knowing that that person is Italy's best figure skater.<br>\r\n\"Siete tutto il di destra l\u00e0? Spiacente circa il traf lento...opinione, non siete la Carolina Kostner, la figura skater? Se siete, lo desiderate prenderlo all'ospedale?-Are you all right there?

If you are, do you want me to take you to the hospital?\", the driver inquired.<br>\r\nReplied Carolina, \"S\u00ec sono, signore. E nessun non dovete prenderli all'ospedale, Sono GIUSTO. Sono preoccupato per questi effluenti radioattivi comunque.-Yes I am, sir. And no you don't have to take me to the hospital, I'm OK.

I'd keep an eye out on any symptoms you might experience, all right. I'm just glad you're all right, and I plan on cheering you on to Olympic gold. Good luck Carolina, I know I'll be pulling for you.\"<br>\r\nAfter the driver and Carolina made their departure from the scene, experts arrived to check out the carnage and the leftover mess.<br>\r\nAfter initial tests, they discovered that the waste had been used to enlarge various plants and animals in tests. A growth serum it was. That's when it hit the experts: Carolina had been drenched with a growth serum, meaning she was about undergo the mother of all growth spurts.</span></div></div>",

She will join a very exclusive club of people who have earned the right to bear their nation's flag into the Opening, doing so as the host nation. It will be tremendous honour that will never be forgotten, but so to will what will take place this day.<br>\r\nCarolina Kostner finally wakes up after a good night's sleep, and she needed it after nearly killing herself in a wreck with a radioactive waste tanker.<br>\r\nThe first thing she does is go to the mirror to beautify herself. You gotta look extra special when you're carrying your nation's flag into the Olympics, even more so as the home team.<br>\r\nAs she gets her clothing together to get geared up, she notices something peculiar.<br>\r\n\"Al right, rivestimento, pantaloni, bandierina. Controllo. Per non provarli su...attenda un minuto. Potrei giurare questa misura me. Non lo ho portato mai yeat, Non lo ho lavato mai, ma non misura me. Dar\u00f2 gli altri...l'OH grande!

My shoes, and pants don't fit me either. Someone must have shrunk them in the wash! I didn't wash them, someone must have, and I'm going to find out who did!\", Carolina exclaimed as she stormed off, wearing her Italian team pajamas that had been issued only to the women of the team, which now feels much more uncomfortable than when she put them on.

Ho messo sopra la mia uniforme di cerimonia dopo che mi fossi alzato, e non misura me. Ho mai uniforme portato loro fino all'oggi, e mai persino li avevo lavati. o c'\u00e8 ne dei miei compagni di squadra?-Coach, I'm not happy. I put on my ceremony uniform after I had gotten up, and they don't fit me. I've never even worn them until today, and I had never even washed them. Did you or did any of my teammates?\", she demanded.<br>\r\nReplied the coach,\"Sono stato intorno ai vostri compagni di squadra tutto questo volta, e posso confermarlo mai non ho toccato i vostri vestiti. E dite che i vostri vestiti hanno ristretto. Ho un'idea, La Carolina. Levisi in piedi in su contro la parete, cos\u00ec posso misurare la vostra altezza e vedere se ci sono delle anomalie.-I've been around your teammates all this time, and I can confirm they have never touched your clothes. And you say your clothes have shrunk. I have an idea, Carolina. Stand up against the wall, so I can measure your height and see if there are any abnormalities.\" So she agreed and brought in the medical staff to see if there was anything wrong. Her last measured height was 5'6, but here, she was measured at 5'8 and a half.<br>\r\n\"La Carolina Buona, potete distendersi. I vostri vestiti non hanno ristretto, vi siete sviluppati. Avete aumentato vertiginosamente 2 ed i pollici di met\u00e0.-Well Carolina, you can relax. Your clothing hasn't shrunk, you've grown. You've shot up 2 and a half inches.\", the coach told a disconcerted Carolina.<br>\r\nShe replies, \"Dovete scherzarli. Sto ottenendo pi\u00f9 alto? Quello \u00e8 impossibile, Sono 19, una ragazza come me dovrebbe arrestare crescere bene prima di ora. Indovino il questo che cosa accade quando vi arrestate...-You have got to be kidding me. I'm getting taller? That's impossible, I'm 19, a girl like me should have stopped growing well before now. I guess this what happens when you crash...\", Carolina replies nonchalantly before the coach intervenes. \"Che arresto?-What crash?\"<br>\r\n\"Niente. Dovrei essere felice per stasera, condurre la nostra squadra in Stadio Olimpico per la cerimonia come capitano della squadra, ma mi confondo circa crescere la vigilia dei giochi. Non potete trovare qualcun'altro?-Nothing. I should be happy for tonight, leading our team into Stadio Olimpico for the ceremony as team captain, and yet I'm embarrassed about having grown on the eve of the Games. Can't you find someone else?\"<br>\r\nThe coach tells her, \"La Carolina, la parte di essere il flagbearer significa responsibilty. Siete una donna giovane, dovreste conoscere la responsabilit\u00e0 ormai. Avete vinto le medaglie sulle fasi pi\u00f9 grandi nella la figura pattinare, qualcosa nessun altro italiano come fatto nelle decadi. Quella responsabilit\u00e0 degli introiti. Potete non ottenere mai ancora questa occasione. Approfittilo mentre potete. Ricordisi di, la folla non si preoccuper\u00e0 quanto alto siete, si preoccuperanno per incoraggiare per il loro propri. Quando vedete tutto il colore rosso, bandierine bianche e verdi che sono fluttuate intorno allo stadio mentre chanting \"Forza\", quella \u00e8 qualcosa che non possiate mettere un prezzo sopra. Lo capite?-Carolina, part of being the flagbearer means responsibility. You're a young woman, you should know responsibility by now. You've won medals on the biggest stages in figure skating, something no other Italian has done in decades. That takes responsibility. You may never get this opportunity again. Take advantage of it while you can. Remember, the crowd won't care how tall you are, they'll care about cheering for their own. When you see all the red, white and green flags being waved around the stadium while chanting \"Forza\", that's something you can't put a price on. You understand me?\"<br>\r\n\"S\u00ec. Ritengo molto pi\u00f9 meglio circa me. Sto andando fare questo. Ma prima che, potreste trovare un nuovo formato in uniforme per me dovuto il mio formato aumentato?-Yes I do. I feel much better about myself. I'm going to do this. But before I do, could you find a new size in uniform for me due to my increased size?\", Carolina requested of her coach.

At the Palavela, the venue for short track speedskating and Carolina's event figure skating, 80 delegations had gathered in preparation for the walk over to Stadio Olimpico for the Opening Ceremony. You would think there would be a lot of nervouse people there as for 90 percent of the athletes, this was their shining moment, but it was a light hearted atmosphere with many a practical joke being played. Case in point, at the U.S. area, one of their athletes laid a whooppee cushion on the chair of one of their leaders. As soon as he sat down, the whole area burst into laughter. Even Carolina's teammates got into the act. Silvia Fontana, one of Carolina's figure skating teammates and closest friends, dared Enrico, a speed skater, to drink a whole gallon of cold milk. Needless to say it ended up all over the place, not to mention with lots of laughter and one pretty sick skater.<br>\r\nAs the big moment began to draw ever closer, Carolina made a stop at one of the restrooms in the concourse, away from all the noise, to get herself fired up for the honour of carrying Italy's iconic green, white and red flag before not only a stadium of 35,000, but also a worldwide audience of two billion people. As she put on a tiny bit of makeup, she noticed that her new shoes were feeling tighter than when she got them, ditto for her clothing under her silver fur trimmed coat. She thought to herself, \"L'OH mi non dice. Uno \u00e8 nervosismo, o sto sviluppandosi ancora. Lo prego sono il posteriore, poich\u00e8 non posso permettersi di passare attraverso un altro cambiamento del wardrobe a causa di altezza aumentata. E spero seriamente che nessuno abbia preso la mia acqua.-Oh don't tell me. Either it's nervousness, or I'm growing again. I hope it's only nervousness, as I can't afford to go through another wardrobe change because of increased height. And I seriously hope noone took my water.\"<br>\r\nLittle did she realize, she had now shot up to 6 foot on the dot, and was still gradually growing, however little by little.</span></div></div>",

Then it happened. Carolina's clothing began ripping apart at the seams. Her shoes exploded off of her rapidly expanding feet, and her chest swelled up like a balloon, even sounding like a balloon being inflated, pushing her shirt and coat to the breaking point and finally well past it. Carolina panicked as her growing only accelerated,\"L'OH il mio dio che sto sviluppandosi! Sto ottenendo pi\u00f9 grande! Suppongo che \u00e8 venuto a questo...- Oh my God I'm growing! I'm getting bigger! I suppose it has come to this...\" <br>\r\nMeanwhile, the guy went to the main hall and shouted to everyone gathered, \"Everyone get out now! Something's happening! I swear to you if you don't leave right now we're all going to pay dearly!\"<br>\r\nThey all laughed at him, but then they heard shaking, some fearing it could be an earthquake. But then a gigantic hand exploded through the south side of the Palavela. The Italian delegation realized right away it was Carolina, they knew it was her as she was the only one who painted the colours of the Italian flag on her hand, and finally every last person made a break for the outside to escape Carolina's rapldly expanding stature. And as soon as the 80 delegations as well as numerous volunteers reached a safe point near Stadio Olimpico, the roof of the buliding was destroyed and there was a 1600ft.Carolina Kostner standing in front of the folks at the Olympics, even bringing the Opening Ceremony in the stadium to a standstill.(\"CHE COSA \u00c8 ACCADUTO ME? E WHO SIETE RAGAZZO \"PICCOLO\"?-WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME?

Suddenly, Carolina's stomach groaned loud enough for the city to hear. When the audience heard this, they suddenly got the impression that she was about to use them to fulfill her.

And then there was the home favourite, Carolina Kostner of Italy. She had won bronze at the European and World championships, raising expectations she might provide Torino its \"Cathy Freeman\" moment.<br>\r\nSasha got to the Palavela to further tweak her program. She got to the dress room to change into her outfit, which is normally an easy task, but today, it's harder than usual.<br>\r\n\"Coach, I can't fit into my outfit,\"said Sasha towards her coach, who was standing at the guardrail in the rink itself watching other skaters practice.<br>\r\n\"What? That can't be right.

None of them fit!\", Sasha yelled at her coach.<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, I have an idea. Sasha, would you mind standing up against the wall, I need to see something,\" the coach asked of Sasha. \"Uh, OK.\"<br>\r\nHer coach brought out a tape measure, and discovered something startling: Sasha had grown taller.<br>\r\n\"Um, Sasha, I found the reason why your outfits don't fit you anymore, and you aren't going to believe what I'm about to tell you. You gotten taller.\"<br>\r\n\"WHAT??? No way. How on earth did that happen,\" Sasha replied with fear and trepedation.<br>\r\n\"Actually Sasha, it's not all that uncommon for women your age to grow another couple of inches. I had a friend back in college, and despite being 21, she shot up 4 inches, true story.\", the coach said as he tried to calm her down.<br>\r\n\"Why don't you ask another skater if they would let you borrow one of their outfits?\", the coach suggested to Sasha.<br>\r\n\"All right, not a problem.\" Sasha made her wasy to the concourse, and bumped into Shizuku, who was stretching before heading onto the ice.<br>\r\n\"Oh hi Shizuku, do you mind if I ask you for a favour?\", Sasha asked her.<br>\r\n\"OK,\" replied Shizuku, and the two made their way into the change room, and Shizuku gave her a sprakling maroon sequined dress, which Sasha had secretly liked for a while.<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Shizuku.

Drug accusations? Guess again. Murder? Nice try Pinnochio.<br>\r\nWhen they got there, they couldn't believe their eyes.
