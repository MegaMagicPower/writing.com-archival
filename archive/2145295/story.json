You realize that you don't know exactly what kind of game this is. While an adventurer would be the easy choice in a first person shooter game, the dating on the console and cartridge suggested that was unlikely. Then you spotted Professor Shelly Oberon, the curvy genius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curvy huh...\" you mutter to yourself. You've always been a fan of the computer generated curves on video game characters, and playing as a genius could have its advantages in more of a strategy driven game. You've made your choice and select the professor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you're engulfed by a bright light and then thing go black. When you can see again, you are feeling very unlike yourself. You look down at your body and collapse in shock at the sight of a chubby belly and flabby arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull yourself up and take in your surroundings. You've been transported out of the school's basement into the depths of a thick jungle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could try to make sense of what had happened to you, a pop up screen flashes before your eyes:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Sheldon Oberon<br>\r\nPlayer class - Genius <br>\r\nstrength: Cartography, Paleontology, and Archeology<br>\r\nweakness: Endurance<br>\r\nnumber of lives: 3</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...the....hell?\" you ask yourself in a shockingly weak sounding voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear a rumble from behind you.

Before you can react, the hippo lunges at you. You are engulfed in a moment within her massive maw and are swallowed instantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo chuckles happily as she enjoys the sensation of your body traveling down to her massive gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, you go from the inside of a hippo to falling from the sky!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooof!\" you moan as you land on your belly. You've gone from scrubbing the basement of your school, to being trapped in the body of a middle aged fat guy stranded in a jungle, to being eaten and swallowed by a huge hippo, and finally fell a hundred feet from the sky! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could this day possibly get any worse,\" you ask yourself as you roll over onto your back with a groan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFamous last words...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes go wide as you feel the earth shake beneath you. You look up and see a familiar hippo. She has what appears to be a grin on her face as she stampedes her way toward you on all fours. The hippo steps over your body, giving you an up close view of her underbelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" you mutter, before the hippo collapses, crushing and squashing your much smaller form beneath her girth.  She shimmies in place happily, flattening what was left of your squashed form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a now familiar flash of light, you feel yourself falling again. You try to compose yourself as you tumble through the air, attempting to right yourself and avoid falling on your face. You look down and your heart falls even faster than your body at what you see. You realize that you're falling straight toward the same hippo that had already swallowed and crushed you! What is it about this jungle, this game, and this hippo!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge animal glances upward and snorts upon seeing your falling body. She scoots herself up in a display that should be shocking for a creature of her size. But your'e in no mood to be impressed, as her slight motion has your fall directing you straight for the creature's massive ass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLUMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the speed of your fall, even your chubby body couldn't provide the resistance necessary to prevent yourself from squeezing between the hippo's massive cheeks upon impact. The creature let out a grunt or a moan and clenched her massive cheeks over your body, squashing you yet again. Her flesh was rough and unyielding, but most importantly, her cheeks were propelled by incredible strength as they chewed up your helpless body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother flash of light and you felt your body falling again. You felt nauseous as you fell, wishing for the sweet release of death instead of this repeated circle of torture at the hands of a vicious hippo. She had moved forward and lifted her ass at the ready, just adjacent to where she expected you to land. You didn't anticipate you would last much longer this round than you had the previous three. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you drew closer to your assumed doom, you feel yourself rapidly changing direction. Your free fall was halted and you were flying parallel to the ground, thankfully away from the powerful hippo. You look around in shock to try to figure out what happened, and you realize that flying was the wrong word. You were swinging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and lay eyes on the strongest man you had ever seen. He wore an expressionless face that looked as if it were carved out of marble. He had caught you mid-free fall, gripping a vine in one hand and your chubby body in another arm as if you were a sack of potatoes. Finally, he lands at what you assume is a safe distance away from the hippo or any other eminent threats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor Oberon?\" the man asks enthusiastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh....um....\" you stammer. You shake your head clear and remember that was the name of the character you had selected. \"Uh....yeah. I guess. Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here you can call me Smolder Bravestone. And boy, I am glad to see you! Where are the others?\" he asks in excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, others?\" you ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks disappointed. \"Well, one isn't four, but it's better than none I suppose,\" he says dejectedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, uh...Smolder....\" you start \"First, I guess, thank you for saving me from that insane hippo. But can you tell me what <i>the hell</i> is going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were indeed grateful for the save, you had just about lost your patience for this place and needed answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBravestone quickly explains the nature of Jumanji to you, and you quickly realize why your friends attempted to destroy the game. You wish they had succeeded. When he gets to the part about 3 lives, you respond in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, but that hippo....I died three times already!\" you exclaim and check your arm. To your great relief, you still have three bars tattooed on your forearm. Identical to your rescuer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Well, count yourself lucky that the game starts with a practice level. Sort of like an instructional. To get you used to it. Otherwise.....\" he doesn't finish his sentence, but whistles long and slow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder. That was a practice level? What the hell else would be in this forsaken jungle?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well look, now that you're here, at least we can get some use from this. Hopefully it's not just blank to you,\" Bravestone says handing you a folded up parchment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open it and see a detailed map. You realize that for all of his strength, your hero was wandering the jungle lost. He needed you to direct him. To aim the weapon, so to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou examine the map, and instruct Bravestone that you need to head toward...</span></div></div>",

Before you, trampling the brush of the jungle beneath her bare feet, is an impossibly large woman. She's barely clothed, with cloths that look like they're stitched together from some kind of animal skins that cover her nipples and most of her crotch, but nothing else. The tall, muscular, curvaceous blonde has her eyes directly on your much smaller body as she stomps your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to run, but only get a couple of steps away before you feel yourself wrapped up in a huge fist. The woman doesn't acknowledge you with a single word, but turns on her heels and stomps back in the direction she came in. You squirm to try to get to a point where you can cry for help, but her hand has you held tightly. She's not squeezing with any intention of harming you, but you can't make any progress and certainly can't be heard from your position being held alongside her hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any ceremony, the giantess drops you on a cushiony surface in a dark room and departs. You look around in confusion. You realize that you're in a very well built hut, huge to you but normal size for the woman who carried you here. In a room of this size, the cushiony surface you're on is, as you recognize, a bed. Upon further investigation, you see another huge woman sitting back in the bed, eying you hungrily. This woman, equally as curvaceous as the first you met, is a brunette and is completely nude. You take a small step back, but recognize that the woman is waiting on you to move toward her. She's not reaching toward you or acting in any kind of a threatening manner. You breathe a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman is not completely still, as she stirs in anticipation. You're alone on a bed with a beautiful, naked woman who is giving you a very inviting look. Normally you would know exactly how to proceed. But your size difference is giving you more than a significant pause. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, another pop up flashes in front of your eyes:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A bonus round<br>\r\nIs what you've found<br>\r\nMake her cum<br>\r\nAnd you have won<br>\r\nA life you must wager to play this game<br>\r\nBeware - No two women are ever the same</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider the message before you and attempt to process exactly what the meaning of the rhyme was. This is some kind of an optional bonus game. If you win, by making the nude giantess climax, you would win an extra life. But if you lose, you lose one of the three you have. You swallow hard. Additional lives in a jungle that contains giantesses and who knows what else could certainly come in handy. But with your lack of speed and strength, was that a risk you were willing to take? </span></div></div>",
