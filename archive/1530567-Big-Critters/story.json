            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tThe street was a hive of activity.  People rushed by in both directions, hurried by their constant affairs, and most were so absorbed in their own lives that they could scarcely keep from colliding into each other (especially when one was less than half their height!).  It was a sea of individuals, the space in-between a contradiction to the isolation of each man and woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBuddy, however, had no time for philosophy, he had a job to do, which was more than most of his fellows he knew could boast, and his job was his life.  Past steaming grates leading into the sewers and stinking tail exhausts of cars that seemed to be positioned to emit right into his sensitive nose; Around broken patches of asphalt and stubborn on comers in the flood of humanity who would sooner correct their route than a boulder in a stream;  Over piles of refuse that sometimes built around the overflowing trash containers like the base of an expanding pyramid and puddles of black, semi-congealed goo in the potholes that was less than half water and well on its way to evolving into a higher life form.  Each curb, every bump was a challenge and Buddy noticed them all for he had the most important job in the world, as far as he was concerned, leading a human safely through the chaos all around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe towering black skinned, gray furred human behind him was known to other humans as \u201cDr. Mathias,\u201d  but Buddy had no need of titles, he was his human and that was all that mattered.  The golden retriever that helped the good doctor get to his elementary school where Buddy would rest under his desk for most of the day was aware that his master was an important human; he had a seat on the board of education and if he was rather busy most of the time, at least Buddy was always by his side and ready to lend a friendly ear or belly to rub during those times he became stressed during work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYes, Buddy couldn\u2019t imagine being anywhere else than beside the tall, dark man in the sunglasses.  His harness and his cape stitched with the words, \u201cPlease do not pet me, I\u2019m working\u201d  might as well have been made of gold for the way that he carried them and had been carrying them since puppy hood when Dr. Mathias got Buddy from \u201cThe Seeing Eye.\u201d  He\u2019d spent more than half of his short, canine life in the company of his human and the fact that his best years were behind him meant as much to Buddy as the plastic bags that floated by in the cool Autumn breeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBuddy stopped at the curb as he had been taught and had done a thousand times since.  His tail stiffened at the sight of the massive angular metal carts that humans rolled around in passing by; they were a threat, always a threat to the safety of his charge.  For while Buddy knew that Dr. Mathias was vastly more intelligent,  and larger than he was, he needed Buddy to guide him.  There was nothing like the feeling being able to help such a great being in such a tangible way; it filled the aging guide dog with pride every time he stepped off the curb.  Dr. Mathias came to a halt beside him and briefly patted Buddy\u2019s head while they waited.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\tAfter a few moments, Dr. Mathias cocked his head this way and that, listening for traffic as Buddy knew.  He said, \u201cForward.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\tNow, at this moment, the critical moment, Buddy was in charge and had an important decision to make, Go or stay.  \u201cSelective disobedience\u201d humans call it, but really all it was was letting the dog decide.  However, as was ground into Buddy long ago by his mentors, this was a life and death decision at every crossing.  Buddy never forgot, but the years wear on one\u2019s sense of caution and even more heavily in the form of conditioning.  The Golden had walked his route virtually every day for\u2026 as long as he could remember.  Day in and day out, it was the same.  Though he was as blind to the mysteriously colored traffic lights as Dr. Mathias, Buddy looked ahead and saw the cars lined up neatly to the right and judged it safe.  He stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA car came sailing lazily in from the left as it arched through the intersection.  So slow was it moving that Buddy thought that surely it would realize there was an elderly man and dog in the street and stop.  But it didn\u2019t.  The golden retriever, so very proud just a few moments ago in his very important job froze, his mind refusing to process quickly enough.  His paws started to grind forward, but it was as if they locked in molasses, he wasn\u2019t nearly as swift as he had been a few years ago.  The car, however, didn\u2019t wait for Buddy and soon a glowing headlight shined down on him, and filled up the world, like the eye of death drawing him into itself; that bumper was just the right height to catch him in the chest and break him to pieces like an egg dashed on concrete.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBuddy felt a push from behind and then he was flying.  Funny, he would have thought getting hit by a car would hurt more, but then perhaps he had died instantly and was simply floating away\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe guide dog landed hard on the asphalt and the noise of the world which had fallen strangely silent returned in a flood, except with a few additions.  There was the screech of tires for one, a woman was screaming, the humans were talking excitedly\u2026 and there were groans coming from behind.  Buddy turned and found his cherished master lying face down on the road behind him, hands outstretched towards him.  \u2026He\u2019d pushed Buddy out of the way at the last second.  The good doctor\u2019s legs lay twisted, the gray pants of his expensive suit marked with the hideous black of tire treads.  Dr. Mathias lay gasping and groaning, clenching his hands again and again; Buddy smelled his master\u2019s blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe entire world seemed flipped on its head.  Things were not supposed to be like this.  Dr. Mathias had placed his life into Buddy\u2019s hands\u2026 it was what he lived for.  Now\u2026 now not only had Buddy failed his human in the most terrible way imaginable\u2026 but his human had sacrificed himself to save him.  It was a strange and horrible reversal of fate.  He should be the one to gladly give his life, not this\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBuddy crawled forward like a puppy and settled his golden furred head near his owner\u2019s.  Gently he extended his tongue and licked some of the grit away from Dr. Matias\u2019s face.  A bony hand rose and grasped him gently behind the head, rubbing the inside of his right ear the way he had done for more than half a decade.  Now the driver of the errant car was running over, cell phone in hand.  The young human moved as if to touch his human, but Buddy showed his teeth and growled menacingly for the first time in his life; no more harm would come to his master from this man.  Buddy started to rise, but the hand on his head grew tight.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n       \"No\u2026 Buddy.\u201d  Dr. Mathias croaked, a thin stream of blood and saliva leaked out the side of his mouth.  \u201cDown\u2026. Stay\u2026\u201d  Buddy settled down, but the hand relaxed before his hackles could even lower.  Buddy licked his human\u2019s, his companion\u2019s, face again, but there was no gentle response, no cracked smile this time.  Pleadingly, Buddy looked to the young man, but he had backed off, still talking urgently into his cell phone.  All around, humans watched as the one man Buddy cared for in all the world silently passed on, an invisible wall about ten feet in radius from the body formed; many humans were on their phones, possibly calling for help, but Buddy wasn\u2019t so sure, one was pointing and taking a picture.  \u2018Why won\u2019t they help?\u2019 Buddy wondered, \u2018Doesn\u2019t anyone care?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDesperately Buddy licked Dr. Mathias unceasingly, all about the head and face as a brooding bitch would trying to lick life into a still pup.  The Golden\u2019s mouth was dry by the time the ambulance arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       The kennels of the Seeing Eye were cramped compared to the spacious apartment he was used to; it was also cold, damp and stank of the nearby puppies as they learned their toilet training.  But above all of the discomforts he had suffered since being parted with the cooling corpse of his previous owner, it was lonely.  Buddy curled up with his hind feet under his chin, as if he might squeeze himself into nothing if he tried hard enough for surely his life as he knew had passed with the generous man who had saved his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBuddy was not a young dog, but he looked even older now for lack of eating.  Buddy had never been a particularly thin dog, enjoying a good meal as much as any other canine and his master being generous with his scraps, but now his belly tucked up frightfully under his chest and his ribs showed; patches of his beautiful coat were starting to fall out.  He tried to sleep, but every time he closed his eyes he saw the aged, wrinkled face of Dr. Matthias, eyes glazed, bloody drool leaking out the side of his mouth.  Buddy lifted his head and howled until he was hoarse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBuddy wasn\u2019t the only older dog at \u201cThe Seeing Eye\u201d in fact; he was now \u201cretired\u201d a couple years before most; though usually retirees remain with their families as pets.  The pups were nothing but pests, all legs and motion, jumping and playing, all the while disgracing themselves with their lack of discipline\u2026  The older dogs knew failure when the smelled it.  It was fortunate then that the waiting list for retired service dogs was years long, highly trained dogs always being greatly desirable.  Buddy found himself in a strange new car speeding away from the enclosed yards and kennels of \u201cThe Seeing Eye\u201d before long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTurning away from the rear window, Buddy settled down in the seat to avoid the bumpy, unfamiliar motion of the car; Dr. Mathias hadn\u2019t drove for obvious reasons and Buddy now thought that it was fortunate the way that his belly was churning now.  Besides the aging guide dog sat a small girl in a cute little dress, on the far seat was a very tall girl with black hair and black lipstick and black gloves with the fingers cut out\u2026 she wasn\u2019t very cute at all, Buddy decided.  In front, a be-speckled, balding man whose fringe of hair was a lighter shade of Buddy\u2019s own coat, very handsome, the dog thought,  drove and beside him a plump human female reclined, a face mask over her eyes and snoring quietly; her smock smelled of butter and dough.  Fairly strange humans all, their skin like bleached bone compared to his former master\u2019s and all of them were much younger.  The human girl-child intrigued him, Buddy had curiously little time with children for all his owner worked in an elementary school, mostly he had sat in his master\u2019s office with outside breaks during class time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCautiously, she , with her rosey pink cheeks spotted with freckles, reached out and touched his tail.  Buddy swished it and she giggled, retracting her hands to her mouth.  The tall girl-child rolled her eyes and twirled her finger on the plastic rectangle he held, a soft crashing noise that sounded like construction work issued from behind her limp black locks of hair.  Buddy ignored it and continued to entertain the small girl-child with his long bushy tail as the tall buildings eventually gave way to smaller houses and then to forest\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the trees gave way to wide rolling hills covered with vast farms and still the car moved onwards. This family must have traveled a long way to get him. Buddy was no great thinker, but his long experience told him that these people must have really wanted him. Eventually, the little car, with a pause to fill up the gas tank, came to a new human city, though not so nearly as vast and tall and the canyons of gray sculpted stone, glass and steel he was used to. Just outside of the heart of the city, the car turned off the freeway and entered into a quieter area. Here the houses were more widely spaced, though many were identical to Buddy's eyes. Wide spaces of green grass lay in front of every home and trees were abundant; Buddy had never seen such a sight, 'So much space!' he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the car pulled into the driveway of a wide three storied house, Buddy was wagging his tail for the first time since the terrible accident and his failure. The little girl next to him leaned over and grasped his neck. She whispered, \"Welcome home!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The balding man attached a rope to Buddy\u2019s  neck\u2014so different from the harness\u2014and brought the dog inside.  The door opened and Buddy was met with a shock, the door opened into a little room rather than the great space he had been expecting from the sight of the exterior.  Buddy had never seen stairs inside of a human home before either, he smelled furniture polish overlaying old wood.  A picture of the man holding his leash, albeit with a full coat of golden fur and smaller versions of the two girls behind him sat on a small end table beside the steps.  Still befuddled by the strange little room, Buddy hardly noticed when the man unhooked him.  Buddy looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe man had a soft, round face, small nose, even for a human, and thick square glasses.  That golden hair, only a few shades lighter than his own, marched around the sides of his head, leaving his crown barren save for a sad attempt at a comb over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPeter!  Won\u2019t you come get this big ol\u2019 bag of dog food?\u201d called the voice of the man\u2019s apparent mate.  She came to the front door while the man turned around and left, waddling a bit.  The big female was actually a little more than plump, in fact, she was bordering on rotund.  Taller and more than half as wide again as her mate, the female dwarfed him.  She had a long face, though the effect was mostly spoiled by the size of her cheeks which appeared full like a squirrel\u2019s and the thickness of her neck which almost suggested that she had to swallow several softballs or a small melon.  She carried nothing from the car but her minuscule purse leaving her husband and children to collect the various supplies given by \u201cThe Seeing Eye.\u201d  Buddy\u2019s tail wagged when the tall girl all in black grabbed his old dog bed from the back, it was one of the few items left from his previous life as he thought of it.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nOnce the rest of the family was coming, the plump woman pushed open a door and all of Buddy\u2019s misconceptions of smallness vanished in an instant.  There was a spacious living room with rich leather furniture arranged around a massive flat picture box that humans loved so much.  Real rich leather, the tantalizing aroma was almost like sugar sprinkled on the air currents, but Buddy was able to resist temptation; he was a disciplined working dog\u2026 or at least he was.  He still didn\u2019t know what role he would play in this household, certainly all of the humans seemed perfectly able to see and guide themselves.  It seemed that he was destined to become nothing but a spoiled pet without a job\u2014and therefore without a life\u2014though he couldn\u2019t expect anything more.  Who would want to rely on an aged guide dog who had led his charge right into the jaws of death?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuddy sagged, but the small, rosy cheeked girl child ran up to him and threw her arms around him once again, kissing him on his forehead; he managed a half hearted lick in return.  Then the human girl did a most peculiar thing.  Pulling back her toes off the ground, she slide forward and seemed to glide across the wooden surface of the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did I say about skating in the house, Lauren?  Take those wheels out right now!\u201d  commanded the plump woman from the other side of the kitchen counter.  Already there were succulent smells wafting from that side of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall, pale girl walked right past where Buddy was sitting, dropping his cherished dog bed on the floor without stopping and virtually ran upstairs without a word.  Buddy heard a door slam shortly followed by the same chaotic din he had heard issuing from beneath her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe husband, apparently called \u201cPeter\u201d  came in, staggering under a mighty bag of kibble.  He threw it down beside the stairs and stretched his back, groaning a little.  Buddy looked up and cocked his head quizzically.  \u201cOh don\u2019t mind her, she\u2019s always like that.\u201d He said and cupped Buddy under the chin with his palm.  Buddy might have nuzzled back, but he couldn\u2019t find the heart to do so.  The man took a folded piece of paper out of his jacket pocket and read it carefully.  He leaned to the right and peered out across the living room to the kitchen to make sure no one was watching and then he smiled to himself.  \u201cA real guide dog, well, let\u2019s see what you can do.\u201d  He muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDown.\u201d He said.  Buddy laid down with almost no conscious input.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUp.\u201d  Buddy stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter checked his paper again.  \u201cReady.\u201d  Buddy walked over to his right side and turned forward.  Now was when he was supposed to be fitted with his harness to begin his very important, and now miserably failed job.  The man looked down with a silly grin on his face, but Buddy felt only disappointment since it was obvious that they weren\u2019t going anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForward.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stepped forward together into the living room where the smaller girl-child, Lauren that was it, was placing the plastic tabs over the holes where the wheels had been in the soles of her little pink shoes.  Buddy didn\u2019t like humoring the man for his own amusement, but the commands were too well ingrained in him to even think about disobeying them.  \u201cHault.\u201d Said the man in the glasses before the kitchen counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plump woman already had her sleeves rolled up and was wrist deep in flour.  So near the floor, Buddy couldn\u2019t see the dishes, but he smelled fresh dough, tomato paste, beef, cheese, herbs and vegetables.  \u201cSee what a good boy Buddy is?\u201d said the husband<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuddy was surprised when the large female slammed her chunky fists into the counter, rolling something and then striking again.  \u201cI still think we should have gotten one from a breeder.  My cousin knows this wonderful woman who has the most beautiful French Bulldogs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe be speckled man grimaced visibly.  \u201cHoney, you know I don\u2019t care for little dogs.  I need a dog we can play with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plump mate to the man next to him looked over the counter down at Buddy where he had already sat down.  \u201cThen you should have adopted a puppy.  Look at all that white on his muzzle.\u201d  She gestured dismissively down at Buddy, \u201cAnd didn\u2019t they say he\u2019s going blind?  He cost almost a grand and now there will be more vet bills.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s just losing some of the sight in his left eye, Sweetheart.  The Seeing Eye said it\u2019s unlikely he\u2019ll go completely blind.\u201d  This was news to Buddy.  Blind?  In one eye?  He hadn\u2019t noticed anything different with his vision, but then those tests with the flashing lights at the kennels came back to him; they way the technicians had muttered and mentioned Dr. Mathias.  Is that why he hadn\u2019t seen the car coming?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmph\u2026\u201d said the wide female and punched her dough even more vigorously.  Peter wisely decided to make a hasty departure.  Peter put the big bag of dog food away in the pantry and stowed a couple of his old toys and a couple new ones away in a basket in the living room, Buddy following all the time.  He picked up Buddy\u2019s bed and walked up stairs.  It was a longer climb that Buddy was used to, Dr. Mathias had always taken the elevator and his hip hurt a little by the time he reached to top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpstairs, there was a long hallway flanked by many doors.  Peter walked all the way to the end and though Buddy instinctually wanted to sniff at the bottom gap of each door, he followed  dutifully at his side, the way that a true guide dog should, just in case.  Buddy wondered half-hopefully if Peter had any medication to fetch, or possibly a cane.  He opened to door to a darkly lit room sporting a wide double bed with a black comforter.  The man put Buddy\u2019s bed at the base of it on the floor and then took a seat in at the nearby desk and computer.  Buddy stood by for a long while, waiting for Peter to move, but when he didn\u2019t and seemed to slide into concentration the way Dr. Mathias had over his papers, Buddy pushed his way between his legs to lie down under the desk\u2026 or at least he tried.  Peter\u2019s leg wouldn\u2019t budge to admit him.  Buddy looked morosely up at Peter.  \u201cGo on, Buddy.  Sniff around, make yourself at home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Buddy, home was being at the side of his charge, home was being useful and dependable.  He laid down under Peter\u2019s seat.  A few moments later, however, Peter rose and Buddy was forced to get out of the way of the chair legs.  \u201cGo on Buddy,\u201d said Peter, pushing him out the door with open palms.  \u201cDon\u2019t be a pest.\u201d  The door shut and Buddy was left outside.  \u2018A pest\u2026?\u2019  he thought and he ears lowered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuddy sniffed at the bottom of some of the doors, instinct prevailing in his idleness.  \u2018Is this what pets do?\u2019 he wondered, \u2018wander around aimlessly sniffing until they find something interesting enough to hold their minds for half a minute?\u2019  He had never considered himself to be a \u201cpet,\u201d he was an assistant dog, the best of the best.  More than half of his comrades were thrown out during selection at the Seeing Eye when he was but four months old.  He was supposed to be better than this\u2026 And he was supposed to keep his owner from dying also.  Below the door behind which came the music like a busy construction yard came the scent of make-up, incense and cigarettes.  It was the first room he had smelled those filthy tar sticks in and he wondered if she were doing something she oughtn\u2019t.  Buddy scratched the door almost experimentally.  He immediately heard fumbling on the other side and the closing of a window.  \u201cI\u2019m trying to listen to The Wake! God!\u201d  The music suddenly became much louder and of course, Buddy had no words to say to her so he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow going down the stairs hurt worse that going up and Buddy took his time with it.  There was a time when he would have rushed down stairs like these almost at the same speed as falling (and more often than not he did), but it seemed that age was taking more than just his sight.  Downstairs, Buddy had something warm, soft and buttery jammed into his mouth before he even knew what was happening.  His first instinct was to gag, but the warm buttery lump tasted so good, it would have been a crime, so he swallowed.  \u201cSee, Mom?  He likes it.\u201d Said Lauren, wide smile almost cracking her face in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell let him have as much as he wants, we have to finish off this batch of dough, it\u2019s going to go bad.\u201d Said the plump female from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Little girl grabbed a platter of fresh, straight-from-the-oven, pastries, what were they called?  Ah croissants.  His owner had liked to put a strip of bacon and a little butter inside as a breakfast snack.  Lauren settled in front of wide, world filling screen before them.  Right now, there was a yellow rectangle with eyes and brown pants dancing with a dopey pink star in trucks.  Strange things humans find entertaining.  Lauren offered him another croissant and though all of them were slightly burned, it was still like a rich buttery heaven exploding on his tongue.  Hardly chewing, Buddy found within himself an appetite of a much younger dog, not that the pastries required much chewing, they practically dissolved in the mouth.  Giggling, Lauren passed him one after another and soon the dozen or so that had rested on the platter had utterly vanished.  She hugged him again around the shoulders while Buddy licked his chops.  \u201cMama, Buddy\u2019s so skinny, his ribs are poking.\u201d<br>\r\nThe plump female laughed, \u201cNot for long if I keep burning these croissants.  Here give him these too.\u201d  Buddy wagged his tail.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Croissants may be tasty, but they aren\u2019t very filling as Buddy found.  When the family sat down for dinner, the pale daughter practically having to be dragged down from her room by Peter,  Buddy saw an elaborate set up on the great dining room table.  Far more elaborate than Dr. Mathias\u2019s single dish recipes for himself, here there was a bowl of corn and a bowl of green beans.  There was a big bowl of mashed potatoes and a dish containing something fried and smelling of fish.  But the main course was a great platter of browned pastries that smelled of meat, cheese and potato swimming in butter and saut\u00e9ed onions.  Peter\u2019s plump mate sidled over and placed a kiss on his cheek.  \u201cHomemade pirogues for Buddy\u2019s new home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew you cared about him, Angel.\u201d Said Peter taking a seat at the head of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crosser her arms as much as her more than ample bosom allowed and said,  \u201cI care about you, honey\u2026\u201d  She looked down at the golden haired dog lying content and full of croissants in the living room, \u201cMaybe he\u2019ll grow on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe served everyone a plate and the pale girl with the long black haired made a face.  \u201cHow many times do I have to tell you, I\u2019m vegetarian.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah yeah, and vegan last week, and the week before that you ate only fish and the week before that, you wouldn\u2019t eat anything white.\u201d Said the mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t eat this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can and you will or you\u2019ll go to bed hungry.\u201d Said Peter.  \u201cAs long as you live under this roof, you\u2019re going to be a carnivore like the rest of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pale child pushed her plate away and let out a high pitched shriek, \u201cYou both don\u2019t understand me at all!\u201d  She stormed off past him and Buddy moved out of the way of an ill placed kick.  Pup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter\u2019s mate sighed and picked up the pale child\u2019s plate, but Lauren grabbed her sleeve as she moved to the sink.  \u201cMommy, let Buddy have it, I think he\u2019ll like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plump female shrugged and put the plate down on the ground.  With the odors coming down off the table, Buddy\u2019s paws practically moved of their own accord.  Despite having put away more than two dozen croissants, he easily found room for the little meat pastries, the fried fish, the potatoes and every drop of gravy.  He was finished before the cutlery began to clink on the table above.  Lying down, belly distended, Buddy relished in the sensation of fullness.  The purely animal satisfaction of having one\u2019s gut filled was a pleasing and previously forgotten experience.  \u2018Well\u2026\u2019 he thought, \u2018perhaps there are some perks to being a lazy, do-nothing pet.\u2019  He belched and crawled under the table where greasy little fingers would often hand him a tidbit that kept his mouth and mind occupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night Buddy curled into his dog bed while the heavyset female snored in the great bed behind him.  His food stuffed belly weighed heavily on him, however, and he slept more soundly that he had since the terrible day he had let his master down.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Walking down the stairs Buddy reminisced over the past week he didn't really notice the soft orb currently protruding from him but he did not really care about it either as it did not get in the way of his day to day adventures which included sleeping, eating, playing, going to the bathroom, eating, sleeping, eating eating eating ect. But Buddy didn't care unfortunately he had gone completely blind in his left eye. His eye was as useful as his masters vision which to Buddy was at the back of his mind at the moment because today was his birthday!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Buddy got to the bottom of the stairs he could smell his gifts and it was sugary he walked down the hall into the kitchen and saw it a large vanilla chocolate free CAKE! And to his left his bowl was overflowing with high calorie dog food, the whole family was there HAPPY BIRTHDAY BUDDY! Lauren rubbed the spoiled dogs belly and said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hope you enjoy it\" <br>\r\n\"woohoo you bet i will\" said Buddy to himself <br>\r\nAnd at that moment the chubby puppy dug in stuffing his face with the very fattening cake its was filled with peanut butter as well!<br>\r\nBURP!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuddy now done with his cake got and realized his previously chubby round belly was now the size of a beach ball \"if beach balls were jiggly and covered in Labrador hair\".

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The living room, floor of polished wood, scuffed in places where Lauren habitually forgets to removes the little wheels from her shoes, it\u2019s massive flat picture box a monolithic alter to entertainment and commercialism around which all the rest of the furniture in the room is arranged, save an ancient grandfather clock which didn\u2019t tick and a mantle above a bricked-up fireplace filled with pictures of the family, even a new one containing a golden haired dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Blink*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the living room was an incoherent mass of brown with black smudges in front of him vaguely where the leather sofas were an instant earlier.  Buddy squinted with his left eye, but matter how hard he crunched the lens nor how he cocked his head, his bad eye no longer gave him anything but a senseless mass of color; he couldn\u2019t even distinguish floor from wall from ceiling, all lines and borders were obliterated and out of focus.  He reopened his right eye and rose unsteadily to his four paws.  The rapid deterioration of the vision in his left eye over the last month still left him with frequent vertigo; often the only way to get around was to keep his left eye shut, but that was tiresome and he often forgot.  At least he wasn\u2019t tripping over his paws anymore\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all his troubles with his sight however, Buddy couldn\u2019t complain about his family.  Peter and Lauren were just as ready to love and accept him into their fold as his old owner.  Their hugs and constant pets were reassuring and Lauren\u2019s youthful energy, so different from Dr. Mathias\u2019, was infectious so that when she occasionally was able to provoke him into a game of chase, he felt like a spry pup again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wife, who Buddy had since learned was called Marian, never warmed up to Buddy in the same way.  The diligent cook of the family who tolerated Buddy\u2019s presence but never went out of the way to cuddle or comfort him was oddly the human around whom Buddy spent most of his time.  Both the sweet girl-child and her taller, spiteful sibling disappeared in the mornings with their father and did not return until late in the afternoon most days.  Often  Buddy had to find a warm spot near the stove to keep the chill out of his bones, but not so near that he was in Marian\u2019s way for while she did not aim kicks at the golden dog, she did not care to alter the step of her thick and somewhat clumsy feet to his presence either.  Of the pale child who wore nothing but black\u2026 Buddy hardly spared a thought and just kept out of her way; she hardly spent anytime down stairs anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuddy yawned and stretched, while the first few days had been like a nice vacation, his constant idleness was hard to cope with sometimes and he often resorted to patrols of the house to stave off boredom.  He stalked off from the kitchen where Marian was preparing a sandwich for herself (the second today, really it was no mystery why the woman was as big as her husband and offspring combined) his long golden coat freshly restored with his regained appetite swishing about him.  His luscious coat wasn\u2019t the only thing new about him, he had regained all the weight he had lost and then some on his rich diet.  Peter saw to it that he had hearty portions of kibble twice a day, but always during dinner, Lauren would sneak him not only tidbits from the table, but  often over large quantities of leftovers after the rest of the family had left the table.  At first, Buddy was only too happy to take this childish show of affection, especially since Peter had bought him an inferior and rather tasteless variety of dry dog food, but now that his belly had softened and his chest thickened, Buddy thought he would have to start turning away some of the girl\u2019s offerings.  \u201cPerhaps tomorrow\u2026\u201d Pondered the sleek golden dog as he padded his way slowly up the long set of stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe arrived in Lauren\u2019s room , pushing the door open with his nose and sniffed a bit.  Fabric softener was still strong since the last wash of the bedding with an underlay of juvenile feminine sweat from when Lauren would come home and throw herself into bed after soccer practice.  There was some dust, more than downstairs since Marian did not particularly care to climb the stairs save to go to bed and also the stale odor of an old punch stain near the bed.  His nose told Buddy most everything he needed to know about the room as he explored, though he still swiveled his head around, giving his right eye a chance to take in the mundane visuals.  In this room, however, there was almost no need for his good eye as the overriding color of the interior was pink.  Pink walls, pink bed, pink pillows and stuffed animals, even the little television was pink and lots of pens with pink fluffy bits attached to the ends littered the little desk; surprising, the floor was not pink, but the same beige as the rest of the house.  Buddy gave the best post and experimental lick where he smelled Lauren\u2019s hand grease  and then settled down on the rug for his second nap of the day.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Though cars often passed in front of the great house during the day, Peter\u2019s SUV that he used to pick up and drop the girls off was distinctive and the golden dog knew immediately when they started to pull into the drive.  This was a good thing since it took Buddy a while to get down the stairs.  He had to go at it at an angle, letting his rear legs keep up with the fore, otherwise the twisting and the angle of descent pained him in both shoulders and hip; it was hard getting old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange, when he came at last to the landing on the first floor, his nose crossed a path of Marian\u2019s scent heading out the door.  It was a lingering trace only, which meant that Marian had left something after Buddy had gone to sleep.  It didn\u2019t weigh on his mind more than a curiosity, however, he was far more concerned with the coming of Peter and Lauren.  The young girl burst through the front door first, bringing a veritable explosion of youthful energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Friday!\u201d  She squealed and threw her arms around Buddy.  The golden folded his right leg and dropped onto his side, raising a rear leg so Lauren could rub his stomach; no longer gaunt, but now pleasantly plump and healthy pink where the fur was scant.  Peter walked in carrying his briefcase and coat in one arm.  He left his hat and coat on the nearby rack and found time to give Buddy a quick rub with his foot once he had taken his shoes off.  The pale girl in black who wore her usual scowl mixed with an expression of extreme boredom trudged her way into the anteroom and threw her backpack around the post of the stairs where Buddy knew that Peter would have to take it off and deliver it to her room later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned against the wall, arms crossed, \u201cDad, I need some money, I\u2019m going out with Althaia tonight.\u201d Her tone, for once, was reasonably civil; just like every other time she wanted something from one or both of her parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo dear,\u201d  said Peter calmly, \u201cWere staying home.  Your mother said she has a surprise for us and a special dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 My\u2026 God\u2026\u201d  said the girl, dropped her tones like dead lead weights, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be part of your suburban, materialistic family, Peter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter grew red in the face at the sound of his name from the child,  \u201cYou will not talk to me like that in MY house, Jillian Turner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Jinx!\u201d screamed the girl so that her flat black hair swung wildly about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo to your room this instant and don\u2019t come down until your mother comes home!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left in a huff and without another word; altogether it wasn\u2019t the loudest or most intense outburst Buddy had seen and he had only been living there for a few weeks.  \u2018Peter should think of something else to do with her.\u2019 Buddy thought, \u2019I think she likes it up there in her room.\u2019  But it was hard to dwell, when one\u2019s stomach was being rubbed so generously that one\u2019s leg starts to kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuddy thought things were going to settle down, that is until Marian arrived.  She came in huffing slightly from the incline up the driveway and instantly, Buddy\u2019s nerves were on alert: he smelled another dog.  A lot of information was contained in a dog\u2019s unique scent, and before Buddy even rose, he knew that there was something off about this dog.  One\u2019s scent is affected by one\u2019s diet and this dog had an oily flair and also it was a little sickly like it didn\u2019t get out often.  It was male, but he was neutered, like Buddy himself, so the smell didn\u2019t inflame his natural territorialness.  Marian came in and announced, \u201cSurprise!\u201d  as she put down the oddest looking dog Buddy had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis coat was all over black except for a few tufts of white hair on his chest and his ears were enourmos and stood up, rounded like those on a rat.  He had no nose to speak of, almost like a human and he hissed when he breathed.  But far and away his most noticeable trait was his protruding gut, bald like a hill at the top and exposing his pink skin and such a size that it looked like the small dog had swallowed a cantelope.  He easily the fattest dog he had ever seen, there was no space at all behind his forepaws when he sat, which he did immediately after being placed on the ground.  Quite round, he was wider at the middle than at either his hips or shoulders and Buddy wondered if those little legs could lift the dog at all.  He cocked his head and his initial confusion at the sight disrupted his usual greeting sniffs; the little dog did not seem inclined to move over and greet Buddy either, though for probably much different reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter came down the stairs and haulted in a similar mannar as Buddy,  \u201c\u2026Wow, that a\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrench Bulldog!  His name is Lew\u00eds.  Isn\u2019t he adorable?\u201d  Marian reached down and grabbed the preening black dog and squeezed him around the middle, not unlike a stuffed toy;  however, in that moment, Buddy felt a hot spur of jealousy that this fat blob of a dog had earned Marian\u2019s affection in a way that he had so far been unable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but when\u2026 where\u2026?\u201d  Peter\u2019s words were failing him in view of his mate\u2019s enthusiasm and Buddy took comfort in the fact that his master did not seem automatically seduced by the pudge dog.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarian set Lew\u00eds down on the floor again and this time the little dog managed to todder off a few steps so as to be out of arm\u2019s reach before planting his relatively enormous rear.  Buddy walked over to the black dog as Marian finally took stock of her husband\u2019s expression and said, \u201cI just brought him over from Julian\u2019s to visit.  Don\u2019t you like him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter struggled to escape from her trap.  \u201cWell he\u2019s nice, but I\u2019m just wondering why\u2026\u201d  Buddy greeted the bulldog with a quick sniff (stronger evidence of a diet over-rich in fat now and little if any exercise), while Peter spoke quickly and more than a little frantically, waving his arms sometimes at Marian\u2019s looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black dog turned his rump around the other way and said in their own tongue.  \u201cWell excuse me!  I think you\u2019ve got me at the disadvantage here.\u201d  Lew\u00eds warned him off with his little, and much worn, teeth.  Buddy back off a step, he thought he knew the source of the bulldog\u2019s agitation, it must be difficult when one was not only so much smaller but also so fat that one could not get away very easily from a potential aggressor.  He felt pity for Lew\u00eds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I was just sniffing.  Do you want to come over and smell me first?\u201d  A calm disposition was key in a guide dog and Buddy prided himself on it; he\u2019d had nothing but friends back in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, but it\u2019s rather too much trouble, how about we just talk; You have a name Fido?\u201d  asked Lew\u00eds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, this dog struck him as a very strange sort, why would he bother with the silly titles humans gave their dogs?  Most canines he knew simply identified each other by sight.  \u201cMy family calls me Buddy.\u201d  Vaguely he was aware of Marian saying, \u201cWell, you have your dog and I can have mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d said the little round black dog.  He shuffled his hindquarters on the floor and moved his front feet over the swell of his belly; he sat on his right thigh, left splayed out awkwardly to accommodate his girth.  Buddy didn\u2019t think his posture looked comfortable at all.  \u201cWell, I suppose I\u2019m glad to meet you\u2026 Buddy.\u201d  He said his human given name with distaste, but Buddy couldn\u2019t care, it was a meaningless title at its root, not who he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuddy laid down facing the blobish dog to meet better on eye level.  The adults were beginning to raise their voices and Lauren retreated upstairs.  There was silence, which wasn\u2019t a very accurate description since dog spoke mostly in body language, and Buddy\u2019s curiosity finally overwhelmed him.  \u201cI\u2019m very sorry that your family has made you so fat; have you tried eating less?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bulldog\u2019s rear leg waggled in the air and it took a moment for Buddy to realize that he was trying to scratch his ear.  \u201cOh I would never do such a thing.  My owner likes me as you see me, in fact, I try extra hard at meals to get down everything they give me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Buddy was really sent for a loop, and also more than a little disgusted, \u201cYou let yourself get that fat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaturally, Humans love fat dogs\u201d said the ridiculously obese bulldog, \u201cI\u2019m the favorite because, I put aside such notions as \u2018fitness\u2019 as the most important virtues.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey do?\u201d asked Buddy<br>\r\n  Lew\u00eds nodded, \u201cHumans want something soft and squishy to hug at the end of the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut don\u2019t you miss getting around?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response the French Bulldog rose and waddled a few steps, great belly swaying like a cow\u2019s.  \u201cI manage, besides, running\u2019s overrated anyways.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuddy was about to inquire more about this strange concept, but then Marian shouted, \u201c\u2026Well you can just make your own dinner then too!\u201d  She stomped over and picked up the bulging black dog who could hardly move a step away from her wrath before she was on him and stormed out the door.  Peter hung his head in his palms and Buddy walked over to lick his face, but Peter pushed him away.  That night, when Lauren had finished giving him his secret snack, he nipped on the hem of her skirt until she gave him more.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Peter and Marian had finished having their heated discussion, so Buddy decided to approach Peter.  Buddy had considered how he would get Peter to give him what he wanted and went over to his bowl and nudged it.  After nudging the bowl a few times, Buddy got Peter's attention.  Peter looked at the clock, remembered that he hadn't fed Buddy, and proceeded to fill Buddy's not-small bowl to the brim.  Buddy found that devouring the bowl was easy for him, so he started nudging his bowl again.  Marian finally got annoyed and asked Peter to see what his dog wanted.<br>\r\n   Peter told Marian that he had already fed Buddy.  In response, Marian said that Buddy must be hungry, and a little food wouldn't kill Buddy.  Peter relented and filled the bowl again.  Devouring the food was not so easy for Buddy on this go round.  Buddy managed to finish the bowl, however, and wandered off to take a nap.<br>\r\n   When Buddy awoke, it was to the sound of china clattering on a hardwood table.  Buddy knew that sound anywhere.  The masters were having dinner.  Buddy heaved himself up, feeling still half-full, and plodded over to the table and gingerly sat down next to Lauren and Peter.  When the humans had served dinner, Buddy put his head on Lauren's lap.  Lauren looked down, got the message, and quietly hamded buddy a good portion of her plate.  Peter, who was oblivious to this, called Buddy over with food too.  Unfortunately, Lewis seemed to be having no such luck with Marian.  <br>\r\n   Later, Peter decided to keep Buddy's food bowl constantly filled.

He felt it for a a few paces before it stopped; but a few paces later, the feeling returned.  Max endured the pain until he got home before he flopped on the ground.  Max's owner was a single lady of about 50, who was a fitness buff and as in shape as possible.  But Mable was a sweet lady, who cared dearly for Max and pretty much let him have his way.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mable free-fed Max, whom she noticed only ate what he wanted and was otherwise a healthy weight.

Max would lie down restlessly until he discovered something he could do with his time and energy: go to his food bowl.  At first, a whole bowl would last Max throughout the day; but as he became accustomed to the size of the bowl, it would only take him three-quarters of a day; and finally half a day.  Eventually, Max could eat his whole bowl of dog food with gusto at breakfast and dinner.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before Max had discovered his hip dysplasia, he had been a thin, rather well-muscled dog with his ribs nearly-visible; but in the course of a month, the time it took Max to accustom himself to his new bowl, he had lost that defined muscle tone, and had gained a thicker coating of fat over his ribs.  He wasn't overweight by a normal German Shepherd's standards, but he was approaching being slightly overweight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Max had first finished his whole bowl of food in one sitting, Mable had pitied him and refilled his bowl, which Max had at first sniffed at, but then left alone.  But Max ate it in the morning, and Mable filled his bowl again, knowing that Max would regulate himself as he saw fit.  At first, Max had eaten a bite out of the bowl and went to lie down for a nap; but the smell of food kept having Max return to it and eat it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eventually, Max found that there was no food left; but Max was fine with that because he felt too full to eat more.

The father, Sam, was a thin man of average height. He worked in an office, but wanted to spend more time at hime with his family, so he decided to set up his own home business one month ago. The mother, Katie, a petite, but quite plump woman, was talking to her children in the back. She loved her family more than anything in the world, and felt that there was room for one more: More specifically, a dog. In the back seat, their two children, eight year old Jack and six year old Sophie, were both well behaved and happy children, who wanted to have a dog to play with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got out of the car, and walked into the shelter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" said Katie, who was holding the door open for her kids as they walked in, \"we're looking to adopt a pet dog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine,\" replied the slightly bored looking assistant, who looked up from the paperwork on her desk. \"Follow me,\" and she held open the door behind her desk, to the animal cages, and lead them through. She gestured to the cage closest to the door, and Jack and Sophie peered through the glass hatch into the cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the cage, was a tired looking white Labrador, called Ben, according to the sign on the cage. His fur was short, and looked slightly dirty, but he looked at incredibly peaceful as he lay curled in the corner. Suddenly, the ears perked up, and his eyes opened, and the  dog stood up, reveling something about himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was deplorably scrawny and thin. His stomach and waist curved up sharply behind his exposed ribs There was not an ounce of fat on him. Ben then walked up to the glass window, peering out at the two human children before him. 'Please take me with you,' he implored the two children, but all they could here was a low whine. It still did the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww,\" they said together, and looked up to their Mum. \"Can we get Ben please Mummy,\" asked Sophie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see sweetie,\" she replied, and turned to the assistant. \"Can we please have a better look at this dog?\" she asked her, and the assistant opened the hatch, letting th Labrador out. He jumped out of the cage onto the floor with a small clatter, as his paws hit the tiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll leave you alone for a while,\" said the assistant, who went back into the office. Ben sat on his skinny haunches, tail wagging, looking expectantly at the family. Sam ran a hand down Ben's side, and the dog instantly relaxed, nuzzling up against the mans leg. The two children started to stroke at his sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's really skinny Mummy,\" remarked Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but we can sort that out,\" replied Katie, who bent down to cup the Lab's muzzle. \"You're such a sweet little boy, aren't you?\" she said in a baby-voice to the dog, and Ben replied by giving her cheek a small lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know who we're taking, don't you kids?\" said Sam, and his children nodded. \"Miss!\" he called out to the assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout ten minutes later, Ben was theirs! They were riding back to the family's house in the car, and Ben was remarkably calm, as he lay sprawled accross the two children in the back seat, who were petting him half to death. As Ben lay there, he was thinking of how good his new life was going to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey pulled into the drive of their house. It was a normal sized, 3 bedroom yellow-brick house, with a large garden. They walked into the house, and removed their shoes, still stroking their new dog. Ben was looking around at his new home. There was carpet, which eased the strain on his tired paws, used to harsh concrete. And heating, meaning he would no longer be shivering as the nights colsed in. There was plush furniture and the entire house looked incredibly homely. It was luxurious, it was comfortable, and Ben loved it already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Ben,\" said Katie, walking into a room off of the hallway, the Kitchen. There, she put down a rather large amount of food for him in a shiny, silver bowl. Ben padded towards it over the linoleum floor, gave it a small sniff, and looked up at her, curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on Ben, dig in. We're going to make you healthy again!\" and with that, he dug in with gusto into his first proper meal in over a year, as the shelter never had enough food to feed him enough. As he ate, Be could feel his stomach growing fuller and tighter, not used tot his level of filling, but the Labrador cleaned the bowl of it's meaty goodness. After eating his fill, he lay down on his side, allowing his new master to stroke him. He relaxed in the bliss of having his belly eased and massaged, and dozed into a nap, happy for the first time in months.</span></div></div>",

He had been na\u00efve when he had immediately trusted his previous owner.  Such thoughts made him shudder hungrily.  His previous owner and even the animal \"shelter\" had failed miserably to feed Ben properly.  These factors, combined with his breed's appreciation of food and its availability thanks to his new mistress had led Ben to use food as a crutch to cope with his struggles.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a few days since Ben had been adopted.  Ben quickly learned that Katie was a complete pushover towards him whenever she cooked or ate, so she tended to give him food from her plate.  She also fed him as much dog-food as he requested; he merely had to whine for a couple of minutes and flip his bowl; and his master or mistress would fill his not small bowl to its brim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had to start slowly at first; but even now, he noted an ever-increasing capacity in his stomach to hold food.  Ben also got little exercise.  His house had its own yard, Katie and Sam were too lazy and busy respectively to walk him and the children were too young to walk him outside by themselves.  Thus, coupled with Ben's last few months of sedentary activity in the shelter, he was really quite happy to lie around and have his family rub his body all over.  Katie still fussed over him that he was too thin and vowed to change that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat promise came to a head at the end of that week.  On Fridays, it was the family's custom to get a meal out.  That night, because Jack said that he was feeling ill, Sam went out and got Wendy's.  Ben overheard his own name mentioned in the order, although he had no idea what a, \"Triple Cheeseburger with Bacon and a Side of Large Fries,\" was, it sounded curious.  Ben patiently waited for Sam to return, a wait which seemed eternal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Sam returned with a greasy bag of food which smelled ethereal to Ben.  As he unloaded the bag, Sam unwrapped a large, greasy thing which seemed to be he pinnacle of the ethereal smell.  After he had given everyone else his food, Sam picked up the greasy delight and placed it in Ben's bowl, where Ben made quick work of it and the other greasy strings which tasted good, but not as good as the pinnacle of other-worldly delights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis trend would set a trend that would continue every Friday, to Ben's delight.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Six months passed.  Ben grew not only more trusting and tranquil, but also more massive.  Ben had gone from a messy pile of practically skin-and-bones, to having a well-contoured, hour-glass-shaped body, to having increasing less defined ribs, to being almost rectangular in those six months.  This thicker fat made lying on his side more comfortable for Ben as well as lying down generally.  Ben's fourth \"birthday\" also passed, giving Ben's family an excuse to give him a small pepperoni pizza of his own and a generous slice of cheesecake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days after his birthday, on a day when even the kids were home, after his breakfast, which had increased from three-quarters of a bowl to three bowls of food on average, Katie awoke Ben from his dozing with his leash, a sign Ben took for a walk.  His gullibility was rewarded, however, with a trip to the Vet.  Ben, being a socialite animal, enjoyed the Vet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ben approached the car, and after Katie had unlocked and opened it, Ben attempted to jump in.  He jumped with a huff and got his front legs in the car; but when Ben tried to get his back legs in, he found that he couldn't.  Katie, being slightly concerned but thinking nothing of this event, pushed Ben into the car.  When Ben had mounted in it previously, it had been from a lower side-door, not from the way-back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive was uneventful; and when they arrived, Ben hopped down with his usual grace a little more slowly than he would have liked.  The smell of animals was overwhelming and exhilarating for Ben, who would have loved to meet all of the animals; but this place also brought up the sad memories of his days at the Shelter.  As he walked into the reception area, he noticed many dogs; but one in particular caught his eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a massive German Shepherd.  He stood two or three inches taller than Ben; but aside from being taller, he was substantially heavier.  While Ben's abdomen made a small fold of fat outward when he sat, this dog's made large deposits bulging away from his body, which hung to the floor and rested upon it.  When Katie had finished, she walked over towards the great German Shepherd and began to talk to his owner; but not before giving him a brief moment of attention, calling this dog Luke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the older woman asked how Ben was doing, Katie replied that he was fine.  After hearing Ben's name, the regal German Shepherd spoke first, \"So, this woman is your mistress?\"  He inquired, cocking his head slightly towards Katie.  When Ben wagged his tail, Luke continued, \"Good, sorry that I haven't given you my usual honors, but my knees aren't feeling too good today.  It's hurts a bit to stand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen understood sympathetically.  And responded, \"So how long have you been with your mistress?\"  Luke wagged his tail and chuckled, \"I've been with Lady Helen for six happy years.  She's taken exemplar care of me and fed me well.  I take it that your mistress feeds you and cares for you well?\"  Ben nodded, so Luke continued. \"Excellent\u2026\" but he trailed off as he smelled something.  Then, Ben knew what he smelled: treats, specifically hot dogs.  There was no one else in the reception area, so Helen handed Luke a whole hot dog and handed Ben one for good measure.  Katie chuckled, \"You love to spoil your dog, don'f you, Mom?\"  Helen chuckled and nodded and fed both dogs another hot dog for good measure.  When Luke pleaded, Helen emptied her pockets, which made Luke tilt his head in surprise.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a nurse appeared and called Luke's name; and Helen stood.  And slowly, Luke pulled his front legs under him; and after scrambling for a few seconds, he managed to do the same with his hindquarters and slowly pushed himself off the ground, panting from the exertion.  Ben noticed none of these things except the grandeur of Luke's standing physique.  Even when he stood, Luke's flanks and abdomen bulged outward with fat.  As Luke waddled slowly away, Ben watched Luke's graceful and serene body sway.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough came Ben's turn to visit the Vet.  He was a middle-aged man, maybe as old as Helen.  He saw Ben and inwardly grimaced at another fat dog but outwardly showed no displeasure.  He knew that he would be called a hypocrite if he told this woman outright that her dog was fat, not to mention that he hated hurting someone's feelings.  Thus, he told this woman that her dog was healthy and had her go on her way.  At least this dog hadn't been nearly as fat as the last, which had been a struggle for both he and a nurse to get on an examining table.  Not even then had he told someone that her dog was fat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ben trundled home, Katie had an idea, \"Ben,\" she cooed, \"Do you wanna\u2026\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ben, do you wanna go to Granny Helen's house and play with Luke?\" Katie cooed.  Ben didn't exactly feel like playing, he was too old and dignified for that; but he did remember the woman who had fed him hot dogs at the vet's office and wagged his tail.  Ben had no idea that his family was going on vacation, but the moment Susan left, he missed them.  Luckily, Luke and Helen were pleasant company. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke had at first been skeptical when Ben arrived because he thought that he would be given less food than he liked; but in reality, Helen gave food more freely than she would otherwise have, Luke noted, at his first meal with Ben.  Both dogs were given a large plate of leftovers each, as well as free-ranged kibble.  On the morning of the second day, however, Ben heard Luke scratching and whining for Helen from the kitchen.  Helen was already in the kitchen; and when Ben walked in sleepily, Luke met him with a challenge, \"Hey, Ben, I bet you can't eat as much as I can.\"  Ben was intrigued but sleepy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Helen walked over, picked up Luke's bowl, filled it, and set it down in front of him; and she did the same with Ben's.  Ben ate and ate; and when he had finished, he looked up and heard Luke whine to Helen for more food.  Ben walked over and sat expectantly.  Overcome with the dogs' entreatment, she filled their bowls again.  This time, to Luke's disdain, she filled Ben's first.  This happened until Ben finished his fourth bowl, which had made him mildly uncomfortably full.  Luke, however, appeared to be unaffected.  After half of his fifth bowl, Ben slowly backed away; and Luke devoured it quickly.  Luke continued like this until his sixth bowl, after which he was forced to admit that he was finished.  And although Helen filled both of their bowls again, neither dog touched his food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, while the two dogs took a nap to digest such a meal, they smelled and heard the sizzling of a juice that came only from a sausage.  Luke seemed to have noticed this too because he blearily lifted his head and body up  and wandered slowly to the kitchen, following Ben, who sat expectantly at the stove.  There, Helen did not disappoint either him or Luke.  Muriel cooked more sausages than a single woman, or person would eat in a single meal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their breakfasts digested somewhat, there was room for the sausages which Helen seemed to enjoy giving to her dogs.  Helen even poured the sausage grease over the kibble the dogs had left untouched that morning, which helped  the dogs devour another bowl each.  Soon they went back to napping.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he awoke, Luke was still asleep next to him.  Muriel was sitting on her couch watching television.  Ben felt sated, but not full.  Ben rolled over as quietly as a lab can, but Luke still noticed and awoke.  A piercing gurgling came from Luke's stomach, so both dogs deemed that it was time to eat again.  Each dog found a nice pile of assorted meats in his bowl, which each wolfed down quickly and started scratching at the floor around their bowls.  Helen obliged the two dogs and filled their bowls once.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when the dogs whined again, Helen went to her fridge instead of the food-bag.  When she closed the freezer came a delightful scent: peanut-butter and ground-beef balls.  The dogs both ate ball after ball until each and every ball was gone.  Suddenly, Ben realized that he needed to go outside; so Helen let him out.  Luke plodded out down the stairs after him.  \"H-hey, w-wait up,\" Luke huffed after going down just three steps, lying down after doing his business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when it was time to go back inside, Ben was hit with his first sense that something was off with Luke.  If going down the stairs was tiring, going up the stairs would be very difficult at best.  And it was for Luke.  First, Luke managed to heave his front paws up onto the first step, then feel with his hind leg for the first step while he probed for the second step.  It was an excruciating process, but Luke finally managed to reach the top of the stairs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke slumped down in front of his bowl and panted, with his rolls of fat jiggling as he did so.  At this point, Ben breached a sensitive question. \"Are you ok, Luke?\"  Luke turned his head slowly to look at Ben.  \"Yeah, just tired.  I guess I'm starting to get a bit old, huh?\" the obese German Shepherd panted as he struggled to control his breath.  Ben decided not to press the issue any more that day.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, Luke was breathing normally  and beating his bowl with his nose.  Ben was concerned, \"Do you really need any more food today?\"  Luke looked at Ben with a look of pure disbelief and disgust, \"What are you saying?  Is this about earlier?  I told you; I'm fine.  I appreciate your concern, however.\"  Ben nodded, a little more appeased; and happily ate all the food he was provided.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week passed.  And at the end of the week, Ben noticed that the pads of fat on his sides were heavier and fuller.  Although his stomach didn't bulge outward when he stood, he knew that he was closer to that landmark.  Luke could now fit another bowl of food, and Ben another one and a half.  However, shortly before Katie came, something else happened with Luke.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Luke tried to stand up on the kitchen's tile floor, he scrambled up onto his front legs; but when he tried to heave his hind legs under him, he couldn't, which left him stuck until he finally managed to get his legs under himself and heave himself up.  Luckily, Ben or Helen hadn't been around to see him.  As Ben left, he looked at Luke and thought that\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ben decided that he wanted to be like Luke.  After saying enthusiastic greetings to his masters and mistresses, he sauntered over to his food bowl and started nosing it.  Sam, who was sitting at the kitchen table looking over stock prices, heard the gentle scraping of Ben's bowl acrops the floor; so he filled Sam's bowl with kibble.  A few minutes later, Sam heard the Sam noise and reluctantly filled Ben's bowl again.  At the third time that he heard the bowl, Sam tried to ignore the scraping; but he couldn't.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for Ben, Katie walked into the kitchen, noticed Ben's actions, and filled his bowl again.  Sam was concerned, \"Katie, do you think maybe that Ben looks a little\u2026thick-skinned?\"  Sam was a soft-spoken, but assertive man, who had few demands.  But Katie was stubborn and saw no issue with Ben's health and size; so she replied, \"No, why do you say that?\"  Sam realized that he was trapped.  If he responded, his response would trigger an argument; but if he didn't, Katie would demand to know what he thought until he told her what he had been thinking.  However, he tactfully responded, \"I was just wondering.  Perhaps he's just a big dog.\"  Katie nodded, a bit disconcerted; and absent-mindedly filled Ben's bowl again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had his bowl filled a few more times before he went off to take his morning nap.  When he awoke, however, he recognized the smell of those peanut-butter, ground-beef balls which Helen had made.  Ben stood and wandered into the kitchen.  \"Hey boy,\" Katie cooed in her irritating fashion, \"Do you want something to eat?\"  At the word, \"eat,\" Ben began to wag his tail.  Seeing Ben's reaction, Katie handed him a \"Satin Ball.\"  Katie had made a large batch of these treats and fed them very liberally to Ben.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week passed, one day, however, while Ben was in his mid-morning nap, he heard Sam's voice call his name.  Groggily, Ben rose and trotted over.  Ben was holding Sam's leash, \"Wanna go to Helen's house to see Luke, Ben?\"  Ben wagged his tail happily.  He would love to see Luke again.  Although he hadn't gained much weight, he had some news for Luke.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived at Helen's house, Ben told Luke of Katie's satin-balls, which made both mouths water.  It soon became a tradition to take Ben to Helen's house to play with Luke.  A year would soon come since Ben was adopted, a celebration which entailed copious treats and nearly-unlimited food.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, Ben now had flanks which bulged outward even when he stood.  However, Luke's health seemed to decay slowly.  When Luke stood, his joints seemed to ache more after less time.  Fortuneately, Helen gave Luke a satin-ball with a pill which relieved Luke's pain for a while.  Then, as Luke tried to climb the stairs in Helen's back yard, he felt a smooth, pointed edge pressing into his abdomen when he tried to put his frony paws on the second stair.  Then, one day, as Luke groped with his foot for the stair underneath him, he took an longer time than he usually did; and his knee buckled, causing the wind to be knocked out of him.  He finally managed to climb the stairs breathless.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke never seemed to realize the connection between his weight and his ailments, so he turned to food for comfort.  This culminated one day when Luke couldn't heave his body up the stairs to his house.  No matter what he tried, he couldn't push his weight with two legs up the stairs.  Eventually, Helen took pity and helped him up the stairs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had also begun to notice a slight resistance from his joints when tried to stand up or walk; running had become a almost impossible for him.  Sam was now very worried about Ben's weight, but still said nothing because he feared the wrath of Katie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen watched as Helen helped Luke up the three stairs to her kitchen.  Sam raised his eyebrows inquisitively at the dog too big to walk up the stairs.  \"Helen, do you ever wonder whether Luke is a bit too\u2026 big?\" Sam questioned.  Helen looked puzzled at his question before she responded, \"I'm afraid he has doggy-arthritis.  It hurts his joints to move around a lot.\"  Sam was unconvinced if the order of thise two events, but accepted her word.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke was stuck.  He wanted to stand, but found that his legs wouldn't support him for more than a few steps before they gave out.  Helen had called Luke from the kitchen, Luke had barely made his way acroos the room.  Luke started whining and barking because he couldn't get up.  Helen heard him and came into the living room, where Luke was.  She beckoned for him to come; so Luke rose, hobbled a few steps, and collapsed, out of breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, Luke?\" Luke whined again.  Helen\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Helen had dealt with dogs who couldn't walk before, even big ones.  She got a towel and threaded it aptly underneath Luke, who now had his pride thoroughly wounded.  In a concerted effort, Luke managed to stay on his feet all the way to the kitchen.  As he walked, Luke noticed that his joints didn't hurt as badly when he had Helen's support.  Then, a thought that he would never be able to shake crept into his mind: his weight was causing his maladies.  Luke chuckled at the thought and dismissed it.  He just needed to acclimate his body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his nap, Luke tried to stand again.  He ignored the burning in his knees and kept standing.  Finally, when his muscles felt numb, his body actually collapsed, which surprised and knocked the wind out of Luke, who lay panting, exhausted for a few minutes before he tried again.  Although it was imperceptible to Luke, he managed to stay standing for a little longer each time he stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen awoke with a snort, panting for breath.  He felt like he had been choking before he was snapped awake.  He tried to go back to sleep, but experienced the same problem just after dawn.  Ben panicked; what was causing this.  Ben had no idea what sleep apnea was or how obesity exacerbated this condition, but he knew it wasn't normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen awoke with a start, gasping for breath.  Sam, who was sitting next to Ben, snapped at the gasping next to him.  It had come from Ben, of that he was sure.  He called Katie in, \"Dear, I think something's wrong with Ben.\"  Katie looked incredulous, \"Look, Sam, if this is about Ben's weight, the Vet said that he's healthy; so let it be, Sam.\"  Sam scowled and lowered his voice, \"Tell me, Katie, is waking up from your sleep gasping normal?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie pondered this for a moment, \"Sam, you're overreacting.  He probably just sneezed or something.\"  Sam resigned and accepted Katie's argument.  He had heard Ben sneeze before, and that sound was nothing like a sneeze but choking.  Meanwhile, he looked up a dog's ideal-weight chart and compared the standard to Ben, who looked nothing like any of the pictures.  He scrolled to a more detailed chart and read the description.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got to the final score on the chart, a nine, he read the description.  First, he had Ben stand, which Sam noticed took Ben a couple of seconds.  \"Look at the waist, which should be an hour-glass.\"  Ben's waist and abdomen looked like an inverted hour-glass; the waist bulged away from his abdomen, not towards, a condition exacerbated when Ben sat down gingerly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Second,\" Ben read, \"feel his ribs.  Gently press and feel.\"  Ben's ribs were only identifiable at the very bottom of his abdomen, Sam couldn't feel them anywhere else.  Sam was astonished.  His dog was spectacularly obese.  When he mentioned this to Katie, she scoffed and responded that those standards weren't realistic and were supported by an oppressive culture.  Sam didn't much feel like talking to Katie when she talked about culture-politics and ceded the point to her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke was now reagining his mobility.  He could walk around the house without any assistance, but going up the stairs was still a hassle.  Luke didn't mind having Helen use a towel to help him use the stairs.  While Luke was in the backyard, he heard a car pull up and knew it was Ben's car.  He waddled over and started barking.  Helen immediately came out to help him inside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter greeting each other, Ben asked Luke the question pressing his mind, \"Luke, do you have trouble sleeping?  I mean, do you sometimes wake up in the middle of the night panting?\"  Luke looked at Ben questioningly and replied that he never had.  Ben then concluded that his sleeping habits had nothing to do with his weight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither dog had noted Sam's slow approach towards them.  However, now that their conversation was finished, they both noted the pieces of cheese he held in his hand.  Ben shot, or rather pushed, himself up; and Luke slowly and gingerly eased and rocked himself up.  Sam noted that Luke's stomach fat pressed against the top of his knees and swayed with each step he took.  Luke looked like a walnut to Sam as Luke waddled slowly over to Sam and sat down.  Sam immediately encouraged Luke to get up, looking displeased, the dog went through the process of standing again.  Sam held the piece of cheese in front of Luke and examined the obese German Shepherd.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke ribs were at no place identifiable.  After exerting moderate pressure at the base of Luke's abdomen, Sam found the trace of a rib.  This result astounded him.  He decided to\u2026</span></div></div>",

So Sam responded, \"Katie, and you too, Helen, I was taking a body-conditioning score of our dogs; and I found that boths dogs were obese.\"  Both Katie and Helen looked mortified.  \"Sam, this is ridiculous,\" Katie spluttered, \"Ben is not overweight; he's fine as he is.\"  Helen was too shocked to speak, and she was too angry as well.  Criticism made her more adamant in supporting something than it did to dissuade her from something.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luke is happy as he is,\" she said finally.  \"Helen,\" Sam stormed, \"he has trouble even getting up!  When will you accept that he is obese?  See reason!\"  Helen stood adamantly in silence.  \"Ben is happy as well, Sam; can't you see that?\" Katie piped up.  \"Katie, Ben has sleep apnea.  That makes him miserable.  Arthritis and sleep apnea are both exacerbated by obesity.  Why can't you see that you are killing your dogs?\"  With that, the room fell silent but for one noise: a rasping hyperventilation.  It came from one of the dogs.  Sam identified the source as Luke.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke was on the floor whimpering and hyperventilating.  Helen tried to soothe him and gave him an aspirin.  After a few minutes, the hyperventilation stopped; and Luke ceased whimpering.  Sam and his family left shortly after that.  Sam and Katie were both still furious at the other person for the ride home.  The only change that came about by the argument was Ben's gettig more treats and food from Katie and her children and less from Sam.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen found that when he slept in a certain position, on his side, that his apnea didn't bother him as badly.  It would occasionally, but not often.  Luke, however, stopped working at regaining his mobility because his heart physically ached every time he exerted himself.  Helen also gave him more treats than she previously had.  Thus, Luke quickly lost what little mobility he had.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ben visited Luke, the great German Shepherd was incapable of standing on his own and had to have a sling to support him with Helen holding the sling.  Luke knew it wasn't very dignified, but it allowed him to get outside and to his food bowl.  Many people claim to have a 200-pound German Shepherd, but Helen actually had one.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, on one Tuesday morning, Helen went to rouse Luke to feed him his breakfast.  She shook Luke, but he didn't stir.  Nothing moved but the fat that rippled.  She shook him again and held a satin-ball to his nose.  Still no reaction.  Helen grew worried; Luke had always responded to food.  She felt for a pulse.  Luke felt cold, and Helen found no heart-beat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen broke down sobbing.  She had loved Luke like a child and had spoiled him more.  She called Kaie and broke the news to Katie hyterically.  \"Mom, it's ok.  We'll bury Luke and get you a new dog,\" Katie whispered in an attempt to soothe her mother.  Helen calmed slightly and responded, \"I want\u2026\"</span></div></div>",

He had a comfortable life, all four months of it, but that wasn't on his mind. What was on his mind, was his reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a typical Irish Setter pup. He was a little over 10 inches tall, with a square muzzle, soulful brown eyes, and thin floppy ears. He was coated with short, auburn fur, and a thick tail. But his most distinctive feature was his tummy. Tommy had always been the chubby one of the five in the litter, and even when he was born he had a rotund belly.

They loved to stroke and pet his cute flab, as he spent long hours curled up on a sofa, or a bed, with one of the humans who looked after him and his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was no different. A normal Irish Setter pup of his age, should weigh about 18-20lbs, but Tommy tipped the scales at two stone in weight. His tummy had stayed the same proportions as when he was tiny, but now he was much bigger, and so was it. He was weaned off his mother's milk recently, and that allowed his owners to fill him with crunchy kibble, wet dog food and occasional table scraps, making sure that he would keep his puppy-fat and pudgy belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis red-furred belly jutted out from his flanks about two inches on either side, and it was quite spherical, hanging down beneath him. Tommy lay on his side, to get a better view of himself. The fur on his tummy was actually being separated slightly, so it was thinner, and his pink skin could be seen at close range. He put one of his forepaws to it, feeling his belly. It felt soft, and cushiony beneath him, and moved slightly as he pressed it, his paw sinking in slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, his sister Sarah, walked over to him, looking excited. She was an energetic little puppy, who was beginning to lose her 'puppy-fat', which just speeded her up even more. She looked like an average Irish Setter puppy, except she had longer ears than her brother, and of course, did not have a large belly, but rather a smooth, flat transition from ribs to stomach. Tommy looked his sister's midsection, and felt that her svelte waist was emphasising his podge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you doing, tummy?\" she asked in her chirpy voice. Because of his size, Tommy was frequently given nicknames referring to his roundness. He didn't mind them though, because he knew his belly was giving him extra petting and affection from their owners, but the others weren't jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing Sarah,\" replied Tommy. He looked at his sister for a second, scrutinising her comparative wiriness to his round belly. \"Sarah?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, is anything wrong?\" she said a little concerned. All of his brothers and sisters were very close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you, think that this,\" pointing his muzzle at his belly, \"is a little big for a dog my age?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was taken aback a little by this, but answered his question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't think it is,\" she deduced, \"but I'm probably not the right person to ask, you should ask Mummy instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what do you think?\" Tommy persisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it makes you look adorable!\" replied Sarah, smiling. \"Besides,\" she continued, leaning her head into her brothers tummy, \"it makes you so soft and huggable, like a big, furry pillow,\" and she cuddled up to him, relaxing luxuriously on his belly. She lay there for a few seconds, before she got back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel better about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks Sarah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Sarah?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah pulled close to him, and pressed a forepaw to his shiny black nose. \"You're it!\" she whispered, and she ran off giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't!\" Tommy called back playfully, and he got up, and ran after her. He moved quite quickly for a puppy of his rotundness, though his belly did mean that he ran with a gambolling gait. After a few minutes, his other litter mates joined in the game, after hearing the commotion from inside. They were all built along the same lines of Sarah, but all had slightly different features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfie, was the smallest, youngest one, with short fur, and deep green eyes, and looked more like Tommy than the others, as he was slightly chubby, with a little belly, too. But he was nowhere near as husky as Tommy. He was also sprightly, but liked to spend long hours relaxing with his owners, curled up on the sofa with Tommy, and 'their' humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDora was a mirror of Sarah, looking almost identical, and was just as playful and energetic. The only real ways to differ between the two, was that Dora had slightly longer fur on her belly, which she inherited from her dad, and was a little bit thinner than the other puppies, her waist curving up slightly, a trim and perky little pup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was the oldest of them, and was slightly bigger then all the others, by perhaps one paw width. He was also the most mature of them, but that was easy to be considering they were all still young, and he loved to play with his siblings and run around with them, but he was not always on the go, like his sisters were. He had light brown eyes, a slight belly like Alfie, and had slightly lighter fur on his paws than his litter mates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all loved each other, and their parents dearly, who loved them back just as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey played tag for a while, and Tommy was usually it, due to his belly impeding his movement slightly, slowing him down, but he was till able to catch the others.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking out with deep brown eyes, through the thin, clear panes of the sliding door was a much larger Irish Setter, the puppies' mother Lulu. At twenty seven inches in height, she was quite large for her breed, and not only in that respect. While she was pregnant with her litter, her owners and her mate had encouraged eating much larger portions at mealtimes, to allow for the extra energy required for the growth and nurture of Lulu's puppies. Rex, the father of the puppies, had also been very protective of her, rarely allowing her to overstretch herself, for he cared deeply for his mate, and would spend hours at a time by her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the increased consumption and lack of mobility had left a definite mark on her frame. During the short eight weeks, she had put on a fair amount of pudge which seemed to collect mainly around her tummy, meaning that she still looked pregnant for several weeks after giving birth. Her auburn bellyfur stretched by her expanded tummy and the rest of her body inflated to a smaller, but still noticable degree. In the weeks that followed, she was still allowed to free-feed by the family, and her waist contiued to expand with softness, as she and Rex looked after their young. She was an intensively motherly dog, always looking out for and fretting over her little ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after the puppies were weened off her milk, Lulu began to lose some of the weight she had gained. More activity in her life had allowed her stomach to shrink as the setter's fat melted slowly off her, but soonLulu was starting to slow down again. She had no real reason to lose the weight, and she was excercised by her owners at least daily, so she would have nothing to worry about from being a little heavy set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLulu sighed a little, still gazing at her offspring, and lay down on the plush carpet. She was glad that she had children, and loved them to bits, but they could be oh-so tiring, particulrly the twosome of Dora and Sarah. While they were outside, she could catch up on some rest, and the Setter closed her eyes in preparation for a good nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the door was brushed open, and the sound of heavy breathing entered the room. Lulu turner her head, still lying down, to look at the intruder. It was Rex, and her expression immediately softened. He was a lean and wiry dog, unlike his mate, but he couldn't care about her physical condition, he loved her too much to be swayed by such things. Twenty eight inches high, with strong legs and seemingly straggly fur, his appearance suggested a rough character, but Rex had a heart of gold. Caring madly for his mate and children, he was the first to suggest to her that she take it easy in her delicate state. Now, half of his day would be spent frollicking with his children, a playful soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex glided softly into the room, and lay down next to Lulu, leaning gently against her. He could feel her rounded stomach against his skinny waist. He cocked his head towards hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'See you still have some holiday weight,\" he said playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know dear, but you don't mind do you?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I mind? I'd love you however big you were,\" he replied, pushing lightly against her luxuriously soft side. \"What were you staring at?\" he inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing, I was just watching the kids. I can't believe how much they've grown already. I can still see them no bigger than your muzzle, and now look at them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's something worrying me though,\" said Lulu, her words sounding a little shaky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, is it something serious?\" replied Rex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. But, don't you think some of them are getting bigger in a different way. Look at Tommy,\" she said, staring at her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex did the same, and knew what she meant instantly from the way he was lolloping around, trying to keep up with his siblings. Tommy was chubby to say the least, bordering on downright fat. Rex stared intently at his child, the way his round tummy was moving, but also saw Tommy laughing, having fun and enjoying himself. Rex knew that his owners were overfeeding his son, but he saw no malice in them when they did, or when they rubbed his engorged stomach after a meal, stroking the puppy. He remembered how they treated his mate when she was growing rounder almost by the day, and how they made sure she was as safe as could be. He then looked at Lulu, her present, slightly heavy form a tribute to her indulgence. He smiled, and responded gently to her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, I don't know why you're worrying. Sure, Tommy's a little heavy, but so are Alfie and Matt, and they don't have any problems. You know that our owners would never do anything to hurt us or the pups,\" he said, nuzzling her softly afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, the puppies are fine, I should know that. Michael and Sally (The Mother and Father in the family that owns them) care so much about us, I don't know what I was thinking, thank you dear,\" and she licked the tip of his muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two proud parents continued to watch their children play, but Rex soon remembered why he came into the room in the first place. His eyes opened wide, and his breathing sharpened up. Lulu noticed almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rex, what's the matter?\" she inquired, panicing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I overheard Micheal and Sally earlier. They were talking about...\" he stopped for a few seconds, shivering, \" The Vet!\" he whispered to Lulu, almost distraught. He was petrified of that place, and was verging on needing sedatives last time he was taken there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh, calm down,\" said his mate softly, \"I'm sure it's just a check up.\" She nuzzled hi to try and relax her partner, but he wasn't swayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I know what it'll be. They're going to get me fixed! Just one more night...\" he was seriously fretting now, but Lulu intervened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what bad will it do? You already have five wonderful children and I love you more than the Earth and always will do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, you know. There's one thing that we'll never be able to do again after then,\" he responded. The penny dropped for Lulu, and she smirked slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if we only have one more night...\" she started, and left the sentence hanging, wriggling her hips slightly. Rex cottoned on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After the puppies are all in the land of nod, we go outside, and 'do our thing',\" she replied, rubbing her mate's side. His mood quickly changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you thank you thank you!\" he jabbered. \"I love you so much, and I want you to know it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already do, loverboy,\" she replied, \"but not a word about this until the pups are asleep,\" she finished smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just know it's going to be a checkup, but since you insist..\" and the pair left the room to round up their children for dinner before the sun started to set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner was the usual affair of kibble and some table scraps from the human meal. The canine family chatted happily as they tucked in to their food, and one in particular: Tommy. Though the puppies all ate from the same tray, the rounding dog was packing away the crunchy morsels like no tomorrow. He was tired out from all the running he had done, and had worked up an enourmous appetite, which hadn't gone unnoticed. Sarah, next to him, confronted her brother on the matter after they had finished. Tommy was relaxing infront of the living room radiator, his midsection taut, almost full to bursting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright bro?\" she asked, rather bluntly, \"you put away a lot of food there. Is there something wrong with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, just really hungry from all that chasing earlier. Need to sleep now, Sarah,\" he replied, closing his eyes, just as their mother rounded the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on little ones: Bed time!\" she called them, and, reluctantly though for seperate reasons, the two puppies followed her to the 'den' they had, of old blankets and pillows, next to the doggy-door at the back of the house, where their father had rounded up Alfie, Dora and Matt already, and was serving as a make-shift climbing frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying goodnight to all of their children, wishing them sweet dreams and nuzzling them half-to-death, the parents settled down next to the mass of fuzzy shapes that was the puppies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut soon they awoke again, or at least, Rex did. His anxiety and anticipation had been hidden by the calming effect of the meal, but he was soon back on edge. He gently nudged Lulu, coaxing her from slumber. She moaned quietly as she got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't you wait that long?\" she asked coyly, with a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-hm,\" was the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on then, big-boy, if you want it,\" and she walked out of the flap. Rex followed her eagerly into the cool, night air, and into the nearby foliage for a long night of passion and pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several hours, the pair emerged, Rex grinning mercilessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you so much, Lulu, and did I prove it?\" he whispered to her lovingly, slightly slurring his words. Lulu was still panting slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did it alright,\" she said in one puff, and she licked her lover's muzzle. \"Now lets get back inside, loverboy, before the puppies wake up and wonder where we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair returned to their sheltered beds, exhausted from their night's antics, and fell asleep quickly. Their tired minds almost devoid of thought about what was to lie ahead tomorrow for Rex, and what their night-life had done in terms of their family's growth.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rex woke to bright, sterile lights which aggravated his already splitting head.  The world was an unwelcome intrusion and he did not raise his head because he knew, even before the surgeons had placed the plastic hissing cup over his unwilling snout, what he would be waking up to.  Still groggy and dazed with drugs, he felt no pain, but by the abominable itching in his crotch, Rex already knew they were gone.  The realization hit him like a hammer and he felt himself unmade, half a dog and unable to perform his functions as nature intended; no matter that he had a family and five adorable pups at home, Rex felt he had been brutalized and perhaps even that a part of his essence had been taken.  He curled on himself within the cool steel cage in which he was enclosed and wanted nothing more than to lick where the stitches itched, but even this simple act of remorse was prevented by the ridiculous fan which enwrapped his entire head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings did not improve upon his return to his home two days later.  Despite his mate Lulu\u2019s reassurances, Rex remained convinced that he was damaged beyond repair and moped about the house, paying only cursory attention to the young ones and often finding comfort in his daily meal and frequent snacks.  \u201cBecause of the surgery,\u201d Rex thought to himself, \u201cI\u2019m destined to be nothing more than a fat, lazy lump on the couch; it\u2019s not fair!\u201d  And yet even as he thought this, he filled his gullet from his bowl in the evenings, often licking its clean metal surface until one of the human children would take pity on him and fill it up again.  And if he felt a decrease in his overall energy, it was hardly to be noticed for the time he spent sulking in the living room, contemplating how now all of his friends would be able to outrun and out distance him easily.  Lulu took it all in stride, staying by her partner\u2019s side, certain that in time, he would recover, mentally as well as physically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a week and a half after Rex came home, the broad white fan was removed from his head and Rex was no longer walking stiffly with his hind legs, though the lack of the familiar weight was a constant distress for the red-furred canine.  He and lulu were idling in the living room before the wide glass doors when the dog clattered and little Tommy, Rex\u2019s rotund third son, clamored over the threshold.  The little setter pup climbed in panting in near exhaustion from the heat and play of the backyard in which the other pups frolicked; of course he was the first one to be fatigued.  He lay for a few moments on the cool tile of the kitchen ceramic, legs spayed out for maximum surface area, though Tommy was able to cover more ground than the average pup due to the width of his middle.  Rex thought vaguely that something ought to be done about Tommy, whose weight was now just shy of a full 30lbs, a full third more than his slim siblings, but he didn\u2019t want to commit to anything at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy eventually wandered over to his parents, belly swinging slightly on his undersized frame and he stared a long time at Rex before saying innocently, \u201cDaddy, you look like Mama.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anyone other than his own son had said that, he\u2019d have risen up instantly and bitten someone\u2019s toe off.  As it was, he was confounded on how to act.  Lulu reacted instantly when she saw Rex\u2019s expression,  \u201cNow, Tommy, that\u2019s not a very nice thing to say to your father.  Say you\u2019re sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy\u2019s mouth worked the air in protest, but under Lulu\u2019s severe glance, he said hurriedly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, But I just meant Daddy\u2019s big like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Lulu\u2019s turn to feel self conscious, despite the fact that the pup was plainly oblivious to the effect he was causing.  Rex rotated his head around to look at his flank and did notice for the first that that he and his spouse now indeed shared almost identical physiques (more identical indeed than Rex would have liked).  Still rather chubby from her well nourished pregnancy, Lulu was not what Rex would have called fat, but she certainly wasn\u2019t as trim as he was, or at least used to be.  There was a considerable softness on his ribs now, and the line formed by his belly, rather than tapered, was almost parallel with his back.  His hips too were less defined, where bones had angled his hindquarters gently, there was now a simple smooth curvature.  Not a very significant change, but certainly a mighty one given the time he had been at home.  Rex finally snorted when he emerged from his thoughts, \u201cI guess I should take it easy on the kibble eh, hun?\u201d  He rubbed noses with her while Tommy trotted off hastily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy that evening, however, habit trumped his nearly forgotten words.  Tommy watched as his father gorged himself and plunged his snout into his bowl, lifting his head every few moments to observe his stance and imitate it himself.  Though it hurt to stuff himself so, Tommy finished his whole bowl\u2014Just like Daddy!\u2014despite that fact that his family had exchanged his puppy bowl for an adult one in lea of Tommy\u2019s prodigious appetite.  Tommy even managed to lick the bowl afterwards and was rewarded with seconds.  He wasn\u2019t able to finish a fourth of the second portion, even though he ate until he was sick and his great round belly bulged and swayed heavily under him, but he was sure that in time he would do better.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For Rex, time passed as if stuck in a mire.  Colors had lost their flare, food was tasteless and it was hard to keep track of how much he was actually eating save how many times a day his bowl was refilled.  His puppies gamboled outside the big bay windows where he sat and watched them everyday but he couldn\u2019t ever seem to muster up the energy to go and chase them the way he did before the surgery.  He even slacked on his protective duties to warn the household of dangerous mailmen and passing cars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHis spouse, Lulu, quietly accepted Rex when he came home, thinking that this was just a temporary funk from which he would eventually recover.  However, after several months, the altered setter had not changed significantly.  Sure, after a while he no longer wandered around the house at night, quietly moaning to himself, but the vigor that was in him before seemed entirely absent, replaced by a worn acceptance of habit.  Now, more than a season since the surgery, Lulu watched as Rex lumbered up to take his ablutions in the yard.  He walked a little stiffly, working out the kinks in his legs and then squeezed himself through the dog door.  Sure he did not seem so sad anymore, but neither did he seem particularly happy and Lulu was increasingly worried that it might be too late to work out a change she had assumed would come on its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe setter female watched the now much larger male amble out into the grass.  It was painfully clear the effect that his poor eating habits had had over the intervening months.  At first it had seemed a good thing, the more Rex ate during a day, the better overall he seemed especially during the first painful weeks after the surgery.  Now however, he had settled into a routine of almost sickening gluttony.  Three whole bowls of kibble in the morning and two more in the evening and he still begged constantly, obtaining sometimes an equal volume of rich human stuffs on days that the family sat down for dinner and had lots of leftovers.  Boy did it show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRex\u2019s long, auburn fur could not hide the vast swathes of fat that liberally coated his back, belly, chest, neck and rump.  His profile was that of a wide rectangle whose bottom terminated close to the ground, far closer indeed than due solely to his new tank-like belly for the length of the auburn fur on his stomach.  He was now more than twice as wide as Lulu herself, wider even than she had been stuffed and carrying five pups in her belly.  It was strange watching the thick fat on Rex\u2019s back tip to the right and then to the left as he took his measured steps across the lawn.  She averted her eyes as he crouched, the thick body now stubbornly difficult to bend and she knew that he was having some difficulty maintaining the position long enough to do his business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLulu turned away from the window then, more to escape the sight of what seemed to be the results of her mate\u2019s efforts to eat himself to death, than any pretense of privacy; it was so much easier to pretend the problem didn\u2019t exist when it wasn\u2019t staring you in the face.  The female setter sighed deeply and retired to the comfort of chewing an old, worn slipper than she had had since moving in.  The corners of her mouth curled in memory.  The world had been so much bigger then, if somewhat louder and more frightening, the human children barely more than infants and herself still wet behind the ears and craving her mother\u2019s milk.  The mother and father had scurried to and fro in care of their brood, only settling down at night to relax with the downy fluff of the new pup.  Rex had already been there a year and he seemed so strong, sophisticated and mature, stealing the slipper for her one night when she had been feeling lonely and neglected.  He had torn his promptly to pieces, but Lulu had always been gentle with her toys, savoring them as one might a hard candy, or perhaps more like a security blanket.  At the time, she had had no conception that after having pups of her own, her own life could begin to mirror those of her adopted human family, nor that her and Rex\u2019s roles could be so totally flipped on their heads.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nFootsteps from the hallway where she lurked alerted her\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The smile, at least, was honest.  For despite how he had changed over the months of mirroring his father, he, more than the others of the litter had maintained his juvenile looks.  Tommy waddled out of Sophie\u2019s room, his swagger was even heavier than his father\u2019s was, undoubtedly after serving another long night at the girl\u2019s body pillow.  He yawned greatly, showing off a new shiny set of adult choppers; they would have appeared more properly threatening if not set into a face  as round as a pumpkin.  Behind cheeks almost as engorged as that of a human\u2019s, the flesh of his neck plumped in rolls like a pack of sausages, framing her son\u2019s face which was more adorable than it was handsome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe touched the side of his face with hers and licked under her chin in the old way he had begged for pre-chewed food which had become an expression of affection and reverence for her among the litter.  Lulu\u2019s world was eclipsed by the great round expanse of Tommy\u2019s flanks which rocked slightly back and forth as he switched his weight constantly from one side to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Mom.\u201d  He greeted, smiling.  Lulu could not help but be lifted out of her little hole.  Of course Tommy saw nothing wrong with the situation.  Here was her darling son, well into his eighth month of life\u2014And Lulu knew what a blessing and rarity it was for her to even know him so long when living with a human family\u2014a time when his brothers and sisters were losing their downy fur and baby fat and growing into the shapes they would be in as adults, and Tommy more looked like he was moving backward  in time.  He had maintained the great, round swell of his belly, expanding it to the point where it was wider than his chest and rested between his knees.  Rather than becoming more graceful, Tommy had again moved backward, he was more clumsy now than ever and could hardly even work himself up to a run before becoming exhausted.  He slept more and of course ate more; sometimes she caught him grooming that great, spherical mound of flesh with his tongue, as if lovingly cultivating and caressing his own obscene obesity.  Of course he couldn\u2019t care less for his siblings\u2019 sidelong glances as they too began to notice how very different Tommy was becoming, he had eyes only for his father, and of course his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this flashed through Lulu\u2019s mind on sight of her overweight offspring, but as a mother, it was her place to only be supportive of him and the rest of her brood for surely Tommy would have no place to turn if he thought that his own mother disapproved.  \u201cHello Tommy Darling.  Dow did you sleep?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine enough, though Sophie kept trying to sleep with her head on my stomach, her head is heavier than she seems to think!  She stopped eventually when I rolled over to the middle of the bed and I got to rest my feet on her back instead.\u201d  He smiled with the satisfaction of what had to have been for him a major and tricky nighttime battle.  \u201cAnd I had the most amazing dream.\u201d  Tommy, though he had only been standing for a few moment\u2019s settled onto his rounded hips that had begun to curve into what Lulu fear would be permanent bowleggedness from the sheer force of his weight.  She noted painfully how her son\u2019s belly generously pressed against the floor for his height.  \u201cI dreamt that the cake me and dad got last night after dinner was as big as the house!  It was so big, even I couldn\u2019t finish it and it so good\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrool collected at the edges of Tommy\u2019s mouth from apparently just the thought and Lulu might have laughed at another dog for the same thing, but here it was strangely not amusing at all, even in one young enough to be excused; it reminded her too much of Rex.  So instead, Lulu said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go outside and play with one of your brothers?  I think Matt is outside digging a hole into the neighbor\u2019s yard with the swimming pool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy\u2019s right leg lept up on its own to scratch his ear, but it merely swatted the air several inches away from his head despite his leaning towards it.  Tommy seemed unaware of just how obese the gesture revealed him to be as he mulled it over with more thought that Lulu would have thought a young male of seven months capable.  \u201cEh\u2026 maybe.  I think I\u2019ll check out what Dad\u2019s doing first though.\u201d  Gathering his weight onto his forlimbs, Tommy made the great effort to get back on his feet, something that Lulu or any relatively fit dog could do without thinking.  Hunching his back in a way that temporarily increased his girth even more, the obese setter was able to get up and pull himself through the dog door in the living room\u2019s wall.  Though not as tall as his father, and therefore not as wide, Tommy still had trouble getting his low hanging belly over the lower lip of the door with his relatively shorter legs.  Lulu reflected internally that Dora could virtually fly through the door.  She set her head down on her old and stained slipper and closed her eyes.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tommy immediately went to work crouching and digging his brother's hole deeper and better.  \"You wanna go swimming?\" Matt asked cheerily, happy to see his hefty brother doing something exciting.  Tommy responded, \"Yeah, sure.  That sounds fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Matt slid easily through the wide deep hole that he and Tommy had created, but Tommy had to force himself very slowly through and hoped no one saw him.  Matt was already in the pool when Tommy walked nervously in.  Tommy, however, found that he had a natural affinity for swimming and started paddling out into the deeper blue of the pool.  Matt was enjoying himself, starting to pant a bit at the other side of the pool; but Tommy was gasping by the time he reached where his brother was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fortunately, there were steps at that end of the pool, which Tommy gratefully used to heave his shaky limbs out of the pool.

Rex heaved and heaved, but he eventually had to admit defeat and wiggle back through the hole.  His only hope was that no one had seen him.  But only Tommy had, and the voluminous dog was relieved that his father couldn't even fit through the hole.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rex, however, was ashamed and furious, emotions he drowned with food.  When Rex's mate asked what was wrong, Rex smiled unconvincingly and said, \"Nothing, sorry.  I'm just in a bad mood.  I'm not as young as I used to be.\"  He said nothing further, and she let him rest.

Tommy was, however, happy to keep his father company and to console him.  Tommy was maturing and realizing that his father was troubled emotionally; but no matter how much Tommy tried to console his father, Rex always seemed just to slip further into his tailspin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rex was concerned for Tommy, his own son.  Rex knew he had to do something, or else Tommy would turn out like him.  But Rex enjoyed food too much and couldn't control his primitive urge to stuff his face as much as possible.  Perhaps, Rex thought, his own weight wasn't so bad.  Maybe this surgery had been a boon to him.  It allowed him to enjoy the company of deeply funny and smart puppy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lulu noticed a change in Rex's attitude.  He was spending more time with Tommy, which seemed to alleviate his minor depression; but it also seemed to cause him to eat more and to cause his son Tommy to eat more.  Lulu even noticed that even Matt was eating more than he usually did.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lulu watched her children mature and grow to full sized adults.  Matt was 28 inches at the withers and despite his slight increase in food intake, remained a sleek, thin, playful boy.  Dora and her sister were 27 inches and rather thin; but still very healthy.  Tommy was the shortest, at 26 inches at the withers.  Tommy now sported an abdomen with a slight outward bulge when he stood.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then there was Rex, Lulu's husband, who had just turned six.  His abdomen had a pronounced outward bulge that made playing with his children taxing.  Rex started panting after a longer walk.

She didn't really want to upset Rex, especially because he was so happy around Tommy.  But the issue kept nagging at her.  Rex always huffed and panted when he had to heave himself up, a task which seemed to take more time than it ever used to.  Maybe Lulu was making this up and was just paranoid; she assured herself that that was what the problem was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lulu noticed also that Tommy and Rex spent a lot of time together outside, but not playing with the other dogs.  When Lulu went to investigate, she found her husband and son asleep in front of the bushes, digesting their seeming ever-increasing breakfasts.  Despite being only two years old, Tommy had to exert himself slightly to get himself up, which even Lulu herself didn't have to do.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rex enjoyed Tommy's company; when the two were awake, they talked about their favorite toys, what they enjoyed watching the others do, and especially their favorite morsels of human food.  \"I prefer pizza to hamburgers,\" Rex said to Tommy, who responded, \"But I prefer the sausages to either of those.\"  Rex chuckled and nodded, \"You're right, I suppose.  Speaking of which, let's go see what the humans are making for lunch.\"  Tommy wagged his tail and forced himself up slowly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rex tried to do the same, but he couldn't manage to heave himself up.  He tried again; and this time, with his back legs under him, he managed to slowly push himself off the ground.  Rex then hobbled after his waddling son.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The humans were indeed making lunch; and Tommy was sitting at the master's feet, the rather large one the mistress called Ron.  He was a sucker for food and liberally handed down food for his dogs.  Although there were only sandwich meats today, Rex and Tommy got a liberal smeckling of Salami, Roast Beef, Pepperoni, Ham, and Turkey in addition to cheddar and swiss cheese.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ron had finished making sandwiches and was bringing plates and potato chips to the table when he noticed Rex's struggle to get up.  \"Poor baby,\" Ron said to Rex, \"Are you okay?  Let me get you an aspirin.\"  Ron liberally coated the aspirin in cheese and gave it to Rex, who ate the cheese and spit out the aspirin.  Ron chuckled, coated the aspirin in peanut butter, and gave it to Rex, who finally ate the pill.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rex felt far better after his master gave him the pill and managed to stand without all the huffing and puffing for a while.  Rex also liked it because he got peanut butter every few hours.  Rex and Tommy returned from lunch to take a nap.  Lulu was outside and Rex decided to get a seat on the couch.  He jumped, got his front paws on the couch and tried to get his right hind paw onto the couch.  Rex struggled and struggled to get his paw up on the couch, but something kept blocking his way.

She stopped and started giggling, \"Rex, I've tried to hold my peace for a while; but this is too much.  Rex, you're fat.  Tommy, so are you.  From now on, moreover, you are both going on a diet.  You will each only eat one bowl of kibble and will have no table scraps.  Are we clear?\"  Rex opened his mouth to protest, but Tommy spoke first: \"I know you think we are, Mother.  But can't you see that Dad and I just like food?  This extra weight is a sign of our pleasure, of our luxury.  Food helps Dad deal with his surgery.  He can't play with us any more because of it.  That surgery has made him the way he is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lulu, becoming angry, retorted, \"And what about you, Tommy.  How do you explain your own weight?\"  Remaining surprisingly calm, however, Tommy replied, \"Mom, I've always been clumsy and lacking the energy that my siblings have.  I also have always found solace in the way food makes me feel.  I can't control my instincts.  I see food, so I want to eat it.  It's just the way I am.  I accept that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lulu had been left flabbergasted at her son's pathetic excuse for pathos.  Maybe he did have a genetic predispostion to obesity.

Perhaps, Rex chuckled, \"to spring\" was not the right word for anything Tommy did.  What Tommy did was scramble and heave himself up and waddle toward where he was going.  Rex had given up the hubris that he was any better, however, because he wasn't.  He was, in fact, worse than Tommy at heaving himself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rex had to slowly roll over, center his feet under him, and little by little force himself up at the spoed of a hydraulic press.

He usually was when they all played together, for he would sometimes sit out the games as he tired quicker than his siblings, for obvious reasons. But when he did join in, he was more often than not the slowest of the five, and though he could catch his littermates, in particular his brothers as they were naturally more heavy-set like he was, it was hard-going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time though, he was determined to catch one of his sisters, as he would feel very proud of himself for being able to catch a puppy like Dora or Sarah. He spotted the former, running closer and closer to him, taunting him in the spirit of the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNya nya,\u201d she called, \u201cyou can\u2019t catch me, Tubby!\u201d and she darted off as fast as her legs could carry her, towards the bushes at the end of the garden. Tommy set off after her, and gradually caught up to her. He kept his gaze fixed on her, his ears flapping in the turbulence and legs working furiously to make headway. She would make seemingly endless small turns and changes of direction, attempting to throw him off course, but he hung on doggedly. Closer and closer he got, until he was within a tail\u2019s-length of his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still looking ahead, unaware of how close her rotund brother had managed to get, and suddenly she felt a paw tug at her tail. She dug her large paws into the earth and stopped, curious. She turned round, and saw Tommy, gasping and panting hard, but grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re it!\u201d he exclaimed, and lay down on the soft grass, his flesh padding the impact somewhat. Dora looked over her exhausted brother, a little worried that he may have overstrained himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou alright Tommy?\u201d she asked. In between long, deep breaths, he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine sis,\u201d and took another gasp of air, \u201cI just need a little break,\u201d and he plopped his head down on the foliage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you sure..\u201d Dora began, and ran off to join the others, who had stayed at near the house during Tommy\u2019s chase. \u2018Boy will they get a surprise, they won\u2019t expect me to be it\u2019 she thought, and disappeared through the shrubbery, to play a trick on the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy was left in the shade to relax and doze away the pain of his exertion. His breathing had calmed, and he felt better, and more at ease. The little Setter stood up, ready to go back inside, but he looked at himself one more time, conscious of what was slowing him down during play. He swung his square muzzle round to examine his most prominent feature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis protruding tummy expanded and contracted as he inhaled and exhaled, making him seem a little larger and smaller. He raised a forepaw to it again, and felt it sink in slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018You got in the way a little bit back there,\u2019 he thought to his stomach. \u2018Maybe I should do something about it,\u2019 and he walked off to find his mother, Lulu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found her napping in front of the fireplace, on the threadbare hearthrug, with her back to the flames. He looked at her thoughtfully from the doorway, studying her physique. She was naturally a normal sized dog, as he could see from the family photograph on the wall, taken before she had children, but her pregnancy had changed his mothers form. There was now a little excess fat on her tummy, as she had eaten to a certain degree of excess during pregnancy, as encouraged by those around her. Little Tommy strode a little uneasily into the room, and nosed her softened belly. He quickly sat back on his haunches, as a small moan escaped her lips, and her eyes opened slowly. Glancing around momentarily, they found the disturbance, and she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it baby?\u201d she asked him sofly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, mummy\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes dear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know how I\u2019m a little\u2026 big for my age?\u201d and he could see her eyes linger on his spherical stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t you think there\u2019s a bit of an issue with it?\u201d he asked, and she smiled once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome here Tommy,\u201d she murmured, patting a spot by her side with her paw. Tommy inched his way over to her mother\u2019s warm bulk, and lay his head gently against her side. His mother moved her forepaw over his head, and to his stomach. She rested it softly on his flab, stroking the puppy, and spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any problem at all with you Tommy,\u201d she said reassuringly. \u201cYou\u2019re a wonderful son to me and your father, and this,\u201d she continued, giving his pudge a playful squeeze, making the puppy giggle, \u201cis nothing to get flustered about dogs come in all sizes. I\u2019m a little heavy at the moment, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with a chubby belly: Especially when it makes you this cute!\u201d and she gave another squeeze, before letting go of him. Tommy walked around to face her head-on, smiling too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeel better now?\u201d she asked her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I am Mummy. Thank you,\u201d and he rubbed his head against her muzzle. She returned his affection, adding,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember Tommy, I\u2019ll always love you, no matter how big you are, now go and play with your brothers and sisters. They\u2019ll be wondering where you\u2019ve got to,\u201d and she closed her eyes again, about to nod-off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy now felt a lot better about himself, and his weight. \u2018There\u2019s nothing wrong with a chubby tummy\u2019 he reminded himself, and beamed. The little Setter trotted off to go back outside, but was being followed by something. Tommy stopped as he heard footsteps behind him, and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Sophie, one of the children in the family that owned him. She was six years old, with shoulder length black hair and bright blue eyes, gazing down at him from her great height. Tommy was never sure how tall she was, but could tell her head came up to the same level as those strange switches that click an make the room bright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you are little guy!\u201d she said chirpily, and picked him up. Tommy liked being handled and stroked by the humans, and he allowed himself to be carried by the little girl. She plucked him gently from the ground, and held him to her chest as she walked upstairs to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOof Tommy, you are heavy,\u201d she said, caressing his back as his added poundage made the ascent a little harder. She made the climb, and crossed the landing to her room, closing the door quietly behind her. It was growing dark outside, so she closed the curtains and flicked the light switch to provide illumination. She plonked the puppy down on her bed, and lay next to him, stroking and playing with the pup while she watched television. Tommy lay casually and relaxed as her small hands (but large to him), made work of patting his body, finding that her hands would usually stray to his stomach, kneading and patting the soft form. She was not too dissimilar to himself in this area. The little girl was also slightly overweight for her age. She sported a small potbelly, a doughy look and hints of a double chin. Tommy eased his head into the girls flab as the latter stroked at his own, and relaxed, in almost total comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After a little while, she picked him up underneath his shoulders, and lay almost flat on her back, looking down her front. She stood the little Setter on her tummy, and his paws sunk in slightly to the flab, as he found support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are a pudgy little puppy, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she asked, smiling playfully, \u201cyou\u2018re a bit like me, you are,\u201d she said, and tickled his exposed underbelly. Just then, Sophie heard a voice from downstairs, and let him down gently, as she heard her own mother calling her down for dinner, and opened the door to let Tommy out, as he had his meal at the same time. He bounded down the stairs, and went for his food tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the puppies ate from the same tray of food, but there was no real competition for it as it was always well filled by the human family. This also allowed them to eat as much as they wanted, which was a lot for Tommy. As he chatted idly with his family, he also chewed his way through the kibble as if there was no tomorrow, and put away a decent portion of the tray by the time he was sated, but went for a nice drink as well, as his running around earlier had built up quite a thirst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt very full afterwards, and his tummy was very taught. However, the fullness, combined with his earlier exercise, also made him feel very drowsy and sleepy, so the Setter decided to go to bed earlier than normal. He went to his parents and told them where he would be, in case they wondered where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, someone had a good dinner,\u201d said his father, Rex, as he waddled due to his meal, into view. \u201cYou alright son?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to bed now,\u201d replied Tommy wearily, \u201cI feel really tired for some reason.\u201d Both his parents glanced at his overfilled stomach for a minute, then at each other\u2019s eyes, in silent agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2019Night then dear,\u201d said Lulu, and she nuzzled her son lovingly. Rex did the same, and the puppy plodded to the den of old pillows and blankets, in a small spare room with a doggy door. He made himself comfortable, adjusting his sleeping position for his tight stomach, and drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, small noise sounded through the ground floor of the house. None of the humans heard it, as they were upstairs. Nor did most of the dogs, as they were still deeply asleep having gone to bed only recently. However, one puppy was woken by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy opened his eyes sharply, and raised his head. In the gloom, he saw a mass of fuzzy shapes, rising and falling softly, with heavy breathing as backing. He heard another noise, this one quieter than the first, as though whatever making it was being more careful. The Setter got up, and walked off in search of the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe crept around the house, his ears listening intently for any more hints of the noises whereabouts. Eventually, he located it. It was coming from the kitchen. Tommy inched closer to the doorway, and peered round the frame. There, he saw</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As his eyes were not quite adjusted to the darkness surrounding him, Tommy couldn\u2019t be sure who it was that he could see. He was, however, able to make out a small, fuzzy shape, almost buried in one of the cupboards and the white door of the unit open behind it. The auburn pup could also hear the sounds of something straining, as though trying to move something far too heavy for itself, combined with occasional sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy moved closer to the shape, trying to discern who or what the intruder was. As he got closer, he could make out a fluffy appendage swishing this was and that, transfixing him as the cogs in his mind whirred away working out what this was. \u2018It\u2019s a tail,\u2019 he thought, solving the puzzle. By now, he could see better in the gloom, and saw that the fuzzy shape was in fact the hindquarters of a dog. A small dog, of his breed. It was one of his siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaying silent as possible, Tommy scanned the figure, to see who it was. He could see that the pup before him was quite thin and fit, with a smooth waist. It couldn\u2019t be one of his brothers, they sported rounded bellies like himself, so that left Dora and Sarah. Remembering that the former had longer, shaggy fur on her underside, he peered at the straining female. She had smooth, short hair on he stomach, which meant it was,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSarah?\u201d whispered Tommy, and she stopped her forepaws pressing against the cabinet. Sarah reversed out of the opening, looking at where she heard the noise emanate from. When she found Tommy, he could see her eyes open wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTommy, what are you doing up?\u201d she asked, sounding jumpy, and to her brother as though she was trying to hide something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard something in here,\u201d he answered bluntly, determined to find out what his sister was up to, \u201cbut what are you doing in there? Isn\u2019t that the place where they keep our food?\u201d referring to the large sack of dry kibble that Michael kept in the cupboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-so it is,\u201d replied Sarah, barely audible. Her ears were back and she was looking down at the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what are you doing in there?\u201d pressed Tommy. Sarah looked up at her brother, directly into his deep brown eyes, and heaved a sigh, before answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was getting something to eat,\u201d she said, almost solemnly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut why, you only ate a little while ago? You can\u2019t be too hungry?\u201d Sarah looked at her brother downcast, and replied to his blunt questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did it because I want to be like you,\u201d she replied, looking as though a great weight had been lifted from her shoulders. Tommy was puzzled though. How could she be like him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow could you be like me?\u201d he asked, genuinely perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to get fatter, like you do,\u201d and Tommy finally realised what she was doing. \u2018She\u2019s going to stuff herself silly to try and gain weight!\u2019 he thought, surprised. He had always been slightly jealous of his sisters\u2019 trim waistlines and fitness. How they could play for hours and not feel exhausted, and how much they could outrun himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut why? Why would you want to be like me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause the family loves you!\u201d she replied, breaking out into a smile. \u201cYou get to laze around pretty much all day while the humans pet you and hug you. You get to eat all that you want, and go to bed almost bursting from dinner. And look at you: You\u2019re a cute, squishy little puppy and they love you for it. I just wanted to get a part of that love and affection that they seem to give to you because of your tummy,\u201d she finished, and dropped her head once again, very upset. Instinctively, Tommy rushed to his sister\u2019s side, and nuzzled her lovingly, his warmth comforting the gloomy puppy. After about a minute of just standing together, Tommy spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for being so forward with you,\u201d he said to her softly. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you felt that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean, you aren\u2019t upset?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would I be upset? All your doing is putting some meat on your bones, which you look like needing!\u201d he replied happily, and his sister giggled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just thought you\u2019d not like it if I took the family\u2019s love from you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not.\u201d Sarah licked the side of his face in gratitude, before returning to the cupboard. Tommy also hopped onto the veneered wooden surface, and helped her to drag the open bag of food so that the opening was accessible for them. They dropped back onto the linoleum floor of the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve done this a few times now,\u201d said Sarah, back to her normal, cheerful self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, I think it\u2019s had an effect, all this eating,\u201d Sarah said peering back at herself, \u201cat least, I feel heavier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy pressed his cold, wet nose to Sarah\u2019s warm stomach. She wasn\u2019t fat by any means, and if she had swelled with fat, it was barely noticeable to the eyes of the pup. But as he felt his sister\u2019s body, there was a certain softness to her tummy, that was not there before, and Tommy could feel his nose push in slightly, indicating that there was definite growth in his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou definitely feel softer, sis,\u201d he said, rubbing against her gently, feeling her small layer of fat ripple a little, \u201csoon you might be as big as I am!\u201d Sarah beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were always the bigger one Tommy, I think you\u2019ll always be,\u201d she replied, before plunging her head into the bag of crunchy morsels. She gulped down several small mouthfuls of them, but stopped quite quickly, and raised her muzzle again, licking her chops thoroughly, savouring the meaty taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to join me?\u201d she asked, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy didn\u2019t know how to respond. He felt reassured about his gain now that Sarah was also going to be expanding, and he certainly felt happier about it. But his large dinner was still, for the most part, resolutely in his gut, undigested and leaving the puppy feeling quite full and stomach heavy still, and he wasn\u2019t sure if he should eat again tonight.</span></div></div>",

I still feel full from dinner,\u201d he began, but Sarah cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on Tommy, I promise you\u2019ll like it,\u201d she replied in mock anger, \u201cyou should know more than me how good it feels to be stuffed with food.\u201d She looked at her brother with round, pleading eyes, and Tommy\u2019s reservations melted away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK then sis, I\u2019d love to join you,\u201d he said, and smiled at his sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay!\u201d she whispered happily, and put her head back in the bag to continue eating. Tommy followed suit after looking at her for a few moments. \u2018I still can\u2019t believe she wants to get fat\u2019 he thought to himself, still a little bemused by his sister\u2019s antics. He buried his muzzle in the kibble, and began eating to try and take his mind off it. \u2018Well, she is right about being stuffed!\u2019 he reminded himself, and merrily began chomping away on the morsels, before hearing an alarmed noise from beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhh,\u201d Sarah hissed, and Tommy raised his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember, you have to be quiet when you\u2019re eating,\u201d she told him, \u201cor we might get caught!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she whispered back cheerfully, \u201cbut just keep it down a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they returned to their eating. Tommy salivated as he chowed down on kibble, feeling the crunchy morsels join the previous meal in his bulbous tummy. His midsection swelled slowly and steadily with the influx of nourishment, becoming tighter and tighter as his stuffing wore on, but the little Setter was happy. He was more than happy. The delight of gorging on the delicious food was sending Tommy into euphoria, but soon he had to stop. The pleasure of stuffing was starting to be overturned by the protestations of his pressured stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy moved away from the bag, and lay down in a curled position, around his now taut belly. He could feel the grub inside him, sloshing and shifting as he digested his meal. The puppy beamed, \u2018no wonder Sarah likes this\u2019, he thought, and dazed in the euphoric feeling of it all, as he began to imagine himself swelling and growing with newfound pudge from his midnight snacking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah kept going with her stuffing, and was moving into the bag of food little by little as she worked her way through the kibble. She loved the feeling of being rounded with a heavy portion of food, and as she ate, Tommy watched in the gloom of the slightly moonlit kitchen. He could see her sister\u2019s midsection getting more and more spherical, pushing outwards to the sides and underneath her currently lithe frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after the pressures of the excess food in Tommy\u2019s belly had quelled slightly, Sarah also picked her head up, satisfied with her meal, and she moved over to join her brother in lying on the floor. She rested her head on his more cushiony tummy, reminiscent of her actions earlier that day, and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love this,\u201d she said, adjusting her body slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d asked her brother, moving his head down to face her. He watched as her burgeoning midsection raised and fell as his sister breathed in and out, before she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis,\u201d she emphasised her word, wriggling her head a little to indicate the pillow-like softness of her brother. \u201cYou\u2019re just so adorably cute and cuddly, even more with this big tummy to squeeze!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, thanks Sarah,\u201d murmured Tommy, and licked the end of her snout, causing her to giggle once again. She jumped up, and nosed at the same belly she had just lain on, her startlingly cold nose making Tommy jolt slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, we better get back to bed, before we fall asleep in here,\u201d she said, grinning. She was aware from her previous night binges that a fully filled stomach was an excellent aid for sleeping. \u201cI\u2019ll need your help to get the bag away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, give me a moment,\u201d replied Tommy, and started to heave herself up. Sarah may have begun to overeat, but she was still much fitter then him, and was able to move much more easily in her stuffed form. Tommy heaved himself to his paws, the claws in his toes making quite clicking noises as he stood up. The food was a heavy weight in his gut, and now that he was standing, it was shifting once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over to the bag, being tested by the pains in his belly to remain as silent as he could. He and Sarah took a corner of the bag in their mouths, and pulled it into the wooden cupboard. But, as it moved up the ledge from tiles to wood, a few mouthfuls of kibble spilled out of the opening and onto the floor, which went unnoticed as the pups worked to get the sack away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short while, they succeeded despite the impediment of being so full. They hopped back down, and Sarah felt a few of the morsels under her paws, the velvet skin helping to soften the impact. Tommy walked back to the door, but stopped when he realised that Sarah wasn\u2019t beside him. The pup spun around, and saw her with her muzzle to the floor, hovering up the pieces as she sniffed them out. He watched her go about her covering-up, wondering how she could still find room for the extras.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresently, she raised her head, swallowed the last few fragments, and smiled at her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I needed to make sure we don\u2019t get found out,\u201d she whispered, after seeing that Tommy was staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I was just trying to work out how you could still eat after all that. You must be bursting!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHee hee,\u201d she chuckled, \u201cI\u2019m a growing girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really are,\u201d Tommy added, raising a forepaw to her tummy when she drew alongside him, feeling how solid it was compared to earlier. It wasn\u2019t too much bigger than before, her waist still curved upwards behind her ribs, but it was noticeable from this close that she had eaten a lot. She looked like she had swallowed one of the small balls that they played with when the sun was shining on the garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think someone will notice that we\u2019re so big in the morning?\u201d Tommy asked. He could tell that his own stomach had stretched out too, and the extra size would surely make someone suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Don\u2019t worry about that,\u201d Sarah reassured him, \u201clike I said I\u2019ve already eaten like this. As long as you don\u2019t eat much more than you would at dinner, the lump always goes down by when you wake up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you work that out?\u201d Tommy asked, a wry smile starting to form on his maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Sarah began, sounding a bit embarrassed, \u201c a few days ago, I really made a pig of myself. I must have eaten that time what I\u2019d normally eat all day, and well, I paid for it in the morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still felt a bit full when I woke up, and my belly still pushed out a bit. At least you and the others had left me to sleep and already had breakfast, so I could eat without anyone noticing my tummy. I went upstairs then until the bulge went down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s where you went,\u201d Tommy remembered that he didn\u2019t see Sarah till well after the sun had reached its highest. \u201cBut why did you have more if you were still showing?\u201d he asked, and Sarah grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was hungry,\u201d she countered, and playfully nudged her brother\u2019s side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI get it,\u201d and the male Setter smiled. \u201cThanks for sharing your snack with me sis,\u201d he said, grateful for the wonderful experience he\u2019d had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should be thanking you bro, you said you\u2019ll keep this a secret,\u201d and she nuzzled his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I will,\u201d replied Tommy, returning her affections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two slowly crept back to the den, tired from being up so long in the middle of the night. Padding their way back through the semi-darkness, they got back to the pillow-strewn room where the rest of their family continued to slumber deeply. Tommy and Sarah quietly said goodnight to each other before settling down on the cushions and closing their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy did not stay awake for long, but his last conscious thoughts were of doing this again. As he drifted off to sleep, he began to dream of the future. In it, he was a gloriously tubby dog, proudly waddling his overweight body around the home, to the repeated affections of the human family, who fondled his supple flab and fed him repeated treats of beef and turkey. The fattened Setter lolled over onto his side, tired from the exertion of his walking, and lazed around with Sophie cuddling up to his massive body, stretching his legs out in ecstasy as her fingers caressed him. Tommy stretched out in the real world, and writhed a little to work himself into a more comfortable position, and he carried on his wonderful dream.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The flawless vision of his possible future self ended seemingly too soon, as the little Setter thought. He barely had time to enjoy his expanded form, when the sun was piercing it\u2019s way into the den. The night-time feed had tired him out, and he desperately wanted to stay in his stupor, but Tommy\u2019s eyelids opened up to the glare and blinked in the early sunlight. Tommy looked around. Only he and Sarah were still left, though his sister was still gently snoozing a few cushions away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the yips and occasional barks outside of Matt, Alfie and Dora as they gambolled about the garden, Tommy reasoned that it must be mid morning. Breakfast would still be in the tray, there was always some food left in it, but he reasoned that they better get moving soon, or Mummy might come looking. They\u2019d have a bit of difficulty explaining why they were still left in the den ages after they had risen; normally, the pups, including Tommy, would wake her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPadding over to Sarah, he nosed her middle to rouse her. She was right, it had definitely gone down. \u2018The perfect crime!\u2019 Tommy though giddily to himself, as his the thinner one awoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning Bro!\u201d she chirped as she saw who it was. \u201cWhy\u2019d you wake me up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI figured you\u2019d want breakfast,\u201d Tommy replied, before dropping to a whisper, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a tummy to keep up now,\u201d glancing at her waistline. While it had gone down since her meal, Tommy could see the ever so slight changes to her physique that were happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiled and gently batted a paw at his muzzle in a playful mood. Her brother walked off after hearing a rumble from deep within his furred mass, and headed for the tray. Sarah shifted on the pillow, rolling to her feet. Shaking her head a little to force away her drowsiness, she trotted off to join him at the food tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the other three siblings continued their game of chasing each other around the lawn, still a little damp from the autumn dew. Rex was standing by on the concrete patio by the screen doors, watching over his precious offspring, guarding them from the deadly, deadly pigeons and blackbirds that scoured the garden for grubs. As he resolutely sat, ready for action, his mind was pondering where his other two children were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer to that was that after their nourishment, they had found a comfy spot in front of the fire, on the hearthrug next to Lulu. As they lay there, the human children would pet and stroke them, while gazing at the rectangular screen while strange things happened inside it. Though they had both just been asleep, the human children would want a comforting furry thing to play with while their cartoons were on, and the pair were only too happy to oblige.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the Saturday morning cavalcade ended, ad the children departed the living room. Lulu had since left with Michael who took her for a walk on weekends when he felt he had time, and this left the pups alone. Feeling as though they needed a little air, the two ambled into the garden via the open kitchen door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex spotted them as they went to join the others. \u2018At least they\u2019re here now,\u2019 he thought, relieved, and watched as they joined the fun. The older Setter\u2019s gaze followed them as they frittered around on the grass, the sun shining down merrily despite the slightly chilly air the occasional gust of wind brought. Tommy looked as though he was lolloping at the back as usual, and this concerned Rex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew exactly why he was not keeping up, the great dome of the chubby puppy\u2019s roundness highlighting itself repeatedly with its non-stop undulation as its owner ran. His father sighed. Rex didn\u2019t think anything was wrong with being a little fat. Lulu was at the moment as her softened for reminded him when they snuggled close at night. Besides, winter was coming soon, a little insulation would be useful in the frigid temperature he had come to expect, and they were only puppies. He could vaguely remember himself around that age, festooned with baby fat as he waddled around with his mother, pleading for more milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Rex also saw that \u2018nyoose flash\u2019 that had been on the screen only a few days before. A dog in there area was on the screen, a dark brown Labrador as far as Rex remembered, but that wasn\u2019t so clear. What was clear was the dog\u2019s vastness. Its huge, wobbling gut, rolling neck and flabby chest, rippling as the poor creature struggled to walk around for more than a few lengths of its tail, before collapsing on the ground. A human in a blue uniform prodded the shapeless hulk of fur and fat, and watched as it rippled for several seconds of its own accord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Setter blocked this memory, trying not to envisage his own son being so monstrously obese, gasping for air. \u2018No,\u2019 he firmly put, \u2018Tommy\u2019s nowhere near there, he\u2018s just a bit tubby. He\u2019s just a puppy, he\u2019s got all of his life ahead, he\u2019ll grow out of it: I did. I don\u2019t need to worry about this,\u2019 and Rex looked around and saw that his third son was no longer running around, but standing still, panting heavily. <br>\r\n\u2018He\u2019s probably just about to have a big growth spurt, that\u2019s all. Tommy isn\u2019t that much bigger than Alfie or Matt anyway.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral weeks passed at the house, as the weather drew steadily more wintry. It rarely snowed, but the coldness of the time was all enveloping around the puppies as they would frolic in the garden, and the winds grew stronger. Worried about her young ones, Lulu was scared by the onslaught of iciness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRex honey,\u201d she asked her mate, as he once more cast his eyes over proceedings, \u201cdo you think we should keep the little ones inside a little more now. It\u2019s awfully cold out here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been walked yesterday, and was starting to regret it by the end of her trek. The house, and the nearby village, were situated on a hill, and the roads in and out of the settlement were very exposed. Michael had wisely worn a thick coat and gloves as the stinging gusts dug at his form, but Lulu had relatively minor defences. Her winter coat was building, but the cold had set in too quick for a decent layer to accumulate before it became frigid, and she was now thankful for the slight coating of fat her body still had. At least that had helped to keep her warm as she trod the cold ground, breath rising in mists before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right dear,\u201d replied Rex softly, turning to face her, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think we should stop them playing out here. You wouldn\u2019t get any peace otherwise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere nearly six months old now Rex, you don\u2019t need to be looking over them all the time, they\u2019re not stupid.\u201d Lulu had said this gently to her lover. She knew how much he valued their young, and that he felt compelled to make sure nothing bad happened to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what if something happens?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be fine dear, they\u2019re growing up, there\u2019s bound to be rough and tumble but it won\u2019t do anything bad to them,\u201d she declared rather forcefully, but then dropped her tone, to a loving whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides,\u201d she continued, licking his muzzle as they surveyed the lawn alongside each other, \u201cI miss you when you\u2019re out here.\u201d Rex had no answer for this, and caressed the side of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry love,\u201d he murmured, \u201cwe need some quality time together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need to be sorry dear, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d and she smiled at her mate, \u201ccome on, there\u2019s a lovely warm spot in front of the fire I\u2019m sure you missed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether, after Rex took one last look at his offspring, they sauntered back into the house, feeling the heat wrap round them in moments, and Rex de-tensed at once. They settled in front of the burning logs, and lay down, simply adoring each other\u2019s company. Rex, always a little fidgety, pawed affectionately at Lulu, causing her to jump a little as she woke from her light doze. Almost as she woke up, she remembered what she saw yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess what I saw yesterday dear,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll those \u2018crissmuss\u2019 decorations were starting to go up in the town, I saw them as I went by.\u201d Lulu knew Rex loved \u2018crissmuss\u2019, and so did she. First the decorations would go up, then the tree would arrive the next day. \u2018Better tell the puppies not to mess that,\u2019 she noted. Then the human family would be home more and more, always giving them loving company. But the best thing was the food that they got. Apart from the big meaty bone they each got, a long list of titbits and treats would pass down the Setter throats throughout the holiday period, all of them savoury and delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, this increased eating would have its inevitable consequences, as Lulu could remember from last year. Her belly would round out, her chest soften and she would generally become more supple as the season wore on, keeping her warm and comfortable in the cold. Rex would go through a similar holiday gain, but both lost it through the rest of the year, no harm done. Besides, she never heard anyone complain about her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s great Lulu!\u201d Rex yipped happily, looking forward to the good times he would have. The lazy days just spent dozing around, being almost waited on by the human children, as they lovingly ruffled his fur and gave him \u2018mins pyes\u2019 and other such morsels Rex couldn\u2019t name. But as he thought about that, he remembered his burgeoning gut from those delectable things, and his mind drifted back to his children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfie, Matt and Dora were normal and healthy sized, even if a little tubby in the case of the boys. But in the last few weeks, the other two had drifted apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy was rounder than ever. He had grown several paw widths in height, but his tummy had grown with it, though slower. It still hung in a pendulous orb below his body, and Rex had started to notice his son\u2019s chest beginning to swell up a bit too, and he was starting to lose sight of his spine. Tommy was still nowhere near what Rex would call fat, but he was more than pudgy now. Sarah had changed too. She\u2019d always been quite lithe and thin, but for around a month now she had been growing alongside Tommy. Her belly was rounding outwards now, though she was still a long way behind her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex was a little worried now, but still firmly believed that they would eventually grow out of their puppy-fat. \u2018Still,\u2019 he thought, \u2018better keep an eye over them at crissmuss,\u2019 and with that, he left that thought alone, as he went back to talking of crissmuss with his darling.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Time continued to pass, though the scenery in the house had changed in that time. A large, pointed tree had been placed in the living room, which caused the human children, Greg, Helen and Sophie, to buzz with excitement as Michael carried it into place, steadying it upright in a black plastic tub of stones. A large box was brought in the room by Sally, onto the beige sofa next to the new vegetation, from which the children picked out glittering objects, always topped with a hook or a ring. Some were angels, golden and glistening in the light of the soft glowing bulbs and fire, others were snowmen, pure white and jolly-faced, but the most cherished and prised were the more weathered objects. The ones which weren\u2019t quite finished, or were missing a bit of the design, the ones made by the children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole affair was topped off by Michael placing a large star on the point of the tree. Soon afterwards, the entire house was decorated in the same manner. Long strands of gold, red and green sparkles were hung over the hallway pictures and draped around the ornaments on shelves. Strange little lights were put up all around, flashing and glowing in all different colours. Lulu and Rex had seen all this before, and  watched, savouring the moment, but they knew not to be intrusive or be in someone\u2019s path. The children\u2019s minds were elsewhere, or perhaps would be clouded by a mince pie or foil-wrapped chocolate, but either way, they would not always look where they were going, as Alfie found out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe littlest setter was dozing quietly on the plush sofa cushion after his breakfast, unaware of the activity around him as the tree was assembled. The decorating was finished and still the puppy was asleep, the warmth of being only a few yards from the fire keeping him resolutely in his dreams. After completing their remodelling of the house with yet more shining articles, they returned to the living room to pay their services to Christmas television. Sophie turned the great box on, and a short but piercing and high pitched whistle issued from it. The human ears were spared the noise, unable to pick up such high frequencies, but Alfie wasn\u2019t, an started to stir from his slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Setter opened his eyes, cloudy in re-awakening, before being fully brought back to reality by a sharp pain in his rear, something heavy pressing down on his tail, and the puppy gave a great yelp. The offender looked down for the source of noise, before standing back up and attempting to calm his victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Alfie I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Greg whispered at the auburn Setter. He had been too preoccupied talking to Helen about what he wanted for Christmas to notice the adorably diminutive form he was about to sit on. The ten year old placed his hand on Alfie\u2019s head, and stroked gently, soothing his frightened pet. He then put his hands either side of the six month old canine\u2019s slightly squishy midsection, pulling him upwards and into his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do Greg?\u201d asked Helen, concerned about the wide-eyed puppy, hearing him squeal but not seeing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I sat on his tail,\u201d Greg replied reproachfully. \u2018Think?!\u2019 thought Alfie to himself, cocking his head at the boy\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive him here, Greg,\u201d Helen told her brother, and walked over to him. She plucked the Setter from his grasp, and cradled him in her arms, stroking his fluffy back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, there little guy,\u201d she mumbled to him in a pleasant voice, like his mother would when he was younger, \u201cI\u2019ll find something to make you feel better\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfie\u2019s tail seemed fine after its ordeal, though he could still feel it throbbing as she sat back down in her soft chair with a quiet thud, barely audible over the jabbering elves on screen. The little girl\u2019s blue eyes caught sight of the chubby tummy the dog was the proud owner of, and spied a small stack of festive treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know!\u201d she cooed at her pet, and picked up a handful of pastry parcels while tickling Alfie\u2019s belly with her other hand. Alfie relaxed, and pressed himself gently against her fluffy sweater, easing into her petting and closing his eyes. A strange smell greeting his nose forced his eyes back open, as she held a yellowy shape in front of his muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, eat up,\u201d she urged at him, and the Setter reluctantly obeyed, opening his maw to accept the unknown. The rough, slightly powdery texture his mouth was greeted by, eventually yielded its contents, and Alfie was awash with a tangy and sweet flavour as the sack burst, almost sending him into spasm as the delicious sauce engulfed his tongue. Savouring every last drop of the lumpy innards, he licked his chops afterwards to find some more of the flavour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you liked that!\u201d Helen giggled,  the eight year old bobbing up and down in her little laugh, before holding another pie within reach of the puppy\u2019s muzzle. Drooling in anticipation, he quickly lunged his head to tear at it, craving desperately for that indescribable zest. He wolfed down another and another of the parcels, until the handful depleted, and Helen settled back down to watch the cartoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfie picked himself from the warmth of the chair, and stepped down to the floor, his springy legs and the thickly padded carpet helping to cushion the rather heavy impact as he landed, before walking off to find his mother. \u2018Maybe Mummy can tell me what that was all about?\u2019 he thought. Though he had become instantly addicted to those morsels, he hadn\u2019t a clue as to why he had been given them so easily. The fullness of his insides and the slight waddle with which he sauntered through the different rooms a testament to his newfound fondness. It had all passed in a blur, but Alfie felt as though he had just had a very large dinner, and it was only mid morning. \u2018Too bad our kibble doesn\u2019t taste that good,\u2019 he reasoned to himself. He liked the beef and chicken flavoured chunks, but they could be a bit bland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTraipsing his stocky form up the staircase, Alfie found Lulu idling on Helen\u2019s bed. The adult Setter looked supremely comfortable on the spongy, purple material, but Alfie felt he had to rouse her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMummy?\u201d he called from the floor below. Lulu opened her eyes, and still half asleep, rolled onto her back, so that now she saw her son upside down and looking a bit worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright Alfie?\u201d she asked, in a comforting voice, rolling the right way up as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s something going on downstairs, it\u2019s weird, but nice weird. There\u2019s a tree in the corner of the sofa room, and it\u2019s all covered in these sparkly things, plus Helen kept giving me these little parcel things to eat, and they tasted the best Mummy! I\u2019m sure you\u2019d love them!\u201d he said, squeaking in his excitement, bouncing from one paw to the other in his exuberance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her son\u2019s rather hyped and bouncy demeanour, and seeing the spittle that had reformed at the sides of his mouth from the thought of these things, the mother Setter had almost deduced what had happened, but she still had to see for herself. Rising unsteadily on the unstable mattress, she gathered herself to jump onto the padded carpet that blanketed the floor, and walked down the hallway. Alfie bounded in her wake, twittering on about these amazing things he ate, the texture, its taste, and just before Lulu felt a little irked by his commentary, they trotted into the lounge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe d\u00c3\u00a9cor, the smells of rich and warming meals to come, the children beckoning her over, it was all there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s here!\u201d Lulu whispered under her breath, energised as much as her puppy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s here?\u201d asked Alfie, still confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChrissmuss!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s when all the family come together to celebrate their happiness to be together,\u201d she replied, Alfie rapt to her voice. \u201cThey sing songs together, give each other presents, and usually just spend a lot of time together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what about those tangy things I got given, are they part of this?\u201d Lulu smiled down at her son, remembering the first time she got one of the \u2018tangy things\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best part for us pets Alfie!\u201d she said vigorously. She looked down at her son, noting the bulging middle he carried around, \u201call the time you get given treats and food, more than just those tangy things, until you\u2018re full and nearly bursting. You\u2019ll love it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Alfie didn\u2019t like the sound of the \u2018bursting\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course you will. This is meant to be the happiest time for everyone, and Michael and Sally make sure that we get to share that too. You better tell your brothers about this, I\u2019ll tell Sarah and Dora.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk Mummy, I can\u2019t believe we get given those things!\u201d and he licked her under the chin in affection, before seeking out his brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little Setter searched all around the house. He climbed and descended the stairs several times, a difficulty given his turgid belly, and searched both floors thoroughly but still couldn\u2019t find them, even using his nose to locate them not was helping. Eventually, he gave up looking inside, and went out the doggy-door at the back of the kitchen. It was a tough decision to make for him, as yet more delectable odours wafted into his nostrils as he made for the flap, but kept on course despite his nose telling him otherwise, as well as hearing the wind occasionally howl outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coldness of the outside world hit Alfie hard, and his downy winter fur battled with the wind to keep his tiny form warm, as he shivered on the icy concrete patio, sitting on his furry haunches. The garden was divided into two halves, separated by a now leafless hedge with a gap in to allow traffic between the two pieces of land. Most of the garden in front of this barrier was grassed over, allowing a lot of space for the puppies to frolic on, as well as a small pond in the corner. But behind the hedge, were shallow pits of dark earth, which in summer were awash with rainbow colours and all kinds of aroma were wafted by the breeze as flowerbeds went into bloom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfie swatted at his ear as he squinted at the garden in the winter sun, a particularly teasing gust having raised a firestorm of itches on his floppy skin. Seeing no one in front of the hedge, even his father who had capitulated to Lulu\u2019s desires about his guard dog duties, the little Setter got back up and trudged onto the frosty grass, thinking that they had to be on the other side of the dormant bush.</span></div></div>",

Just a few minutes ago he had been in his cage at the humane society, a well sized concrete rectangle where he spent the last few months, and now he was crammed inside a plastic box held in the air by the people who had been caring for him for the past few months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScruffy was not a happy dog. He remembered when he lived with his Mommy and Daddy. They were old, well into their 70's, and while they couldn't move much they loved Scruffy so much. Scruffy didn't mind. If they didn't move, he didn't have to! There were days when he had plenty of energy, but as he grew up he found it to be more and more work just to get up and away from the food bowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it had to do with the fact that he had gotten so heavy. Mommy had always kept his bowl full to the brim. \"If he can still eat more, it means he's hungry!\" She would insist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaddy agreed, as he pat his own large, expansive belly that covered his lap as he sat on his rocking chair, threatening to spill over his overalls. \"Lil' guy needs to have some meat on him!\" He would say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Scruffy did have meat on him. He never noticed, he had never known what the humane society people called \"health\". But boy did he have meat. By the time he was picked up and carried away, Scruffy was just 2 years old and a whopping 95lbs. He hadn't walked in the past 4 days except to relieve himself outside. The door was kept open for him since he couldn't squeeze through the doggy door, and the warm Kentucky air drifted in, filling the room with an atmosphere of relaxation. Scruffy was very happy to rest on his blubbery belly and munch on food all day! But for the sake of a concept called \"health\", his world was taken from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime at the humane society had been a nightmare. Scruffy was given food only three times a day and it tasted terrible. Instead of the bacon and beef Mommy would give him, Scruffy was fed a dry kibble that left him hungry afterwards. He would be taken out for a walk once or twice a day, and it was there that he realized how much his belly weighed him down as it threatened to scrape against the ground. Scruffy hated his walks. The humane society workers lamented over how hard it was to motivate Scruffy to do ANYTHING that would help him lose weight. Still, Scruffy did lose 17lbs of blubber. Scruffy felt less comfortable laying down on the concrete floor. He wished he could feel his belly spreading out around him but it wasn't there anymore... Well it was, but not nearly by Scruffy's limited perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here he was now. Being handed off in a carrier to a new owner. \"Good luck with his diet!\" One of the workers said with a hint of relief in her voice, since she knew it wasn't going to be her job to walk the unwalkable dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, and don't worry! I'm sure Scruffy will be the perfect size in no time!\" Said a voice that was now carrying Scruffy's mobile prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA door opened and closed. A car door opened and closed. A car engine revved up. Scruffy peered out of his carrier for the first time to see the face of his new owner. It was...</span></div></div>",

He had the tan of someone who worked outside often, which neatly met the dark blonde shade of his crew cut hair. His body suggested that he frequently visited the gym, but that he also enjoyed his fair share of meals. He had thick arms and pecs and probably had some nice abs under the small pooch of belly that sat around his waist. His thick, almost square jaw was lightly dusted with scruff and his eyes were hazel. All these details, of course Scruffy didn't notice. Scruffy just saw that he was a human and he wasn't familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive from the humane center took about 20 minutes. The sun was beginning to set and it's golden light set the inside of the car aglow. The car smelt like barbecue and it made Scruffy hungry again. He missed Mommy's barbecue chicken. He would always eat it up and beg for more. Scruffy sighed to himself and laid down to rest, but just then the car pulled into a driveway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScruffy couldn't see where he was, but he knew he was moving again. He whimpered when the man picked up his carrier and started walking to the door. \"I'm back!\" he called a semi-deep tone. Someone within the house stirred and head over to the door to greet the man.

The young man let Scruffy's carried onto the ground and let him out. Scruffy leapt out with joy and bounded around the woman. \"My baby, my baby!\" She fell to her knees and embraced her dog. \"Oh, Henry come and see! Brian brought our Scruffy back home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jus' bring him over here, Mary!\" Scruffy's \"Daddy\" called from his recliner in the living room. \"I ain't gettin' outa this chair if I don't have to.\" Henry spoke with a thick southern slur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's bring Scruffy to Grandpa,\" said Brian, the one who adopted Scruffy. Mary nodded. She tried to lift Scruffy with her feeble arms but she struggled. Brian knelt down to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just feel him! He's gotten so thin, poor baby!\" Mary lamented as Brian walked her back to the living room. \"What did they do to my baby?\" The tears were only beginning to slow their fall from her thick, rimmed glasses. Brian nodded before setting Scruffy down in front of Henry, who let out a hearty laugh that shook his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's the little guy! Tiny, ain't he?\" Henry leaned forward from his chair, causing his belly to bunch forward into rolls. \"It's a good thing that you've done, Brian. You're a good kid.\" He reached out and grabbed Brian's arm with his sausage-fingers. He gave his grandson's bicep a squeeze. \"Say, you've been looking pretty good. Think I could ever join you at the gym? He a body like yours? Or is it too late for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, grandpa, if Scruffy's gonna get back to normal he's gonna need a good role model for eatin' up!\" Brian chucked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I s'pose so!\" Henry reciprocated the laugh. \"And if anyone in this country knows how to grow a belly, it'd be me!\" He grabbed the sides of his belly to emphasize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just stick to what you're good at, grandpa.\" Brian gave a devilish wink. He then turned to his grandmother. \"Still, you two know you have to be careful now, right? The people at the humane society think I'll be taking care of Scruffy and that I'll be starving him more. You guys can't be seen with him. It'd probably be best if you kept him inside and fed. And you can't let my parents know about this. They're the ones who had Scruffy taken away in the first place, but I won't let that happen again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course. But do you think we should be careful about feeding him? Your parents did say he was getting a little fat...\" Mary said with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, grandma, you know that's silly! Scruffy's just got some extra layers of love.\" Brian knelt down to scratch Buddy behind the ears, massaging the roll of blubber around his neck. \"So much extra love... And the more love, the better right?\" His grandparents nodded, smiling.</span></div></div>",

I wish I could pet him!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I went to take a step but it made too much noise and the fox saw me. Scared he ran away into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<i>Ugh! I'm so stupid, he was so calm! With some luck he comes later</i> I trew the chunk of pork belly on the grass and went back inside, but as I was closing the door I saw the fox walking slowly towards the pork and then eat it ravenously, almost choking on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<i>oh little guy, you really like that huh?</i> I watched him inhale the small chunk in seconds, and when he was finished he just stood there looking at me from the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<i>Don't worry I'm going to get you some more!</i> I cutted a lot of small cubes of that greasy meat and left them on a plate on the door, just in front of me, to try and get him close. The fox ran towards the food, as if I wasn't there at all and started devouring it.<br>\r\nNow that the fox was close I could really see that he was in bad health, I needed to help him pack a little bit of weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<i>What if I pet him? maybe he bites me, but he is so CUTEE!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly aproached my hand to the fox and he was so focused on the food that he didn't even noticed it, as my hand touched him he stopped eating and just looked me straight in the eye and didn't move for a second, but then he went back to devouring the food I gave him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<i>Huh, so he really doesn't even care if I pet him! it's the best fox ever!!</i> I stood there petting him while he ate until eventually the food ran out. When that happened he just looked at me, and then left, dissapearing back into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Omg that was awesome! I need to give him some more tomorrow, he still locked hungry!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Much less having a wild animal as a pet. The fox spent all resting and eating, it was the opposite of what the internet said about this animals, but still, he was malnourished and it would probably get active once he got well, right? Oh boy was I wrong\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like the fox never got full, during the first week I increased the amount of food I gave him daily, and he still asked for more every time he finished it, screaming so loudly I just couldn\u2019t refuse to feed him more or the neighbors would notice I had such animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearing the second week of him living at my home, he seemed really healthy, or at least like on the photos I saw online. I couldn't bring him to a vet because foxes where banned as pets on my country, so I just took care of him following online forums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when I started weighting him as I could just pick him up like a house cat and he just let it happen.<br>\r\nThe first time I weighted him, he was 18 pounds, a little bit under what the internet said according to his size (he was big for a red fox).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was clear that he wasn\u2019t going to leave soon, I had to give him a name!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<i>How should I call him?</i>  I looked at him while he ate a bowl full of bacon I had just given him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<i> I mean, he really loves bacon, maybe I should call him that\u2026 Well, its a pretty stupid name, but he really deserves it, its like there\u2019s nothing other than bacon in this world for him, I try feeding him healthy things but the only things he wants are bacon and similar greasy things!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I just started calling him that, and by the forth week at home, he started really earning that name.<br>\r\nI weighted him at 26 pounds! Bacon was starting to go from skinny to normal, to overfed really fast, and it was no secret why that was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- <i>Omg, 8 pounds in 2 weeks? That can\u2019t be good for you!</i></span></div></div>",

Breakfast was probably Misty's favorite time of day, she got to eat, then rest awhile before she would go out and play in the back yard. While she was eating, Albert (her owner) grabbed his laptop bag and his coffee and gave her a pat on the head before rushing out the door to go to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Misty had finished eating, she wandered over to her pillow on the floor to rest for awhile. Then, she decided that she had some buisness to take care of, so she headed for the back yard (Albert left the back door open so she could go when she needed to). After doing that, she decided that it was a good time to see if there was anything new in the yard. She searched high and low, but everything seemed to be the same as yesterday. But wait, Misty thought she heard someone calling her name, but it was too early for Albert to be home. So where was it coming from? She wandered around and saw an elderly woman who had just moved in next door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you start wondering what is going on, let's get a little background info on our next door neighbor. Her chosen carreer before she retired, she worked at an animal shelter. Every day she saw extremely thin and lethargic dogs in need of some serious help. And after she retired, she grew older and less aware. Now her perception for every dog is that it isn't fed enough, so she is always trying to keep dogs from going hungry, even if they don't need it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, back to the storyline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had never seen this woman before, but she seemed kind and freindly, so Misty decided to greet her. Misty went over and greeted the woman, tail wagging, and the woman gave her a pat on head and then stared at Misty for a minute. Misty was slightly confused by the woman's reaction, but then she seemed to come back to normal. The old woman looked at Misty and asked \" are you hungry? You look starved\". And with that she went on her way back to her house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Misty was rather confused by the woman's sudden leaving, after all, she really didn't have a clue as to what she was saying. Well, except one word, food, that word made sense. Then the woman returned with a bowl and a can of dog food, she laid the bowl on the grass and dumped the contents of the can in the bowl. Misty was surprised that this woman was giving her food at this time of day, Albert only fed her in the morning and the evening, and she had already had breakfast. Did this lady mean that she got more food? She really didn't care, she scarfed up her second breakfast, liked the woman's hand, and retreated to the house, hunger sated once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good long sleep, Misty heard the woman calling her name again. What does she do?</span></div></div>",

With a grand yawn, the black and rusty orange dog got up from her fluffy blue bed and headed for the door, hearing the sounds and smells of breakfast being made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess was like most of her breed, fairly stocky through the chest, head and neck, with a thinning haunch that showed off all of the muscle her breed was known for.  She knew that when the good doctor and his wife had come in to the shelter that Princess had been dumped at after her last 'job' as a test subject at some laboratory, that they were a pair of the good humans.  They had been hesitant, after hearing her background, but the way that Mordachai, or Doctor as he was known to all the humans who came over and visited him, never took his eyes off of her, that was proof enough for her that they would soon be a family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she began to worry, she had never had a family before, all she knew was that when the big metal bowl was put in front of her, she was supposed to eat it.  But what if she did something that her new owners didn't like?  What if she got to be too big for them, she was a big dog, and hadn't finished growing yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fear and worry kept on even after all of the paperwork got signed and she was taken out to their car, loading up and laying down in the back of their minivan, much to the happiness and praise of both of them.  But her fear caused her to shake and shiver, which the humans believed to be her being afraid of going with them.  If only she could tell them how she really felt...The car ride home was short, and once they were out Princess was allowed to wander the front yard, smelling all the smells she could.  Then it was time to see her new home, which she was given a tour of in depth, they even had a room that was all hers, with a big bed, lots of toys, and a big food dish that they promised would never be empty....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was then, this was now, and while they still treated her like the royalty her name suggested, they were busy humans, and that meant that Princess spent a lot of time alone, or with the dog sitter, James.  If ever there was a human she could fall in love with, it was James.  While the Tedurani's gave her kibble, James cooked and fed her human food, food that she never knew could taste so good.  In fact, as she headed into the kitchen, it was James who was at the stove, already setting a large platter of sausage, bacon, eggs, and pancakes with butter down on the floor for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well good morning, Your Highness.\"  James said with a grin, giving Princess a rub under the chin and along the neck at the same time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess just barked twice and then dug into the food with snorts and sniffles of happiness, her tail wagging behind her in glee at seeing him, but especially at seeing the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was finished, and the dishes were done, it was time to spend time with her favorite human.</span></div></div>",

He read off a few to Princess, not really expecting an answer from her, and he didn't get one.  Finally he came across the old films, and an original copy of the movie Charolottes Web.  With a laugh James commented that he hadn't seen it in ages, and that Templeton reminded him of the greedy rotty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'sure, whatever.' Princess thought to herself as she licked the last of the grease and salt off her lips as James put the video in and settled down next to her, lightly petting and scratching over her belly with his fingers.  For some reason it just felt so much better when he did it than when Mr. and Mrs. Tedurani did.  He always seemed to casual with it, hitting all the spots she wished without ever meaning to.  With a groan, she got up into a sitting position and then flopped over the other way, so that her head rested in his lap, her brown eyes looking up to him with love and adoration, while he just enjoyed his movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the movie was over, and Princess was snoring on James' lap, her eyes having gotten heavy as she rested, but her subconscious had been working the whole time, hearing all the references to food during the famous Templeton Fair Scene.  Something about it clicked with her inner most self, a part of her that she had been granted while staying in the stark white lab, with the men who injected her with all sorts of things, the most prominant was a sort of chemical that they thought would help underfed and malnourished dogs put weight back on.  It had been a failed experiment at the time, but they did not realize that all that was needed was proper stimuli.</span></div></div>",
