He farted as the mess filled the back, bulging his jeans out. He smiled at the mess he made and straightened up, looking at Max.<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like I do have a reason now.\" He said, smirking as Ash grinned. Max crawled off and returned with a thick, babyish looking diaper, some powder, and a container of wipes. He told Ash to lay down, which he did, and unbuttoned his friends pants, sliding them off, then taking Ash's shirt off, leaving him in just a pair of soiled briefs. Ash smiled up at Max, as the sight of his friend in a thick diaper, dressed as a baby, and the feeling of the large mess squishing around in his underwear was giving him a raging hard-on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax just smiled and swiftly diapered Ash, having only a bit of trouble getting the diaper over Ash's cock. He patted the front and smiled when he was done. Ash sat up and hugged Max, his diaper crinkling. The padding was so thick Ash would probably barely be able to even toddle let alone walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly ___ felt a growing pressure in their bladder.</span></div></div>",

He was tired of the constant whining about the wet diaper that he had practically begged to be put into.  Max thought that Ash deserved the spanking and the forced silence of the pacifier.  Max decided to go one step further and stormed outside, slamming the cabin door behind him as a bit of a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's see how he reacts to that!\" Max thought to himself.  He went around the back of the cabin and peered through the small window so he could spy on Ash, who was just sitting on the floor in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was sitting on the floor for almost ten minutes before he dared to move any muscles.  He turned his head and looked around the cabin while sucking on his paci.  He felt ashamed, and he felt humiliated, but most of all he felt even more aroused than before.  All this domination coming from Max left him with filled with desire and wanting more.  He was suddenly aware of how the thick, wet diaper he was wearing pressed against his erection.  He slowly moved his right hand down to his crotch and he started to massage his erection through his diaper.  He moaned through the paci and closed his eyes, never even noticing Max looking through the back window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Max stood outside in his own diaper watching Ash intently, waiting for him to climax, he was formulating a plan in his head.  He planned to rush inside at the exact moment of Ash's orgasm in order to give Ash the fright of his life.  He started to move around the cabin to the front door.  He could hear the crinkling of Ash's diaper as he furiously pleasured himself.  Max decided that this was the right time to act and he threw the door open and stepped inside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh's eyes grew wide with surprise as he came in his diaper.  He moaned and blushed under Max's stern gaze.  He checked out Max's diaper.  As his pleasure subsided, Ash let his hand fall to his side in a combination of exhaustion and ecstasy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it looks like someone's been a naughty baby,\" said Max as he closed the door and moved towards Ash.  \"What should I do with you now?\" Max asked to himself...</span></div></div>",

Ash obeyed and whimpered as he crawled to the nursery, Max taking pictures of him, each one for one of Ash's friends and rivals, with an embarrassing detailing of what Ash had done. Once Ash had made it to the nursery, Max had taken enough photos for one of Ash's friends to have. Ash laid down on the floor and waited for Max to change him. \"Such a naughty baby!\" Max yelled at Ash. \"And you know what naughty babies deserve? Punishments! So, you're punishment is for all of your friends to see who you really are! A horny, baby boy!\" Max then showed Ash all the pictures that he took, Ash begging for him not release them to his friends, but Max didn't listen, but instead changed his messy diaper, and putting a pink chastity cage on it. \"So that baby doesn't get any naughtier than he already is.\" Max said.

Don't fret, I am not here to reveal your identity to the public. In fact, I am approaching you with a rather ludicrous offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy name is Miki Sakamoto, and I am the C.E.O of Young At Heart Incorporated, a rather prestigious corporation that sells the necessities for members of the ABDL community.

More specifically, you can consider her your \"Number 1 Fan\". As a matter of fact, I distinctly remember that she goes to the same school as you and some of your Sailor Scout friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you could already tell that she is one of our primary models for our F.A.B product line. Anyway, to put it simply, she wants you to be, in her words, her \"Super Duper Bestest Best Friend\", with the condition that you wear the exact same type of clothes as her, diapers included. In exchange for such compliance, my company will not just keep your identity as Sailor Mercury a closely guarded scpecret, but we will also heavily compensate you with whatever you desire. That is, if you decided to accept this offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSincerely,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Miki Sakamoto, <br>\r\nC.E.O of Young At Heart Incorporated\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, Amy was certainly in shock at such a revelation. After all, she covered every expense to avoid having someone discover the identities of her and the other Sailor Scouts.

After all, she was known to be rather meticulous when it came to the secrets of the Sailor Scouts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one hand, she should accept the offer this \"Miki Sakamoto\" character was giving her, maybe negotiate a way that doesn't involve disclosing their heroic identities to the public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut on the other hand, she wanted to instinctively decline such an embarrassing offer, which could result in recklessly allowing the Young At Heart Inc. C.E.O to disclose the identities of the Sailor Scouts to the public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, whilst thinking on her decision, she recognized the name \"Saiyuri Sakamoto\". Amy would always voluntarily assist with the girl's homework as a tutor. Saiyuri was a rather \"hefty\" girl, easily weighing in at little over 300 pounds in weight. And yet, Amy always found Saiyuri's initial behavior to be a little...\"childish\" for her age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, now Amy knew why Saiyuri behaved like a little girl: Probably because it was a Fantasy of her's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, two hours had passed, and Amy soon made up her mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went over to her family's cellular phone, dialed in the number written in the letter as a way to contact Mrs. Sakamoto. It rang for a brief moment or two, where Amy then heard a matronly woman's voice respond, \"...Hello? Who is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, is this Mrs. Miki Sakamoto? This is Amy Anderson speaking.\" Amy replied, confirming who she was to the called individual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Good to hear from you, Amy! So, I take it that your reason for calling me is that you want to accept my offer, then?\" Mrs. Sakamoto chirped, her tone changing from confused to chipper in a heartbeat. From there, Amy exhaled a deep sigh in response and answered, \"*sigh* ...Yes, Mrs. Sakamoto. I'm calling to accept your offer. Just...Is this call being recorded?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No~! Absolutely not, my dear! I wouldn't stoop myself to such a dreadful level of depravity, Amy. I take it that you are already \"properly dressed\" in the attire I have sent you, my dear?\" Miki queried, causing Amy to look back at the package full of infantile garments about her size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she returned her attention back to who she was speaking to and replied, \"Oh! Um... No, I haven't, Mrs. Sakamoto. I...I believe they're too big to fit on me properly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops! I'm terribly sorry, dear Amy. But not to worry, I will make sure you *ahem* \"properly\" fit into your new attire. I shall arrange some transportation for you. Look for a blue limousine.\" Mrs. Sakamoto chirped, where she then ended the conversation by hanging up the phone, thus ending the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

On the other hand, she wasn't entirely sure if she coukd trust the word of Mrs. Sakamoto, consider what has happened just now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"*sigh* I...I guess I have no choice but to go along with her demands.\"</i> She thought to herself, hearing the limousine chauffeur honk the horn once more.

Fortunately, she was in the clear, as the chauffeur then politely opened the rear door for her, gesturing her to enter inside the vehicle, to which she reluctantly complied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, she certainly wasn't accustomed to the sheer thickness of the diaper, especially since it was intentionally produced for someone much fatter in mind, since she occasionally had to pull the infantile garment upwards to avoid it slipping down to her ankles, despite her outfit's comfort and functionality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was inside the limousine, the chauffeur soon returned to the driver's seat, and proceeded to drive towards the intended destination for his escort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon sitting comfortably inside the limousine, the chauffeur soon pressed a few buttons, which revealed a large set of plattered foods and cuisines laid out before Amy, where she then asked, \"Um, excuse me, mister? What is with all the food here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...The food is for you, Ms. Mizuno.\" He flatly stated, keeping his eyes on the street due to his occupation. Confused as to what he meant, Amy shot a confused look at him and asked, \"...And...What does this entail?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...It is a request from Mrs. Sakamoto that you eat as much food as possible before your *ahem* <i>playdate</i> with her daughter, Ms. Saiyuri Sakamoto. That's all she said.\" He bluntly confirmed, which Amy acknowledged that the chauffeur was clearly on a strict \"Need-To-Know\" basis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as Amy sat back down her seat, she felt and heard the diaper crinkle audibly, causing her to blush profusely. She contemplated on her next move whilst she thought <i>\"...I got a feeling that this Mrs. Sakamoto wants to fatten me up or something...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little choice on the matter at hand, she stabbed a fork into some stirred beef, propping up to her mouth as she mentally thought, <i>\"But...It seems there's little choice in my predicament. *sigh* I just hope all of this nonsense is worth the trouble.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, as she took a small bite out of the stirred beef, her tongue made contact with the cooked cuisine.

Yet...something felt very off in her appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon further inspection, she soon deducted what was truly off-putting with her: She now looked as if she weighed 300 pounds heavier! In appearance, her body had ballooned outwards all over, from her now bulging belly, her somewhat ballooned breasts, her newly thicker legs, etc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd weirdly enough, her entire Sailor Scout uniform still managed to fit her, despite her now fattened waistline. \"...Wh-What has happened to me?\" She said confused, self-examining herself from head to toe, only for the chauffeur to calmly approach her as if it was a normal occurrence to him and calmly explained, \"Simple: You've been <i>properly</i> prepared for young Saiyuri, ma'am. After all, you are required to wear proper attire during your visit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Proper...attire?\"</i> She thought, initially confused as to what the driver said, only to then feel a rather puffy sensation wrapped around her butt and privates. Instinctively, she looked downwards, pulling up the hem of her blue skirt to then see something undoubtedly peculiar:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thick bulky diaper, which did little to hide under her outfit. It was neatly covered up by her Sailor Scout leotard, which now had a buttoned up diaper flap in the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, it was enough to entice a rather embarrassed blush upon her now chubby cheeks, to which the chauffeur then calmly came up behind her and quipped, \"...Now then, we best get you inside, m'lady. Don't want to keep them waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*sigh*</b> ...I suppose not.\" Amy admitted, almost in a defeated tone due to how embarrassed she actually was.

A grand staircase spilled itself out before her, with ruby carpeting and golden-trimmed rugs strewn about the main lobby of the household. Instinctively, she mentally noted, <i>\"...I guess she wasn't exaggerating when it came to her wealth. \"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mercury waddled through the Grand Hall, Amy then saw many pictures of an immense form that shocked her. So much so, she unintentionally wets her multiple diapers as she starts to tear up a little. And yet, she didn't notice that the eyes of the painting were crossed out and have been burned out. Mercury wondered why these people would worship this particular Mistress...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Why would there be so many paintings of Queen Beryl in one location?\"</i> Mercury thought to herself. However, such speculation soon took a backseat for the moment, as she suddenly heard an all too familiar voice she's heard just recently whilst it chirped, \"...Fascinating works of art, are they not?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy tries to reach for her cell phone that was shoved into her bra, as she tried to grab it and bring it out of her deep cleavage. It took her a couple minutes to grab the device, \"...I'm sorry. I just need my phone for a second.\" From there, she calls Mrs. Sakamoto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd upon dialing up the phone number, Amy soon heard the tell-tale signs of the recipient receiving her call. In turn, she instinctively turned to the source of the noise, to which she soon gaze upon a rather rotund woman waddling her way towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm grateful that you've accepted my offer, Miss Mercury. Welcome to my humble abode.\" She proclaimed, all but confirming her true identity to the obesely diapered Sailor Mercury. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...I take it that you're Mrs. Sakamoto, then?\" She cautiously asked, unable to ignore this strange tingling sensation in the back of her subconscious, as if being reacquainted with an old adversary that hasn't been seen for quite some time. In response, the rotund matronly woman gave a firm confirmative nod, acknowledging her identity towards the heavyset Sailor Scout in bulky padding.</span></div></div>",

Mattt showed Tai the photos and Tai fell to the floor. \"Where'd you get these?\" Tai asked. \"The where isn't really important. Now who's the bay. Not only do you wear briefs but you also wear pullups.\" There not pullups their Goodnites!\" Tai shot back. \"My brother is younger than you and he hasn't wet the bed in years. No way should our leader be such a baby. \"Guys hold him down!\" Matt said, and Joe and Izzy along with their digimon held Tai down. \"Agumon help me!\" Tai called. \"Sorry Tai but you were really mean, that's not very nice of you.\" Agumon answered. Tai struggled to get free but couldn't. \"Tk do the honors will you.\" Matt said. Tai watched in horror as Tk produced the items needed for a diaper change. Tk diapered Tai, and put a pacifier in his mouth. \"Spit it out and we break your face got it.\" Matt warned. Tai reluctantly kept the pacifier in. \"Here are the new rules. I'm the leader now. That's one. Two is that your now the baby of the group. You will be diapered at all times. Anyone of us can change you. Three is make Tk cry again and will show those photos to everyone in school. So does baby understand?\" Matt asked. Tai nodded his head and sobbed. \"Awe look baby's crying already.\" Tk said.    </span></div></div>",

However, Rika Nonaka wasn't the only one inside the bedroom who was wearing a pair of ludicrously thick diapers, for Renamon was now currently wearing a thick crinkly diaper around her fur-coated waist, courtesy of the injuries she received during her battle with the crazed Witchmon.

And boy, did such \"free time\" explicitly flaunt itself on both Digimon and Tamer, not just in their behavior, but also their waistlines as well. Over the past few months, Renamon developed a habit of cooking plentiful meals for her baby Rika, which were not just delicious, but also surprisingly fattening as well, causing Rika's lithe and petite body to plump up in a noticeable fashion, complete with thicker thighs, plumper butt, slightly larger breasts, a slightly fuller face, and a small but noticeable paunch of a belly pooching outward against the waistband of her thick diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Rika Nonaka wasn't the only one who was becoming a bit fatter, as Renamon was quickly catching up to the diapered Tamer in the \"body filling up with adipose\" department, due to the anthropomorphic fox Digimon test-tasting much of her own handmade delicacies. Then again, Renamon has heard of the phrase, \"Never trust a skinny chef\", so one would say that Renamon took those words to heart, both figuratively and literally. In turn, this gave Renamon a measly 10 to 20 pound head start on Rika when it came to which of the two of them was the fattest one of the diapered duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFast forward to present day, as both Renamon and Rika were sleeping soundly. But as the sun's rays dimly shone through the windows into the bedroom, it slowly began to stir the plump diapered Renamon from her slumber, sluggishly stretching her slightly chubby furry arms while exhaling a long yawn. From there, she rubbed the sleep from her eyes, as she looked down at the unconscious Rika, who was still in a state of peaceful slumber, sucking on a baby blue adult-sized pacifier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, their weights weren't the only noticeable signs of change to the plump diapered Digimon and Tamer, for Rika's bedroom now had a more infantile atmosphere to it, complete with a brand new bed that was equipped with custom-built crib bars, as Rika was currently a fleece Renamon-themed onesie, which had a yellow hood with cute floppy Renamon ears on it, along with a pair of Renamon hind paw booties equipped on her feet, all while the overall ensemble did little to conceal how adorably plump the once cold-hearted Rika had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, Renamon couldn't help but display a warm motherly smile toward seeing her Tamer dressed up in such an adorably cute and infantile display, as Renamon gently rubbed her left paw-like hand along the side of Rika's arm and slightly tubby waist in a soothing manner. Although she initially didn't want to become a mother, the plump fox Digimon was sure glad she was one now, taking care of Rika as if she was her own Renamon Kit.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Although, as much as she wanted to continue watching Rika sleeping like a baby (No pun intended), Renamon knew that the infantile Tamer needed to wake up for the day, as the plump motherly fox Digimon began to lightly shake Rika back and forth to stir her from slumber. \"Rika-chan, it's time to wake up~~\" Renamon said in a sing-song tone, which was fortunately successful in stirring the diapered Rika from her peaceful slumber, as the chubby infantile Tamer slowly rose up to a sitting position on the bed, stretching her arms outward and emitting a loud yawn in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ermmm... *yawn* Good morning, Renama-ma.\" Rika said, turning her hooded head to look at her Digimon caretaker with a reassured smile on her face. In response, Renamon gently patted Rika on the top of her hooded head, giggling slightly and replied, \"*giggle* Good morning to you too, my little Rika-chan. Do you need a diaper change?\" Of course, upon hearing of such a question, Rika swiftly nodded in confirmation, as the plump infantile girl easily felt how damp and bloated her diaper had become overnight underneath her hooded Renamon onesie, which brought up a blush upon her slightly fuller face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, such blushing soon dissipated when Rika noticed that her Renama-ma also had a wet diaper as well, causing the plump diapered Tamer to giggle profusely and said, \"*giggle* It seems I'm not the only one with a wet diaper.\" Obviously, this quickly reminded Renamon that she was also in need of a diaper change as well, as she then gave Rika a motherly smile and answered, \"*giggle* ...Well, it seems you're certainly right on that, my dear Rika-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Renamon unlatched the bars, thus allowing Rika to waddle over toward the changing table, with the plump diapered Renamon following closely behind her infantile Tamer. Once the diapered duo reached the adult-sized changing table, Rika soon propped herself up onto the surface of the changing table, where Renamon unbuttoned the front of Rika's hooded Renamon onesie for easier access to the damply padded undergarment. Of course, Renamon had already become accustomed to changing Rika's diapers (as well as her own) by now due to experience, as she untaped the diaper tapes and disposed the damp undergarment into a nearby trash bin, balling it up in the process. Then, shortly after cleaning Rika's crotch area with a baby wipe, the plump fox Digimon pulled out a fresh clean diaper from an already open package, as she administered baby powder upon Rika's private area before placing a new thick diaper around the plump Tamer's nether regions, sealing Rika in a fresh padded undergarment via clasping the four diaper tapes onto the front of the diaper. \"There we go, Rika-chan: A fresh, clean diaper.\" Renamon said, patting the thickly padded crotch of the diaper several times, causing it to emit these loud crinkling sounds in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, as Rika stepped down from the changing table, Renamon propped herself onto the changing table as well, repeating the same process she performed on the plump infantile Tamer previously, only she was performing this on herself. Fortunately, Rumiko, Rika's mother, managed to find some diapers specifically made for Renamon, especially since the types of diapers that Renamon uses happen to have a small hole in the back, perfect for her yellow vulpine tail to poke through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after Renamon sealed herself in a fresh clean diaper, Rika had returned from brushing her teeth in the bathroom. After all, even though the plump infantile Tamer wasn't allowed to use the toilet anymore, Renamon still allowed Rika to use the bathroom in order to brush her teeth, but not to take a bath by herself. By now, Rika had already been stripped of the hooded Renamon onesie she wears to bed, now currently standing in front of Renamon, wearing nothing but her thick padded diaper and a pink bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Renamon dismounted from the changing table, facing her beloved but plump diapered Tamer, bearing a tender motherly smile upon her vulpine snout and asked, \"Is there anything you would like to wear for today, my little Rika-chan? Your mother and I managed to buy these two new outfits just for you.\" Then, Renamon swiftly presented two uniquely different but equally infantile outfits to Rika, as the plump diapered fox Digimon held one outfit in one arm and the other outfit in the other arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon closer examination of the first outfit dangling from Renamon's left arm, Rika could make out what it was. In appearance, it was a pair of babyish adult-sized overalls, made from a combination of baby purple silk and fleece. However, the pants part of the overalls were noticeably puffy, which did little to conceal the fact that the wearer was potentially wearing a thick bulky diaper underneath, as it displayed a buttoned up flap on the front for easier diaper changes. Also, the overall's pant leg length were akin to girly shorts, but were compensated by the appearance of these thigh-high baby purple and white striped stockings, along with a pair of adorable purple baby booties. Finally, the outfit also included a larger version of Rika's old T-Shirt, but with a whole red heart instead of a broken red heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Rika then shifted her focus onto the second outfit dangling from her Renama-ma's right arm. In appearance, the outfit was a baby red silk onesie, complete with big puffy pant legs, and a poofy frilly skirt adorned around the outfit's waist, imitating a \"Big Baby Princess\" vibe in it's infantile appearance. Eventually, after much consideration and much blushing, Rika inevitably decided to wear..,</span></div></div>",

Now then, I'll be in the kitchen making breakfast, should you need me.\" Renamon replied, as she neatly folded up the other outfit and placed it in the nearby clothes cabinet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Renamon proceeded to exit out of the bedroom and towards the kitchen, all whilst having a noticeable waddle in her movement due to the thickness of her legitimately thick diaper clinging to her plump waist and hips. Once she reached the kitchen, Renamon stood there in front of the stove and oven, putting a paw-like thumb to the bottom of her vulpine snout and thought, \"Hmm... I wonder what I should make for Rika and myself today. Belgian Waffles? No, that's so plain. French Toast? Nah, too boring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Renamon finally decided on which breakfast she wanted to serve to Rika, snapping her paw-like fingers as she exclaimed, \"I know: Blueberry Pancakes!\" And with that, Renamon swiftly began to work on cooking a scrumptious stack of Blueberry Pancakes for her plump diapered Rika Nonaka. Meanwhile, as Renamon was cooking up a storm in the kitchen, Rika was preoccupied with dressing herself up for the day, as she equipped the large T-Shirt upon her chubby upper body. From there, she moved onto the baby purple silk and fleece overalls, putting each plump leg through one leg hole at a time, then pulling the babyish garment upward to cover up her ludicrously bulky diaper, as she hoisted the overall's straps onto her shoulders with relative ease, thus securing her in the adult-sized infantile garment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after equipping the infantile overalls and large T-Shirt, Rika then focused on the thigh-high baby purple and white striped stockings, as she grabbed the left stocking and swiftly pulled it up along her plump left leg, which was a slightly loose but ample fit upon her leg. Then, the plump diapered Tamer performed the same process on her right leg, thus completing her infantile ensemble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finally getting dressed for the day, Rika braided her hair (which now reached halfway down her back) into a form-fitting braided ponytail, which was made easier due to the plump infantile Tamer letting her brown hair grow longer over the course of 5 months. Once that minor task was finished, Rika then began to examine herself in the full-body mirror propped up on a nearby wall, taking in every angle of her adorably cute appearance, along with shaking her plump diapered butt in front of the mirror once or twice out of amusement, just as her thickly padded diaper emitted these audible crinkling sounds underneath the silk and fleece overalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that was said and done, Rika calmly waddled out of her bedroom, only to see...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Inevitably, once she was finished getting properly dressed, Rika waddled out of her bedroom, through the Living Room, and towards the Kitchen. However, when the kitchen came into view, Rika was greeted by quite a delicious sight: a foot-tall stack of Blueberry Pancakes, drenched in a light coating of Maple Syrup. In response, the diapered Tamer couldn't help but drool a little from such a scrumptious cuisine laid out before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, while her gaze was transfixed on the blueberry-filled flapjacks, Rika became unaware of Renamon sneaking up behind her, as she spoke toward the infantile Tamer with a motherly tone and said, \"*giggle* My, my... It seems you're drooling with excitement, my little Rika-chan.\" Shortly after speaking, Renamon then used her right paw-like hand to pat Rika's thickly diapered behind a few times in a teasing manner, as each pat emitted these loud crinkling sounds from Rika's diaper. Of course, this easily snapped Rika out of her almost gluttonous stupor, as the infantile Tamer yelped out an audible \"EEP!\" in response, where she then saw Renamon waddle off to the side, which easily showed off the fox Digimon's own thickly padded diaper as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Renama-ma! You scared me!\" Rika yelped, wiping her mouth clean of drool with a left arm, as she gently rubbed her thickly padded diapered butt with a right hand in response to her motherly Digimon's surprise coddling. \"*giggle* My sincerest apologies, Rika-chan. I find you to be rather adorable when you're drooling like an infant for a minute there.\" Renamon replied, as she sat herself down at the table with her own plate of blueberry pancakes and a glass full of orange juice. From there, Rika soon followed suit, as she waddled toward the opposite chair and sat down alongside Renamon, hearing the audible crinkle of her thick bulky diaper from merely sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, just as she was about to dig in, Renamon swiftly stopped her, as she tied an adult-sized bib around Rika's neck. And with that, Rika began to greedily cut into the stack of pancakes, as she then began to devour mouthful after mouthful of delicious blueberry flapjack goodness, tasting the syrup-coated morsels with each deliberate bite. Of course, due to Renamon's refined cooking skills, the infantile Rika had slowly but surely developed a noticeably increased appetite, which in turn, resulted in the diapered Tamer's plump and softer physique, a far cry from Rika's original but petite physiology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, Rika wasn't the only one binging on blueberry pancakes, as Renamon was devouring equally large bites as well, only with much more etiquette. But eventually, after roughly 45 minutes of eating, both Rika and Renamon were able to finish off each of their plates, which resulted in both the diapered Digimon and Tamer to have quite the stuffed stomachs, causing their bellies to noticeably bloat outward by an inch or two. \"Uuugh... So... Full...\" Rika moaned, as she felt her body still digesting the food she has consumed. Fortunately, Renamon wrapped her slightly plump arms around Rika, and began to lightly pat the plump diapered Tamer's back until... UUURRRP!!\" Rika burped, which released the excess gas inside her taut stomach, giving her a bit of relief from a overly stuffed belly, courtesy of her Renama-ma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There now. Feeling better?\" Renamon asked, as Rika nodded in confirmation and answered, \"Yes. Thank you, Renama-ma!\" \"*giggle* Aww, you're welcome, my little Rika-chan.\" Renamon replied, who emitted a light burp as well moments later, excusing herself for such rude behavior. However, out of curiosity, Renamon then spoke toward the chubby infantile Tamer and asked, \"So, Rika-chan... I take it that you have something planned for the day then?\" Obviously, Rika indeed had something planned for today, because...</span></div></div>",

So, when will your playmates arrive?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, pretty soon, I hope!\" Rika giggled, playing with her portable game device as a minor distraction. Sure, she and Renamon have decided to embrace the Big Baby lifestyle, but that didn't mean relieving themselves of adolescent and adult activities such as playing video games or watching scary movies. But still, they certainly weren't complaining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, just as Rika had beaten the game's boss, her cell phone started ringing, picking it up and seeing that she received a text from one of her friends, Miku, which read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hey, Rika-Baby! Ready for the playdate at ur house?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Rika casually tossed aside her game device and rapidly texted: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hella yeah! R u bringing the diapers? The huge ones?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after sending the text, a few minutes passed by until a reply came back, which read: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh yeah!

Tell Renama-ma I said hi!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing of this, Rika soon squealed with ecstatic glee and excitement, akin to a toddler receiving a brand new toy or given a big lollipop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing her Tamer's excitement, Renamon, who soon wetted her diaper moments ago whilst washing the dishes, displayed a motherly smile and chortled, \"Ooooh! It sounds like <i>someone</i> is rather excited today.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am excited, Renama-ma! Miku, Rei, and Sayaka are bringing their Digimon over. He-heee!\" Rika retorted, who did a little childish dance, hopping a little, causing her chubby diapered butt to bob up and down whilst she did so, as the thickly padded undergarment crinkle loudly in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Renamon soon found herself a little excited herself, especially since she'll be seeing Rika's friends' Digimon again, which were a female Gatomon, Biyomon, and a female Dorumon. Sure, she was more accustomed to seeing Guilmon, Terriermon, Impmon, and the other Tamer Digimon, but socializing with other like-minded Digimon was undoubtedly not a bad thing for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was finished with drying the dishes, Renamon soon tended to her now damp diaper, speaking to her favorite Tamer and said, \"I'll be changing myself into a clean diaper if you need me, my little Rika. Is that alright with you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggle* Not at all, Renama-ma! You wear diapees as well.\" Rika childishly quipped, giggling with contentful glee at how Renamon is diapered like her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Rika preoccupied herself with watching some cartoons on TV, she soon heard the doorbell ring, which prompted her to get up and toddle over to the door.

What about us, Rika-Baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Rika peered over behind the mildly chubbier diaper-wearing girl to see both Rei and Sayaka toddling inside the house, along with their Digimon companions, which strangely enough, seemed to be wearing some diapers of their own as well, along with some equally adorable ensembles!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiku's Gatomon undoubtedly had the most frilly outfit of the trio of Digimon, equipped in a baby pink onesie with a poofy frilly short skirt around the waist area of the outfit, which did little to conceal the bulk of her respective diaper due to her stubby legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Rei's Biyomon, known to be the more naive of the trio, wore what appeared to be a pair of fluffy footsie pajamas, with said footsies shaped to better fit Biyomon's avian feet. Much like Gatomon, there was the unmistakable crinkly bulge of a diaper underneath the outfit ensemble, complete with Biyomon's tail feathers jutting out from the rear of the infantile clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, last but certainly not least, there was the metaphorical <i>\"Mammothmon In The Room\"</i>; Sayaka's female Dorumon. Out of the three dog-sized Digimon, Dorumon undoubtedly had quite the thickest diaper of the three, much to Dorumon's utter reluctance, judging from what Rika could see from the begrudging expression on Dorumon's snout, who also bore quite the embarrassed blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, as for her outfit ensemble, it was certainly a custom-tailored ensemble due to Dorumon's saurian-esque physique, as Dorumon huffed a frustratingly embarrassed demeanor, her arms crossed in a fidgety manner due to how much the absurdly thick diaper crinkled and explicitly forced her stance into a profound waddling gait. And to make matters even more embarrassing for the tomboyish Digimon, Dorumon was put in a frilly baby blue dress, where the frilly skirt trim was so short she was unable to hide her diaper whatsoever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, Rika couldn't help but let out a light chuckle at Dorumon's embarrassing predicament, then coyly said, \"*giggle* That's quite the diapee you have on, Dorumon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Dorumon blushed even more until she was a beet red instead of a mauve hue, her hind legs bending inwards out of timid meekness, to which the embarrassed Digimon abruptly rebuffed, \"Sh-Sh-Shush it, human! I-I-It isn't like I wa-wa-wanted to we-wear something so...So--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--Infantile? Oh hush now, Dorumon. You look absolutely adorable!\" Sayaka interjected, to which she promptly committed a few audible pats on her Dorumon's diapered posterior, which made the Digimon quiver in quite a timid mess, as the rest of the group toddled inside Rika's house, with the three girls wearing quite an assortment of babyish garments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as both Miku and Rika promptly severed their friendly embrace, Rika could easily see that Rei was currently carrying a total of three large grocery-sized bags stuffed with the diapers that they mentioned over the text messaging, to which a smile grew upon Rika's slightly fuller face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, as they toddled their way deeper into the Nonaka household, Rei spoke toward Rika and asked, \"...Say, speaking of diapered Mons, where's your Renama-ma at, anyway?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I figured you'd mentioned me quite so soon, Rei-Rei. *giggle*\" Renamon cheekily quipped, whose voice originated from where Rika last saw her diapered Renama-ma; The kitchen. As the group made it to the kitchen area, Renamon had just finished up making a fresh batch of treats, as her overly-padded diaper jutted out from the pink frilly apron she donned sometime ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, they noticed something rather noticeable on the vulpine Digimon; the front of her bulky diaper was taking on a light yellow tint to it's patterned design, to which Miku cheekily joked, \"*giggle* Well, looks like Renama-ma certainly needs a change!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggle* My apologies, Miku-chan.

As you can clearly see, I've apparently taking up baking as a hobby. *giggle* Pretty ironic, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say! Considering what Rika-chan told us about you prior to her coming out, I wouldn't believe it either!\" Miku chirped, the smell of a fresh batch of cookies becoming rather tempting to say the least, where she then meekly asked, \"...M-Mind if I--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--Have one? *giggle* Why of course, Miku-chan! I made all of this for Rika and her friends, haven't I?\" Renamon cutely interjected, giving Miku permission to take one of the Renamon cookies, to which Miku voluntarily plucked one from the tray, biting off the cookie's left ear in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Renamon toddled over to the living room coffee table where the others were sitting, casually placing the still-warm tray upon it's surface, where she then matronly chirped, \"Here you go, girls! A nice, fresh batch of cookies~! Now, if you'll excuse, it seems I'll be needing a change soon. Don't cause too much of a ruckus, do you hear?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, Renama-ma!\" Rika chuckled, as the rest of the diapered entourage toddled over to the couch for a midday snack before lunch, while the chubby diapered Renamon cutely toddled back into the bedroom, most likely to get changed into a fresh clean diaper no doubt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"*sigh* I must admit...this new lifestyle Rika and I have chosen...\"</i> Renamon thought, stripping herself of the adorable frilly apron she wore and discarding it onto a coat rack, passing by a full-body mirror, thus getting a good glimpse of her now chubbier form. Momentarily, she stopped to view her reflection, slowly twisting and turning get at every angle as she mentally continued, <i>\"*giggle* If only Impmon could see me now...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the left of the mirror, Renamon could easily pick out the stacks of diaper packages neatly stacked together on the carpet floor, a cheeky but blushing curve of her lips appearing in the process, as she pulled out a thick bulky pair of Digimon diapers from an opened package, as another thought slithered into her mind, noting her newly acquired pudge as she traced her baby fat bump with a calm paw-like hand as she self-noted, <i>\"...But still, I never thought in a million Digi-Cycles would I be \"letting myself go\", as the humans would say.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back onto the current topic of notice, Renamon could clearly feel how warm her wet diaper was at this point, patting it once with a free hand and noted, <i>\"Well... I guess I better get myself changed then.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had become a regular routine for Renamon, given how she was now rendered incontinent from her battle with a crazed Witchmon sometime ago. And yet, it felt a little bit of a blessing in disguise, as it were. Turns out some big fancy corporation was interested in making diapers for Digimon, and they approached her with an offer to be both their model and tester for their products, hence how the two could afford the <i>infantile</i> renovations, one would say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>==1 Minute and 25 Seconds Later...==</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Renamon was able to change herself into a fresh diaper with relative ease, as she double to triple-checked to make sure she was properly secured in the crinkly puffy undergarment. Suffice to say, due to the ludicrous bulk of said undergarments, Renamon had already gotten accustomed to toddling and waddling about like a human toddler or infant would. Though, she wouldn't admit this loud, but she actually liked the way the diapers felt pressing her digitgrade legs apart. In a way, she almost wished they gave her some thicker ones to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was finished inspecting herself, Renamon toddled over to the nearby closet to choose an outfit to wear for the day, which ultimately came down to...</span></div></div>",

Beastboy was skeptical. He thought Robin's smelled wet. \"Dude did you wet your pants.\" Beastboy said. Robin wondered how Beastboy knew, aw he forgot about Beastboy's sense of smell. \"I ah... I did.\" Robin finally came clean. Robin was so embarrassed. Beastboy was in aw at the fact that his fearless leader was a bed wetter. Robin told Beastboy to promise not to tell anyone. Beastboy was a gossip it was hard for him not to say anything. Yet for Robin's sake he didn't tell a soul. Robin continued to wet the bed. Beastboy was the on;y one that knew.

It had been difficult to hide it from the other Titans but they somehow pulled it off. Just recently however it had gotten a lot harder as Robin's condition had gotten worse and he was starting to wet himself in the middle of the day now. They had both decided it was for the best if he wore some form of protection during the day, just in case, so now Robin was wearing Pull-Ups full time, except for at night when he would wear thicker night time diapers so he didn't leak. Because of the change in Robin's condition Beast Boy was now caring for him 24/7, changing his diapers whenever he needed. Robin could probably do it himself but every time Beast Boy told him that he refused stating that the other teen did a much better job, Beast Boy really didn't mind though, he kind of enjoyed it, it made him feel responsible and needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we may need to start putting you in diapers full time, Robby. These Pull-Ups just aren't cutting it anymore.\" Beast Boy said to Robin, using a nickname he had started calling him. Robin laid on his bed on top of a changing mat as Beast Boy changed his nearly dripping Pull-Up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm'kay\" Robin said, his thumb finding it's way into his mouth, a habit he had picked just recently. Robin let his eyes slip closed as Beast Boy slid a thick diaper under him and quickly powdered his bum before taping the diaper shut. He watched Robin suck on his thumb with worry in his eyes, he had been noticing his friends condition getting progressively worse. He was more needy, always wanting to be with Beast Boy, he couldn't go to bed by himself anymore, Beast Boy had to stay with him until he fell asleep, and his day time accidents were getting even worse, in fact Beast Boy couldn't even remember the last time he saw Robin use a toilet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one thing Beast Boy couldn't deny though, Robin enjoyed being taken care of. He wasn't sure why, but every time he changed Robin's diapers he just looked so at peace and calm and care-free; the total opposite of how usually was. He had no clue where Robin's new personality was coming from, but if he enjoyed it as much as Beast Boy did than he wanted to make sure he was happy as could be. Beast Boy looked at Robin, the teen was sound asleep in nothing but his diaper, sucking on his thumb. He smiled before covering him up and turning off the lights so he could nap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Robin was asleep Beast Boy went to the store to go get some more supplies for him since he was running low.</span></div></div>",

He turned on the light and set down his bag as he walked over to Robin to wake him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robby, baby time to wake up.

Robin stirred slightly and his eyes opened to see Beast Boy looking down at him, the teen grinned big at him but his smile quickly turned into a frown and he started to whimper, tears forming in his eyes. Beast Boy noticed this and looked at him sympathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong baby?\" Beast Boy asked, wiping away a few tears that had spilled over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I made a-a poopy.\" Robin said in between sobs. It was then that the smell hit Beast Boy's nose and he cringed, he had absolutely no idea how he missed that smell. The green titan pulled back the covers to reveal that Robin had indeed made a mess in his diaper. </span></div></div>",

So you don't get it on anything else.\" Beast boy comforted him, wiping away his tears and using his baby talk. Robin's stuck his thumb in his mouth and sniffled nodding his head, when Beast Boy saw this he remembered something and reached down into his bag that was on the floor and pulled out a black and red pacifier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here Robby, suck on this instead. we need to kick that thumb sucking habit, it's not good for your little fingers.\" He said as he pulled Robin's thumb out of his mouth and quickly replaced it with the pacifier. Shockingly, Robin didn't put up any protest at all, he quickly started sucking on the pacifier and even stopped sniffling. Beast boy helped Robin lay back and reached into his bag to pull out the necessary supplies to change Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's get you out of this messy diaper. What do you say?\" Beast boy said cheerfully, Robin just nodded his head a giggled. Beast Boy undid the tapes on Robins diaper and pulled it down, he started wiping Robin's bottom and around his crotch before he balled up the diaper and threw it away. The younger teen pulled out a new, more babyish diaper than the plain white one Robin had been wearing, this one had pictures of cute little teddy bears on it and was thicker than the ones Robin had been wearing. Beast Boy quickly put the diaper on him and applied baby powder before taping it up snug around his waist. Beast boy reached into his bag and pulled out a baby blue onesie to put on Robin since he couldn't put the boy's tights on over his diaper. Beast boy pulled it over Robin's head and snapped the crotch together before helping Robin sit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hungy Bee.\" Robin said around the pacifier and as if on cue Robin's stomach growled. That was another thing Beast Boy had noticed about Robin was that his speech and vocabulary had become very juvenile. Just recently his motor skills had gotten the same way, Robin could barely turn door knobs now, much less tie his shoe on his own. Robin stood up and took Beast Boy's hand as they walked to the kitchen, Beast Boy didn't miss the fact that Robin was practicly leaning on him the whole walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's get something to fill up that tummy of yours.\" Beast Boy said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Beast Boy popped open the can of baby food and grabbed a plastic spoon as he scooped out a spoon full and stuck it into Robin's mouth. The sixteen year old hero smiled and quickly swallowed the mush, opening his mouth back up for more. Beast Boy chuckled and gave him another spoon full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really like this stuff, don't you?\" He said as he fed him some more. How Robin had managed to get baby food all the way up to his forehead was a mystery but Beast Boy laughed as he finished feeding Robin and began wiping his face with a warm wash cloth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I firsty, Bee.\" Robin stated simply as he hopped down from the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you? Well I guess will just have to fix that then.\" Beast Boy said as he walked over to the fridge and pulled out a bottle of baby formula he had put in there earlier. Beast Boy figure robin could probably use the nutrients since he wasn't eating adult food anymore. Beast Boy picked up the older teen, a feat he was proud to say he mastered, and rested him on his hip as he walked towards the large couch. Beast boy sat down and cradled Robin as he brought the teat of the bottle to his lips. Robin quickly took the nipple into his mouth and wasted no time sucking down the white liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow down, Robby.

Yuzu had a tendency to overreact a little when it came to stuff like this, a trait that she picked up from their dad unfortunately. Not to mention if she found out she would probably tell their dad and that would make things horrible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo gathered everything up and walked over to his door, since Yuzu hadn't said anything he assumed she had gone back down stairs. Ichigo poked his head out the door and checked to see if anyone was around before sneaking out into the hall and rushing over to the washing machine. As soon as Ichigo had thrown the soiled laundry into the wash he ran back to his room and quickly flipped the mattress over and remade his bed, he didn't have time to worry about cleaning it right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo grabbed the air freshener off of his desk and sprayed a generous amount into the air, making sure to spray a little more by his bed. He started keeping some after the accidents began so that he didn't have to worry about his room smelling of urine all the time. Satisfied, Ichigo put down the aerosol and sat down on his bed. The part time Soul Reaper sighed loudly and rested his head in his hands, weaving his fingers into his bright orange hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>'I need to figure out something, I can't keep this up. I hardly get any sleep anymore, this is getting harder to hide from everyone, and it's just making me even more stressed... I really don't want to do this, but I-I guess it's time I looked into some protection. I was hoping it would just go away, but that obviously isn't gong to happen. Crap, this sucks!'</b></i> Ichigo got up off of his bed and made his way downstairs to eat breakfast, afterward he would go down to the local convenience store and grab some protection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was happy it was a Saturday, otherwise he wouldn't be able to go get what he needed after breakfast. It was the perfect time to go, his dad would be starting work for the day and Karin and Yuzu would be too busy worrying about the mornings chores to pay attention to him. After Ichigo had sat down with his sisters and began eating he noticed that his dad was no where to be seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWhere's dad? He's not gonna eat with us?\u201d</b> Ichigo asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cHe said he was skipping breakfast for today, he had to go run some errands before he had to be back here for work.\u201d</b> Karin said semi-monotonously as she ate her rather large breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cOh, okay. So we probably won't see him until tonight, huh?\u201d</b> Ichigo asked trying to hold in his excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cProbably not.

The Soul Reaper walked into the store and avoided eye contact with the perky teenage cashier that greeted him as he made a beeline for the personal care aisle. He looked up and down the aisle not seeing anything remotely related to what he wanted, so he moved on to the next aisle over. After about three aisles Ichigo finally found what he was looking for. Well, almost...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>'None of these are for adults. None. You would think there would be at least one package of adult... diapers.'</b></i> Ichigo thought to himself, still not wanting to admit that was what he was here for; diapers. He looked over the aisle for a second time, and then a third, still nothing. The closest thing he could find to what he needed was a package of Huggies brand Pull-Ups. They were the largest size that they made, so they would probably fit him well, but there was no way he was going to humiliate himself even more by buying those. Adult diapers were bad enough, but this was just torture. Ichigo scanned the aisle one last time, hoping to find a package in the back that he missed, but no such luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>'I cannot go another night without...something. It looks like I don't have a choice...'</b></i> Ichigo sighed loudly and grabbed the package of Pull-Ups and some rash cream and wipes and made his way over to the register. He set all of the items down on the counter so that the cashier could ring them up, Ichigo just watched awkwardly as she placed them into a bag, grateful he didn't know her personally. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was on that path home that he noticed a familiar tightness in his stomach, so he picked up the pase a little to get home faster and get to a bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ichigo was walking home as briskly as possible the sensation in his lower stomach kept getting stronger, painfully so. He tried to ignore it but was almost unbarable. Suddenly, and without warning, Ichigo's bladder just let go, and the young teenager stood just watching in shame and emmbarrasment as he wet himself in broad daylight. He was unable to stop it and when he was finally finished he simply looked around not knowing what to do. He felt like he was on the verge of tears, and he was lucky there was no one around to see or he might have actually been crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo took the bag that was in his hands and quickly covered up his front area with it as he made a mad dash back to his house. The orange haired male opened the door slightly and peaked his head inside to make sure no one was around before he darted inside and went straight up to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he made it inside safely he shut and locked the door and threw the package of Pull-Ups onto the bed. Ichigo sat down and threw his head into his hands as he silently sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>'What is happening to me?! I'm turning into a mess!'</b></i> Ichigo thought to himself rather pittyfully. He stood up and began to strip himself of the soiled garments, throwing them into a corner for now. Ichigo went to open his dresser to grab a new pair of boxers but had a sudden thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"I have no idea if this going to happen again, hopefully not, but I can't afford to ruin anymore clothes...\"</b> Ichigo said outloud as he reluctantly grabbed the bag of Pull-Ups and used his teeth to rip it open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy slid one of the thin diapers out of the package and looked it over, turning it in his hands and feeling it. It was mostly blue and had the character Buzz Lightyear from Toy Story on it, it even had a rocket ship on the crotch that dissappered when it was wet. Ichigo breathed out slowly before opening it up and stepping into it, he pulled it up around his waist and made sure it fit right everywhere. It fit his frame surprisingly well and was rather comfortable. A light pink blush formed on his cheeks as he saw what he looked like in the mirror, the teen quickly pulled on his pants and tried to move on like it was just any other day.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The boy simply went upstairs and changed the soiled Pull-Up in silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kurosaki family had just finished their supper for the night and Ichigo was walking back up to his room when he heard a very faint beeping noise, one that he was very familiar with. As he entered his room he looked on top of his night stand and, sure enough, his Soul Reaper pass was flashing, indicating there was a Hollow around. The ginger male sighed and grabbed the badge, pressing it to his chest. His human body fell limp to the floor and Ichigo, now dressed in his Soul Reaper clothes, stood in it's place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo picked up his body and placed it in the bed and under the blankets before he hopped out his bedroom window and ran off in search of the Hollow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until Ichigo ran into an open field in a park area that he saw the beast. The Hollow easily towered five feet over Ichigo, it had large feet and a long beefy tail, thick tentacles were in the place of it's arms. It's head was small in comparison to the rest of it's body and it doned a Hollow mask that vaguely resembled a feline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hollow currently had a Plus wrapped in one of it's large tentacles as it prepared to eat it but stopped once Ichigo made his presence known. The creature turned it's head to look at the Soul Reaper and dropped the Plus to the groud. It roared loudly before sending one of it's tentacles in Ichigo's direction. To his surprise it streched all the way to where he was standing at an alarming rate and he had to dodge out of the way quickly, barely making it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe Hollow sent another tentacle in Ichigo's direction and the boy attempted to dodge again, however, his reaction time was worse and the tentacle scraped by his arm. His sleeve ripped open and a small trail of blood trickled out of where the Hollow had made contact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo noticed the the Pull-Up he was wearing was imparing his movements, making it hard for him to get around easily. It was at that time that Ichigo heard a shuffling to his left, someone else was there.</span></div></div>",

What are you doing out here?\"</b> Ichigo asked as he looked over at the blonde-haired man wearing his signature hat, but kept his Zanpakuto pointed towards the Hollow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Well, I caught wind of this Hollow on my way back to my shop and I thought I would come take care of it. Looks like you beat me here, eh Ichigo?\"</b> Kisuke said moving his cane around as he talked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ichigo had time to reply to the former Soul Reaper the Hollow lunged at him again. He was able to get out of the way of the tentacle this time and quickly counter attacked, slicing deep into the appendage. The Hollow roared loudly and swung the bloody arm around wildly. Ichigo flash stepped behind the monster and went to take a swing at it, but the Hollow was quicker than it looked, to both Ichigo and Kisuke's surprise it angrily lashed out at Ichigo with it's tail nailing him square in the stomach. The impact sent Ichigo flying into a tree and the blow caused him to release his entire bladder into the training diaper he was wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo uncomfortably got to his feet and moved to attack the Hollow, but the mess in the thin diaper he had around his waist threw him off and broke his concentration and the Hollow landed another blow on him, sending him to the ground once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKisuke noticed Ichigo's odd movements but assumed he was disoriented from the fall and chose not to do anything, he figured he would dust himself off and move in to finish the Hollow. However, as the fight moved on and Ichigo suffered blow after blow from the beast Kisuke began to worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"What are you doing, Ichigo?\"</b> Kisuke whispered quietly to himself as he watched the fight painfully go on. It wasn't until the Hollow hit Ichigo across the face and almost knocked him unconscious that Kisuke decided to step in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo was exausted and hurting everywhere from the Hollow's punishing blows, he simply couldn't dodge anything in the state he was in. The weakened Soul Reaper gathered together all the strength he could find and swung Zangetsu at the creature one last time as he shouted the words 'Getsuga Tensho!' The blue wave of spirit energy colided with the beast, severing one of it's tentecles. Ichigo, exausted from the fight colapsed to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKisuke quickly drew his Zanpakuto out of his cane and dashed over to the Hollow, swinging his blade and finishing it off. As the Hollow disappeared Kisuke went to tend to Ichigo but as he approched him he saw that his injuries were more than he could handle here, so he decided to bring him somewhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"I'm sorry Ichigo, I shouldn't have let it drag on for that long.\"</b> Kisuke muttered to the unconsious boy as he picked him up and flash-steped away.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sasami got a wide and evil smile on her face and headed to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later Sasami knocked on Ayeka's door carrying a Carrot cake on a tray. \"Oh Ayeka I made everyone a cake can I come in?\" Ayeka replied giving permission, as she walked into the room they shared she stepped over alot of ayeka's fdirty clothes and tns of make upcases and girly magazines, her sister was such a slob all of the time. \"Here Imade it special have a piece?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Sasami you silly child you know I am on a diet to perserve my royal waistline as heir to the Jurai royal famility I must be ladylike, beautiful and hold myself with grace and intelligence as such I have no need of your fatty cake.\"<br>\r\nSasami gave her the cute puppy dog opouty eyes that were nearly tearing up, Ayeka shiver at the look before nodding and taking a bite.As usual her cakewas to die for, in truth Carrot cake was one of Ayeka's favorites especially Sasami's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, oh my word this is heavenly yet something tastes a bit off why is that?\"Just then A surge shot through Ayeka and she felt very strange.</span></div></div>",
