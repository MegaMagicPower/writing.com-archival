Quickly thinking what he said in his head, maybe this won't be so bad after all. He thought. He saw his mom carry human sized boxes in one hand while going to his room. Renee saw him and he had a blank stare on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke: hey mom Ashley and Alyssa are sleeping in the game room again. Where Chaz?\" Asking in an angry tone<br>\r\nRenee: well,( with an angry tone) you scared Chaz bad so he's in the living room with his iPod. You scared him and you didn't even talk or say hi to him. He's on the couch, you need to apologize for your behavior or no more football of any kind! Understand Luke Pacific? Serious face Luke.\"<br>\r\nLuke: yes mom.\" Softly he took off his gear and changed into a sleeveles shirt and wind pants with boot. Holding two A&amp;W Rootbeers, both with straws. Luke stop in the door way and looked down then sigh, he scared this kid in his armor would be scare him again just by looking at him. He slowly moved to the room and put one rootbeer down by Chaz and keeped one for himself. He sat down on the couch and turned on the tv to Cartoon Network total drama island. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke: umm hello.\" Looking at the rootbeer then relishing the that Chaz's voice won't be as load as everyone's, he increased audio volume high to here him. Chaz hid behind the can when he scene Luke sit next to him.<br>\r\nChaz: uh H..Hi you must be Luke. R right.\" Luke shook his head up and down slowly in a yes form.<br>\r\nLuke: yeah your Chaz right?\" <br>\r\nChaz: yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor an hour or so the giant and human talked bout different things and it seamed their premature with what they said bout each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaz: football champion eh?\" Now happy to even sit on Luke's waist \" ever heard of triple charge?\" <br>\r\nLuke: No.\"<br>\r\nChaz: well you have hole 1-3-7 spreed so the other can...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Chaz could finish, Renee walded in with a small and large plate of steak firies and broccoli with melted butter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke: thanks mom!\"<br>\r\nChaz:( now smiling hoping it way just like home) thank miss Pacific.\"<br>\r\nRenee: please call me Renee.\" Talking in a sweet tone. \" Dig in !\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

O-o reliving the steaks may have attacked his sisters, he quickly moved Chaz and his food of his waist and onto the coffee table he rushed in and grabs holds of his sisters before they get anymore closesr. Landing on his back. Luke got up and caried his sisters by their neck cables and airlanes. They flaired their arms and legs begging Luke to let the go but to no advail. They gave in and sigh. Luke walked over to Renee's couch and sat them beside their mom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee: thanks Luke ( then she turned to he two daughters) now we have a gets here so don't hurt him or Luke will kill you two.

But since earth is gone...\" <br>\r\nRenee: it's ok Chaz.

A steam steal frame that looked like Luke's body. Renee looked over then something came into plan. Grabbing Chaz fast she had a devils smile as she move Chaz to the frame then placed him on the work bench. Grabbing the frames chest plate, the inside was covered in spiders webs and dust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee: Luke didn't you say 12 years ago that this was not working cause of the power sorce.\"<br>\r\nLuke: yah, why ask now when we all...\"<br>\r\nRenee can you change this to a human cockpit?\"<br>\r\nLuke: ( looks up from the pillow) made if I get more steal and iron.
