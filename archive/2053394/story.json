Zimmerman bred horses, or so he claimed. he specializes in the larger breeds, focusing further on Clydesdales and shires. the cows, on the other hand, really didn't do much but provide further tax exemption, as did all of his other animals. He did not mention what other things he did to make money, but it was irrelevant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     he had contacted you because he had noticed strange lights flashing in his stable about three days ago. when he approached and made his presence known, the lights stopped. none of his prized horses seemed harmed in any way, but you were contacted to prevent them from becoming so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     His driveway was a half mile set of tire ruts with tall grass lining the middle. his house looked humble enough, but the stable seemed only a fraction smaller. you could make out five windows of stalls, two of which were occupied. a yellow horse and an even larger black one poked their heads out as you came closer. you had always been slightly wary of horses. they were too big for you to be comfortable around them. these would be downright unsettling to stand beside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Zimmerman came out of the house as you parked and greeted you warmly, shaking your hand with a firm grip  and asking if the place was hard to find. together you walked to the stable so you could look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You were right: these two horses, the yellow actually a light brown Clydesdale, and the other a huge shire horse, turned around in their stalls and stared at you as the two of you entered the stable. at the shoulders, they were each at least five and a half, maybe even six feet tall, intimidating your just below six foot self. Zimmerman assures you that they are gentle giants, and goes on to explain that nothing is stolen or damaged, but the lights are definitely concerning. after looking around you tell him that you will stay the night to see if these lights will come back, and find out what they are.<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\nYou awaken from a light sleep with the taste of a Big Mac still clinging to your breath. you look sleepily toward the stable and see a bright flash of light. It's time to do your job. </span></div></div>",

What could it be? Aliens? witches? Wizards? There's no telling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You peek from behind the wall and see two men. Just two, regular men, one of which is holding what looks like a strange gun. Kind of a let down, really. As you watch, the man aims the weapon at the black shire horse you saw earlier and fires. Before your eyes, the horse begins to shrink, smaller and smaller until you can't make it out from here. A few seconds later, he fires again, and he horse is back to its original size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Forget your job! Curiosity commands you to get a better look. You dash forward and hide behind a metal shelf of grooming products. The strangers haven't noticed you. You lean out and take another look. <i>Plonk</i>! A bottle of horse shampoo tumbles from the shelf and bounces on the ground. Too late you reach out to grab it, exposing your position in the process. You look back and find both men staring at you. An awkward silence fills the barn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You leap out and dive toward the stall on the opposite side of the stable, containing a brown and white paint horse. Just as you reach it, a white light blinds you and you fall unconscious.  </span></div></div>",

Your shirt snags on bits of sand and rock, tearing in a few places, but you make it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside only terrifies you more. At the opposite side of the stable, directly in front of you, is a black shire horse that easily dwarfs the one you just got away from. Worse yet, you as other horses heads in all but one of the stalls. You press your back to the stable door, feeling a panic attack coming on. But, you have to move on, find safety, get help, anything to improve your situation. You start walking toward the center of the stable when movement to your left makes you freeze in place. </span></div></div>",

How are-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"MORNIN' BOYS!\" A mans voice booms, cutting off every thought in your head. You spin around, stepping in a hole amongst the straw and falling into your butt. You see Zimmerman, in his titanic form, striding casually into the stable. Minor tremors shake the spongy ground beneath you from his footsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He's it. He's your ticket. If you can get to him somehow, everything will work out. You quickly stand back up, but he's already passed by your stall. What's more concerning is a loud rumbling above you. Looking up, the paint horse is staring at Zimmerman impatiently. You see it shift, and watch it's leg begin to move. Directly toward you. You get up and run, no point in waiting to get crushed. It's hard to do with all the straw, and you don't get more then five steps before you trip and fall. All you can do it turn and watch. The hoof is descending, casting a shadow over you. It slams down just in front of you, sending a powerful shockwave through the ground, and tossing you up a few feet. You lift up and roll toward the horses hoof, finally stopping against it. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n You're shaking with pent up fear. You use the hoof as a prop to stand up and lean on as you breathe away the energy. Sadly, fate has other plans. Zimmerman is back, carrying a bridle. He stops in front of your stall. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Zimmerman!\" You scream desperately, \"down here!\" You can't jump in your position, but you're waving your arms like a madman. He doesn't even hear you, and proceeds to fasten the bridle over the horses head. You watch hopelessly as he completes and removes the barricade from the stall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Suddenly, your flying, in a way. The hoof lifts, moving so fast that your pressed against it on your back by the sheer motion of it. In a matter of a second, you're carried right out of the stall and into the hallway, a packed earth floor with a few pieces of straw scattered around. And, like a catapult, the descent and step of the horse throws you forward far more violently than you had pictured. You bounce and roll along the ground, kicking up a mild dust trail and causing yourself a bit of pain. You stop, laying face down on the damp ground, feeling the decreasing earthquakes of two colossi exit the stable.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You just need to figure it out unless you're prepared to spend the rest of your life one inch tall, which you're not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first instinct is to wait for Zimmerman's return. He's the only one capable of helping. The horses are not going to offer any assistance in that area. In fact, one clumsy movement and they could end you with a misplaced hoof. Yea, best to stay away from those behemoths until you can return to normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rush toward the huge door leading out of the stable.

The man greets her with a hug and a kiss, she addresses the man by his name, \"Mitch\" first. Mitch, addresses the woman as \"Sadie\". Great, at least you know these two titan's names. Sadie is a bartender at a local Bar and just got off work. After exchanging more hugs and personal quotes, Sadie decides to get comfortable and starts by removing her shoes. Sadie kicks off her dirty black Nike work/running sneakers. One of the overturned shoes lands just several feet from you! The odor emitting from them is horrific. In fact, her feet stink worse than the boyfriends. No kidding. You immediately throw up all of your breakfast and lunch as you scurry away from that shoe. Sadie tells Mitch that she is going to change into her pajamas, but before she does that, she throws a packet of popcorn into the microwave and asks Mitch to get a movie ready on Hulu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the couple prepare too settle in for the night, you think really hard as to how you will get these massive humans attention. Of course, you are too small to be heard, but visible enough to be mistaken for a bug and get squished. You need to be careful and handle this situation gently. A minute passes and Sadie comes out of the bathroom in her pajama pants, right as the microwave beeps, indicating that the popcorn is ready. Sadie's massive barefoot slams down just feet from where you stand! Your stomach churns as the stench washes over you like a tsunami wave!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm....that popcorn smells good, babe...\" Kevin says just after the microwave beeps, indicating that their movie snack is ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I got the extra buttery kinda.\" Sadie said, getting up too retrieve the bag of popcorn from the microwave! Once again, the smell of feet is overwhelming as Sadie's giant foot passes over you! God this is disgusting. However, you really need to somehow get too higher ground.

Mitch then goes in for a kiss which is reciprocated by Sadie kissing him back, then slapping his face teasingly saying \"Or we can do something that is actually enjoyable and just watch the movie you picked out\". Sadie then sticks her tongue out at Mitch and He just teasingly plays back with giving her a tickle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch from a distance as the giants play with each other for a few minutes, and then they finally settle down as the movie starts to play. Your chance to take action is now, there is only one option that is going through your head right now, that you have to get to higher ground and retrieving the help from these giants might be the only way you have of one day returning to normal size again. With that thought, you trek your way towards the giants, in your head you think \"I'm going to have to climb one of them to reach there ear, it's disgusting and very scary to think about but that might be the only way that I survive being tiny\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPopcorn and crumbs start to rain down from right above you, as you approach the closet giant who was Sadie. The intense familiar stink of her foot instantly draws its self over you. You do your best as you get closer to the smelly, dirty foot to keep from throwing up. Looking up her, while being between her toes, the foul odor is unbearable, you see toe jam in between her toes that you just hope that you never get stuck in. The climb starts now, you take a deep breath of the rotten air around you, knowing full well that you don't want to try and smell anything till you reach a better spot, and theirs no turning back. As you jump up and climb onto her in between toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squishy, wet, and clearly sweaty skin that is below you makes it a bit hard to keep your balance as you make your way past the toe jam toward the center of the horrible environment that is Sadie's foot. You are like a an ant to her that she can just barley feel and enough for her mind to just ignore. Sadie then starts to move trying to get more confront-able, completely unaware of the fact that she is causing a great amount of distress towards a tiny man that is climbing her foot.  You not wanting to do this but having no choice get down and try to hold onto the sweaty gigantic foot skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Sadie manages to do though is stretch her leg out causing you to fall from her foot to the leg that is below you. The hit was like a falling rock, the fall hurt you slightly but luckily you were able to keep a grasp on the woman's leg. A little dazed at what just happened you get up to look straight ahead to see the giant short pajama pants in the distance and a good min from there her breast that cover the sight of her face.

I mean who would want to imagine life at being so small, that's so disgusting to even think about haha\" She then gives Mitch a kiss and says \"I love my big strong man\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this was heard you think of the irony of the situation that your thrown in for someone who never wanted to know what it was like to be so small. You then start your trek once again, Taking breaths in, being glad that your starting to get a good distance from her feet smell with each inch you take towards Sadie's knee. There is though a sweaty odor that does come up as you approach the giantess knee, from right under it. But it's definitely not as bad as before. You climb to the top of the knee and catch your breath. To you it feels like you just walked half a mile, but in reality it was only a few feet (ha ha (: ).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take you to long to start moving again, since standing still won't get you very far. You were forced to have to scrape your way down Sadie enormous thigh, since it was at a particular angle. Touching the bottom of the thigh a huge foul odor swept right into your face. It was coming from right in front of you, under the short pajama pants. The smell was toxic, you had no idea which was more gross this intense stench that was clearly coming from Sadie's crotch or the dirty foot from before. Either way that didn't matter to much to you. What matter was just getting past this obstacle, you then jump and grab a hold of the shorts and tread your way on top of it. You try your best to hold your breath once again, as the intense smell that is bouncing off her gigantic vagina seems to seep its way through her pants and make your venture that much harder to endure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hope that this all ends with the giants helping you get big again is all that keeping you from just giving up and running away. On your way to the waist band you even gag a little as you have to cross right over something sticky on her pants. Not wanting to even think about what it is though, you venture on and safely make it to the beginning of her shirt. Still holding your nose, you walk across the squishy domain that is her stomach, its not like she's fat, she is skinny but she has no strong ab's either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk across the squishy tummy, you are thankful for making this far and the two giants being engulfed in the movie made it that much easier to trek this far. You then make it to a sort of slope that leads up to her Boobs. So you cling to her pajama shirt and climb your way up. On your climb you start to notice an intense smell of perfume that smelled soft and gentle but also toxic at your size it was hard to tell if it was hard to breath because of it or not. You did your best though to ignore it, since ts defiantly better then crotch or feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hardest part of your journey thus far for you was right now trying to make it over her right boob, which felt soft and enticing. But being this size you didn't really want much to do with it. You seem to have made it over her boob and immediately notice just how tired you are getting. You cling to the shirt and look up to see crumbs of popcorn, a giant Sadie's face with brown hair that touches her shoulders, with a giant man arm wrap around her neck cuddling her against him. As you look to your side, you see a giant top to a front shirt pocket. it looks sort of deep but if you were to climb in it you know you could climb out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought then hit you, since your so exhausted right now and seeing that the movie is about 15 mins from being done. Maybe it's a good idea to just call it for now and get some rest in her front pocket. Sure you hate the idea of being tiny and being in a giant girls pocket may sound like a good time to most, to you thinking logically it sounds more dangerous then enticing. But with your time having a limited window to grab her attention and feeling like your going to fall over due to need of rest, you need to decide fast if its better to just keep moving or grab some rest...</span></div></div>",

Plus sleep didn't sound to bad for someone who just climb a mile and a half. So you make your way over to the pocket and drop yourself inside, safely and no real injuries acquired while doing so since it was a soft cloth. And as your prediction was right Sadie got up as soon as you made it to the top of the pocket, Sadie stenches, and you immediately fall asleep for what an hour and wake up to the pressure of two titans hugging each other with you in the middle. \" Anyway that was okay for a Gulliver movie babe but next time I think I should be the one to pick the movie, sound good my fierce strong man\". You immediately feel pressure as Sadie goes in to hug her man real tight and for a good min. Mitch lets out a deep breath \"Ugh fine, but do you have to go home now, you haven't even given me a chance tonight to get those pajamas off of you, and I know how much you need to de-stress\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said Sadie playfully pushes Mitch away and with a sad look in her face says \"I know but tomorrow I have my mother coming in, my cat needs to go to the vet in the morning, my online professor needs his dumb paper due by 12pm, and if I end up staying the night then I'll just want to spend the whole day cuddling you, then we both miss out on our responsibilities\". You then feel the crushing force of the two titans coming together one more time kissing. The pressure then releases slightly again and with Sadie's giant voice \"How about this, you come over tomorrow night meet my mom and I will rock your world tomorrow night does that sound good?\". Mitch then grunts and says \"Fine that works... my little crazy workaholic cutie, but I'll probably be the one rocking your world babe *chuckles*\". Another life threatening squeeze and kiss goodbye that actually knocks you out. Sadie grabs her work cloths and nasty Nike shoes to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the heart whelming goodbye's Sadie gets in her car and drives about 15 mins to her home. Says hi to her cute fully grown cat that has white fluffy fur. She then drags herself into her bedroom, throws her shoes off right by her bed and then crashes on her queen sized bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are the first to wake up in the morning scratching your head, realizing that due to the amount pressure and the fact that you were exhausted from being tiny you must of just knocked out.  With Sadie laying down you are able to easily crawl your way out of the giantesses shirt pocket. You look back towards her feet and admire for a moment just how far tiny little you had made it and now was probably the most risky part of the whole operation, waking her up and acquiring Sadie's help..</span></div></div>",

A giant hand then appears below you as Sadie hits the side of her head and then you fall into it. She sort of feels something and pulls you up to her eye. The force is almost unbearable and feels like being in a fast car, you hold onto her thumb and then you see a giant eyeball. You try to make some kind of movement in which is responded with \"What the????... No way... how the...(grabbing her words together, she calms down a little, but still very freak about the little tiny sort of looking like a man in her hand) Okay I seen enough\" She this placing you onto her bedroom side table and uses a magnify glass that was there as well to look you over one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie's ear then comes down into your view she then says \"Okay I might believe that your actually real, but you need to tell me what happened to you so I check your story. I mean right now if you are real then your a stranger to me, for all I know you could have some shrink kink and made something so that you could perv on me, but something went wrong and here you are.

Probably literally and meteorically, but I have to take a shower and get ready for my day. So how about you stay right here on this table and I'll take a shower, so we can talk over coffee in my kitchen\" She looks at you not really caring if you agree or not but just looking that you understand. With you pretty much knowing that there's no way to argue, you squeak in acceptance. Sadie rushes to her bathroom that in her room and turns before closing the door to say \"You also better not perv on me or I will squish you like the ant that you are\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slams the door, the shower goes and fear draws itself over you but not enough to ruin your accomplishment. But bad luck has its ways of just ruining your day, as a white fur ball jumps onto the bed. It was Sadie's cat, who didn't notice you so you were safe for now. You did though get a little scared and run behind Sadie's lamp to hide from the cat. With your movement alone though The cat look as though it spotted something and was instantly behind you. Not sure if the cat can really see you or not, you froze and turned towards the giant beast. The cat just seemed curious so it took its paw and lunged it in front of you. The thought of this is it, how you die is by a giant cat you think as the bathroom door swings open. \"Catherine get away, shoo..

I know it will be dangerous but it's the only way I can grow back to normal size, So will you help me?\" you then look up Sadie who is taking a moment to think over what you just said and then finally says...</span></div></div>",

Probably because she was just use to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you arrive back at Sadie's home her mother heads straight for the guest bedroom to catch some sleep, while Sadie goes to her room with you.

And you know with all those strange lights happening. I need to stay at the farm tonight, srry babe. but ill have to pose pone our meet up\" Sadie started to get slightly sad but she understood and said \" that okay babe I still love you, we can meet up tomorrow or sometime this week okay love?\" a moment past of silence and then Mitch responded with \"yea sounds good babe, we can see each other tomorrow hopefully I have somethings I have to get done now so I love you and miss you, Bye\" Mitch hangs up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie then dives on the bed and screams into a pillow for a second then turns to you and says \"ugh, oh well I guess this being your first night here with me aware of you. its probably a good idea that Mitch didnt come....

You didn't enjoy this kind of treatment and wished that there was a way you could just do this whole thing yourself but with still being stuck at this size, you must settle with Sadie's demands \"Okay we leave when you say so\". Sadie looking at you satisfied with the response that was given nods her head yes and then grabs her keys to get ready to leave for the farm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long 15 min drive happens with you inside of Sadie's shirt pocket. The whole ride you just kept hoping that this was going to be it, that living a half inch tall life nightmare was finally going to end. And the excitement grew grater as you heard Sadie's car stop. She then says \"were here, now lets go search for clues\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie ended up parking her car a quarter mile down the street at a farmers market parking lot, So it ended up being a few more mins of a walk to finally arrive at Mitch's farm.

She also sees Mitch dead asleep \"Okay we should be good to walk around and search\" Sadie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sadie tries her best to navigate through the darkness with only few lights coming from a fence, barn, or chicken coop. You do your best to search the area for any flashes of light anywhere. The time seems to past quickly with Sadie casually sneaking across this huge acre farm. It has seemed that Sadie was having enough of this and told you that she would look around the barn as the last place for the night. And as you two approach the giant barn, hope was being drained from your tiny body. But then in a blink of an eye Sadie jumps back and gets herself against the barn wall. You were immediately bounced around in her front pocket and then the motion stops, which allows you to get to your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen while trying to get her to tell you whats going on. You stick your head out of Sadie's shirt pocket and see lights coming from the distance but you can't tell if it's coming from the road that swerved sort of closed to the barn or if it was those people who shrunk you.</span></div></div>",

As Sadie just froze in fear scrunched down on her knees looking through these cracks in a huge amount of wood that were by the barn and made for good cover. Now having the ability to actually see them through some old pieces of wood and noticed that the people were only about 5 or 10 feet away from you two. The two of you were calming down only slightly and hopeful that the night time and the darkness gave you enough camouflage to hide from the people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie was able to see the flashes of light which was coming from a guy who was aiming a gun thing at a horse and changing the size of it. Sadie also see's one other person sitting on some pieces on wood taking notes on a clipboard. Then out of nowhere you hear there voices.. one sounded like a deep guys voice and the other a female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....did you see that.... a few more test's and.... everything.... needed... (it was hard to hear them)\" the guy said this looking at the female voice who responded with \"yea... gad to get... dumb farm...\". The conversation was then cut off with the guy answering his phone. He seems to turn his back away from your 2 position and the woman was distracted writing up notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie thought instantly that this was there chance to take action. She looked down at you and whispered \"Okay so I believe everything now, But we don't really have a plan here. So make some kind of motion if we should stay and hold still if we should run for it\". the question was what were they going to do, was it to dangerous after all at least with out a good plan and they should just run or was this possibly there best chance and sending the tiny you to approach them is the best thing to do?</span></div></div>",

A loud noise that was a shotgun being cocked was heard and the two of them seem to freeze. \"What are ya'll doing on my property. this here farm is private property, you hear me? *shotgun bullet is fired into the air* now don't make me shoot you and come out. I am sick and tired of seeing all these strange lights out here, I betting you bunch of teens who think the world is your oyster but its not, now come with your hands up and I'll let you off by just calling your parents\" Mitch's voice called out to the two people who just seem to hold still for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then hear the female voice say \"Now..\" the farmer being confused stands there and then a beam of light hits him. it blast him back into his house and knocks him out. you and Sadie look over to see the man who fired the ray hit a switch on the gun, aimed at the cow and then fired. With the cow back to normal the two start to bolt it. Sadie instantly gets up causing you to fumble back deep into the pocket. You feel her running and screaming \"HEY STOP... YOU 2 STOP RIGHT NOW\" over and over again. You manage to grab the top of the pocket and pull your head up to see the 2 people running with the gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you start to see that Sadie is actually getting a good distance towards them. the guy stops and turns. He aims the gun and without saying a word makes Sadie freeze in her place \"okay just put it down and you can leave\" Sadie says like she is the one in control of this situation which shes not. But then the guy just fires one more shot before running away into the distance. And as if everything was going into slow motion you jump and manage to be the one hit by the ray blast. you return to normal size of      6 \"0\" but manage to fall onto Sadie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushes you off her with plenty of force, as she looks up though, sadly the two people have disappeared. Sadie hits the ground once, sad that they got away. She then looks over at you to say \"Well I guess its not a total loss...\" She just then remember about her boyfriend who was hit. \"MITCH!!!...\".

Sadie looks at me for a moment and gestures as if she will take it from here then says \"Babe, I know your confused and probably scared but just give me a second to explain\". Sadie explained everything from who I was to why we were here without him knowing to ending with how he got to his current predicament. And then after an hour of Mitch moping about his new size to finally calming down, we sat down at his table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess the best thing we can do now is just wait till they return. I mean this seems like there favorite place for experiments and now that they think the farmer is out of commission they should be back soon\" you say this trying to get everyone's hopes up. \"Well I guess but I don't know if I can run my farm at this size, so looks like you young man (which sounded funny coming from someone less than half your height) will have to run my farm till then\" Sadie then tried to interject by saying you have a life and she could run the farm for her man. But you feeling a little responsible for this situation say \" Well I don't think that's true I probably lost my job while being tiny for so long and my gf most defiantly is cheating on me so she's out of my life now.

With that and a bit more work advice Sadie walks back into the room and says \"I took work off for a month and told my mother she should probably head home tomorrow both due to emergencies\" Then there was this long awkward period of time where Sadie and Mitch kept talking among themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey eventually went to bed, Mitch also wrote an email to his employees saying that he will be absence for some time and while being gone he will have you some guy in charge of the farm, and you decided to fell asleep on Mitch's couch, The morning came quickly and you were shook out bed by Sadie. \"hey sleepy guy you have to start your first day of farm sitting while I start my first day of bf sitting\" she says this laughing with a big smiling grin on her face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(what happen next?)</span></div></div>",

But as you started to learn through  the week about the different processes and heavy lifting. They warmed up to you. It was funny because never before would you of thought that farming would have become such a cool thing to you. You were actually having fun. But it seemed like the opposite for Sadie. Her first week started off great, Mitch respected her and didn't ask her for much. He even tried to pamper her at his new size which was working till he realized how exhausting everything is when your 2 ft tall. It got to a point in the middle of the week where he was saying no and back talking Sadie like she was an adult trying to get a kid to do what she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie's behavior did actually have to change by the 2nd week to a much more stricter attitude, It was like she changed the sight of seeing him as her lover to seeing him like a child. which was insane to think about since they still slept together and sort of did couple things with one another. This time period you all spent with one another went on for another month and a half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this time The two people with the ray gun never showed. You were basically known as the farm owner by the employees point of view who have seem to forgotten about the og farmer Mitch who also gave Sadie his bank account since he had no use for it till he grew back and you needed to pay the bills. Also during this time you were gaining a built buff body, it seemed everything was going up for you. As for Sadie she was still together with Mitch who seemed to carelessly live his life now still rebellious against his gf and hoping to grow back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up for another great day at the farm, the employees are doing good, and your out there plowing fields in the sprinkler. Sadie comes out of the farm house looking for you with some fresh lemonade. Excited you stop and go to drink, \"Wheres Mitch?\"<br>\r\nYou ask her looking sort of confused to why shes out here. She said I put him down for a nap because he was being a bratty punk to me\" you then look at her a little confused, but since your job wasn't to watch Mitch there was no need to question it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie then walked away for a moment and grabbed a hose. She began to spray all the dirt that was on you. \"HEY stop that your getting me all wet\" Sadie look back you in a teasing way \"Your dirty, and no dirty men in my house...\". You then look back at her in a joking/serious way \"oh your house, well then I'LL  just have to take back my farmer hose\" you lunge at her grabbing it. Then out of nowhere you 2 find yourself in the sprinklers running around having all kinds of fun. And after mins of playing around in mud. Sadie grabs you and kisses you....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(what happens next?)</span></div></div>",

Immediately when the Farmer eyes open, he freaks out. You tell based on his little body scrabbling around that he is not happy and the squeaking noises that can just barley be heard are swears. That is when Sadie starts to approach the little man with one hand over her mouth and the other reaching out to allow the tiny farmer to get upon her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG! your so small.babe...\" After Sadie said this she started crying and you couldn't even tell what she was even saying anymore. You had to defuse the situation and calm everyone down. it worked after an hour and ya'll sat down, explain who you were, and how the size change clearly happened. It was all still a big mess of worry in till you agreed to take on the responsibilities of the farm while the farmer is all tiny. Then it seemed like everyone was getting a bit more comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(switching Farmers pov)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie seemed to keep trying to look on the bright side of things. \"You know now that your tiny, you get to places that I can't to...\" She kept going down from there. Farmer was just  worried the whole time while he tried his best to explain everything that the guy (you) have to do. Then we finally got to a point where we can just relax and decided to just turn on the TV since theirs nothing we can do about the tiny situation at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie decided that the best place to place the farmer was on the living room middle table. And in an instant the farmer realize just how messy he really can be with all these crumbs and stains that cover the table. But if the farmer thought that was bad it got a little worse for him when Sadie and the guy(you) decided to put there feet up on the table. The smell was awful coming from the guy(you) feet. But The smell coming from Sadie's feet were ten times worse, It almost made the Farmer throw up on the table. He couldn't image that a 5'4\" girl could ever produce such a bad smell of sweat and jam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie started looking over at the farmer who was trying to make some distance away from her feet to sit down. \"Hey babe how about you do me one of those things that you can now do at such a tiny size. (she is trying to cheer him  up) You should give me a foot massage, it would really make me happy(:\" Sadie says this and looks over at the tiny farmer with a smile. The farmer just look back at her and didn't want anything to do with her stinky feet. But with really no other way to insure that he is still in love with her at his tiny size, he walked over and started doing it. \"AWWW babe that feels so good\" Sadie says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like hours of being near her putrid feet, Sadie finally got up and said okay lets head to bed. She picked him up, wished the guy(you) goodnight, and then heads towards The farmers room. Where she set him down and then she heard a knock at the door \"hmmm who could that be at this hour...\" Sadie says leaving the farmer on the bed and walking towards the door...</span></div></div>",

I was sure this was his place?\" The young female says looking in and recognizing the inside interior. \"Oh you must be talking about my boyfriend yes. (not wanting to tell a stranger about his tiny situation she lies) He is out right now and I am here watching the farm for him. So why are you here at this hour?\" Sadie says this confident in her lie and distracted by just trying to get rid of this young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young female look at Sadie and was surprised that the farmer would try to cheat on someone who looked this good. She then thought for a second and even though she knows that she had a one night stand tonight with her boyfriend she really didn't want to get in the middle of it. So she also decided to lie to get home faster. \"Oh well... my name is Lily and I was here earlier... trying to setup a farmer internship with the farmer. Yea, and I brought 2 pairs of shoes since I didn't know if we were going into the mud or not. But anyway.. I left my black boots here so do you mind if I grab them?\" Lily says this looking up at Sadie hoping that she bought the lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh okay, that makes sense I guess. Sure you can come in and grab them. He probably mistook them for mine and put them in his room here lets go check\" Sadie says this not even 2nd thinking the situation because she is just to tired and had way to of a drastic night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she walks in Sadie sees the farmer and whispers for him to act like a doll so he did. But not without seeing the cute young girl that he knew and was hoping that Sadie doesn't know the full story. He began to play dead like a doll and fear took over him. which was not the fear of being caught but more like the fear of Sadie killing him at this size if she knows that he had a one night stand with this girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily came in not even questioning Sadie's whispers to a lifeless doll on the farmers bed. They both then got to work looking around for the boots. Sadie thought they might be in a bathroom closet so she said to lily for her to look in the room while she goes to the bathroom to look. Completely overlooking the fact that her tiny man is still in the bedroom now alone with an unaware girl. Lily then thought maybe there was a chance that they flew under the bed. So she got on her knees to look with the farmers tiny forum being right above her. She found them and she was so glad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily got up without saying a word and put the boots on the ground to change into them but as soon as she goes to sit down on the bed the farmer is looking up to see the females a** coming straight down on top of him...</span></div></div>",

Mitch answered and looks to be more dressed then he was before when we saw him asleep. The two hug and greet one another with a brief conversation. Then the door shuts with the two of them going inside. you with a bit of curiosity look up at Sadie for an answer. All you see is her fist gripping the side of the barn and face that looks to angry to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attempt to pond her boob to get some kind of response but instead get ignored with her pushing you down her pocket and then she starts to move forward to get a better look on the inside of the farm house. She Mitch and her talking while looking at some paperwork. The silence though is finally broken as Sadie takes you out and is hold a tiny tect device thing. \"Listen little guy, I know this might be unfair to ask you but since I took you out here to search for those people who shrunk you. *gulp* I am asking you to wear this tractor  (that usually made for bugs and other tiny things. Sadie bought it on her errands to keep track of you) and sneak in that home to find out who that woman is. I know your going to reject because you could get hurt but this whole situation seems messed up and I don't want to be cheated on again...\" Sadie says this holding tears back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have always had a soft spot for a crying girl and even though this is scary with something you really don't want to do. But since she did help you out and said that when the tracer leaves the home she will be able to easily find you, theirs no other choice then to say \" fine, hand it over\" she straps on this tracer that doesn't cover to much of your body up and is light enough to move with.You then look up at her and say \"so how do you want to do this...\" She takes you, ignoring what you just said and walks over to a window she knows is always open and tosses onto the table and whispers you good luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that your put into the same situation you were in when you started tiny, except this time you have a way out hopefully. So you make your way down the table and move forward towards the living area where the two are sitting. On your way you past by the familiar odor of the farmers shoes. Followed by the unfamiliar strong odor of the woman's shoes, that smell equal as bad as Sadie's did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were able to easily though run up to where the woman was sitting and be right by her putrid feet, the smell was very toxic. but trying to ignore it while hiding underneath the couch, you see Mitch closing your only exit out. \" its a little cold outside so I better close this window\" Mitch says with a harty laugh and then go goes to join the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talk for what seems like forever and boring garbage while a football game plays in the background. But finally you hear what you have been waiting for one of them to say as Mitch says \"... so thank you so much for being such an amazing....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(who is she?)</span></div></div>",

As you traverse over the cobblestone floor you notice to your left right by the stall door is a piece of notepad paper. You head towards it and straight away you notice something odd about it. It has no dirt or mud stains on it, in a dirty stable!? You head over to investigate. The paper is small, not at all for your size but very small for a normal size human. You crawl on top of the paper which was about the size of a bathroom floor in area. Even at your mini size you can make out the writing. Lucky for you its readable. It reads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ben, we have another test run of the size modifier tonight and again for the next 5 days if possible. That idiot farmer Zimmerman has no clue what we are up to. Oh, if someone does come while we are here, use the shrink ray on them. We cant afford any delays. Our major operation is the end of this week. Dont fail me!\" --Clyde--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a major breakthrough! Physical evidence of criminal activity taking place in this very stable! Well that explains you being shrunk and what has been happening at this farm at night. But what the paper didn't explain was the motive behind the crime and the why? You decided that this note had to be hidden somehow, before the crims return. Judging by the daylight, you estimated it was already midday. You took hold of the notepad paper as best you could and started to drag it to the utmost corner of tbe horses' stall. Thankfully the paper was light and the edge thinner than you still even at your height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that the very back corner of the stable had woodrot and you could see the insides of the wall. Summoning as much strength you can, with newfound determination to bring the crooks to justice you drag the paper over to the corner. You head past the sleeping stallion, minding its resting form, over to the corner of the stall and stable. After much effort, and 1 hour later the task was done! You fold the note paper carefully and neatly hide in the insides of the wooden wall. \"There!\" Job done! Now the evidence is safe but you can't rest yet!..</span></div></div>",

Firstly, you need a motive and secondly you need to somehow contact Zimmerman and return back to normal size. A tall order for someone only 1/4 inch tall! With boldness replacing fear you turn around back towards the center of the horses' stall. The stallion is still sound asleep on its bed of hay. What a magnificant creature! You had nothing to be afraid of. And you couldn't allow the crooks to get away with their crime. As you walked out towards tbe center of the stall, the mighty stud of a horse comes back into full view again. Its dark brown splendour of its sleeping form, that pale underbelly, those mighty hooves, the curvature of its slender neck, and that....the most impressive sight, the sight of the horses' member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rushed out to get a closer look at the horse. The stallion's penis was still there, resting neatly on the hay. Its sheath and tip was now staring directly at you. At this distance you can just make out the pink glans head. Shivers ran down your spine. Just how big was its head compared to your size? The pink glans was well.over 3 storeys high! \"No you musn't\" You thought, time is of the essence and you must contact the stallion's owner. Although....he might end up coming here this afternoon you think, after all he will have to tend to the beast today. Exploring this mighty beast was a golden oppertunity. And your fear of the beast was gone. Although, it would be safer to just wait it out and find Zimmerman yourself. What would you do? Explore the stallion and his mangnificant body or contact Zimmerman now?</span></div></div>",

You see the workshop table where the criminals had set up the machine. Decided there would be the best place to look for clues, you pressed on. Once again travailing over those annoying cobblestone floors. Your joints ached with fatigued, as night drew closer. You spent half a day doing this. You can't believe that it was nearly 24 hours that you shrank and ended up in this nightmare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you made it to the workshop area of the stables away from the stalls that housed the horses.

Oh man he was a sight for poor eyes, even though you both were complete stangers til yesterday. Zimmerman came in leading his prize mare into the stable. A beautiful Shire horse and mate to the stallion who you already met. She wasn't as tall or big as the boy but her mane was beautifully combed and shine. Her slender form had curves, muvh more browner like a chestnut brown, and looked proud to waltz on in. Zimmerman was at same heads height with the mare and and clicked his tongie talking to her. \"Come here my lovely into your room you go.\" He led her into the empty horses' stall right next to the stallions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rush out into the open and waved your arms frantically at Zimmerman. You yelled and screamed as loud as you could but to no avail. At this height your voice is no louder than the smallest whisper drowned out in the ambience of the farm with all its country choral of noise. Zimmerman turned towards the table where you stood in front of and he walked towards...YOU! You were in the way you fool! Peril and fear now came back renewed, you needed to get clear of Zimmerman's mud cacked work boots right now! As Zimmerman approached, you could now see all the detail. His reddened face, his leather brown hat, his farmer garb, mudded, dusty and stained. His denim jeans and those big cowboy boots was about to step on you. Emergency action is required.

As it opens its gigantic jaws you see strands of saliva drip from its palate at the top to its tongue at the bottom. The horse chomps on the hay and takes a whole clearing of hay in front of you. The piece of hay you were clinging to wasn't taken but there is next to no hay directly in front of you. You are the next bite and mouthful, if you don't move RIGHT NOW! You start to climb the hay frantically as the horse who is munching that last mouthful is starting to swallow the chewed remains down its throat. The horse licks its muzzle clearing of hay cut pieces and leans in for another bite at the hay pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continue to climb up in panic, you actually forgot to look to see if the horses' mouth is coming for you. A shadow looms over you and the smell of horse hay breath whips up your nose. The draft of wind from its nostril is nearly knocking you off the hay as you struggle to hold on. The horse grunts, puffs and opens its maw for another bite. As it is heading straight for you, the puffs of horse breath has you nearly blown off. But which happens first?

Grains of sand and hardened dirt as large as your hand make things so simple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you're almost at the top, you start heading to the right, to get around the horseshoe at the top. It takes only a couple minutes, but you finally reach the horses bridge sized ankle. From here, the entire rest of the city sized horse is laid out before you. It's flank and ribs are rolling hills, and it's individual hairs tower over your puny frame like a forest. Without anything else to do, you resume your hike up to its back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you reach its knee, when suddenly...</span></div></div>",

This time it was almost exactly the size of what they were looking for. Picking up the horse the two guys brought it (and you). Out behind the barn. They now wanted to see if they could control how big they could make the horse. And so, they picked a random size and fired the laser from the shrink ray. Unknowingly to them and lucky for you it was aimed right at you. You began to grow, But since the guys didn't see any immediate change in the horses size they turned the ray off quickly which left you microscopic.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThey were curious about why the machine malfunction and figured that maybe a flea that was on the horse could of gotten in the way which led them to think that they made this ray way to exact in its accuracy which was quickly noted down as they began to see some sights of sunlight. off to the horizon. So, deciding that was enough research for the day they dialed back the accuracy and regrew the horse. Things become much clearer to you as you begin to grow and you begin to see the two giant figures were two guys.

So you jumped has you heard a loud noise next to you and saw the giant pink iPhone laying in the mulch. Seeing this you begin to think that the giant is going to reach down and pick up the phone and you need to hide somehow. But Jade was a bit smarter then that and only used the phone as a distraction as her hand was on the other side of you. So, as you turned to run for it you ran right into her giant soft hand. And then the flesh walls of the girls giant fingers close around you. As she feels your presence, she starts to get excitement. Your then lifted up with no line of sight except the skin of the giant hand that you were in. Many thoughts were entering your brain all at once. But your mind became blank as the hand started to let light in and you were greeted with the face of your captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Jade laid her eyes on you, she instantly knew you were real and needed to safe with her. So, with no introduction or any kind of conversation Jade closed her hand once again and reach over to grab her purse in which she opened the zipper and dropped you in. Then seeing nothing but a smile and shush sign coming from the giant woman, the zipper closed above you and you were left in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade wanted nothing more then to talk to you and find out more about you. But since she was in a public place, with the odds being high of somebody that she knew walking by seeing her basically talking to a bug. She really didn't want to be talked about being crazy so the decision was final that she would have to wait till she got home in the privacy of her room before saying anything to you. She was just hoping that you wouldn't be to mad at her or scared of her for being so out of nowhere about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade then looked around making sure no one toke notice of her and seeing that no one did, she reached down and grabbed her phone. Placing it in her back pocket and then proceeding to pick up her purse and deciding to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>(Some things to know about Jade to explain some of her actions:)</u></b><br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">-She is 22, 5'11\" feet tall, and is<br>\r\na pure country girl.<br>\r\n-She is a little crazy when it comes<br>\r\nto love<br>\r\n-She had recently 2 weeks ago had been broken up<br>\r\nwith by a tall 6'1\" 23 year old guy who had a <br>\r\nhigh school sweetheart thing with Jade<br>\r\nin till he met some short girl at the <br>\r\nlocal bar.

Being a little bit of a ditz she didn't think about your position in the bag as the bag swung from side to side as she walked. You had no way of gaining any footing inside of the purse. Instead you flew around the bag with the tampons, loose change, random cards, lipstick, etc. You had no time to even think about the situation that you were currently stuck in and instead focused once again on just surviving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a half hour walk Jade has arrived to her home. Walking up the long path inside of her families farm, Jade sees her dad and gives a friendly wave yelling that she has to get some work to do so she's to busy to work with him. So her dad waves her away and as Jade is about to reach her front door. She felt disgusted as she saw her ex boyfriend Todd. Todd saw Jade and wave her, he approach her and said in his average confident voice \"Hey cowgirl whats..\" Jade cuts him off with putting her hand up in his face. Then says \"Listen your an employee for my dad, not here to socialize. So get back to work because I don't want to talk to you...(she pauses)\" She says this trying to sound as confident as she could, and not just crumble in tears begging for him to come back into her life. she continues \"..Now if you don't mind I have something I need to do\". Upon hearing this and then watching Jade stroll past him Todd turns and says still confident and asshole like \"Listen cowgirl I just wanted to talk...\". Todd then pauses himself watching Jade go inside. Jade only turns back and says \"Well I don't...\" then she closes her front door behind her and runs inside and up stairs to her bedroom in which she goes inside and locks the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe runs up to her bed with the purse still around her shoulder giving you a full on ride as she jumps and lands with her face in her pillow. She does a long scream into the pillow and calls herself stupid. With you being under neath a lipstick that landed on you with the massive free fall. But you were still not to badly injured and was just hoping that this new hell would end soon. And as soon as you thought that, Jade who is feeling depressed about herself suddenly remembers your existence. She then hurries to open her bag, bring light and a strong smell of perfume into the bag, you are once again met with the giant girls face followed by her massive hand covering all line of sight for you. The next thing you know is that you are being dump onto a wooden desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get yourself up and see the girl sit down in front of you, rolling her chair closer to you, Jade just stared down at you. Upon seeing you up close Jade began thinking to herself that you look so cute and if it wasn't for your height she would have already been trying to get with you. But even with that thought of your height being a slight issue. Jade in her current depression state wasn't really thinking straight and thought that she could still try to get with you.And needed to know more about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she then realized right away that she didn't prepare herself to what she was going to say to you and having just hover herself over you for what feels like a minute of silence she just blurted out \"Ummm hello... there little guy. There's no reason to be scared I'm not going to hurt you. My name is Jade... so do you have a name?\" Jade just stares down at you hoping that you don't just make a run for it. But with you thinking that it would be pointless to try and run. You decide to talk stating by telling her your name and leading into \"... Is there a reason why you grabbed me? I'm kinda busy and need to get back to....\" Jade cuts you off and starts talking as if she only heard you say your name \"That a cute name, so can you tell me how are you so small?\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began getting a little irritated that the girl has ignored your previous comment but decided it wasn't worth dying over and since you weren't the best at lying you just told her the truth about what you know being hired for an investigation and being shot with a beam of light. Then leading to how you ended up here. Jade gasp with her hands over her mouth and then you watch as her hand quickly leaves her mouth and heads in your direction. With what starts with a pet on your head leads into her going down your back and grabbing you. Bring you closer to her and embraces you into a mighty hug, Your tiny body immediately starts feeling the pressure on sides being pressed into her cleavage her boobs and hands was just squeezing your body tightly against her. She gives a quick smile as she thinks that you might be over enjoying this not realizing the amount of pressure that your under. Bur she goes right back into sympathy mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe you poor thing, I can't believe the things you had to endure. Having to be one second a big strong man and the next poof your all tiny and adorable. Well don't you worry, your safe now with me. I'm not going to let any more bad and scary giant things cause harm to you. I have no issue in letting you stay and live with me forever. So how does that sound little guy?\" Jade says this last part while letting off pressure of you against her. She then proceeds to hold you in the palm of her hand like a small hamster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling relieved that the hug was over, you toke in some air breathing heavily in trying to recover. In-which Jade doesn't really notice you doing. She just patiently waits for a response out of you. Which even though you were just trying to survive this giants embrace you were still able to hear the question and thought it was crazy. There's no way you wanted to spend the rest of your life tiny living as some kind of pet to this giant hick country girl who has essentially kidnapped you. Especially since you knew that there was a way to grow back since you saw those people who shrunk you regrow the horse. All you had to do is hope that they would return to the scene of the crime or use your investigation skills to track them down. With those thoughts streaming through your mind, you only had one response to give Jade which was a shake of your head no followed by you saying \"No way, listen I have no interest in living with you and staying this tiny forever. I appreciate the thought and all but I know theirs a way to grow back to my normal height. So how about instead you just help me out and bring me back to the farm I came from. You can even be an even greater help if you stuck around and helped me find the people who did this to me\". You say this and just stare up at Jade who at this point has tuned you out after you said ..help me out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade was speechless to a certain degree just thinking about what to say to you next. She didn't expect for you to deny her offer, she figured this was every guys dream to be with a beautiful girl that was offering to take care of him forever. And for you to say there was a way for you to regrow. This was something she didn't want, she liked the idea of you being small and unable to leave her. You being tiny gave her control of how your guys relationship would end up like and there's absolutely no way that she wanted to lose that idea. She is the big person here and so, she is the one that makes the rules. You were hers the minute she picked you up. So, now she just have to say something to you to let you know it. Jade then had the thought of that she didn't wanted you to hate her, but also knew for your own good that she had to deny you from denying her offer. And So,...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What happens next?)</span></div></div>",

She loves having you around but also thinking about her own safety in what you were asking her to do. Jade decided to say \"No no no, that all sounds way to dangerous. For not just you but also for me, I'm sorry little guy but the answer is no...\" after saying this Jade just gets nervous hoping saying something like that will just make you let the whole thing go. But instead you considered what Jade was saying and said as a comeback \"I guess your right, I mean asking you to do all this would be crazy. So how about instead you just bring me back to where you found me and I'll make it work from there\" you say this with great confidence and knowing that this seems like a good arrangement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Jade considered what you said for a moment but after hearing this she was just staring to get a little frustrated. And then decided right there and then that she was going to have to lay down some tough love. So looking down at you in her hand in front of her half exposed cleavage that is being \"mostly\" covered by the black tank top that she is wearing. Jade says \"NO, that is way to dangerous. You are way to small to be out in this big world by yourself. I'm sorry little guy but the answer is NO...\". Listening to this from Jade's giant soft hand. You feel humiliated and get very angry, with the idea that this girl thinks she can just decide whats best for you. But also remembering that she is much bigger then you are, you do your best to make a calm argument by saying \"Oh come on, I will be fine. I have survived this long by myself. And I am pretty good at staying out of danger....\" you continue in trying to make your point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying all this, you are actually kinda sounding like a teen who is complaining to his mom about not being able to go out. And Just like any of these kinda of conversations the mom which is Jade is situation always has a good response that typically ends the conversation with you unhappy. So Jade gets a frustrated look in her eyes and then cut's you off with saying \"THAT'S ENOUGH, So far you have just been lucky. Your just to tiny to be left alone. I mean just a few hours ago you were very close to ending up as a squished speck under a woman's construction boot or even the other close calls when the crowd of people walking while you were making your way over to my bench. I'm sorry but like I said before it's to dangerous. You are staying in the safety with me\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are shocked when hearing this, you had no idea that she even saw the construction woman incident or any of the other's. You really couldn't think of anything to say back. So with the silence happening for a good minute. Jade just looked down at you and felt that she was probably a bit to harsh in pointing out your literal short comings. She didn't want you to be depressed, just wanted to have you as her's. And that when she had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with you shaking yourself back into the situation at hand. You look up at Jade and see a wide grin grow across her face. Which was then followed by you being forcefully moved closer and closer towards her chest. And without saying a word to you Jade easily loses her grip on you, causing you to plunge towards her exposed cleavage. Landing with one bounce and then into the hole that you reluctantly grip onto the soft flesh walls of Jades right boob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade seeing you helplessly grip your body on her breast  makes her very excited for what she has planned to cheer you up. So then you watch as Jade grabs a hold of either side of her boobs and then gives you a *wink*. Followed by her saying in a flirty tone \"Listen I'm sorry but I only want whats best for you. So I think I 'll make it up to you\". which led into her making an immense amount of shaking. In Jade's mind this was every man's dream I mean there always starring at her boobs as they bounce while she is running. So it only makes sense that men want to be in them while this is happening. But Jade had might of miscalculated this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you began feeling the bouncing occur you were gripping for your life. Not really enjoying the current situation that you were in. Instead you were filled with anger about everything going on and fear of losing your life. You just hope that Jade begins to notice that you are not having a good time, In which....</span></div></div>",

It's disturbing to watch and think that could be you at any moment But you have confidence that you can survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's only been about 7 or so minutes but you have already are getting bored just standing next the giant black converse's. So looking to the side you thought that if you could avoid the sidewalks center and just stay to the farthest side of the sidewalk. You could very easily start making your way towards the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with that thought in mind you marched forward. But you were very quickly stopped as a giant red Nike running sneaker has slammed down in front of you. This caused you to lose your balance and fall back a bit. Landing on your ass you look at the owner of the shoe, being some mindless female teen wearing headphones. She suddenly starts tapping her foot up and down. Which scares you back under the protection of your bench. And right back next to the Farm girl's dirty black converse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen  seemed to be leaning against a tree now and still tapping her foot. Seeing this you think that this girl could be here awhile.

If you want to know more about the farm girl who is named Jade, go through the option of if the farm girl did notice you.

Your able to shake your head with a painful feeling and realize that you are wake and alive. But you also have zero feeling and ability to move in the parts of your body that weren't mention before. You look from side to side and see brownish darkness walls that are keeping your body wedged into place. You are very scared but need to know where you are and since you have the ability to move your head with a slight bit of pain coursing through you. Your able to lick the side of the wall. And after tasting the rubber you instantly remember and know where you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of trying to get yourself out of this position had crossed your mind, But with little ability to move you were just to stuck in place for what you could move to make a difference. Plus it was also to painful. It's seems that you know now that you really didn't have any skills at all. You were just really lucky to make it as long as you did. It's to bad that you didn't realize that in till now. You thought as you heard a closet door being opened and you got your first glimmer of light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing able to see you were actually given a better view, that was better then just the floor at least. Since the shoes you were stuck on were placed on the 2nd or 3rd row of a shoe rack that made all the shoes go at a slight angle downwards. You could see an empty shoe spot below you and also a bit of the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade who got home with you a few hours ago and then went out again, has just walked into her room after doing her 2 mile jog/run. Opening her closet like usual. She vigorously forces her running sneakers off. and then places them into the empty shoe rack spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are greeted with seeing feet and a bit of legs that you presume to belong to the owner of the shoes. And then the horror of your new life begins in an unexpected way to you. As a gentle hand holding two running sneakers have deposited the sneakers below you. Greeting you with humid air and a very toxic smell of foot sweat. With no ability to hold your nose. You were forced to endure it all. As this was just part 1 of your new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade has already at this point gone off to take her shower, leaving the closet door still open. You try once more to maneuver your left hand and neck up, to free yourself.

The paint horse is a distant blur, while still mind blowingly large. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a skittering noise to your right. You feel a rumbling on the wooden surface. You swivel to face the new danger and freeze at the sight: a roach, the size of an aircraft carrier, is speeding toward you. You can't help his gag at how grotesque it is in this much detail. It's mandibles are hairy and constantly move around in front of its mouth, which is just a little black hole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't notice you and walks by, but The air displaced as it moves is enough to send you over the edge and into the open abyss. Screaming for help is pointless, so you pray instead. You pray that you'll at least survive the fall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a sec... Do you hear whistling? You pause in your prayers and look through the open stable does below you. Zimmerman is just outside and heading toward your flight path! He's he's pushing what looks like a wheelbarrow, but you can't make out its contents, if any. </span></div></div>",

After a minute or two of running, you reach it, and see that you won't be able to just crawl through the holes between fibers, despite your size; You'll have to climb it. Thankfully, the fibers are small and tight enough that you have very little trouble using them like a ladder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems like an hour (really only a few minutes,) you come upon a hole in the fabric mesh.

You watch the outside world descend below you at a terrifying speed. It stops so abruptly that you are thrown against the top of the hole and nearly tumble out of it entirely! Your grip holds, however, and you scramble to the outside of the bag and keep your grip for dear life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething big and brown moves inside the bag. You peer through the hole and see brown hair, great leathery lips, and yellowed teeth the size of houses. They all work together to take huge chunks out of the pile of alfalfa inside and pull it into the horses titanic mouth. You breath a sigh of relief. You have no idea how you would possibly  have escaped that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world starts moving. All around you the stable is moving away and you see that you are headed toward the entrance. You wrap your arms around a fiber and hang on for the ride. The horses slow, lumbering steps take a few seconds each to occur, but each one takes you miles at a time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse is led out of the stable and toward the pasture to graze with the other horses, about twenty from what you can make out. The fence and gate are still pretty far away, but many of the horses are sticking around the edge near a metal water trough. Your heart begins racing at the thought of having to avoid all of those behemoths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZimmerman opens the wooden gate and leads you both into the field. By now, the horse is licking up the last stray pieces of alfalfa inside the bag. A massive hand rises above you and removes the strap from the horse's head. The horse, from what you can see, barely moves before lowering its head to graze, leaving you to the mercy of an unaware Zimmerman. A few of them approach you, stopping around you all and see if Zimmerman brought them any treats. He hadn't, so they go back to grazing where they stood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you, the bag, and everything you can see are quickly flipped upside down. As if that wasn't bad enough, and you weren't close to falling, the giant farmer begins shaking out the bag! Gravity fluctuates for you, and you are positive your going to lose your grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd... There it goes.

The aftershocks wobble and make you run like someone who had had way too many drinks, but you could at least get there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo many earthquakes to count later, and they finally slow down to an infrequent and unpredictable number, allowing you to both calm down, and make the connection that the hell you experienced was just the horse walking. \"I hope it's done with that for a while,\" you grumble, starting a light jog. Through all of that, the sky above shifted and brightened, though you had no idea where the horse went; the images you saw through the hairs were so blurry and misshapen that you stopped worrying about it. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You will realize, after a while, that it was a very fine hair, one that would be barely-visible to someone looking very, very close. But then, you are, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foot completes its movement, and you hear a grating, groaning sound as the zipper on the side of the boot is zipped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd without a care for your safety, Bailey -- the girl -- puts her foot back on the ground, and begins to follow after that nice Mr. Zimmerman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's getting to be a great rider,\" Zimmerman tells the girl's mother. \"You feel free to bring her around next week if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be sure to do that,\" the woman said. \"She loves visiting this farm.

If that wasn't enough, the whole muscle shifts back and forth, so you are constantly being rocked, making it quite easy to fall into those saliva swamps.

You are pinned to the canvas for but a moment, before the shoe drops out from beneath you. You bounce of the shin of the girl and ricochet forward, landing among the laces. Dazed, you somehow hang on through one more step -- the second of two -- that carry Olivia to the table and her breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are one big bruise, and you really want to just fall to the floor and try to find your way back to the dog dish. It's a disgusting, pointless existence, but at least you'd be alive. Alas, even though you are just atop the shoe of a teenage girl, there's no way you could jump and be assured of not dying, at least not on tile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally start to feel vaguely human again, enough to sense the constant slight earthquake of the girl's feet beneath you, to smell the funky foot odor that's become part of the shoe through many wearings. You can't stay here, you know. The girl is just eating her breakfast, and then she'll go somewhere else, and another set of footsteps like those and you might not survive. For a second, you think about trying to climb up her leg, but it's almost half a mile of sheer skin up to her knee alone. And while it's relatively still right now, it won't be for long. No, you'll have to find a way down, preferably before she goes outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, if she goes outside, maybe she'll walk through carpet. That might work, you think -- the drop would be less. Maybe you could leap to safety and try to reformulate your plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again -- you're holding on to the laces above the shoe's tongue. They keep the shoe fastened, but not perfectly. The gap between the tongue of the shoe and the shoe itself isn't much to the giantess above you, but to you it's a good ten-foot difference. Maybe if you got inside the shoe, you could find someplace relatively secure, and wait for the girl to settle down for the day. It's risky, but while you're not sure you'll ever be able to get anyone's attention, you actually are closer to a person than you've been in weeks; part of you would rather die trying to get found than live off a dog's crumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't have long to decide. If you want to jump off to the carpet, you need to get closer to the toe of the shoe. If you want to go into the shoe and find a hiding place, well, it's time to do so. What do you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Regardless, you are in a bowl of cereal, surrounded by crunchy mountains with holes big enough for you to fit in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cold immediately began to work on your brain and motor skills.

I'm down here!\" You wave your arms frantically, hoping beyond hope that she spots you, which she can't. The spoon dips below the milks surface and you feel the contents of the bowl pulling toward it, you drop to your knees and hang on for dear life. High above you, Olivia is smiling. Why she could be happy when you are in so much danger is a mystery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spoon lifts away, splashing a bit of milk back down around you. You narrowly avoid a drop the size of a mansion and end up diving right off the bit of cereal, back into the milky depths.

You watch, frozen in amazement and fear, as it approaches , slows down, and stops very, very, uncomfortably close to you. It sticks it's nose into the air and sniffs, filling the air with the sound of slow, deep breaths. Then it tilts it's head down to your general direction and starts to sniff around.You crane your neck to see the name on the dogs collar and read SPIKE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SPIKE!\" you scream out of curiosity, as to if he'll hear you. Nothing happens but more sniffing. \"SPIKE!\" You try again, not really sure why. The giant dog tilts his head and starts to bring his muzzle towards you. This is when the feeling of danger hits you. Spike could breathe in and take your speck size body into his mouth or his nose. There's no way it would know or smell you at this size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then get an idea. If you can get on to Spikes paw, you can stay there until he goes into Zimmermans house, then you can get to Zimmerman who can hopefully get you back to normal size. Steering well clear of the monolithic nose dropping toward the ground, You sprint towards the closest paw and realize that it's as big as a football stadium. You jump on to the black padding, which now looks more like giant black scales, and start climbing. You climb until you're steady and then nestle yourself in a crook just beneath the toe's claw. It stinks of mud, but beggars can't be choosers. You suddenly feel a rumbling and a shift in the paws position. Then Spike starts to walk.</span></div></div>",

Everything is slow, really, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less terrifying or traumatic. The paw rises high into the air and briefly goes limp, nearly throwing you out of your hiding spot, then it comes careening back down to the ground, which also nearly knocks you out. Over and over this happens, so frequently that you can\u2019t count the steps, or concentrate on where it is you are going. It takes every ounce of your strength and concentration just to stay where you are. The smell of dirt and animals are your only clue to your outdoor location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you do notice amidst the chaos, is a sudden change in light and temperature. Spike is also slowing down. You sneak a peek at the outside world and resist the urge to jump for joy: you made it inside! Then you start to panic all over again. Sure there aren\u2019t any horses or cows or gusts of wind, but a house has its fair share of dangers, including your current transport dog. You manage to see a light grey carpet and ready yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Spike steps down, you leap from the paw onto a thick fiber and immediately scramble for whatever cover you can get to. It\u2019s a short lived attempt, as the air current made by Spike\u2019s wagging tail send you flying through the air once again. You watch from the air as Spike walks around a bed (apparently you\u2019re in the bedroom now) and walks out, evidently searching for Zimmerman. He is gone by the time you settle onto the carpeted floor, which is now a sea of fibrous trees packed so closely together you can jump from to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see that Zimmerman hasn\u2019t made up his bed yet, and a bit of the sheet is touching the floor. If you made it there and climbed up you could, in theory, somehow maybe get Zimmerman\u2019s attention from the top of the sheets. Or, you could be a bit more adventurous and head into the living room, where tile floors would make things a bit easier, but lose any potential of shelter by wandering giants.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was then followed by the next awful thing the speed at which the frog would jump, making you just feel sick.

First and foremost: how the heck are you going to get back to normal?! Those two guys took off with the shrink ray, or whatever it was, and you may have spooked them enough not to come back. Second: when was this horse going to wake up? The sun has been out for a few hours now and it hasn't moved a muscle.

You release your grip on the hair, prepared to jump rather than become a bloody speck on a horse's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before the hair makes contact, the horse bucks its head slightly, throwing you forward and sending you tumbling down its face. Tumbling may not be the best word; you are sailing just over the hairs. Within a few seconds, however, gravity takes over again, and you land squarely in a white patch of hair, painfully. One of the hairs slams into your midsection, knocking the wind out of you. You land on your back, still unable to take a breath, and lay there in shock. A few seconds and you're back and standing up. Just in time for a shadow to blot out the light above you. Zimmerman's massive palm is plummeting toward you!

You hear a rustle behind you and the stalk you're standing on vibrates slightly. You turn back and see the titanic head of the equine beast half buried in the pile of straw. You thank your good decision making, but can't help but imagine yourself inside that mouthful the creature lifts away with. You turn around and put on a little burst of speed. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs you hop down onto the dirt, you finally see that your journey to wherever is going to be an arduous one: pieces of straw litter the ground all across what you can see of the floor, which isn't much. Where there isn't straw, you make out rolling hills, the product of regular traffic, which spells trouble for you. You can still easily make out the Clydesdale in the opposite stall, absently standing there, oblivious to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, many of the straw stalks you come to can be walked under, but a few of them do require you to either walk around or climb over, both of which waste precious time. The hills and prints are no different. Regardless, after over an hour of traversing the rough terrain of a floor, you've managed to make it to the center of the stable walkway, and you stop and catch a breather, sitting on a grain of sand nearly as tall as you. You look around and see all that you can inside, and it kind of freaks you out. You're still having trouble contemplating just how small you are</span></div></div>",

It's clear already that he won't step on you, but you hide anyway, beneath a slightly bent stalk. He steps over you and the stalk protects you from the air current he creates in passing. Once he's gone, you step out and watch him walk to the end of the stable and face a horse you can't see. Its head pokes over the stall door and you see it's the same shire horse the two strangers were shrinking and regrowing. Zimmerman takes a set of straps off the wall nearby and puts it over the horses head. He holds the reins and opens the door. The shire walks out behind him and they both head directly toward you. Not good! You begin running toward the side of the stable, even though it contains an even bigger horse than the one behind you. It quickly becomes clear that you aren't going to make it, but you don't give up hope. Each step of the shire shakes the ground, until they're so strong they make you trip. You stand back up just in time to see the horses hoof lifting toward you. What would take less than a second to occur at regular size, the hoof lifting takes a full five seconds before it starts to descend onto you. No amount of running will save you now. You sink to your knees and close your eyes, ready to face death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world goes black as the hoof stomps down, shaking the ground  and creating a shockwave that leaves your ears ringing painfully. Wincing, you open your eyes and see a light ahead. You look up and see the horses hoof dangerously close, but not crushing you. A thick metal barrier around the edge of the hoof separated you from a quick death: the horseshoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt lifts upward, blasting you with light and creating an air current that lifts you effortlessly into the air behind it you swirl and fly with the hoof, watching as it takes another slow, lumbering step.  the impact from it blows you a little further up, closer to the shire's black underbelly. You look back and see its hind legs approaching. You pass between them  a few seconds later, after you have started to descend again. This time, both legs create the strong wind, and you are launched upward as they pass. Up, up, up, between its tail and its thick legs</span></div></div>",

You shoot back toward its wide open throat and watch the tongue lift up toward you like an airplane runway. You descend roughly and hit the back of its tongue by a stroke of luck.

Long story short, the trip is quite eventful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the beast again opens its mouth, you see that you are almost at the end of its tongue! Only a few hundred feet more to go!

Wet squelching sounds erupt all around you. Your world is flipped upside down as the tongue reaches for the metal bit. It slams into the top of it and drags forward, pulling you toward the bar. Helplessly, you are deposited on top of it in a thick coating of hot saliva. To you, there are earthquakes, floods, and blasts of heat. In reality, the Clydesdale is just working its jaw around the bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are laying on top of the bit, your head just poking above the spit layer so you can breathe, when you feel a deep tremor, then another, then another.

Eventually, you all head back to the stable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're too panicked to try figuring out where you are going, choosing instead to focus on the fact that each step the horse takes moves you a little closer to the edge of the bit. Below you, what little light there is reveals a slimy, roiling pink mass of muscle. You're close enough that you watch it roll back and swallow a few hundred gallons of saliva and settle back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething big casts a shadow over you, even in this dark humid maw. You turn to see the front of the Clydesdale's tongue descending onto you! It easily catches you and snaps back toward the front of its mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight blinds you. You have to blink and squint in order to see the outside world, but only for an instant. In the next moment, something hits your back and drags you off the animals tongue.

If he leaves, you'll probably never become normal sized again. You'd live the life of a dust particle in a corral for the rest of your life, however short it would be now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHOOSH! A deafening rumble and a blast of hot air hit your back like a hurricane. You launch haphazardly toward Zimmerman like a bullet, aided by a bit of condensation that stuck to you. You look back for a moment and see another horse in its stall. You must have drifted to close and it snorted. No time to care or count your blessings, as you brace for impact. </span></div></div>",

Or, if you want a third option added in an existing chapter, just ask me to add it in. </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<b>Also, if you want me to change an unused chapter option to something of your choice, just tell me which one and what to make it.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is my first written anything, so bear with me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         To start off, You are a veterinary investigator. You take in calls of potential animal abuse and see if they are severe enough for animal rescue to come in and remove the animal. While investigating a farm with strange nighttime happenings, you find your life taking a sudden and shocking turn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRULES: I'm going to be a killjoy...<br>\r\n1) <b>be realistic</b>. if youre a speck on the ground, animals aren't going to notice you, and if they do, wont recognize you as human.<br>\r\n             *because it's a pain to focus on, we can ignore hunger. If you find something to eat, you can remember how hungry you are blah blah blah. Still need to drink though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n             *<b>Animals are animals</b>. they cannot talk, they don't have human personalities and wont hunt the protagonist down because (s)he's there. Dogs might, depending on your size. And animals certainly won't do... Things... With the protagonist if they do manage to find them. Neither will people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n             *<b>the main character is not invincible</b>. You cannot survive impossible heights on a whim. You cant just jump off something that's ten feet high when you're an inch tall and walk away without a scratch. If something like this does happen, explain how you're alive or make sure it is explained in an earlier chapter. if you take a hit that would hurt a normal person, you will be hurt, and any injuries should, at least temporarily, affect future decisions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             *<b>Have the proper mindset:</b> you aren't trying to live out any fantasies, but you are scared half to death most of time. its a scary place to be when you're so small and everything is so large in comparison. keep that going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh... Fine... I suppose, in an adrenaline fueled rush, all the thrill and danger can be exciting and awesome, but don't go pursuing it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) <b>Be descriptive</b>. no one sentence chapters when it can be elaborated. preferably, a 6-8 sentence paragraph minimum, but I can't fault anyone for less. The protagonist is you, so there's no need to get specific on gender, age, etc. if you are specifying the outcome, location, etc. of an event, it's okay, but don't turn that into a chain of \"no\" and \"other.\" furthermore, just be creative. I know it can be hard. If you're stumped, ask yourself \"what would that be like?\" Three times. Works for me every time. <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n*I'm big on consistency in stories like this one. Please: I know can be tricky, but try to remain the same size when describing things. If we are one size, then a tooth and a paw cannot both be the size of a house, and people who frequent these kinds of stories know what I mean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) <b>punctuation:</b> Funny as it is to read, entire paragraph or more chapters that have no periods, commas, or any kind of punctuation grate against my pride as a human being. If you're going to write something, at least take the care to write it properly. Minor errors don't concern me as long as I'm not gasping for air at the end of a \"sentence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) <b>update 7/10/16</b>: <b>for those adding chapters</b>  if you want to change size after the first option to do so, you have to confront the guys in the stable. Only they can do it. For reference, look at the \"you make it into the stable\" chapter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that being said, I will allow pretty much anything, within reason...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI WILL GIVE 10,000 GP TO THE AUTHOR OF THE 250th CHAPTER!!!</td>",
