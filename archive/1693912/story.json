He had been working non-stop and decided to take a break. \"Man, I must have twice as many inventions then I had last week!\" He said to himself as he ate his sandwich. \"I don't know if I'll ever get to test them all. I got lucky with Rouge wanting my chaos emerald last time, but I doubt she'd be willing to do it again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then there was a loud banging at his door. \"Who could that be?\" He opened the door and there stood Rouge with a very ticked look on her face. \"Rouge? What are you...\" \"Don't give me that!\" She cut in. \"You know why I'm here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held the chaos emerald he had given her in front of his face. The one that said \"Made in China\". \"Oh. That.\" Said Tails nervously. \"Well the deal was I would give you a chaos emerald if you tested my inventions. I never said it would be a real one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you little sneak!\" Her temper was fuming. \"Let's see how you like being someone's guinea pig!\" She grabbed him by the scruff of his neck and dragged him towards his lab. \"Wait!\" He said. \"I still have some inventions I haven't tried yet! If you let me try them on you, then I swear I'll give you two chaos emeralds this time! Real ones!\"      </span></div></div>",

Tails tries to run away, but Rouge pulls the trigger, firing a green beam at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beam hit him, then suddenly, he began growing at an alarming rate. Everything around him was getting smaller. Suddenly, he bumbed his head on the ceiling of his lab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" He said. He looked down at Rouge, who now realized her mistake. Tails grinned. He reached down to grab her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to run, but his hand closed around her. He lifted his fist up to his face. \"Tails! Put me down now!\" She demanded from inside his fist. Tails squeezed his fist tight. Rouge yelled, fearing being crushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems to me that your not in a position to be making demands.\" Said Tails. \"Now, I'm going to teach YOU a lesson.\" He pondered what to do with her. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Tails looked around,and then he looks at Rouge. Suddenly,a smirk appeared on Tails's face. Rouge was shaking in fear. Tails then said \"Hmm,since i wanted to teach you a lesson,the lesson will be you being my meal.\" Rouge then said \"But my body is poisonous! You'll die!\" Tails then said \"That,we'll see. I'll scan you now. A full scan,checking every nook and cranny of you.\" He put her into a small container which looks like a blender without blades,and then the top part closes. Tails then starts typing something,and then machine then starts. After a few minutes,the results came in. This is what the machine said: \"SCAN COMPLETE. NO BIOHAZARDS FOUND IN BODY. NO MALICIOUS WEAPONRY FOUND IN SUIT. CONDITION: CLEAR,NO POISON,NO VIRUS..\" Tails then stared with an evil grin at Rouge,which made Rouge shake in fear once more. He took her out of the scanner,and asked her one question before she became his meal: \"Any last words,Rouge?\" Rouge didn't say anything. She just stared at him,scared as if she's going to be killed. Tails then said \"Alright,silence it is.\" Tails opened his mouth,and Rouge looks at it in fear. Rouge began praying that he doesn't do this,but her praying failed. Tails put her in his mouth,and closed it shut. Darkness. Pure darkness around  in there,with little to no light. She started being flinged around in there,going here and there. Tails then tasted her,and thought \"Wow,did she cover herself in sugar or what?\" All of the flinging stopped,and Rouge calmed down,hoping that he'll spare her. Her hopes are nothing but yet another failure. He swallowed her. She fell down,down and down. Then she landed inside some greenish/yellowish liquid. It was acid. She saw a silhouette that looks like a hand. It was Tails patting his belly. She screamed at the top of her lungs \"PLEASE LET ME OUT! I'LL DO ANYTHING FOR YOU! I SWEAR!\" Tails heard it and answered \"Well it's too late,bat girl. You tried to use my growth ray against me,and by accident you enlarged me. This is your lesson.\" Rouge gave up,and thought \"This is it. I'm done for. All that's left is me being digested. Surely I'll have some fun in Heaven.\"</span></div></div>",

Shouldn't you have some clothes on?\" Knuckles asked. \"Shouldn't you?\" She asked sexily, walking up to Knuckles.

I am merely being compelled by an artificial imbalance of chemicals and electric currents, coupled with an image that was blasted into my mind,\" Tails explained.

However while she desperately desired to get away, she found herself unable to motivate herself, due to how incredibly dull Tails was being.

She giggled. \"You make a cute doll Tails.\" Tails couldn't speak. He was aware of what was going on but he coiuldn't control anything. Inside his head, he was screaming obscenities at Rouge, and demanding to be changed back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now, what to do with you?\" Thought Rouge. Then she had an idea. She flew out the door and to Cream's house, still carrying Tails. \"Enjoy your new home Tails.\" She said smirking as she rang the doorbell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dropped Tails on the doorstep and flew off. Tails head footsteps approaching, and the door opening. Cream opened the door and looked around. \"Hello?\" She looked down and saw the doll that was now Tails. \"Ooh, a Tails doll!\" She gleefully picked him up and held him to her face. \"You look just like him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cream! It is me! You have to take me back to my lab!\" He screamed in his head, hoping she would hear him.

Tails suddenly ceased his inner complaints, now listening intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess I'd better see what happens,\" said Cream. She then proceeded to pull the tab out. \"Well?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Although Rouge had some skill at breaking into secure computer databases, she was by no means a programming expert. Thus she initially panicked when she activated the machine and  the screen brought up a prompt that would allow her to custom tailor the roboticization process. Just by looking at it, Rouge could tell that manipulating anything on it was beyond her skill. Fortunately, there was a button labeled 'INITIATE DEFAULT CONVERSION' on the control panel. Relieved at being presented with an easy option, Rouge opted to simply press this, rather than attempt to divine the, frankly byzantine, customization program.As soon as she pressed the button, the machine began to emit a blinding light. When it was finished, the transparent conversion pod lifted to reveal Tails' new, robotic form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a word he was... cute. He looked largely the same as before, small and slightly toylike, except that instead of fur, he was covered head to foot in orange and white painted metal. His limbs, tails, neck, and midsection had been replaced with jointed, highly flexible replicas. Finally, his eyes had become two blank screens. Suddenly two brightly glowing circles, exactly the same shade of blue that his originals had been appeared on them, signifying that he had completed the power up sequence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails stepped forward, out of the roboticization chamber, and turned to face Rouge. \"Yes!\" Rouge exclaimed. \"It worked! Tails is now my robotic slave!\" \"Not exactly,\" Tails replied. His voice was much the same as his original, albeit with a small electronic overtone, and his eyes seemed to glow brighter when he spoke. While on a more obviously threatening robot, such as metal sonic, the affect would have been intimidating, on Tails, who's features were rounded and soft, rather than sharp and angular, it was more endearing than creepy. \"What!?\" Rouge shouted. \"But Robotnik designed those pods to enslave anyone who was roboticized!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is why <i>mine</i> was not an exact duplicate!\" Tails replied, anger beginning to suffuse his voice. \"When I reverse engineered it, I deliberately removed the device's ability to immediately enslave, and made it overwhelmingly difficult to modify the procedure from default parameters! You didn't think the customization tool was that mind bogglingly complex by accident did you?\" he explains as he walks toward Rouge, his new metallic form managing to exude an aura of calculated precision and efficiency, despite how cute it looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge attempted to run, but Tails was too fast for her. He easily caught up with, and captured her. Although she struggled to escape his grasp, his robotic limbs, though fragile looking, where unbelievably strong. Tails lifted Rouge up and she started panicking. \"What are you going to do?\" she asks, frightened. </span></div></div>",

But as she entered the lab, everything went black, and she saw stars as she was suddenly knocked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails had been standing next to the lab door. He had hit rouge in the head with a mallet as she entered. He smiled evilly. \"And this is what you get for using my own machines on me.\" He dragged Rouge across the floor and strapped her into a chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge began to wake up, still dizzy. \"What the!?\" She said when she realized what had happened. She was sitting next to a large machine with a long tube coming out of it. \"Tails, where are you!?\" She shouted angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails stepped out from behind the machine, grinning. His belly was now the size of a basketball, and stuck out a good foot from his body. \"Hello, Rouge.\" He said. \"I thought you might come back to rub this in my face.\" He said pointing to his now rounded belly. <br>\r\n\"So I made this machine especially for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took the tube coming from the machine and shoved it in Rouge's mouth. The tube had straps on its sides, which Tails buckled around her head, so she couldn't spit the tube out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmmmhhhhhhh!\" Rouge protested. Tails went over to the machine controls, inputting commands. \"You the one good thing about this belly of mine?\" He said as he typed. \"After this kid is born, my body will be back to normal.\" He smirked. \"I can't say the same thing for you, though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge gave a muffled \"What do you mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to take something important to you away.\" Said Tails. \"something even more valuable than jewels. Your figure.\" He pressed the start button, and a white liquid flowed from the machine, through the tube, in rouge's mouth. It tasted somewhat like cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge struggled against her bonds, but to no avail. Then, her body started to get bigger. Her belly grew to match Tails', then even bigger than that. Her arms and legs thickened, making them look like overstuffed sausages. Her breasts welled to the size of beach balls. Her body suit began to rip, revealing her growing flesh. Her heart plate strained against her billowing breasts until it snapped and flew off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails grinned as he watched. The fluid was a special weight gain formula he had created for just this. It would continue to fatten Rouge until her stopped the machine.

As she grew, Rouge could feel multiple objects growing around her and shifting positions. These movements were the chair she sat it, as it expanded to fit her growing form. All to soon Rouge began to hear snapping sounds coming from various parts of her body. She felt all of the blood rush to her cheeks as she began to blush furiously in embarrassment. Every second more and more of her blubbery fat was spilling out of her diminishing suit. She felt a strain in her chest, as her heart plate tried to remain clasped to it's masters breasts, but the efforts were in vain, as the plate popped off and shot across the room with enough force to embed itself in the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy cow!\" Tails thought to himself as he clambered to his feet, having just been forced to dodge Rouge's heart plate. As he turned back to Rouge, he began to feel pity. Rouge was occasionally rude, mean, and even could be downright cruel on occasion, but did she really deserve this kind of punishment? Tails pondered this to himself, but only for a moment, as he was soon greeted with his gag reflexes kicking in reminding him of his current predicament. He then remembered who had put him in this position, and quickly hit a button to double to fluid consumption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge suddenly felt the fluid amount increase. And the quicker it increased, the quicker her clothing amount decreased, until only moments later her clothing burst off of her bulbous form, leaving only shreds to cover her. If she wasn't red before then even Knuckles would be jealous of her now. Come to think of it, what would Knuckles, hell, ANYONE for that matter say or think if they saw her this way? Rouge only thought of this for a moment before discarding the idea as a new thought passed through her mind. Could that be grass touching her butt?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Tails had opened up the hanger doors on the rear end of the lab, ironically enough this was the same way Rouge's rear was facing as well so everything worked out just peachy. Rouge's butt and ballooning legs began to spill and spread out behind the lab as she continued to fill with fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest, this wasn't so bad when she put things into perspective, Rouge pondered. At least she wasn't in any actual physical pain. Tails on the other hand, while currently with the upper hand, in a mere couple of months would find himself going through the lovely excruciating pains of childbirth. Rouge would simply have to live at the gym for about twenty years. However all of these thoughts left Rouge's mind as she drifted off into a blissful trance. She was allowing the fat to spill everywhere. Her girth was flowing out across the field. She could feel grass and stones brush against her soft and cushioned body. Her mind was actually at peace for once. There were no jobs, no heists to pull off, no stress, no cares. Rouge was actually happy. She could even feel herself getting extremely aroused by this growth. She prayed for it to never end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, while it didn't end, it did have to stop momentarily as Rouge's extremely large butt ran smack into a...</span></div></div>",

He knew that he would be having a baby soon, but he first transformed himself into a girl not only to protect his identity but to be able to have his baby.

As for Rouge, she was apart of this as well, so he would have Rouge help him take care of the child no matter what.<br>\r\n Rouge was happy, but not for long for she stopped growing. Tails came along and told her everything that she was going to do until further notice.<br>\r\nTaills: Hey Rouge.<br>\r\nRouge: You got me, now we are even.<br>\r\nTails: No we are not. As you were growing I thought about a couple of things, first of all I was forced to change myself into a female to have this child. Secondly, call me Tiffany if you are around other people. Thirdly, you will have to help me take care of this child. <br>\r\nRouge: What, how can I do that while I am like this.<br>\r\nTails: Easy, I know you can't move so I will just bring him or her to you whenever I go out. All you have to do is care for the child. This should be easy for I will do most of the care. When the child gets old enough to be out on his or her's own then I will turn you back to normal.

It's complicated to explain, but you insert a DNA sample in the slot, and then device uses quantum entanglement to track wherever the person in question is.

He had invented braclets, one on each arm, that allowed the user to posses anyone, anything. His first test subject was Rouge, and now he 'was' her. He got up off the ground, and took a step toward his notebook. He let out a slight moan, because his breasts had rubbed against the breastplate. Rouge didn't wear a bra. \"Geez, she IS a slut.\" Tails/Rouge muttered, slightly taken aback from her knew, feminine voice. \"Hmmm, maybe Rouge's brain still works and causes me to act a bit like her.\" Tails guessed. \"Who knows, genious.\" Said a sarcastic voice inside her. \"Rouge?!

And anyways, I'm not going to stay you.\" Tails said. \"Yeah yeah yeah.

Don't do that!\" Rouge thought in her mind. \"You mean you can feel everything?\" Tails asked. \"Yeah. I can feel and think, but I can't talk or move.\" Rouge said. \"Cool! I just have to test one more thing.\" Tails explained. \"Why do you have to-\" Rouge began, but suddenly stopped. Tails now had complete control over Rouge, so Rouge couldn't think or feel. In fact she couldn't do anything. She was frozen in Tails' mind. Of course, Tails could always turn her back on, but she didn't want to dothat just yet. \"Now that I have complete control over Rouge's body, what should I do?\"</span></div></div>",

He was <br>\r\nDigging around his lab for a certain invention for<br>\r\nRouge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere this is the stitching bot 3000. This device is one<br>\r\nof the best sewing machine ever seen. It can make you<br>\r\na dress in under a minute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it makes clothes?\u201d Rouge asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, now lets begin.\u201d Tails said while he turns on the<br>\r\ndevice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe device turned on and started to scan Rouge body<br>\r\nto get the right measurements for the uniform. It had <br>\r\nspecial scanners designed to scan each part of Rouge\u2019s<br>\r\nbody to make sure that the \u2018uniform\u2019 fits perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it doing master?\u201d Rouge asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy device is scanning all of your body to make sure<br>\r\nthe uniform fits.\u201d Tails told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven these?\u201d rouge said while fondling her breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Tails was too distracted watching Rouge play <br>\r\nwith her breast, the device was finishing up all the <br>\r\nmeasurements. Once done, the device put together a<br>\r\nmannequin that perfectly looked like Rouge physically.<br>\r\nThan it began to work on the \u2018uniform\u2019 at a very slow<br>\r\nrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster, I thought you said it can make things fast?\u201d<br>\r\nRouge asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt can, I just set it to slow.\u201d Tails explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Rouge asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought we can spend a little time together while we<br>\r\nwait.\u201d Tails answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh master, you\u2019re so sweet.\u201d Rouge said in a lustful<br>\r\nwhisper.<br>\r\nRouge and Tails then left the lab and went to sit in the <br>\r\nliving room. Once they sat down on the couch, they <br>\r\nstarted to make out and hold each other close. Tails was<br>\r\nblushing wildly and body was starting to heat up. Rouge,<br>\r\non the other hand, was glad this was making Tails happy<br>\r\nand loved Tails so much. She decided to hold Tails close<br>\r\nin-between her breast and look down into his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you master Tails.\u201d Rouge said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you too Rouge.\u201d Tails replied as they started kissing<br>\r\nmadly again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, the two were done. What laid on the<br>\r\nCouch was a sexy, loyal bat that loved his master and would<br>\r\nDo anything for him. She had a smile on her face, a burning <br>\r\npassion, and a few arousing as she looked down with her<br>\r\nhalf open eyes at what she cuddled with. What was cuddling<br>\r\nher was a small fox who had a happy smile and a bunch of<br>\r\npink lipstick marks in the shape of kisses. He lay calm as he<br>\r\nused the bats cleavage as pillows, and had a hand on her <br>\r\nbreast and  a hand on her butt. Tails felt like he was held within<br>\r\na loving goddess. Soon a timer went off, telling Tails that the <br>\r\n\u2018uniform\u2019 was done. When they returned to the lab, there was <br>\r\nno \u2018uniform\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster, where is my uniform?\u201d Rouge asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s behind that door.\u201d Tails said and pointed to a do. \u201cWhy <br>\r\ndon\u2019t go in and change? I want to see how it looks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Rouge went in to change into her \u2018uniform\u2019. After a few<br>\r\nminutes of waiting, Tails finally got to see Rouge. As she exits<br>\r\nout, his jaw drops. Rouge was in a French maid outfit that <br>\r\nexposed a bunch of her cleavage and a skirt so short, that you<br>\r\ncan see her white panties, that are wedged between, in the slightest <br>\r\nmovement. She also had some high heels, stockings, and some<br>\r\nmakeup to top it off. Tails couldn\u2019t believe how hot she really <br>\r\nlooked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfect master.\u201d Rouge said and giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Rouge got all the supplies together and started to clean the<br>\r\nlab. She made sure she was going to clean it as sexy as she can <br>\r\nbe. Once she started, Tails was about to enjoy the show. First,<br>\r\nshe started to dust all around. Bending over every chance she got.<br>\r\nShe wanted her master to see under her skirt, and he did. Wherever<br>\r\nRouge went Tails followed behind. He got glimpse after glimpse of<br>\r\nher panties. Tails was starting to loose it in his mind in arousal from<br>\r\nseeing Rouge\u2019s panties and butt. Rouge knew what this was doing to<br>\r\nTails and was about to make him want more. She cleaned more of his<br>\r\nlab and kept arousing him. Weather it was showing off her cleavage,<br>\r\ndropping a test tube or two into her breast,  or getting on her hands <br>\r\nand knees to clean the floor. All this was doing to Tails was him <br>\r\nwanting more of her. After two hours of cleaning, Rouge finished and<br>\r\nTails went to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did a good job Rouge.\u201d Tails said and then gave Rouge a light<br>\r\nslap on the butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh thank you master.\u201d Rouge said pepped.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tails considered the options, he had so many to choose from... but one in particular caught his eye... he hesitated... it was so lonely being a super genius. <br>\r\nHowever, with this option on his invention he could nudge genetic predispositions in to positive number territory. In this case, IQ points. He looked at Rouge who was waiting for him it appeared to ready himself before striking a pose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a thought, and grinned gently and beckoned Rouge over to the chalkboard and lab bench he usually occupied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I would uh, like you to do, Rouge... is don this lab coat, and glasses but keep them on top of your head for the first shot... and pose like this,\" he demonstrated standing with his arms crossed and hand under his chin while contemplating the board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge shrugged and donned the lab coat and the glasses as instructed and though she was sexy naturally, this added a dimension that even stunned Tails, but he aimed the camera using the viewfinder and centered it on her head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ulp, this is it, no turning back now... here goes nothing,\"</i>he depressed the shutter button and the image was captured at the same time an invisible bolt of energy arced into Rouge's cranium and... her brain grew... new synapses formed, new neural pathways opened... a pair of new lobes began to form... though currently incomplete they were there. <i>\"I hope this works...\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge stood blinking at the board in confusion, what once looked like gibberish on the board to her just a moment ago now ... started to make sense. How was that possible? She didn't know but it was a bit disconcerting. Still, Tails had given her his word that she'd get an actual Chaos Emerald out of this and she really really wanted it so she remained silent for the time being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails lined up the viewfinder again and snapped off six shots at different angles like he was trying to be a professional photographer. Which his IQ would easily allowed if he actually cared. But with each snap of the camera... a little jolt shivered through Rouge's cranium and down her spine... the vague understanding of the formula on the board became sharper and clearer to her... her brain was enlarging further and she was grasping this complicated formula... where moments ago she'd have just ignored it. It was... stimulating... she reached out hesitantly at first, picking up the chalk she kept her gaze now on the board as another bolt of energy shot through energizing her brain and stimulating it's growth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sixteen shots... her IQ was now nearly as high as Tails' own. If Tails had bothered to do an IQ test on her he'd have seen she wasn't as dumb as she acted and he might not have taken so many pictures with his camera on that Higher IQ setting. So, after the eighteenth snap of the shutter, her IQ began now exponentially growing without further prompting... her skull groaning as it tried to remain intact. After the twentieth snap, her forehead rose imperiously and blood flow increased further raising her intellect.. she began writing on the chalkboard with increasing confidence and soon stepped back and set the chalk haphazardly on the lab bench and turned around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails nearly dropped the camera when he got a good view of her throbbing vein fed cranium. She sashayed forward and indicated the board... \"You were wrong on the fourth and sixtieth variable by point zero six tenths percent. If you adjust the eighth and twentieth variable coefficient to two point eight one percent more then you will get a satisfactory result. However, if you leave out the fifth variable and proceed with the overall f<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">= X minus two times two point nine two and divide by sixteen you will not only succeed you will be able to usher in a new age of energy efficiency and production with cold fusion.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails checked and quickly ran the entire algorithm through his super computer and with growing surprise... Rouge was right... she had solved the formula that had stumped even him... he quickly saved the entire blackboard with a quick picture after inputting the information into his homemade super computer for safe keeping and consideration later. When he turned back around to face her she was perched on an anti-gravity chair... no, throne a ring around her swollen cranium was providing additional support via micro anti-gravity generators she was reading through his entire library at speeds that would make Sonic look slow... and each book she perused added to her big bulging brain. She snapped the last book shut, lifted the camera he had somehow lost possession of and made some adjustments. Then handed it to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will use the...\" </span></span></div></div>",

You stay with each other, even when you've grown up. Miles, listen to Rouge, do what she says.\" The future Rouge said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned and walked away.

His fur was darker and he was taller than her. His tails were longer and silkier. He was wearing shorts and a t-shirt. In his hand was a glittering ruby the size of a pomegranate. He threw it towards Rouge. She caught it and stared at it. She looked up at Tails then back to the jewel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened as she realised it was gone.

Sally yelped as she tried to grab onto something for support. Then the entire room of her tower was torn off, and there staring down at her was Rouge. \"Well, well, Sally.\" She said grinning. \"Rouge!? What happened to you?\" Gasped Sally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a little growth spurt.\" Said Rouge. \"Now, you will surrender your position as queen to me, or else you'll be joining your friend, Tails.\" She patted her stomach as she said this. \"You ate Tails!?\" Said Sally, horrified. \"Yep, and he was tasty.

That someone was Sonic, who landed with a loud plop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sonic!\" Said Tails, happy to see his friend. \"Tails!

With a <i>rather</i> cartoonish ding, the door opens, release light smoke and stream across the room. Tails takes a look into the chamber to see the result the machine had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge was standing still with her eyes closed. Her eyeliner, mascara, and lipstick had disappeared, leaving her face without any makeup. It was obvious that she was smaller than before, unmistakably a child. Still she managed to be taller than Tails is now, but it might be loss noticeable if she wasn't still in her boots. Speaking of which, those boots, her gloves, and breastplate were too big to fit her, but fabric underneath it seemed snug around her. Might make sense to wear form-fitting clothing if you're a thief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge slowly flutters her eyes open as they adjust to the fog. She tries to step forward but since her knees were inside the the long boots, she stumbles forward and rolls right out of them. Offering a hand, Tails lifts her to her feet. Upon another inspection, no matter if from the top of their heads or their upright ears, the both of them are the same height. Rouge then quickly pushes Tails away, causing him to fall to the ground.

You're just...\" Tails stated before being cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look kid, I don't know who you are, but you better have a good reason as to why I'm here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails was a little surprise to hear that Rouge had forgotten about him. It wasn't as if she truly got amnesia, though. It was a guess, but Tails hypothesized that Rouge's memories and personality reverted back to what they were when she was eight as well. He figured the first time he saw her was around the same time Shadow and Space Colony ARK appeared, which ultimately was not long ago. Changing her back about ten years would make her not remember who he is. Heck she wouldn't remember anyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,you see...\" Tails said while rattling his head for a excuse good enough not to get his face kick in. \"Ah! That's right. I found sleeping outside a few hours ago. I would have left you there if I didn't think a bad man named Eggman would have taken that chance to use you as a robot's battery.\" For a lie thought up on the spot, it really did capture her attention, plus it was something Eggman probably would have done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eggman? Sounds like something you would eat for breakfast? Aw well, let me tell you something, Foxy. If that punk ever tries to pull something, I'll kick him so hard, he's gonna need ice for weeks.\" Rouge boasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She's already good at kicking people at eight years old? Just who is this girl.' wondered Tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way,\" she said rather stiffly, \"what is with this outfit?\" She points towards the empty breast plate that threatens to sag the entire attire to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood rushed through Tails cheeks as his face breaks out into a blush.\"Well, when I found you, you were mostly...um...n-naked\" Rouge's mouth started to growl after hearing this, frightening Tails into a panic. \"But, you see...I couldn't leave you like that! So I tried throwing some clothes on you. It just turned out that they were too big. Do you get it now? It's actually kind of funny. Haha ha! Ha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a swift motion, Rouge kicked her toes into Tails' gut. The pain that caused him to double over was being smothered only by the fact that he knew she was holding back. \"I knew you were a freak, I guess those big tails weren't for show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was something Tails hated more then people mocking his height it was people mocking his twin tails. He quickly got up and began to yell at the brat before it just started a session of the two just spatting insults at each other that resolved nothing. Finally, Rouge stormed out of the lab, holding up the plate to keep it from bouncing around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails was upset about what just happened, but when he finally cooled down he knew he it wasn't right to leave kid Rouge to the world. Tails spoke aloud to himself \"Man, I guess I screwed up, huh? I need to get her back here before anyone sees her, especially Eggman. Mmmm...she's probably not a jewel thief so she might not try to stay hidden. Maybe a survey bot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the door slammed open as Rouge returned. She was obviously still in a foul mood, looking at the fox.\"Umm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tails, the name's Miles Prower, but call me Tails\" he said getting the hint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, so Tails, turns out I need a favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Tails curiosity peaked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't quite leave yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"</span></div></div>",

With his mouth slightly opened and a twitch in his eye, he quickly folded. \"Right, off to get some clothes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--One hour Later--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stood in the middle of a shopping mall, staring down a clothing store for girls. Girly girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tails, you can't be serious. I would look absolutely ridiculous if we shop here.\" Rouge complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ridiculous? You're the one using my tails to cover herself.\" Tails pointed out. True enough, Rouge blanketed herself in between his golden furred tails. Quickly removing them, she stood nearly naked with only the fabric of her former suit on her, minus the breastplate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, I'm not girly. I never have been. Wait, you're a genius or something, right? Can't you just take some bigger that I would like and shrink them to fit me?\" She questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm an engineer. If it doesn't have any tricks like hovering over water I don't think I would make one hundred percent.\" Judging by the look in her eye, he guessed she stopped paying attention after the 'walking on water' thing. Wait, can't she fly? \"Anyway, if you really don't want the be 'naked', then you should really get something while we're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no way I'm doing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugff\" Tails scoffed in detest to Rouge's behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, looks like I'm getting nowhere here.\" With that, Rouge left Tails behind leaving a trail of people gasping at her sudden rudeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails just watched as the batgirl disappear among the crowd. Finding an empty bench, he sat down and began thinking about what he was going to do. Obviously Rouge tolerated him up to this point because he could help her, but now she doesn't want it anymore. Then he thought about the promise he made with her to test his machine. He had hope that if she didn't remember, he wouldn't have to give her two Chaos Emeralds. Now he was thinking if he had rode along with this for too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a tap on his shoulder in the middle of his pondering. Before him was Rouge in a new completed outfit. Over the black fabric was a white gilet vest with the edges being pink. She was also wearing a pair of khaki shorts that seemed loose if it was not for the belt with a heart shaped buckle. Apparently she still had her taste in boots as she wore a white pair similar to her old ones that went high enough to allow a few inches between them and her shorts. The plain part about the outfit was the traditional white gloves that almost everyone has, but her left wrist held a bracelet with a moon-star pattern. Tails couldn't lie to himself, she picked out a great wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to see you try to find this in that shop.\" Rouge boasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! How did you find clothes to fit you?\" Tails said with amaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently there are stores here for <i>all styles</i> and <i>all ages</i>. Turns out this genius didn't look hard enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails slapped his forehead in light of his mistake. Then a realization popped into his head. \"Wait a minute, how did you pay for those if I wasn't with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I just took them. Do you seriously think they would force the <i>sweet, innocent</i> girl to take her clothes off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Point taken, but if you ran off without me, why did you come back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he heard her excuse, she looked to the person standing behind him. When Tails turned to see them, his heart slightly sank. What if they put two and two together and realize the Rouge got younger? Now he had to deal with... </span></div></div>",

She wasn't certain, but this girl seemed awfully familiar to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tails...\", Amy started, \"who's your friend here? She kind of reminds me of someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly placed his hand across her mouth in an attempt to stop her talking. He raises his other hand to her ear and whispers, \"Amy, don't freak out, but that's Rouge. She tested one of my new machines, and now she is eight years old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she practically squealed in a hush voice. \"Well why she's here? Why did you bring her to the mall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I sorta...can't tell you why.\" he uttered not wanting to bring up the clothes incident. \"There is another thing. She can't remember anything past the point she was eight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let me get this straight: she is now eight which is also your age, she doesn't remember us, you're both together at the mall, and you're too shy to tell me anything else.\" she summarized. \"It sounds a bit like a date if you ask me.\" she teased with a sly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails' white cheeks tinted red after hearing this. \"No, it's not like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello...\" Rouge's voice piped up, catching Amy and Tails off-guard. \"You can't pretend that I'm not here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was the first to apologize and 're'introduce herself to the kid. Rouge's impression towards the adult in the group was not the best, still being peeved about being ignored.  She was a bit of a rebel to Amy, not going to in depth when answering her questions or straight up refusing. She was getting irritated to the point she had  her hammer behind her back. Even though he was nervously looking directly at her, Tails had no clue where it came from. The conversation was going south until the focus was set to Tails himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Amy starts gripping the hammer tightly, \"If you don't mind me asking, why exactly are you here with Tails?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge places her hands her hips and look in his direction. \"Because he's taking care of me. He told me about some evil 'Eggdude' and now he wants to play hero.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy froze. \"You mean Eggman, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever his name is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, can you excuse again for a second.\" She grabs Tails to speak privately again. \"Okay mister\" she hisses, \"you're going to have to fix this. If Eggman was to get her, she probably wouldn't be able to fight back as she used to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I think she might be fine.\" He waves his hands in front of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you be so optimistic about this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know how she used to thief? Well everything she has right now <i>is</i> stolen.\" He points behind her. Of course the only thing of interest of Rouge. Amy scanned the clothes she was wearing to catching his drift, but what really sealed the deal was that she was holding Amy's Piko Piko Hammer behind her back, not really trying to hide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Give that back!\" she screamed, snatching it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, what can I say, it looked so cool I wanted to see it for myself.\" Rouge smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, that's the real Rouge alright.\" Tails deadpanned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" she returns to a whisper, \"this still seems pretty weird. Do you think you turn her back to normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's possible...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then do it! Sorry to crush what little fantasy this is, but you know what you have to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails knew that Amy was right, but to a point, he didn't want to turn her back, at least not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a sharp pain hits Tails as Rouge pulls his ear to engage into their own private conservation. \"If she's giving trouble, I know what we should do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails asked, \"We...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're being too soft, kid. Toying with her is fun, so we should prank her. Then she'd know not to look down on you.\" she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prank her? I don't know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, what's the worst that could happen?\" It grew silent as Tails was reflecting on the last 'prank' he pulled. \"It doesn't have to be anything big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I do have other machines I wanted to test out. Hopefully these ones don't affect memory.\" he mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the ticket. Wait, what was that about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing!...Nothing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to see what you would do, but the choice is yours. Are you going to do it or not?\"</span></div></div>",

We going to head back to the workshop.\" He carefully phased to keep Rouge in the dark. \"Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why do I have to go with you?\" Amy took suspension in 'we'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails only thought of one word that was good enough, \"Closure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.

Upon stepping indoors, Amy became overwhelmed by the number of machines. She knew it was one of the best, if not the best, thing Tails can do, but this seemed pretty excessive. \"Tails! Are all of these machines new?!\" she screamed not being able to compose herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was caught in the middle of thinking of how he would prank Amy. \"Huh? Oh, yeah.\" He scans the room until he saw something that might do the trick. \"I started off with this one first, then the rest just worked itself out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was too caught up she forgot her reason for coming. She examined the device that Tails grabbed. It wasn't what she expected. In his hand was what looked like a laser gun. \"Argh,.. what does it do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing bad, I promise.\" he pulled the trigger and the resulting laser hit Amy. She stood still before her legs slowly bent and crashed on the floor. \"That was a lot easier than I expected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge was a little shocked, \"What did you do?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said it was nothing bad.\" he waved his free hand in front of his face. \"The laser makes the person it hits fall asleep for an hour. When they wake up, it would be like they slept for eight hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy slowly stirred while she muttered, \"Oh...Sonic...Your running...can't out race...my heart...\" The fox and bat just stood still, not sure how to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\" Tails said, hoping to end the confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if anything, you bought some time. You better have thought of something good by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails scratched the back of his head. \"Actually, I already thought of a few.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what are you waiting for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing really, i just...curious about something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge flicked her ears and grinned after she heard him. \"This outta be interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made some machines that need one test subject, but I also made a few that need more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...you expect me to be guinea pig?\" she said fuming. Tails stayed silent, thinking of the irony. \"Why don't you just test on yourself!\" she spat as she held Amy's hammer up high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha! No no no no!\" Tails span his twin tails allowing him to reach to the top of the hammer as he eased it back down. With the fearsome instrument down he breathed a sigh of relief. \"Look, at least you would know what would happen, and if something goes wrong, I can fix it better if I am like I am right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glared at the boy, then tilted her head down in contemplation. She rattled with the idea as she tapped the Piko Piko in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you please drop it already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly would happen?\" she questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends, but they usually swap some things around, like switching minds and bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thinks it over again before looking back at the hedgehog on the ground. She saw her once more before deciding.</span></div></div>",

So what does bad boy do anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...It's...an age changer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of silence, Rouge smirked, \"Perfect.\" She grabbed one of Amy's arms and began to drag through the doors as Tails only waved his hands in a failed effort to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy continued to muse in her sleep. \"Sonic...I knew you'll...take me away...one day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, she has it rough.\" Rouge commented as she had Amy sit up in the chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails had to raise his voice a bit, \"What do you think you're doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She seemed bossy, so I think it'll be fun to shrink her down to our level.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails winced at what she said; it was the same thing he thought to himself when he did it to Rouge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready to teach her a lesson?\" Rouge was eager to see the result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails gulped. What if Amy were to get amnesia too? It was too late to try and suggest something else. He decided to go through with it and hope to fix it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe genius fired up the machine, set the age to 08 years, and stood back. Everything seemed like it was going fine; it was working just like it did the first time around. Before long, there was the cartoonish ding and the double doors of the chamber opened. The sleeping hedgehog was definitely smaller than when she went in.  Her dress sagged as her figure no longer supported it. While it looked like she could manage wearing her gloves and shoes, it was not going to be easy. The only thing to still fit was her hair band as her quills stood out behind her instead of lazing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge looked the young girl before facing the boy, \"I'm going to wake her up.\" Before Tails could protest, Rouge was already shaking Amy's shoulder. A few shakes was enough to pop the bubble coming from her nose and wake her. She fluttered her eyes and yawn and found the white bat in front of her. To Rouge's dismay, Amy's ear piecing scream forced her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Amy rose to her feet while her whole body fidgeted, \"Who are you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you don't remember me?\" Rouge queried. The only response she got was a fear induced shake of the head. \"Ahh...I wanted to rub it in your face, but what's the point if you don't remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails was locked in a inner monologue during this, \"I first met Amy when she was eight years old, after Sonic saved her from Eggman and Metal Sonic. Is she at the point where she would she know who I am?\" As his eyes left the interface, he saw Rouge's eyes shooting daggers at him as if he robbed something from her. \"Please don't look at me like that. If you hadn't rushed Amy into...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how do you know my name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy..!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy moved forward but each step threaten to have her dress slide off. She quickly caught wind of this and held it up with her arms. Unfortunate she didn't tighter clothes like Rouge did. \"No, don't look at me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge shrugged, \"Well aren't you a shy one? Getting a little stared having people look at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails stood off to the side, \"Like you're one to talk.\" Suddenly, an alarm started going off, startling everyone in the room. Tails immediately recognized it and pulled a small tablet from underneath his workbench. \"Why now, why now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned it on and the screen lit up with a live feed from the Blue Blur himself. \"Hey Tails, Eggman is on the move with robot in tow. We need air support, buddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it! I'll be there in the Tornado soon.\" Tails was ready for the face-off until he snapped back into his situation with the young bat and hedgehog. \"Aw man. Look I have to go, but neither of you can leave the building.\" Tails said with authority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw that,\" The bat rejected, \"Sounds like you need all the help you can get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Tails nearly growled, \"I know what I'm going to be up against. You are probably going to get in the way. Just stay here until I get back. And you know what? That's an order!\" Tails left the room. Within moments, Rouge and Amy had seen through the window the jet plane takeoff off the runway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That kid,\" Rouge muttered, \"what makes him think that he can give me an order?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink girl just looked on as the jet disappeared. She didn't say anything but instead was thinking...</span></div></div>",

Her eyes blinked when the jet blurred out of focus. \"Whoa...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge just scoffed at her situation. She was told to stay in a place she barely knew with a prepubescent version of the woman she wanted to tease but can't recall what happened and was one unfortunate move from being completely naked. What really ticked her off though was Tails' command that struck her right in her pride. He seemed submissive and manipulable beforehand. Now the fun was over before it could start. She took another look at Amy who lost in her own little world. It was pretty obvious to her that she had a crush, especially figuring what she said in her sleep. However, her eye was now on someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You probably don't want to do it.\" Rouge spoke up, gaining Amy's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Wait, does he already a girlfriend or...\" Amy said innocently before jumping to the conclusion, \"Ah! I'm sorry! I didn't know you liked him first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe apology deserved a spit-take courtesy of Rouge. \"N-no! Don't be stupid! I would never..!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Sorry. So, <i>is</i> he..?\" asked the thumb-twiddling girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the heck should I know? Just trust me on this. This could be bad news.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy puffed her cheek at Rouge, showing her mildly angry side. \"Well why not? He's fighting Eggman, who the bad guy so he must be a hero or at least a good guy.\" (I'm assuming she'd know even when she's this young, personally I have no true idea.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? Okay. First, do you remember what his name was?\" Amy's face froze, seeing how that could be a problem. \"Second, you're suddenly in his place and aren't allowed to leave.\" She placed her index finger over her lips thinking about how bad that was. \"Lastly, you're nearly naked.\" This caused her face in red up under her pink fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it just a bunch of misunderstandings, I swear!\" Amy pleaded. \"Besides, a cool guy like him would never do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy placed her palm on her cheeks and began to drift back into her imagination, \"He's so super smart, super reliable, and super handsome. Flying away in his plane to save the day. And he has big puffy tails too. I bet they'll feel like snugly pillows. What a dream boat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was getting too sappy for Rouge's taste, but then she got a wicked idea. Why mess with one person, when she can toy with both of them at the same time. \"You're really not going to change your mind huh? Well then, I guess only be fair to let you in on a secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy snapped back to reality, \"Secret? What secret?!\" She quickly rose to her feet, which led to the inevitable wardrobe malfunction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, first things first, wear some clothes that fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--90 minutes later--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tornado touched down on the runway without a single scratch on it. Its pilot sighed when he came to a complete stop. He was a little thankful that it was only one of Eggman's ridiculous attacks instead of a serious one. But now he had to resume with another problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy peeked out the window and tried calm herself down. Rouge leaned into her ear to whisper, \"Remember, he's smart but dense. Try being as straightforward as you can.\" She stepped away and thought to herself, \"I can't wait to see his face when she confesses to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails stood outside the door when he felt that something was off. He slowly opened the door and saw to two girls inside. While Rouge remained exactly the same, Amy was refitted with a green top, orange tutu, and light bluish shoes. (Exactly like in Sonic CD) The truly scary part for Tails was that she held direct eye contact with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe love-struck girl took a deep breath and said...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amy was in the dark about her current situation. She could not make sense of it all. All that she could gather was that she was abducted by the bat and fox. The girl seemed to have some beef with her and most likely got the boy to tag along. Even after the boy shouted at the bat, she still seemed like the one in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge scoffed. Staying cooped up in one spot was not what she wanted to do. Since gloating the hedgehog turned into a failure, her train of thought leaned toward putting her back in the machine and doing something else to mess with her. She had time, but not the knowledge. She was a bit bad, but she'd still feel guilt if something happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink girl saw the bat girl in a state of anger and tried to seize an opportunity. If she could do something to her, her own escape would be ensured. She slowly rose up grabbing the oversized dress and inched towards a center with many weird instruments. Each one that stuck out to her was confusing; she had no idea what did which thing. She ran her free hand over it and grabbed something at random. What she got was a small remote device with a forked antenna, a green screen, and only one button. There were not any instructions, so she just pointed it at Rouge and pressed the button. Electricity ran across the prongs of the antenna and the screen showed a wavelength of some sort. Other than that, nothing else happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge's ear flicked at the crackling of the electricity and turned around. She saw a worried Amy looking at her. \"Just what do you think you're doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving lost her chance to make a break for it, she fell back onto the ground. \"Please! I wasn't doing anything, I swear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that means you were.\" Rouge pointed out the obvious. She approached her with angry malice in her eyes, \"I knew you were a pain. I'll just be finished with you before he gets back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy cowered in fear, \"Please, don't come any closer! Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could not see it, but the screen on the remote turned blue. In that instant, Rouge was visibly forced back as if she had hit a brick wall. Despite her efforts, she was physically incapable to move toward Amy. The pink hedgehog looked at the remote that kept emitting a blue screen rather than the original green. As she recalled, her attacker stopped as soon as she told her not to. She commanded it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe caught a second wind and stood up with the remote pointed at Rouge. \"Freeze!\" The scene had many similarities to a police officer stopping a criminal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bat's arms, legs, and neck all locked in place. Without being able to stabilize herself, she fell face-first to the floor still holding the pose. Rouge's will to stand up was ignored by her entire body. \"Shoot! Why can't I move?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand up!\" With the command, Rouge shot straight up back on her feet. \"Jumping jacks!\" Her body continued to follow instructions and begin to embarrass her by unwillingly exercising. \"Bow!\" She leaned forward with her right foot behind her left and her arms swept down to the sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I get out of this...\" She threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Anything I say, she does. Maybe I grabbed the best thing of all.' Amy thought to herself smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge tried to find a way to free herself. From the corner of her eye she saw something useful, the raygun Tails used to make Amy fall asleep. She hobbled while still bowing and grabbed her lifeline. With a quick flick of the wrist, the hedgehog fell asleep again, dropping the remote in the process. Regaining control, she walked over to retrieve the remote. 'Maybe...I can have my fun after all.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy snoozed off again, but woke up nearly instantly. Rouge saw this and quickly jumped back. \"How did you wake up so fast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scratched the back of her head, \"Yawn...I-I guess it's because I just woke up...a little while ago.\" She rubbed her eyes before noticing the remote. \"Uh-oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rose to her feet to try to get the device away from the bat, but Rouge pointed it at her and pressed the button. \"Mmm...?Oh I know. Drop the dress!\" Amy had no choice as the hand lifting the dress opened. The red garment dropped around her ankles and her face blushed mad. Rouge pressed the button again and said, \"Now say 'Rouge is so awesome. She's the best!'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen went from blue back to green. When Amy didn't say anything, Rouge thought, 'Was I not supposed to hit the button again?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could fix it, the naked hedgehog tackled her. Rouge lost her grip and the remote flew across the room. Both of them saw the remote and raced to it before the other could get their hands on it. There were many times that it slipped out of one of their grasp, but eventually one of them got it, pressed the button, and yelled \"Freeze!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir victim was frozen and unable to move. The girl to claim the control device was...</span></div></div>",

As expected, they both smile, surprised to see him unexpectedly. Cream in particular walked up in front of him and greeted him politely. It did not take long before she asked the obvious question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\" she bows her head to the bat, \"I'm Cream. Who might you be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge huffs \"Mmph...The squirt really minds her manners. The name's Rouge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails was stunned by how quickly she revealed her name. Seriously, there was no easier to make the connection to the two Rouges than for both of them to have the same name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream had a finger on her mouth looking up, staring off into space, with Cheese mimicking the action. \"Hey, Cheese? Haven't we heard that name before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chao...\" he responded dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's fine. It's nice to meet you Miss Rouge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails was dumbfounded about the entire exchange, thinking, \"They absolutely forgot about her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla spoke to Rouge in her soft voice, \"We don't usually see Tails with kids his age. How did you two meet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I was just outside one day and that's just it.\" she lied as she blushed in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails interjected, \"Yeah, nothing really out of the ordinary there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just finished shopping and are headed home. Mama, can we invite Miss Rouge over?\" asked Cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why not, but we should tell her parents so they know what's going on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge expression darkened at the mention of her parents, something that did not go unnoticed by everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my... Dear, I...\" Vanilla apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...shut it...\" Rouge mouthed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rouge...\" Tails tried to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said shut it!\" she yells attracting the attention of everybody in the mall. She starts breathing aloud while avoiding all eye contact. She quickly turn to run away but is stop when Vanilla grabs her right wrist before she could make a single step. She tries to yank her arm free, but it was useless as Vanilla was not flinching. \"Stop! Let me go! You don't got anything to do with this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadow casts over Vanilla's face and her motherly smile was replace with a frown of disapproval. Her presence was cold as the only thing she told the fleeing bat was, \"No.\" Vanilla was so scary, Tails and Cream enveloped into a fear-induced hug with Cheese taking shelter behind them. No matter how hard Rouge pulled, she stayed plant to the ground, allowing only her arm to move. At the lightest hint of Rouge's resistance weakening, she pulls her forward and leads her out the mall. Cream followed her mother while Tails was still confused about what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama, what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes were revealed again as she looks at her daughter. They weren't passionate, but they also weren't threatening. \"It's a mother's job to watch out for their child. So we're going to search for her when we are told more about her.\" She looks towards the helpless Rouge who has reduced to not moving her legs, allowing herself get dragged as she stares at the ground. \"In the meantime, we are going to be the ones to look after her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderstanding, Creams turn back to Tails and waves goodbye. When they are out of sight, everyone returns to their business. At least now Tails can think clearly again. \"Aw man. I don't think I should try to stop them. I hate not knowing what's happening to her, but now I can go back to fix the aging machine. Hopefully she could hold out until then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--The Rabbit's Residence--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the cottage, the rabbits and bat situated in the living room. Rouge was a grump, still looking down feeling powerless. Vanilla saw the brat sitting on the floor and her daughter looking incredibly worried. \"Cream, can you and Cheese go to your room? I want to talk to her alone.\" They nod and left without a word. She sighs, not quite sure where to begin. \"...After all that, I bet you must be hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry?\" she says, not satisfied with that response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......C-can I have something to eat.\" She tilts her head up but still doesn't look her in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, dear.\" She grabs a small wrapped snack from the cabinet and offers it to her. Rouge eyes it, gently plucks it out of her hand, unwraps it and bites down. \"Okay, can you tell anything about what happened between you and your parents?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge turned her head and took another bite. Vanilla was frustrated until she heard something coming from Rouge. Sniffing? No, it was more like crying. Rouge was not looking away in detest, she was trying to hide tears. Vanilla returned to her former motherly self and shown great concern to the crying child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M...*sniff*...Miss R-Rabbit......please...\" she begins to plead, wiping her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...*inhales*..._________________\" she yells.</span></div></div>",

The child was on the verge of losing it, but kept her face up to the adult. \"I just can't go back there again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla was understandably frightened at the outbursts. She pained to see this suffering coming from the girl. \"Sweetie, w-why can't you go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge whimpered as she wiped her face with her arm. \"If I go back, I'll...be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla quickly placed her hand over Rouge's mouth. She had not heard anything yet and was already mortified. She could tell that she was traumatized by whatever was at the other end of her words. The bat just closed her eyes as tears fell onto Vanilla's glove. She knew Rouge needed comfort, but she could not leave it as it is and ignore it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla's eyes were cast in shadow again. Her hands grabbed both sides of Rouge's cheeks and tilted her head up. The bat was shocked to see the rabbit's serious face again. The same one that dragged her out of the mall no matter who saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did they hurt you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did they threaten you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't tell me, there's nothing I can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What can you even do...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes slanted into a glare that stared down anyone to question her logic, \"Pardon me, but there's nothing a pissed off mother can't do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--Tails Workshop - Morning--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails was deep in work on the aging machine. He was taking extreme caution in trying to remove the physical memory drive without damaging it. With soldering gun in hand, he focused everything into going for the target. \"To think, everything about the jewel thief is inside this computer chip. If I mess up here, she's truly going to be lost.\" He flipped the switch on the soldering gun to bring it up to heat. \"Okay, carefully...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud noise rang across the room, startling the genius. His body jumped in place causing him to panic. After inspecting that nothing was damaged, he went to the source of the noise, a small tablet device that someone was trying to call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tails here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen lit up to show the face of his young rabbit and chao friends. \"Hello, Tails.\" She bowed her head but did not wear her usual cheerful face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails knew something was up. \"Is something wrong? Does it have to do with Rouge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh. Mama was talking with her and got really mad. She said her parents were mean to her so she's going to do something.\" Cream and Cheese shared a concerned look. \"I haven't seen her like this in a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chao chao...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw man...\" Tails sighed. \"Wait, what do you mean 'in a long time'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream's eyes trailed off in remembrance, \"Well one time, we had a fake plant on top of our TV. I pretend to take care of it by giving it water, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails tried to finish the story quickly, \"Spilled it on the TV and broke it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream was ashamed in herself. \"Mama already told me it was fake, so when she found out, she punished me to make sure it wouldn't happen again. She is scary when it came to 'discipline'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was more believable to Tails after seeing what happened yesterday. \"You said she was going to do something, what was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid rabbit balled her fists. \"She said she was going to give them a piece of her mind. She also said she might need to talk with the police for help.\" Cheese grabbed the video phone and showed a different part of the room. \"Until then, Miss Rouge is staying here and away from anymore danger.\" Rouge sat at the dinner table idly smearing one of Cream's crayons onto some paper. She was too bummed out to even look up when her name was spoken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails did not like the initiative Vanilla was taking but understood why. \"I guess that's for the best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails eyes popped open in sudden realization, \"WAIT! That's bad! Really Bad!!\" Leaving a questioning Cream on the line, Tails ran out the door. \"The memories can wait! Vanilla doesn't know Rouge got younger. Within those ten years, there's no telling what happened. She's going on a wild goose chase...or worse...\" Tails shuttered at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two-tailed fox made a quick flight to the closest police station to the Rabbit's residence. He tried to see if Vanilla contacted them in anyway. Weirdly enough, she had not. He was confused but then thought that she went ahead without any help. Tails did not know where to go, but he stormed out of there. He began to panic until someone cleared their throat behind him. He turned to see the motherly rabbit apparently waiting for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vanilla, why did you...?\" Tails asked before being hushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spoke in a deeper tone than usual, \"Tails,\" He knew she was going to say something bad. \"You're going to have to fix this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm certain.

Vanilla gently yet firmly held Rouge against her chest. Rouge at first resisted but gave up, screaming into her fur and skin. It was uncomfortable, but the rabbit knew it would take a moment before she'd calm down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes of expressed pain has passed before the noise died down. The crying reduced to sniffling as Vanilla lightly rubbed young Rouge's head. She placed both of her hand on the sides of her head and looked in her still tearful eyes. \"Dear, I'm going to need you to something for me, and for yourself. Don't say another word tonight. Not one......When you finished your snack, we'll have dinner, then go to bed. Unless if you want to go to bed now?\" Rouge shook her head in Vanilla's hands. \"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge got up and dragged herself to the dining room table. After being instructed by her mother, Cream came back from her room, trying not to speak the bat but give her warm looks when they made eye contract. After a silent dinner, everyone retired for the night. Because Vanilla didn't want her emotionally stressed guest to sleep on the couch, she shared Cream's bed. The mother took a last look to make sure everything was fine as both kids were in bed before turning off the lights. Cream turned her head towards Rouge, who only met it by looking in the corner of her eye. \"Good night, Miss Rouge\", was all she said before flipping herself around. Rouge turned over herself and started to drift off while thinking if she should have responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--Morning--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the friendly chao assisted the both of them out of bed, they went to the living room where Vanilla sat, waiting. Cream stuck to her 'new' friend like glue before the topic was resumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Rouge dear, are you going to be comfortable enough to talk about it?\" she didn't answer, looking at the floor. \"That's okay. I just need to tell you this.\" She rose to her feet and took a step forward. \"You said that you had nowhere to go. Well, we'll be here for you.\" This really took her by surprise. Cream and Cheese both gave smiles of full sincerity after hearing the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why...?\" Rouge asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone should have a place where they call...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" She interrupted. \"Why...why are you being so nice to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Vanilla got to her knees and eye-leveled with her. \"There is no other reason than you need it. Everyone needs kindness in this world. You need to both give it and receive it.\" she hugged her head against her chest again and was joined by Cream and Cheese. \"I know it must hurt, but if your don't accept kindness, you'll push away the people that would help you, that care for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge just stood in the middle of everyone. She kept mostly to herself for a long time. Her relationships with people were always loose, so no one got too attached. Like with the fox boy. It started off sour, then she used his tails to cover herself until she got the chance to nab something to wear. She had planned to get him caught in the mix should her plan fall through. She never saw herself being this selfish until now that she's being embraced by a selfless family. She closed her eyes, trying not to show her tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--One week later--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails finished soldering his latest invention, the 'Memory Reforging Helmet'. He worked on a way to restore Rouge's memories to bring her back to reality. Luckily for him, the aging machine held onto them due to its large storage capacity. After building an adapter to back it up to a portable drive, he plugged it into the helmet. Considering the rest of his recent inventions, this one was done rather slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, if Eggman hadn't decided to attack that night, I could have still been in the groove I was on. Whatever. Now I just need to find Rouge. I hope Vanilla knows where she is.\" He recalled when she dragged her out of the mall by her wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly left his lab and flew with the helmet in his hands. Getting close to the Rabbit Residence, he spots Cream and Cheese picking flowers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lands in front of them and they exchange greetings. \"So Cream, do you know what happened to the bat we saw a week ago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean Miss Rouge? She's had been staying with us ever since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a little surprised, but it made it easier for him. He walked through the front door and called for Rouge. When she was actually in full view, Tails saw that she was wearing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Umm...Aren't you a bat? Don't you like the night?\" Tails said with both sarcasm and true curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Real funny. Why don't you try to find your way home in the middle of nowhere?\" Rouge snaps back. \"So like it or not, I'm pretty much stuck here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great...\" Tails sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--Some Time Later--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery reluctantly, Tails sets up a makeshift bed with a couch, blanket, and some pillows. Not the best bed in the world, but hey, it beats sleeping on his workbench. Meanwhile, Rouge just lounged around not really saying or doing anything. In truth, she seemed bored out of her mind. After a bit of agitated finger-tipping, she finally broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Foxy, when are we going to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...I guess I could cook something right now.\" The fox opens the fridge and examines its contents. \"Ah man. Sorry Rouge but I was creating so many machines I forgot to get some more food. All I have left is a chicken breast and some potatoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmpf...Is that all? You make if sound like a bad thing.\" Rouge walked into the kitchen and grabs the ingredients. \"I wouldn't want you to screw up this meal, so I'm going to take over from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails looked a bit confused, \"You? I wouldn't picture you being able to cook or be a chef. You seem so...tomboyish.\" Remembering Rouge before the experiment, her consistent flirting, wordplay, and feminine charm wouldn't quite label her a 'tomboy'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll just have to prove to you just how wrong you are.\" Then without warning she punts him straight out of the kitchen and onto the sofa-bed. Taking a wild guess, Tails thinks he should just left her continue. Though this wasn't the first time a girl was fixing dinner for him, Rouge, kid or not, is not Vanilla or Cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he tries to find something to occupy his time, he eyes the age device, door open and Rouge's old boots lying on the ground from when she tripped. Moving to the monitor, he looks up something that's been bothering him. Rouge can't recall most of her adult memories, so if she were to age up again, would she remember? After troubleshooting, he found the direct answer he was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails built the machine with a large amount of memory space and processing power, so he could return test subjects to their previous state. With it, memories. Once they were reverted back, they would be in the same state as they were before the test. Unfortunately, since an individual's brain packs so much information, only a single person's data could be stored. If someone else runs a test, Rouge's memories would be deleted and be unable to be recovered. Tails makes a mental note to see if he could make the storage device removable, and possibly portable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, if you're done with that, I'm finished with the food.\" Rouge yells at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cautiously crosses it front of the plate in fear of what monstrosity he would have to eat. When he opened his eyes, he was slightly taken aback. She cut the potatoes into wedges and evenly fried them. She baked the chicken to the point where it was cooked the whole way through. The entire plate was glistened with a light red liquid that was probably there to make it look fancy. Everything would have surprised him if he didn't see Rouge's plate next to his and how 'generously' she divided the chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I admit it looks good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough talk. I want to see the look on your face when you eat your words.\" She said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picks up a fork took the first bite out of the chicken. He honestly wanted to find some fault in it, but was seriously just a good piece of chicken. Rouge laughs at the face she wanted to see and started to eat the wedges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did a good job Rouge, but what was this red sauce on the plate.\" he questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't know. I just grabbed it from the second fridge over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Second fridge?\" He looks in the direction she was pointing and his eyes instantly grew. He smacks the fork out of Rouge's hand yelling, \"Stop! Don't eat anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your problem?\" she fires, incredibly ticked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not a fridge! That's a cooling unit. I didn't just make machines, I made potions too. You put some kind of potion in the food and we can both be affected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rushes to the unit and immediately finds out the potion's effect.</span></div></div>",

Why did it have to be that one?\" Tails thought, cursing his luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what was it?\" Rouge asks, sounding more concerned than she intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a vial of truth serum.\" He unconsciously blurts out. He could not help it after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the truth floating in the air, Rouge planned to take full advantage. That was until she honestly said the first thing that came to her mind. \"Man, don't scare me like that. For a second I thought you were going to say poison.\" Though not what she intended to say, she played along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I don't make poison, and even if I did, I would definitely prepare an antidote.\" He defends himself to protect his credibility before trialing off again, \"But maybe I should have made an antidote to the serum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this should be fun.\" She approaches Tails to corner him while trying to think of some juicy questions to ask him. \"Maybe I get some dirt to blackmail you with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well we both ate the chicken so you're under its effect too.\" he points out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hoping you wouldn't notice.\" she cringed as she showed him he was right. \"It's no big deal. I just wouldn't say anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really think that's going to work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not really.\" That time she slapped her mouth shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently the potion more than effected the words they said as Tails could not stop himself from laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge exploded, \"Hey, knock it off you jerk. I'm going to kick you so hard that's it's going to hurt.\" Silence rang throughout the room before Tails laughs even harder after the threat flopped. He soon stop when he fully though it through. It struck the same time Rouge's toe dig into his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lands on his back before raising his index finger to confirm, \"Just so you know, I'm not a fan of getting kicked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\" she growls at herself for destroying her own image. \"That's it! I can't tell the truth if I'm the only one asking questions, right? So I'm not giving you a chance.\" She lifts him to get him at eye level. \"Now why the heck did you make this inconvenient potion?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I needed it just in case someone was hiding something from.\" he helplessly answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was disappointing. Well with that out of the way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails needed to interrupt her before she would ask anything that would be compromising. \"Why did you come back here? You don't seem to be the kind of person to hate the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got on my nerves, but it looked like you got so many interesting toys here. I was going to wait until you fell asleep to  take some, but now that you know that, I can't.\" she stomps on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And another thing, why did you want to cook for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was for you to trust me. Pretty pathetic isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pathetic, how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stooping myself to such a level you'd expect a little girl to do, cooking...Ah! Tell me this wears off. Tell me it's right now, please!\" She yells the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only supposed to last an hour, but it was split between the both of us, and most of it is still on the plates. So really, it shouldn't take that much longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So last than thirty something minutes? That's too long! You know what, my cover was blown, I'm out for real this time.\" She turns towards the the door, pushing it open. Tails could tell she was serious this time because she was trying to snake her wings through the fabric so she can take flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails tried to stop her, \"Wait! If you leave now I won't be able to fix you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n............<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Rouge said in monotone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...kinda turned you into a kid. You're really supposed to be an adult.\" He hangs his head in shame. He tried to avoid revealing the truth but, in the end he revealed himself without even being asked a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge takes a step back and pivots on her toe. With great speed, she pins the fox against the wall. \"Why the heck would you do that?!\" Her eyes were flaring with menace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you agreed to it.\" Now Rouge's expression was flabbergasted. \"We agreed to do some experiments with you being the test subject. You know I'm not lying right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......Well...Sounds like I was being stupid.\" She lets go of Tails and backs off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the thing I didn't want to tell you the most. Now that you know I don't see a reason to keep this up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to turn me back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's the right thing to do.\" He boots up the aging machine to return Rouge to normal. Rouge stares first at the machine, then the boots, then the breastplate before it all started making sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what was I like as a grown up?\" she asked with wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seductive, sly, greedy. If there was something you wanted, you would stop it nothing to get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon. When you step inside, you'll also get your memories back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge was lost in thought before saying...</span></div></div>",

The way you put makes it seem a bit scary. Damn potion! I hate not being able to keep secrets!\" Rouge shouted the last bit with her arms flailing in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy chuckled at the bat's misfortune, only for her to raise her kicking foot to immediately get him to pipe down. \"Sorry, you know I can't help it. ahem...So what are you even going to do now that you're choosing to still be a kid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if I change and get my old memories back, then what would happen to the ones I have now?\" She asked with her head slightly tilted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...don't know...You might keep them or they could be pretty much deleted.\" Tails guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, if they do, I got to make some enjoyable ones.\" Rouge crossed her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, is that really necessary? We could just see if they do right now and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to say anything else embarrassing again, so I'm going to bed.\" She turned and headed towards Tails' bedroom. Before Tails could stop her, the door was slammed shut and locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile everything was under control, Tails couldn't really do anything at the moment. Despite his better judgment telling not to leave her alone, he left to get more food for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--Morning--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge was a bit a mess when she woke up. She was never a morning person, probably due to her being a bat. Her eyes fully adjusted to the light after a yawn and saw the different environment. Remembering what happened, she quickly checked one thing before anything else. She grabbed one of her wings and said aloud, \"This is a wing of...a wombat..!\" It was stupid, but now she knows she can lie again. She stood up and heard her stomach growl. \"Right, I cooked dinner last night and it ended up on the floor.\" she grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked out of the room and immediately saw Tails sleeping on the cough. What was more surprising was the stockpile of food on the center in paper bags. Paying no mind to it, she opened the fridge to see if he got milk and was more astonished that it was completely filled as well. Seemed like he made several trips before tiring himself out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eyed him snoozing away with a glass of milk in her hand. It didn't escape her that he purposefully bought too much food for her. She caught herself staring before shaking her head. \"Whatever, after what he did, he <b>owes</b> me breakfast, at least. Hey Tailboy, rise and shine.\" She dug her toe into his sleeping face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails got startled awake and pushed her foot aside. \"I'm up! I'm up already! Geez...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, cause I'm starving.\" With that, Tails was already pressured into cooking breakfast. Well, he 'prepared' it instead of cooked it as he just poured two bowls of cereal and cut an orange in half. Rouge teased Tails' simplicity. \"So the genius that can make machines and potions doesn't know how to cook? That's kinda sad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it! I just didn't want to wait for too long.\" He retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no further conversation as the two ate. It was a little weird to Tails that while she teased the meal, she was downing it as if someone else was going to take it. When she finished drinking directly from the bowl, she let out a sigh and licked the corners of her mouth. Tails stated, \"This is really strange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you're supposed to be an adult, and yet you chose to stay a kid. Why is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge turned up her nose, \"...I-If I wanted to answer that, I would have told you last night thanks to that stupid truth serum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious she's trying to avoid talking about it, but would knowing actually help?</span></div></div>",

It makes the drinker become more attracted to the first person they see.\" After he was finished explaining, the two were obviously staring at each other. They hastily spin one-hundred eighty degrees, breaking all eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me something good about this or else you and my heel get real attracted each other.\" Rouge threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt worked as Tails frantically thought of a response. \"Huh?! Um um um...Well the potion is temporary, so if we wait it out, we should be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...\" He took into account that to potion was split in two and was mostly on the plates. \"...ten minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge sighs and sits down on the ground. \"That's not too bad, I guess. All I have to do is not look at you, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails takes a seat as well. \"Don't make it sound like that is the bad thing here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed in utter silence. It was nerve wracking that doing nothing was to best thing to do. Rouge spoke up, \"If I had to guess, I'd say you got your eye on someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails face heated up at her remark. \"W-what are you trying to say?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made a potion that make people like someone else. It would make sense if you were to use it on the special someone to like you back.\" She smiles, though it was invisible to Tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails facepalms, clearly wanting to change the subject, \"Why does that even matter to you?\" He place his hand back down and unexpectedly touch something. He turns his body to look when his shoulder touched something else. Truly curious now, he looks behind to see that the gap separating him and Rouge was gone as he saw her looking back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! What are you doing!\" Rouge screams, averting her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?! We were a few feet away! I shouldn't have bumped into you.\" He defends himself by covering his eyes with his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must've scooted closer to me. You're already losing to the potion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this isn't working.\" Tails ran to his bedroom and slammed the door to separate himself from Rouge. He opened the door slightly to yell back, \"Don't steal anything!\" then locked the door behind him. In solitude, Tails forced himself to calm down. His heart was beating quickly, which he hoped came from the sudden shock and yelling. Even though he was just sitting down, he needed to catch his breath. The most troubling thing was he kept seeing the image of Rouge staring back at him. \"If this is happening just from a taste, drinking the entire vial could drive the drinker crazy.\" he concluded. Faintly, he could hear something happening in the other room. He couldn't immediately tell, but it sounded like a piece of metal hitting something. He thought of what it might be before his face pales. No, she isn't...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails opened the door and confirmed his supposition. Rouge was holding a fork with the chicken in one hand, potato wedges in the other. She ate without any restraint. Her eyes wandered over in Tails direction and noticed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth was still full as she indifferently said, \"Hey...You're back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?! You can't eat that!\" Tails yelled has if she lost it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? Yeah the fork was on the floor but I cleaned it.\" She showed the fork has if it was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not it! If you waited a bit longer, you would been fine!\" He explained with great concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know, but I'm still hungry and this is the only food here. I still going to eat so the potion would have done its thing anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't the worst argument, but the fox knew to result. \"Arg...You do know that when mine wears off, yours is still going to be a problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but if you eat yours too, then it won't be one-sided.\" The witty bat countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails gave a slight yip. He did not like where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge showed a smile different from her former seductive tone. It was more friendly. \"What could happen? After all, you liked the cooking, didn't you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that smile made Tails' heart beat faster. \"...Even if I wanted to, you're eating from my plate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True.\" She stuck the fork into a wedge from her plate. \"Then take one from mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She planned this out! That's cheating!\" Tails screamed internally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, it would be mean to deny my cooking.\" She pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails was torn. It wouldn't be fair for him to stay away from Rouge when she was going to be the only one under effect. At the same time, if he went along with it, he didn't know how far it would take him.</span></div></div>",

So she lay there, making cute little baby moans &amp; coos. She kept on trying to grab it, but the results were the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails stared at the baby as she was reaching for the emerald. \"She's pretty cute,\" he thought to himself. \"It amazes me to think that this tiny baby would grow up to be the treasure hunter/ jewel thief/ part-time spy she is today.\" After that, he was wondering about something. He wasn't an expert on raising children, but he figured that he or someone else would have to raise her again, since she was currently unable to do anything on her own. But then he also considered possibly doing another experiment on her, like make her another age or trying out another invention. He sat there pondering what he should do.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His claws grew longer, but he gained the ability to retract them like a cat. His upper canine fangs extended,  and his eyes turned red. A large pair of leathery wings, each nearly as long as Tails was tall, grew out of his back, stretching outwards to display his massive wingspan. Then, his waist pushed in as his hips flared out, and his nipples surged forward, forming D-cup breasts. His limbs became slender, and his hands and feet turned dainty. His face became much more feminine,  and his hair grew out, falling down his back until it tickled his bubble butt. Finally, his penis disappeared inside him, becoming a vagina, with his testicles becoming ovaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge broke off the kiss, and looked at the new succubus staring back at her,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel, my pet?\" She asked, stroking Tails' muzzle. \"D you like this new you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails looked up at her and said...</span></div></div>",

No, no, that can't be right. If I was dead I wouldn't be walking around!\" Suddenly, Rouge slipped on the floor. The force of the impact knocked her head off, but she hadn't realized that yet as her head had landed looking away from her body. As her body stood back up, she began to worry when her head's perspective didn't shift. \"Um, Tails? What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails picked up her head and turned her to face her now headless body. \"I told you. You're dead.\" Rouge was stunned. \"No! No, I can't be dead! This just has to be a side efffect of your machine! Right?\" \"Here, I can prove it to you.\" He walked up to her body and pressed her head against her own chest. There was no heartbeat. \"See?\" Tails handed Rouge her head. She slowly held herself up to examine her neck stump, and was able to see all the muscles and spinal bones and everything. \"I-I just can't believe it...\" Rouge mumbled, before breaking down in tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails gave her rotting flesh a gentle reassuring hug. \"There there Rouge. I know this must come as something as a shock, but look on the bright side. At least you're still ambulatory, right? Most corpses aren't nearly so lucky as you are.\" Rouge sniffed, then smiled weakly. \"Y-yeah, I guess that's true. Um, Tails?\" \"Yes Rouge?\"</span></div></div>",

BUT! I can give you some mobility.\" He says, picking her head up. \"Cynthea, would you mind getting project 36 for me?\" \"Of course master,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Cynthea returns, she has a strange disk in her hand. \"Rouge, this is the grav plate. It's a bit complicated to explain, but essentially it allows whatever it's attached to to float around.\" Saying this he get's to work, attaching her head to the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he is finished he tells Rouge that she should now be able to control it with her mind. Rouge just sits there, trying to activate it. \"Um Tails? I think it's broken or something. I can't get it to work.\" \"Oh, right!\" Tails slaps himself in the forehead. \"I forgot to attach the power supply! Stupid me.

From what you see it works. Makes you fall in love with the person you lay eyes on. If you want it Rouge has it, though if you took another step closer I think she'll lose it.\" Tails responds. Amy saw the vial of pink liquid in the bat's grip, and couldn't help but well up with the desperate desire to get Sonic in her arms and pulls out her hammer. \"I'm getting that potion!!\" she lunges at Rouge in a hope to catch her off guard and seize the tool she needed to accomplish her goal. </span></div></div>",

Though, in concern for her lover, but only having one hand free, she barely and disappointingly manages set it on low power and shrink, zapping herself and shrinking down her titanic cleavage just enough to let Rouge walk freely, Tail's on the other hand, was still nearly pushed to the ceiling still being handcuffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge getting some breathing room, gets enough time to fly out.

Rouge responds, \"Oh hell yes I'm jealous, but on the other side I know these are mine. All mine.\" Amy, satisfied, slides the gun down her giant boobs, which pretty much fill 75% of the room, toward Rouge.

Of all the people!?\" Rouge asked herself this when she was answered when Tails started to \"examinate\" her eyes with his to make sure she is ok.<br>\r\n\" I need you to look at me just to make sure.\" Tails said while giving her a smile and putting his hands in her red cheeks.<br>\r\n\"Are you sure are you alright?

Just feeling ok.\" Rouge said while started to lose in his eyes.<br>\r\nShe started to get close at him more and more but for some reason he seemed not being affected by her almost like he didn't is falling for her charms too.<br>\r\n'Could it be I teased too much that he lose any affect form me' For some reason this simple thought made Rouge feel much things: regret, guilt, sad, shame and overall realization over her own feelings.<br>\r\n\"Tails could I just talk with you over something?\" Rouge said almost pleading.<br>\r\nTails notice that and Tails raised an eyebrow in complete confusion<br>\r\n'What could be? I think it was working.\" Tails seemed confused she was over the control of his nanorobot so what is happening.<br>\r\nRogue waited to Tails take position and decided to speak.<br>\r\n\"Tails you know I always made fun of you for feeling attracted for me?\" Rouge said with a guilt tone.<br>\r\n\"Well to be honest I don't like to think in that moments\" Tails said masking his emotions of confusion.<br>\r\n\"Tails\"Rouge said while putting her hands over his neck and taking him much close to her. \"I'm sorry. I am sorry for being bad with you over all this time it wasn't right and it was selfish of my part because I...\" she started to lose courage when she finally was going to say it.<br>\r\nBefore Tails could ask what is happening Rouge smack her lips with his started to make out with him.<br>\r\n \"Who could imagine that my first kiss it would be you?\" Rouge said with a proud tone while tears of joy started to run from her face ruining her make up.<br>\r\nTails was in shock first Rouge asked for forgivness, then she confessed to him anf now she wants him like a lover.<br>\r\n\"Err could you please excuse me a moment?\" Tails said with nervous.<br>\r\nRouge see this like Tails is resisting her charms, well if she go far she would go beyond to have him by his side. <b>He would do anything for him</b>.<br>\r\nTails started to check over his pad to check Rouge's brain. Tails found herself surprised to see that his nanotech was locked in the affection mode for some reason her brainwaves made the nanotech take it's own will in the matter and now apparently it was locked in the command of making her attracted, interested and happy just only around him. In other word she made Rouge  fell in love with him.<br>\r\n\"Tails~\" Rouge take Tails attention while letting some underwear fall to his head.<br>\r\nWhen he looked she was naked in a description that only in dreams she could imagined.<br>\r\n\"What is it? My fox boy is awing her damsel who wants his attention.\" Tails only thought in running away but for some reason his \"lower parts\" wanted to get close more and more to her.<br>\r\nTails debates this if he goes it would mean he had to make sure to deactivate the nanorobot and make Rouge return to her old self.<br>\r\nOn the other hand he could just enjoy the moment but it would mean he just had to not only return this new Rouge her feelings but also accept any possible repercussion that his tech is making by his own inside of her.<br>\r\nSo what it could be the best?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just to look at the camera and realize he didn't stop the recording and starting to run up to stop the video.<br>\r\nData:From now on I will only make a video per month just to make sure someone else doesn't...\"get any ideas\" to ruin the again<br>\r\nEntry #1:<br>\r\nDay 1 after the incident<br>\r\nSubject: Rouge the bat<br>\r\nStatus: Girlfriend<br>\r\nEffects: Caring, Flity,Protective, Submissive.<br>\r\nNotes: The day after our encounter I was worried that she might still have some sense of what I did to her at first but at the moment she wake up and started to kiss me I know she didn't, and now here we are, speaking like a married couple who ask how we are all the time, I decided to test how much control I have over her, I started to ask all the morning about personal details of her life with the excuse to know us better if we are going to be something I begin with thing like her likes for jewels, treasure hunt,her daily life, and little by little I started to ask more personal things like her age, childhood etc; with that said he discover she was an orphan who live in poberty and that's why she want to always have beautiful things so she could always have something she can afford even if is just the silliest thing of all just because she got nothing in her past. After this Rouge started to ask me something about me.<br>\r\nShe confessed that she already knew a few things about \"the sidekick of the hero of mobius\" like my hobbies and favorite things, but if she and many others who spent time with the duo always questioned was: How was Tails's and Sonic's life was before the whole hero thing started?<br>\r\nUneasy  with this I explain my part of this since I assured her that Sonic didn't tell me a lot since he seemed to hate about his past.<br>\r\nWith a nod she gave me I explained that I didn't remember my parents and the same as her I didn't grew up with them, I told her about my problems I had in those days like people bullying me because I was more smart that the rest, or just because if my Tails, I could swore I just saw Rouge get angry for a moment when I talked about the part when they destroyed my inventions, but anyway I told her how I met Sonic, and since then we are like brothers.<br>\r\nAt the end she seemed thanked that I shared that with her to suddenly asking me to wait for her in the living room while she got out of the house for a minutes.<br>\r\nI take this oportunity to take a look on the device I discovered the robot unlocked the hormonal control, who is the ability to produce some especific hormones to make specific changes in the subject body or put it in some state.<br>\r\nI decided to introduce some \"adrenaline\" in her system to only fund her back squeezing me in her...\"girls\" saying she was some good news, apparently she just contact Eggman to tell him she quit and he didn't dare to wait for her because she would never came back and she would hate to be a bother for le anymore.<br>\r\nI was happy at least she won't be our enemy anymore, but the I realize something if she decided to quit just like that for me then how it could be with her precious emeralds.<br>\r\nI decide to give her my emerald once for all<br>\r\nwhen she look at it she was confused apparently after all of this she forget her principal reason to be in here, I remind her and then her face turned sad it was the proof I needed to know,she started put him over her own likes to decide to make her a new offer.<br>\r\nShe seemed intereseted when I told her it would be about us I decided to ask her if she live with me...let's just said in only take her more than 2 seconds to say yes and started to run to her house for her things.<br>\r\nKnowing it would take her time I decided to inspect the new function I recognized some names, to summarize some control brain activity like programming brain chemical to give the adrenaline and make someone feel asleep.<br>\r\nAlso some alter some physical things like body shape, like rejuvenate the body or backwards make someone look more older but for all make some parts of his body grew more than others.<br>\r\nTaking a moment he decide to....</span></div></div>",

Now what do u want me to do?\" Tails smiled knowing his plan turned into a success. Tails had Sonic step into the machine he used to turn Knuckles into a girl.

Just for people who were already outside the mind.

I only get used when she thinks of jewels, and even then Greed does most of the work. It's sooo boooring. I figure, since she doesn't use me much anyway, she won't miss me when I'm gone.

I'm sure at least some of you were hoping for this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story takes place after a certain story line in the first one. Where Tails gives Rouge a fake chaos emerald. Same rules as the first one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, You can put in the same inventions from the first one, just don't use the same storylines. Make something new up! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that's pretty much it. Have fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUPDATE! I have decided to put in an option for Tails to test his inventions on another Sonic girl. There is to be no experiments on any male Sonic character except for Tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOriginally by Anonymous One <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/portfolio/view/ironman16\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/portfolio/view/ironman16</a></td>",
