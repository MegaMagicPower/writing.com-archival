Here and there, servants and courtiers waddled around importantly, hustling, bustling and gossiping among themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nServant-boys in uniforms of breeches and tunics, white stockings and shoes, waddled hither and yon, the sunlight reflecting off of the brass buttons on their baby-blue and snowy-white uniforms.

But...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix waddled after his master, staring nervously around. He sighed. Crown Prince Cameron could be notoriously stubborn! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My prince! Please! I beg you to return to your chambers! Cassidy and I can bring you whatever you want from the kitchens! You're not allowed in the servants' quarters! You're not supposed to move!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh-sh-shuddup Felix! Y-you're MY boy and you're...g-gonna...d-do w-what I ask! T-that's...your...job!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix groaned. He knew the prince was right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes. Master\", he said. He hurried up to his master and started walking alongside him. Cameron was enormously, staggeringly fat. At just twelve years old, he had already succeeded in weighing over a ton! Carefully, Felix guided his master through the palace, stopping every six feet so that the prince could catch his breath. Cameron's only clothing was an enormous, blue cloak the size of a bedsheet, and a thick, gold chain draped across his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe long passage towards the servants quarters was triple-wide. Even so, the prince blocked nearly the entire width of the corridor with Felix hurrying alongside him to ensure he was comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My prince! You should've come in your litter!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...g-guess that...w-would've...b-been...smart!\" Cameron wheezed. He leaned heavily on an elaborate silver and ivory walking-stick in his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-not...much...further!\" Cameron wheezed. He turned a corner and waddled towards a pair of doors. Felix hurried forwards to knock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in!\" said a boy's voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix shoved the doors open and waddled inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His Royal Highness, the Crown Prince Cameron!\" he announced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" the boy yelped! \"Oh wow!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding behind an enormous work-table, his hands dusty with flour, Benji Benson stared at his prince! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenji had dark, chocolate brown hair and weighed nearly 450lbs. Just ten years old, he was an aspiring baker, and his doughy physique sure looked like he was! He waddled out from behind the table and bowed low. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Royal Highness, Prince Cameron, Sir!\" he said. He reached out and kissed Cameron's hand, getting flour all over the prince's forearm and fingers. He blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...ahem...you shouldn't be here...should you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I told him!\" said Felix, feeling frustrated. Cameron smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...wanted to...see you!\" he said, slowly getting his breath back. Benji blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I can always bring food to you, right?\" he asked. Cameron nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know!\" he said, \"B-but I...I just wanted to hang out and stuff...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenji nodded. \"Aww...that's sweet\", he said. Cameron laughed.  </span></div></div>",

Benji's father, who had caught him in the palace bakery when he'd returned from his delivery-rounds, and who had of course, at once reported him to the king. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelching heavily, Cameron waddled slowly into the palace's great throne room, bowing to the throne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waddling off again somewhere, were we?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron kept his head down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes, papa\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Felix...you permitted this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Majesty!\" said Felix, dropping to his hands and knees on the long, red carpet that ran the length of the throne room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Darius frowned. \"Cameron.

A few crumbs dropped from his mouth, down his three chins, in between his two massive moobs, and running down his massive stomach to land gingerly on the purple robe which covered his nether area. The robe was made of the finest silk and dyes of Adiposia, and were a gift to him by a merchant wanting to gain his favour. Just like now, the robe was often the only thing he wore. Although it didn't really matter, as his crotch was long lost in between his massive fatpad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommo, who was sitting at the end of Edmund's bed. Swiftly dusted the crumbs off his robe. Tommo was quite the eagle-eyed boy, and moved surprisingly fast despite being a servant of 500 Lbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks man!\" Edmund said, noticing Tommo's deed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommo smiled at the compliment. In exchange for their eternal service to the prince, they were showered with praise from His Highness. That was all that really mattered to Tommo and Mason, if Edmund was happy, they were happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mason, Tommo, I'm thinking of leaving my bedchamber. Could you go fetch my clothes and jewelry?\" Edmund said, as he shuffled a bit, only to end up not moving at all due to his near immobility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommo and Mason then left the room to go to his wardrobe, which had to be moved to another room due to Edmund's constant growing collections of jewelry, clothes, and other expensive items. In the meantime Edmund pondered to himself of what he should do today. He then came to four possibilities.</span></div></div>",

Don't you want to go out?\" said Tommo, obviously confused that the stubborn prince actually changed his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've thought of something better, a gift for you two for working so hard! Come on, help me up.\" Edmund replied with a large smile as he motioned the two boys to come towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMason and Tommo took his blanket off and grabbed him by one of his large cheeks each, and proceeded to haul him up very slowly. As they finally got him up on his own two feet, he started to lean forward, almost knocking over a gold statue of himself in the process. Luckily, Tommo and Mason were able to get Edmund's balance finally under control. Unfortunately, all three boys were already sweating a storm when they finally all stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo Tommo! Grab me my walking stick!\" Edmund asked him, although he was panting while talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ay sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommo waddled to the end of his giant, gem decorated bedroom. He looked at Edmund's walking stick rack which hung in between two paintings made by a famous painter by the name of Severus Lardius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one you want today?\" Tommo asked Edmund, who was still cooling down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Imma going casual today, so let's go with the sapphire studded one\" Edmund said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ay sir\" Tommo said as he brought the stick to Edmund.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I think we're ready to go!\" Edmund said enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But uh, uh master.\" The timid Mason sputtered nervously. \"Uh, what about, your clothes?\" he said, fearing that Edmund may not like his questioning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nahh, I'll be fine!\" Edmund said, making a dismissive gesture. \"All the adults are out on this big meeting or something in a foreign nation. It's just me, you two, the other servants, and Cameron in the palace today\" He said with a confidence that was unique to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdmund slowly started wobbling outside with the aide of his walking stick. He just barely managed to squeeze his wide cheeks between the already giant door-frame. Tommo and Mason walked behind him slowly, making sure no one could see all 2,000 pounds of naked, sweaty, princely flesh walking through the ornate palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooooo, Edmund, my master, my good sir, my highness.\" Tommo approached Edmund from his side. \"What is this quote on quote gift you have for us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will seen soon enough, my fine servant!\" Edmund said, trying to put on his most noble and proper accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, fine\" Tommo replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after 5 minutes of traversing down the hallway. Which in actuality was about 30 feet. They finally reached a large sliding door at the end of the hall. It was the palace bathrooms!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommo practically squealed as Mason slowly opened the sliding door. Servants weren't allowed in the royal bathhouses, they had to go to the crowded servant bathhouses downstairs. One by one, the three boys slowly waddled into the steamy room. Tommo and Mason followed Edmund towards a small slope which led them to the water. Slowly, Edmund drifted his huge body into the shallow water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you two waiting for? Get undressed and come in!\" Edmund yelled, motioning them to come in.</span></div></div>",

Except that he looked like he weighed 500 pounds! The boy was dressed in nothing but silken robe of the purest white, trimmed with gold. He waved a hand dismissively, and at once, everybody resumed their conversations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPondius Adipus - the God of Gluttony and Hedonism, waddled sedately through the palace. Immortal and ageless, he had to the permanent look of an extremely adorable, and extremely obese, little boy. His face was fat, soft and round, with a very thick double-chin, his belly wobbled and bounced and his buttocks wobbled with every step. A golden crown of laurel leaves encircled his head, while in a quiver by his side were stored a knife, fork and spoon of silver and gold. His feet were soft, plump and bare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled as he approached an enormous bedroom door and knocked. It was opened a minute later by a boy in blue and white servants' outfit, who gasped, and immediately stepped back, falling to his hands and knees.

PUMPING out sweat, he stood there, wheezing and gasping like he'd just run fifty miles! Pondus laughed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit. DOWN. Cameron\", he said, kindly. Cameron collapsed back into his bed, wheezing and gasping from the effort while all around him, dozens of palace servant-boys rushed to find Pondus a chair...and a footstool...and food! In under a minute, he found himself sitting on his ass, his feet up and at least half a dozen palace servant-boys surrounding him, eager to serve! </span></div></div>",

Good living and good eating have always gone hand and hand in this noble land, as borne out by their national motto: <i><b>\"Gula et Voluptatum\"</b></i> - \"Gluttony and Hedonism\"! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd nobody exemplifies these qualities more than the royal family themselves! Indeed, the very prosperity of the lands they rule are directly affected by their own pleasure, comfort and obesity. The better they are served, the richer the country will grow! As such, they are literally waited on hand-and-foot, every minute of the day, to ensure the absolute highest level of pampering possible! They live in the grand capital of their empire - the exquisite Adipella City. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould you like to meet them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>High King Roland</b></i> - Also known as Roland the Vast, High King Roland is 30 years old, with dark blonde hair and a neatly trimmed beard, and has blue eyes. Weighing 6,000lbs, he is the undisputed ruler of all Adiposia, and to whom all must pay tribute! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA generous, merciful and kind ruler, Roland has learned to do as little ruling as possible - a gentle touch will always achieve the greatest results - Adiposians are creatures of habit - and they do NOT like those habits being changed.  The king introduces new laws and changes old ones at his peril. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>High Queen Marguerite</b></i> - The Matriarch of the Royal Family, Marguerite is sweet, loving and attentive. She spoils her sons incessantly and loves the high-life. Throwing feasts and dinners, garden-parties and soirees is her greatest pleasure, as well as feasting on the finest of foods! The Queen had to gain a sizable amount of weight to bear her young safely, and rocks the scales at 4,000lbs! Like her husband, the Queen is 30 years old, and has soft green eyes and light brown hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Crown Prince Cameron</i></b> - The fattest boy in the entire kingdom, Cameron is a sweet, kind, and generous boy, spoiled sweet by his parents and pampered lovingly by his servants. Cameron has blue eyes and golden hair like his father. He is 12 years old and weighs 2,300lbs. His favourite activities are playing in the pool, hunting, shooting, eating and being pampered, and hanging out with his friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Prince Edmund</b></i> - Edmund is Cameron's younger twin brother. Like his brother, Edmund is sweet, loving and friendly, but unlike his brother, he tends to be more 'active'...in as much as a 2,000-pound blob can be. He has chestnut-brown hair like his mother, and soft green eyes like her, as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>The Royal Servants</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Bretton and Eliza Tibbetts</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBretton, is King Roland's personal manservant. Both men have known each other since childhood, and are very close. There is almost nothing that Bretton don't know about the king's life, or vice-versa. Eliza is Queen Marguerite's personal lady's maid, and she attends her mistress's every need. While the King and Queen sleep in separate bedchambers, the suite of rooms between their private apartments are the personal rooms of their most senior private servants - Mr. and Mrs. Tibbetts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Felix and Cassidy</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same age as their master, Felix and Cassidy are Crown Prince Cameron's personal servant-boys. They both have soft, blonde hair, with Cassidy's more coppery, while Felix's is more golden. They weigh about 300lbs each and are by far the prince's most loyal retainers, ardent fans and most obedient servants. They are the sons of Bretton and Eliza Tibbetts, the king and queen's personal servants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Tommo and Mason</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same age as their master, Tommo and Mason are Prince Edmund's personal servant-boys. Like their colleagues, Felix and Cassidy, Tommo and Mason exist purely for the function of ensuring that Edmund does not have to lift a finger. It is their job to wait on him, hand and foot, night and day, and to be at his beck-and-call whenever he desires. Tommo and Mason are the grandchildren of Allaric Wilvermere - the palace's Majordomo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Benji Benson</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 years old and 450lbs, Benji Benson is the son of the palace baker. One of the princes' closest friends, he has the privileged position of being able to go anywhere he wants in the palace, to deliver the princes food from his father's bakery. It is his dream to one day take over, and follow in his father's footsteps and rise to the rank of Chief Baker to the Royal and Imperial Household! As the main supplier of food to the princes' bellies, he shares a very special relationship with them, and often spends far too much of his spare time hanging out with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Prince Hades</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHades is no servant, he's actually the princely bodyguard. A longstanding tradition dictates that the secondborn prince (or prince closest in age to the Adiposian princes) of the Kingdom of Mountania grows up in the Adiposian royal court, acting as their bodyguard, confidante, friend, and disciplinarian. It's his job to protect the princes, look after their welfare, help them out, and, if needs-be - punish them, on the king's orders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHades is 13, tall for his age, with long, flowing golden-brown hair and a tan. He's also extremely jacked, muscular and obscenely good-looking. He's a laid-back, arrogant, swaggering slacker, and likes to throw his weight around, but deep down, he is a genuinely sweet, kind and loving kid, who considers the massively fat Adiposian princes to be his closest friends. </td>",
