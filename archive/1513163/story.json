Unfortunately for you, the path that leads directly to your house has been blocked by a massive pile-up, so you must find an alternate route. The only path you can take is the one through a spooky looking forest that not too many people have been known to go in. Despite this, you simply shrug and begin to walk through the forest. As you get halfway through, you hear low growling in the distance.<br>\r\n\"Whoa...what was that?\" you ask yourself while turning around.<br>\r\nAnother growl is heard, but you're still unable to find anything suspicious, so you continue to walk.<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear a loud guttural noise and some ferocious beast hops out of the trees and lands right in front of you! The beast is standing on all fours with gray fur covering its whole body and blue tattered shorts on. Its short pointy ears wiggled and twitched a little bit and it had long claws on its feet and paws. Drool was dripping from its large, pointy yellow teeth and seeping onto the ground. A long gray tail was slowly wagging left and right and its red eyes were piercing into you. The monster lifted its head and howled loudly. It was obviously a werewolf.<br>\r\n\"Oh my God! A werewolf!\" you yell.<br>\r\nThe monster snarled viciously at you and takes several steps forward. Then the creature stands on his hind paws and stands right next to you, staring down at your face. The monster is nearly six and a half feet feet tall; seven inches taller than you are. <br>\r\n\"What are you doing here, trespassing on my territory? Turn around and go away now!\" he growled.<br>\r\n\"Whew! I never knew werewolves had funky bad breath! You want some breath mints?\"<br>\r\nAs you offer the Lycan some Mentos, the werewolf snarls viciously again and swats the pack of mints away, angry and annoyed.<br>\r\n\"You dare mock a creature such as myself?!\"<br>\r\n\"I wasn't mocking you; I was stating a fact.\"<br>\r\n\"One...more...word...and you wake up in my stomach!!!\"<br>\r\nYou gulped loudly. Sure, it was fun pestering the werewolf, but now it seemed really peeved at you. And by the sounds of its grumbling stomach, it was hungry. This werewolf might actually be crazy enough to chomp your head off.<br>\r\n\"Now what's it gonna be human?!!?\"<br>\r\n\"Um...\"</span></div></div>",

All the meat you want!\" you shout in desperation.<br>\r\nThe werewolf lets you go. He ponders this fact for a moment.<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... perhaps you can serve me better than I thought...\" he muses, stroking the whiskers on his chin in thought, \"You will take me to this butcher's shop... immediately!\"</span></div></div>",

It's right this way.\" you say.<br>\r\nYou turn around and begin to walk down the path you were just on, with the werewolf following you and breathing down your neck. You wish you could run away, but you already know that the werewolf will quickly grab you and stuff you into his mouth, so you decide against the decision. After walking for about a half hour, you arrive at a late night butcher shop that looked like it had just closed down.<br>\r\nThe werewolf's stomach growled and you realize that he has begun drooling heavily after you feel drops of slobber land in your hair. He laughs evilly and gets on all fours, ready to run into the butcher shop and ravenously eat all of the meat.<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" you shout.<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"You can't go in there! My manager is working the graveyard shift. What happens when he sees a giant werewolf?\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I won't chew his body when I eat him.\"<br>\r\n\"How about...I go buy the meat for you and deliver it to you? Then you can let me go home and everybody is happy.\"<br>\r\nThe werewolf growled gutturally at you, still thinking that you might decide to betray him.<br>\r\n\"You better not take too long or I'm gonna have to come inside myself.\"<br>\r\nThe werewolf shoves you into the road and you begin to run to the butcher shop. You open the door and walk up to the counter, greeting your boss who's still wearing his white hat and bloos-stained white apron.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jonny. How's it going? I thought I said your shift ended an hour ago.\"<br>\r\n\"I forgot something though...\"<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\nYou looked around at all the fridgerated hunks of meat and try to decide how much of it you need.<br>\r\n\"Can you get me some bacon and sausage and that brisket over there?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"You wanna eat all this meat this late at night?\"<br>\r\n\"I need protein! I'm trying to bulk up when I work out.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright, how many pounds of sausage?\"<br>\r\n\"Thirteen.\"<br>\r\nYou and your manager awkwardly stare at each other for a while.<br>\r\n\"You want thirteen pounds of sausage???\"<br>\r\n\"And twenty pounds of bacon, yes. And seven of those briskets.\"<br>\r\n\"...Is something going on Jonny?\"<br>\r\n\"No. Why?\"<br>\r\n\"Cause there's a giant werewolf standing next to the window looking at you.\"<br>\r\nYou turn around and see the werewolf with his nose on the window, drooling like crazy and smiling devilishly.<br>\r\n\"You have to help me. That werewolf is trying to kill me!\" you say is desperation.<br>\r\n\"I can hear you, y'know!\" yelled the werewolf from outside.<br>\r\n\"That werewolf is trying to kill me.\" you whisper.<br>\r\n\"I can still hear you!\"<br>\r\n\"Damn those pointy Lycan ears of his!\"<br>\r\nYou suddenly begin to mouth the words to your manager.<br>\r\n\"That werewolf--\"<br>\r\n\"Even though I can't hear you, I can tell by the way your cheek bones are rising and falling what you're saying.\"<br>\r\nYou punch the manager in the face and throw yourself over the counter so the werewolf can't see or hear you.<br>\r\nYou suddenly begin to whisper in his ear.<br>\r\n\"That werewolf is trying to kill me! I need as much meat as I can carry so he'll leave me alone. If I don't, he'll come in here and eat me; maybe you too.\"<br>\r\n\"What?! I'll be damned if I let a dog eat me!\"<br>\r\nBoth of you look up over the counter and realize that the werewolf is standing right next to both of you.<br>\r\n\"How did you get in here?!\"<br>\r\n\"You left the door open.\" said the werewolf.<br>\r\n\"Oops.\"<br>\r\n\"OOPS?!!\" yelled your manager.<br>\r\nThe manager suddenly grabbed a meat cleaver and waved it in the werewolf's face.<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n\"We don't get another supply of meat for two months! If he eats all of the food, we'll go bankrupt!\"<br>\r\nThe werewolf lashed at your manager's meat cleaver and it goes soaring out the window, leaving him defenseless.<br>\r\n\"Oh God...\"<br>\r\nThe situation is getting way out of hand. The werewolf is about to eat your manager. You don't hate him; in fact, he's one of your friends and the only boss that doesn't treat you like crap. You should at least try to convince the werewolf to let him go. On the other hand, if your boss goes free, he might start spreading rumors. He could tell the cops about a werewolf sighting and things could get out of control and wind up biting you in the ass (literally). Your manager could easily be written off as collateral damage.<br>\r\n\"Jonny? A little help here?\"</span></div></div>",

THINK OF THE CHILDREN!\" By this time, you're on your knees begging.<br>\r\n\"You're............. pathetic,\" say the werewolf. \"Just give me the meat so I can go home, already.\" The werewolf put your boss down.<br>\r\nYou get up, brush the dirt off of you, put your hands behind your back and say, \"Thank you,\" as if nothing had happened.

Unfortunately for you, the path that leads directly to your house has been blocked by a massive apartment fire, so you must find an alternate route. The only path you can take is the one through a spooky looking forest that not too many people have been known to go in. Despite this, you simply shrug and begin to walk through the forest. As you get halfway through, you hear low growling in the distance.<br>\r\n\"Whoa...what was that?\" you ask yourself while turning around.<br>\r\nAnother growl is heard, but you're still unable to find anything suspicious, so you continue to walk.<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear a loud guttural noise and some ferocious beast hops out of the trees and lands right in front of you! The beast is standing on all fours with orange fur covering its whole body and yellow torn up shorts on. Its short pointy ears wiggled and twitched a little bit and it had long claws on its feet and paws. Drool was dripping from its large, pointy yellow teeth and seeping onto the ground. A long orange tail was slowly wagging left and right and its yellow eyes were piercing into you.<br>\r\n\"Meeeeaaaat....\" growled the monster.<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Every hear of mouthwash?!\" you ask while holding your nose.<br>\r\nThe monster snarled viciously at you and takes several steps forward. Then the creature stands on his hind paws and stands right next to you, staring down at your face. The monster is nearly seven feet tall; a foot taller than you are. <br>\r\n\"You smell tasty!\" muttered the werewolf.<br>\r\n\"Oh God...\"</span></div></div>",

You have certainly chosen the better of the two choices... for us both!\" he replies, \"Now...down the hatch ya go!\"<br>\r\nThe orange beast opens his mouth cavernously, and begins lowering you into his throat head first. Strangely enough, he does not seem to find the process at all painful, rather he seems to enjoy it with an eager ravenousness. You smell his hot, rank breath as you enter his mouth. Your body is coated in thick saliva, the fluids gathering naturally in anticipation of food. As you enter into his esophagus, the wolf gulps loudly, and you feel the tube contract and constrain around you, pushing you into the werewolf's awaiting stomach. You land with a soft, wet thud into the werewolf's belly, and although there is no acid or digestive fluids to harm you, you do feel a thick, slimy mucus all around the stomach wall. You are curled up into the fetal position inside the werewolf for lack of space, which is slightly uncomfortable, but the monster's gut has become obese and swollen with all of the extra weight you have added. Oddly enough, you can actually see your shiny, moist, pink surroundings, as there seems to be an unnameable light source within the werewolf's digestive tract, so that you aren't in pitch black.<br>\r\n\"Comfortable, human? Or perhaps I should refer to you as dinner for the next hour?\" the werewolf's voice rouses you from your thoughts.<br>\r\n\"Well...\" It could certainly be worse. Even if you can't move around, at least you aren't in any pain. \"It could be worse. I'm not going to have to be in here too long, am I?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"No,\" the werewolf replies. He belches loudly and wetly, and the stomach wall quivers around you as he does so. \"Ahhh! Delicious!\" he remarks, enjoying your flavors. \"Anyway, no, you'll only be in my belly for an hour, give or take, then you'll move into my bowels, where you'll be covered in you-know-what and then it's potty time.\"<br>\r\nYou try not to imagine what the excretion process will be like. It's too disgusting a thought to entertain. Not that you'll have to wait long to find out.<br>\r\n\"So... what do I do to pass the time?\" you ask dumbly. <br>\r\n\"Not my problem,\" the werewolf replies with a shrug. He lifts his butt up and farts. \"Man! I guess you humans give us gas or something!\" he says.<br>\r\nYou decide that, since you will be in here for a while anyway, you might as well pass the time with a conversation. And... since you can tell your host is the arrogant type...<br>\r\n\"Tell me about the history of the Lycans,\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, yes, \" says the werewolf, \"A glorious tale, to be certain. All of you humans should learn of our great history!\"<br>\r\nHe tells you a long and detailed tale, of conquest,struggle, and environmental devastation. He pauses occasionally in his story to belch and pat his fat belly. You learn that his people were once a proud, ruling species, controlling all of both the Americas and half of Transylvania during ancient times. Then, as humans fought back and the forests were destroyed, the Lycan race's history fell into muddled legend. The werewolf scoffs scornfully when you tell him of the Wolf man and other such werewolf stories.<br>\r\n\"Half-man and half-wolf, indeed!\" the Lycan spits, \"Ridiculous!\"<br>\r\nAn hour passes by in this way rather quickly. You feel a suction, and you're squeezed through an opening in the back of the werewolf's stomach. You enter into his intestine (the large intestine, as carnivores do not have a small one), and are instantly overwhelmed by the stench of dung. A deep and awful fart makes your pinkish-brown surroundings vibrate, and you feel the gas blowing over you, warm and foul and all around you. You see the werewolf's rectum open as he farts, but not enough to see much of where you are. In a few more seconds the intestine rumbles again, and you suddenly feel warm and sticky as you realize you are being covered in excrement. You close your mouth and eyes to prevent it from getting in them, but the dung is light enough and somehow doesn't seem to constrain your breathing. <br>\r\nOutside, the werewolf feels a pressure in his lower gut. <br>\r\n\"Alright! Time for pooping!\" he laughs. <br>\r\nThe orange werewolf drops his tattered, yellow shorts, his tail stands erect, and he squats over the ground, exerting pressure as he poops you out in...</span></div></div>",

You wonder if you should ask what's wrong with the werewolf, but you quickly get rid of the idea, fearful that the poop will flow into your mouth.<br>\r\n\"Hey! You constipated again Brix?\" asked a voice from outside.<br>\r\n\"Just wait a second! I'm almost done.\" said the werewolf.<br>\r\nThe werewolf grunted loudly and started straining as hard as he could to squeeze you out of his anus. But unfortunately, only more gas came out.<br>\r\n\"I warned you not to eat any more humans again Brix.\"<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\"<br>\r\nSo the werewolf has a name, and it just so happens to be Brix. <br>\r\n(That's a weird name for a Lycan). you thought.<br>\r\nBrix inhales sharply again and starts grunting so hard that he was gritting his teeth and sweating a little bit. Brix shut his eyes and slowly began to excrete you from his anus, along with another clump of dung. You land right on top of the pile of poop and are too exhausted and disgusted to move. You hear Brix sigh contently and fart one last time before he pulls up his yellow shorts. <br>\r\n\"So how did you like your little adventure?\" asked Brix.<br>\r\n\"Never...again.\" you moan.<br>\r\nYou stand up and shake the fecal matter off your body and look around the area you're in. The first thing you notice is the dark surrounding and that your only light source is the night sky. Then you get a horrible smell of fungus and other damp stench that smelled like a public restroom or rotten meat. You even see a couple of flies hover around your face and try to swat them away. Wherever you are, it must be some sort of brown cave.<br>\r\n\"Where am I? And what is that smell?!\" you wonder.<br>\r\n\"What this? This is my den, my home. Where did you think I was gonna go to?\"<br>\r\n\"This is--No! Damnit! Where the hell are we?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I saw some big accident on the road and started going in the other direction.\"<br>\r\nYou shriek. Brix had taken you in the EXACT opposite direction you were supposed to go in. By letting the werewolf devour you, you inadvertently dragged yourself even farther back than before.<br>\r\n\"As for the smell, that's either me or my roommate, Jakes.\"<br>\r\n\"How's it hanging'?\" asked a mysterious voice.<br>\r\nA black furred werewolf dropped from the ceiling and landed right in front of you. The werewolf was a little bit taller than Brix on his hind legs and had a humonguos belly. His gut was huge and bulging over his messy brown shorts. At least you figured out what the smell was though.<br>\r\n\"You swallowed another human again Brix?\"<br>\r\n\"He gave me beef jerky. The least I could do was not maim his face off.\" said Brix.<br>\r\n\"Cool. Hey, human!\" yelled Jakes.<br>\r\nYou turn around and groan when you see Jakes breathing his foul breath in your face.<br>\r\n\"Um...yeah?\"<br>\r\n\"Pull my tail.\"<br>\r\n\"I...What?!\"<br>\r\nJakes turned around and waved his tail in your face.<br>\r\n\"C'mon! Just yank really hard and really fast!\"<br>\r\nYou sigh, as though you already know what he's gonna do. You grab his tail and pull on it very hard. Jakes passes gas loudly in your face, expelling a foul stench of gas into your nostrils. You don't even groan or try to fan the smell away; you just sigh and look a little bored. After traveling through a werewolf's rectum, you're kinda used to the nasty odor of werewolf farts. Jakes sniffed the fart and started laughing wildly with Brix, both of whom were rolling on the ground laughing like idiots.<br>\r\n\"Hey Brix! Didn't you say we were going to invade the town tomorrow and start pranking everybody and vandalizing the town?\" asked Jakes.<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Either that, or we gather every Lycan we can find and eat everybody.\" said Brix.<br>\r\n\"What do we do until then?\"<br>\r\nBrix stretched his arms and yawned loudly. \"I don't know about you, but I'm gonna go to sleep. I suggest you do the same human.\" <br>\r\n\"Er...yeah.\"<br>\r\nBrix and Jakes yawned again and got into a comfortable position to go to sleep. You see them shut their eyes and know that soon enough, they'll be snoring. The door leading out of the den is wide open. However, you yourself are very tired and should probably at least rest for an hour or two. Of course...you might oversleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think very hard and decide to...</span></div></div>",

I don't even wanna know what's in your stomach!\"<br>\r\n\"Well maybe you should've thought about that before you tried to run away from us!\" shouted Brix.<br>\r\n\"THIS ISN'T FAIR!!\" you shout.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. You'll come out again tomorrow morning when I go crap behind that tree.\" chuckled Jakes.<br>\r\nYou shout and try to get free from Jakes' grip, but he simply begins to slowly lower you towards his mouth. Jakes opens his mouth and you see a whole colony of saliva on his tongue and teeth, feeling the hot moisture of his bad breath in your face. Jakes throws you into his mouth and closes it. You land on his soggy tongue and are overwhelmed by the rotten odor.<br>\r\n\"Don't you werewolves ever brush your teeth?!\" you shout in disgust while holding your nose.<br>\r\nJakes must've heard you, because he decided to roll his tongue back and you landed in-between his esophagus, hanging on for dear life. You shriek as you look down and see a yellowish gas bubble slowly rise up towards you, which wound up exploding and causing Jakes' mouth to open. He made a grotesque rumbling sound as his mouth opened and his whole mouth shook you like crazy; he had just burped.<br>\r\n\"Wow! I never knew humans tasted this good!\" said Jakes, licking his lips.<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, the burp shook you so much that you traveled down his esophagus and landed in his stomach. Unlike Brix's stomach, Jakes' wasn't exactly friendly and the acid could melt right through your skin. It wouldn't exactly kill you, but you might as well be dead afterwards. There must be a way for you to get out of the stomach in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter clutching onto the sides of Jakes' stomach insides (making sure you didn't make contact with the acid) for several hours, you see many bubbles travel up to the esophagus.<br>\r\n\"Hmm...I wonder...\" you thought.<br>\r\nIf the last bubble burst made him burp, maybe you could trap yourself in the bubble and make Jakes burp you out. You quickly run through the acid (which burns through your shoes and socks) and jump inside the bubble, just before your feet are able to melt off. You sigh with relief, knowing that you'll be able to safely escape Jakes' foul insides and hopefully try to convince them to take the spell off and take you home in peace. You see Jakes' mouth open and wait a few seconds before the bubble pops and Jakes burps loudly again. Only this time, you fly out of his mouth...in your regular size.<br>\r\n\"Damnit! I did the spell wrong again!\" shouted Jakes while kicking up dirt.<br>\r\nLucky for you, Jakes screwed up on the spell and the effects were only temporary.<br>\r\n\"Now...let's try this again: Can I please go back to my home?!\"<br>\r\nBrix and Jakes laughed. \"We're already there!\" <br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\"<br>\r\nYou look over Jakes and Brix's back to see a whole neighborhood full of houses lined up in a straight row. You must've been inside Jakes stomach for so long that they decided to take a midnight stroll, inevitably wandering into a housing complex. It was your sorry luck that they found out where you lived.<br>\r\n\"Should I try the spell again and eat him once more Brix?\" asked Jakes.<br>\r\n\"No, I got a better idea: I'm assuming you live here, right?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"<br>\r\n\"Since you weren't so kind and generous to spend the night in our home, maybe we should do the same to you.\"<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\"<br>\r\n\"You let us spend a day in your home, and we won't devour you or rip your face off.\"<br>\r\n\"You guys already ate me! What good is it if you eat me again?!\"<br>\r\n\"Because this time, you'll be digested...slowly and painfully.\"<br>\r\nJakes laughed evilly and started drooling, wanting to eat you once again.<br>\r\n\"So either I let you filthy creatures into my house for 24 hours or you kill me?\"<br>\r\n\"Yup. You better choose quickly before Jakes makes the decision before I do!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The werewolf farted again before he grunted and shot out a whopper of a load on the floor, adding on to the smelly pile that was already there. You groan loudly and cover up your nose with your shirt, trying not to take in any of the odor. You thought about stopping the werewolf or at least finding a way to shoo him out of your house, but you had no weapons of value besides a bat and you were confident he could merely bite through the wood and snap the bat in two. The werewolf lets his last ball of dung fly out his ass before letting out a small poot and sighing ecstatically.<br>\r\n\"And now...\"<br>\r\nThe werewolf puts his hands inside the hefty formation of scat and forms a large ball with it, tossing it into the air and laughing devilishly. You yelp once the werewolf smiles at you once more and dive out the way, just as he tosses a ball of dung at you. The dung hits the wall with a loud squishy splat; the noise made you jerk and groan again.<br>\r\n\"That's disgusting.\"<br>\r\n\"You bet it is!!\"<br>\r\nThe werewolf starts cackling and begins to throw his poop all around the room, covering the walls with fresh, warm brown lumps of poop and making them stink like his posterior. The werewolf even goes outside of your room to do some damage, staining the walls on the staircase by wiping his hands down the walls as he ran down the stairs. He quickly runs back to your room and grabs some more poop, forming more balls and throwing those at the walls as well. At the rate he's going, your whole house will be so aromatic the whole neighborhood will have to migrate and live several miles away from you. You have to find a way to stop this before it gets out of hand.<br>\r\n\"THIS IS TOO MUCH FUN!!!\"<br>\r\nThe werewolf falls to the ground and starts laughing hysterically with his eyes shut. Seeing as how he can't see you, and since you reek as bad as the house does from his scent-marking earlier, you turn around and slowly began to creep down an adjacent set of stairs, heading for the basement. You needed to find some help in getting this filthy canine out your house.</span></div></div>",

Can't quite hear you!\" He farts again into the cushion, then doubles over slightly. You see him grin as a wet stain spreads across the front of his pants, and on to the couch. He raises his tail, and you see a brown mound start to bulge outwards. His friends are all watching, and are enjoying your distress. The brown mound in his pants keeps growing, the smell of manure eminating from it. A muffled, wet fart is heard through his pants, and more mush gushes out. Eventually, his supply runs out. He looks at you with a grin, and reaches back with a clawed hand to feel his handiwork. Satisfied, he leans backwards onto it, squishing all around his pants.

When I pinned you down back there, I sprinkled a load of itching powder down the back of your shorts!\" The werewolf starts to howl with laughter as you groan and start furiously scratching your butt with both hands. The itching just gets worse, and you run to a tree and start rubbing your butt against it, causing the werewolf prankster to laugh even harder!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha! I wish you could see how funny you look!\" He's laughing so hard he can barely breath. \"Oh man, my next prank's gonna have to be a real good one to beat this!\"</span></div></div>",

Am I quick or what?\" You look up as he speaks, but instead of his face you're presented with his furry werewolf butt. Before you can do anything except widen your eyes, he lets rip with a foul and powerful fart, right in your face - BRRRRAAAAAAAP!!! You cough and splutter as you feel the wind hit you, trying to fan the stink away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An old one, but a good one!\" the prankster laughs and hops away, casually letting rip with a few more farts just for fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... that's disgusting!\" You stagger around, dazed a little by the smell, but at least your butt's stopped itching now. \"Are all werewolves as gross as you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, pretty much,\" comes the reply. \"Anyway, farting's not so bad - it's fun!\" He smiles at you, revealing his big teeth. Though you're starting to get the impression he likes you, as a pranking victim if nothing else!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so.\" You shrug, trying to make a point of how gross he is. \"It stinks and it makes rude noises.\" As you're speaking, the cheerful werewolf appears to be muttering some words in a language you don't understand. \"Everyone knows that farting in public's wrong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe werewolf grins wider than you've seen him grin before. He's stopped mumbling in his weird language. \"Oh yeah?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" You reply, but then from nowhere a massive, wet-sounding fart erupts from your butt! Your jaw drops and your eyes go wide. \"What... what's happening?!\" You stammer as another gas blast thunders from your rear end, then another, and another. \"Help! I can't... stop... FARTING!!!\" You yell as fart after fart blows out of you, leaving the werewolf prankster giggling hysterically on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that was just a small fart spell, but it seems to be working great!\" He laughs again as another rude, nasty fart explodes from you, half-heartedly waving away the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glare at him, your butt cheeks shaking with the force of your gas attack. \"A fart spell?\" This is too much - whatever he's done to you with his magic, it's making you break wind like a hurricane! You grit your teeth and stamp over to him angrily. \"This...\" BRRAAAAP! \"Isn't...\" PAAARRRP! \"Funny!\" RIIIIIIPPP!!! But even you can't help smiling at those funny fart noises you're making. After a moment you burst out laughing and fall on the ground with the werewolf, farting and laughing away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you farting's not so bad! 'Cept for the smell!\" He laughs and cocks a leg, letting out a putrid-smelling gas-blast of his own. He's right - it really does stink!</span></div></div>",

Like real magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe werewolf shrugs like it's no big deal, and nods. \"Yeah, well, it's more than card tricks and pulling rabbits out of hats. But it's not like Dungeons and Dragons stuff, I can't shoot fireballs or fly or anything like that!\" He curls his lip scornfully, but he looks a little defensive, like you might not be as impressed as you should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Well, what other kinda stuff can you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour new friend smirks at you. \"Well, I can show you some other tricks I know, I guess. So long as you don't mind being the butt of the joke again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get a little nervous flutter in your stomach. Well, surely it can't be as bad as the farting! Besides, that turned out to be pretty funny. \"OK, sure,\" you agree. \"But no stinky stuff this time, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww...\" He looks disappointed again. \"That's like half of my spells. Well, OK, it's a deal. I've got another couple of real funny ones I've been dying to try out for a while! Let's see...\" He looks up into the darkening sky through the trees. The full moon is already visible - why else would a werewolf be out, after all? \"Ah, perfect!\" He grins at you mischievously. \"OK, stay right there.\" He starts to mumble under his breath, making a couple of odd movements with his hands. It only takes a couple of moments, and he's done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink, not feeling any different. \"Well, what did that do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know how werewolves turn into wolves 'cause of the moon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know that.\" You glance up into the sky. As soon as the light of the full moon falls upon your eyes, you get a weird feeling all of a sudden. You find yourself reaching for the top of your shorts, and before you can stop yourself you hitch down the back of your pants, baring your butt at the moon! \"AWOOOOOOO!!!\" You howl like a wolf as you moon the sky!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour werewolf buddy starts to howl too, but with laughter! \"Great! I've turned you into a weremooner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A WHAT?!\" You yell and pull your pants back up, but after a moment you catch sight of the moon again, and out comes your moon once more - \"AWOOOOO!\" You wave your rear end about, much to the werewolf's hilarity!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly hear the snap of a twig nearby, and while you've still got your bare butt out, someone steps out of the undergrowth!</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s like your body isn\u2019t even listening to you, and just seems to hike your butt higher into the air and wiggle it around as you howl. You can\u2019t stop it. It just feels so right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you see your best friend, Rob, coming out of the woods. The two of you have been close for years, and you really don\u2019t want him to see you like this, but can\u2019t do anything about it. As he approaches, he sees you on the ground, big butt high in the air, and gives a puzzled expression. \u201cUh\u2026 W-What the heck\u2019s going on here, dude?\u201d He asks, confused. \u201cR-Rob, s-sorry, I just\u2026 AWOOO!!\u201d You howl again, shaking your butt up and down. You can\u2019t help it. Even if you want to stop, it feels like your body has a will of it\u2019s own, and all it wants to do is present and show off your booty. For some reason though, it actually feels surprisingly nice. Like your butt deserves to be shown off for everyone to admire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-dude, are you mooning me? And\u2026 Seriously, what\u2019s going on here? You were late coming home, so I came looking for you, only to find you doing\u2026 whatever this is?\u201d Your face is bright red as you continue shaking your butt at him provocatively. \u201cTh-this is kind of a bad time Rob-A-AWOOOO!!!\u2026 Can\u2019t you come back l-later?\u201d You can\u2019t contain your howls and panting. You\u2019re just like a dog.  As you groan, embarrassed as you continue to howl and shake your butt at him, Rob suddenly notices the werewolf grinning behind you and his eyes widen. \u201cW-What the heck is that?!\u201d He yelps in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe werewolf just smiles wider, \u201cI\u2019m a friend of his, and I take it you are too?\u201d He says, lifting his furry arms over his head, giving both you and Rob a nice whiff of his pungent B.O.. Rob is at a complete loss for words as he stares up at him, but gulps and finally stammers out, \u201cI-I\u2019m R-Rob\u2026 I\u2019m his r-roommate and we\u2019re s-supposed to be getting\u2026 heading back home.\u201d The werewolf smirks. \u201cReally? What\u2019s the rush? Why don\u2019t you stay and have some fun with us? I was just showing him some cool magic tricks. Wanna join in on the fun?\u201d The werewolf chuckles to himself, no doubt thinking of a new prank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob gulps harder, and tries to back away, but the werewolf immediately goes up to him and places his hands on his shoulders. \u201cPlease?\u201d The werewolf asks, giving him puppy-dog eyes. Rob seems uncertain, and looks over to you with you butt still up in the air. \u201cE-Ehh\u2026 I think you can, uh, relax\u2026 He doesn\u2019t seem too bad honestly\u2026\u201d You hesitantly vouch for he werewolf, even if you can\u2019t stop mooning. Rob sighs, a bit reluctant. \u201cA-Alright, I guess I can join in\u2026 whatever this is\u2026\u201d The werewolf smiles wide, \u201cYou will? GREAT!!!\u201d Then pulls Rob into a big bear hug, smothering him in his hairy chest, and giving him a nose full of beefy werewolf musk. You feel a strange mix of pity, enjoyment, and a odd sense of jealousy as you watch Rob attempt to struggle out of the werewolf\u2019s arms. You don\u2019t know how to feel, knowing that Rob\u2019s going to be a part of the pranks now. On the one hand, you don\u2019t think you want your best bro in the world being put through what you\u2019ve just gone through. On the other, the werewolf might leave you alone, and somehow you know it\u2019ll be hilarious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe werewolf finally lets Rob go, leaving him gasping for air and a little frazzled, before patting him on the back. \u201cSo, Rob, what\u2019d\u2019ya wanna do first?\u201d The werewolf asks mischievously. Rob scratches the back of his head awkwardly, \u201cUh, I, um, really don\u2019t know?\u201d The werewolf laughs, \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got a few ideas\u2026\u201d He says, an ominous glint in his eyes. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was really warm and protected you from the cold air from outside. Of course, he was sleeping with his mouth open so you had a front row seat in smelling his foul breath. But you didn't care. You were actually starting to get over his halitosis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a hot stench creeps into your nostrils which compels you to wake up and investigate.<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that?\" you mumble.<br>\r\nKocho was still lying on his back, snoring with his mouth so it obviously wasn't him. You lay your head back on the pillow and resume your resting. But then, the same stench wakes you up and you were wondering if someone planted a stink bomb in your closet. You then turn to Kocho and stare at him for a while, trying to figure out if he was faking his sleeping. While doing so, that same nasty smell enters you nostrils once again.<br>\r\n\"Kocho is that you?!\"<br>\r\nYou plant your ear near his anus and wait a few minutes. After you did you heard something airy come out and realized the spot of the bed where his butt was suddenly smelled horrible and the room got hot and stinky again.<br>\r\n\"Uggh...silent but violent...\" you mutter, plugging your nose.<br>\r\nEh, at least he wasn't doing it on purpose, so that made you feel a little more sentimental about him. You walk over to the fan you have in your room and turn it on high to air out the room. You know that Kocho is gonna keep farting, but at least the room won't smell horrible come morning.</span></div></div>",

It's not like I can stop you from taking a dump.\"<br>\r\nKocho shrugged. \"If you say so.\"<br>\r\nYou quickly go back to sleep and hear the werewolf get off the bed and go over to the bathroom.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You finally get Kocho to sit on the toilet, but it was with great effort, as he is very large and had a hard time turning around in the bathroom. Even sitting and leaning forward his head is still touching the ceiling. As he sits and begins to relax his anus, the big wide grin comes back to his face. <br>\r\n\"It's going to be a big one. I just feel it inside,\" the werewolf said, looking at you. <br>\r\nFrom the size of his gut you can believe it and the toilet seems so small under his huge ass.<br>\r\nYou start to wonder if it will hold his weight, as he must weigh over five hundred pounds. <br>\r\n\"By the way, what have you been eating? You look quite bloated.\"<br>\r\nThe werewolf looks back at you and tilts his head sideways, inquisitive as to why you asked that question; he does not feel anything out of the ordinary. Quite to the contrary in fact. He feels just great; his stomach, for once, is very full and not being guilty of digesting the food.<br>\r\n\"Nothing special, about the equivalent of two large human males in meat and all kinds of stuff that the butcher gave me. He told me that he was cleaning his inventory and that these products were past the expiration date.\"<br>\r\n\"Oooo yes, I could see that you had a little snack before coming here...\" And by the look of his gut, you figured a lot more than 300 pounds!!! But your relieved to hear that it's not people being digested in there.<br>\r\nThe werewolf grinned even more while looking down at you.<br>\r\n\"He gave it to me for free!!!... What could I do? I was not going to refuse such an appealing snack!\"<br>\r\n\"You big woozzy, you did wolf it all down, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n\"Hummm, it was soo good!!!\"<br>\r\n\"You could have keep at least half for another meal you pig!!! No wonder you have a big one coming out in the middle of the night!\"<br>\r\nOn these words, the werewolf is no longer able to keep it in, and he starts straining a bit. You can see his tail moving up a bit behind his back and see the pucker start expanding downward  when looking down at the toilet bowl between his furry leg. He then let out a humongous fart that rumbles the room. <br>\r\nBecause of his size in proportion to the toilet and the room, he has to keep his legs wide open and his knees apart, crouching down instead of sitting down on the small bathroom appliance. That is the reason why you can see his pucker flexing when looking between his legs. You can not keep your eyes off from looking between his legs and wondering if the bowl would be big enough to contain the mess that was about to come out. <br>\r\nAnother huge fart came out... one that managed to spill some water out of the bowl cause of the force of the wind.<br>\r\n\"Pewwww.... Heh, the stuff that you ate was really past it's due date, judging by the smell of it!\"<br>\r\nThe smell was so strong that you worry that it would peel the paint of the wall.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I ate a lot worse and passed it without difficulty,\" the werewolf said, still grinning back at you.<br>\r\n\"Here come another one!\" the werewolf said laughing.<br>\r\nHis anus did extend a bit and a rancid wet fart came out, followed by a very long hissing sound as gallons of gas came out under pressure. Now the air was getting very foul inside the bathroom. Luckily the door and window was open. <br>\r\nThen, a series of little popping and crackling sounds could be heard, and you could see the pucker actually opening up between his legs.<br>\r\nYou start seeing the tip of a huge turd coming out. It's at least if not more, the diameter of very, very large horse dung, but very dark, almost black and smooth. <br>\r\nThat excrement kept coming out, filling the bowl of the toilet until the water actually overflowed onto the tiled floor, creating a mess. <br>\r\nYou stay there watching the show, mesmerized, unable to say a word looking at the ungodly huge dump that the werewolf is taking right in your bathroom. <br>\r\nAfter 20 seconds, the bowl just not large enough... The feces starts to overflow and come out of toilet, spilling around the toilet seat and between the werewolf's legs. <br>\r\nHaving never used a toilet before, the werewolf just loves the feeling, the warmth, and the stench of the poop coating his ass and coming out between his legs.<br>\r\n\"I love this thing, it's a lot more fun then to just squat in a bush. I think I will adopt your toilet thing from now on.\"<br>\r\nOn these words, a loud crack is heard and the toilet just gives away under the pressure. The noise snaps back for your torpor and looking at the huge mess, you say in a low voice to yourself, \"Why me....\"<br>\r\nThe broken toilet does not deter the werewolf from continuing his dump, as he feels the huge relief of the dung going out of his system. <br>\r\nFoot after foot of black gunk in a semi-solid state keeps coming out from behind the now crouching werewolf. The remains of the toilet is now gone and buried under the mess. <br>\r\nJudging from the quantity you see on the floor, at least 50 pounds of the stuff has accumulated so far. You just face palm, realizing that because you were too sleepy, you did not think about taking him outside to do his deed. Now you ended up with a big mess to clean up. The flow of the werewolf excrement suddenly come to a stop. Now that the flow of feces has stopped, you start to think that it could have been worst when you look at the wolf's huge belly.<br>\r\n\"Are you finally done?\"<br>\r\n\"No... There is a lot more to come!!!!\" he said in a straining voice.<br>\r\nThen you hear a loud...<br>\r\n\"NNNNNIINNNGGGGGGGGGGGG\" <br>\r\nAnd you realize the huge beast is straining quite a bit and that it's probably caused by blockage. The unfortunate truth is there is probably a lot more to come.<br>\r\nYou try to pull your were-friend out of the bathroom to the outside, but he is not budging. He is so concentrated on his poop that he's not even aware that your are pulling on him. You step to the side to have a peek under his tail, now wondering if you were right. The werewolf just keeps straining more and clenches his huge paw while keeping his eyes shut. And the big anthro canine does let go of another huge-smelling fart that sound like a horn.<br>\r\nThen the tail comes back up and the anus starts to expand to a size of more then a foot. You can see it clearly because you are now at his side. The diameter, even though it's impossibly large, did make sense in the case of this werewolf, as you know he is capable of excreting whole humans through that hole in one piece. The big turd that starts coming out now is really hard and had a beige color to it.<br>\r\nThen it hit you. What came out first was the soft, watery, bloody part of his meal, for the semi-hard consistency and the black tarry look was caused by all the blood from the meat. Now it is the part that consists of all the bone and fiber that's coming out.<br>\r\nYou stay there, bewildered by what you are seeing and it gives you a feeling that is almost erotic. By the moan and straining sound that the big woozy is giving out, you now know that the relief for him is also erotic. That is why he enjoys passing a huge meal so much.<br>\r\n\"You truly enjoy taking a dump, don't you?!\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"NNNNNGGGGGG\" with a little nod is the answer given by the werewolf, still straining to get that huge load out from his butt.<br>\r\n\"At least I know that you are still listening to me.\"<br>\r\nAnother nod came out of the still pushing wolf. Foot after foot of very hard--over several inches in diameter--filth came out of the werewolf's ass and just kept piling up. You can see the skin of the anus acting like a rubber seal, protruding almost 3 inches out, over and round the log, coating the big turd as it come out with the foul smell of his anal gland product. There was so much of the stuff that is was almost like a paste that was applied as the hard turds came out. You can even see the two glands. They are so large that they are like two halfs of a grapefruit protruding through the skin on each side of the anus. Now you know why his crap is smelling so bad. <br>\r\nAfter five more minutes of crapping, Kocho's bowels were finally empty. He stopped by contracting his anus, and by doing so about a quarter of a cup of the anal gland paste came out from the hole and dropped on top of the heap. Kocho finally came back to his senses and rose from his crouching position back to all fours cause of the height of the ceiling. It was just too low for him to stand up right in the house.<br>\r\nLooking back at his mess, the werewolf said,\"Fewwww, I was not joking when I told you that it was going to be a big one!\"<br>\r\nHe almost laughs as he looks at the pile and the destruction of the bathroom.<br>\r\n\"That is an understatement, that pile more than three feet high. There is at least three hundred pounds of crap in there!! It will take a shovel and a wheelbarrow to take out!\"<br>\r\n\"Heh, I'll just mark your house. Now that it's also mine, you should be happy,\" Kocho said with a little mischievous smile.<br>\r\n\"Now that I'm done pooping, I've still got this huge urge to take a piss. Where do I pee?\" <br>\r\nKocho got on his knees, holding his huge \"firehose\" in his paw, ready to let go....</span></div></div>",

Even your wolf friend start to gag...<br>\r\nThose dam thing are finally empty and all the pasty stuff is out. Only a yellowish liquid can now be seen which is what it should be.<br>\r\nYou wash that part again... then.<br>\r\n\"He, I'm done and I'm out of here...\"<br>\r\nThe big woof also follow you quickly out of the room cause he two is about to trow out is stomach content. <br>\r\nAs soon as your out you take a big breath and come back to your senses.<br>\r\n\"Now that  was bad... You must feel a lot better now\"<br>\r\nYou see a big smile in your werewolf friend and he just pick you up in his arm and hug you and start licking your face...<br>\r\n\"I've never realize that it was hurting back there.

Now that you can see him up close, he's not as intimidating. His yellow teeth and shaggy fur give him an almost... approachable look. You're just a little speechless. \"Not much for conversation, huh? More of a... silent but deadly type then. Groovy.\" You move back a bit,not sure what to make of the situation. \"of course, it's nothing compared to my own abilities\" you're not sure what he's on about, but he's not eating you, so that's nice. \"care for a demonstration?\" </span></div></div>",

Before you can dwell on it too much, our friend mister werewolf disappears from the bush. You have the strangest feeling that this won't end well. You hear a rustling sound, and he reappears. Although, you are presented with... a different end than the one you are already acquainted with. It smells about as dreadful as you'd expect. His tail is right in your face, and there are actual flies buzzing around it. Suddenly, as his ass moves ever closer, you realize what's happening. His tail goes up and begins to wag, as the werewolf raises one leg. you hear a loud grunt, and accept your fate. You hear the blast before you smell it, and you see the fur on his ass blow backwards from the force. Then comes the smell. Sulfur. Eggs. Rotten meat. Your eyes water and you stumble back. He cuts a few more brief farts, then turns to face you. \"Skunk and cheese burritos tend to have that effect on people\". You're shocked at how casual he is, having just unleashed the apocalypse from his butt. \"Come on, kid. I can't leave you in the woods at night. There are all kindsa weirdos around\".

You wave your hand in front of your face in an ultimately futile attempt to fan away the smell, and you hear mister werewolf try to stifle a laugh. You wrap your arms around him and he breaks into a run. \"better hold on tight\" he laughs, breaking wind as the trees blur past. It would almost be kind of beautiful in a weird sort of way if it weren't for the smell. Seriously, what the hell did this guy eat? You hold tighter to his matted grey fur, and try not to breathe through your nose. The wolf comes to an abrupt stop and you fall off his back into a patch of grass. Mister werewolf lets out a howl and leans against a tree. He gestures toward a cave in the distance and calls out \"welcome to my... er... lair\" before raising his leg. You hear something of a splashing type sound and notice a stream of yellow liquid running down his leg, withering the plants it touches. He sighs loudly and grunts, letting out a loud fart in the process. \"that felt good!\" he says with a bit too much enthusiasm. \"Now come on in\" he says, flashing a sinister grin.</span></div></div>",

You lay down on the cold floor, staring up at the werewolf looming over you. \"Pretty gnarly, right?\" he says, gesturing around. you try to sit up, and look around. The cave is dimly lit, and the floor is littered with food scraps and bones. A dying fire sits in the middle of the cave, built from logs and garbage, and surrounded by a collection of rather tasteless, threadbare looking furniture. What appears to be a large pool of water sits toward the back, but it's difficult to make out. Of course, the most surprising thing would be the other werewolf reclining on a particularly hideous floral couch. His shaggy black fur is streaked with white, and he loudly belches in acknowledgement of your presence. \"Hey skonnet!\" Says the grey wolf. \"Hey drogo!\". So that's his name. \"What are you doing back so soon?\" Drogo gestures to you \"couldn't just leave this kid here\" \"yeah, I was going to ask about that\" this is just surreal. You'd do something if you had any energy left. \"hey drogo\" he says \"yeah?\" \"You carried the kid in your mouth, didn't you?\" \"Of course, why?\" \"Well, you didn't bite him, did you?\" \"How else was I supposed to get him in there?\" \"It's just that, well, we're werewolves, you know what happens when...\". You don't like where this is going. \"Oh, crap\" drogo turns to you and says, rather frantically \"okay, look kid, in a few moments, you may feel some... slight discomfort. Don't panic\". What's he on about now, you wonder. Drogo suddenly squats by the dying fire and groans. A small (and rather disappointing, if we're being totally honest here) fart escapes his ass. Drogo shuts his eyes tight, clenches his fists, and loudly grunts. A particularly foul stink bomb erupts from his fluffy grey butt, as the flames flare upwards, illuminating the cave. You'd react, but you notice patches of fur growing rapidly on your wrists. Suddenly it all makes sense. </span></div></div>",

The cave stinks, and you soon realize why, many more werewolves than the two you met last night are wandering around the cave, mostly lined up by the fire. You go over to see what's going on, still only half awake. \"hey!\" Says the wolf in front of you.  \"You must be new\". His fur is a reddish brown, and he wears a bandana around his neck, and a pair of slightly ragged greyish underpants. \"Breakfast is just over there\" he says pointing to the front of the line. \"beans\" he says. What else. \"Hey\" he says, noticing the bags around your eyes \"let me wake you up a bit\". You agree. Hesitantly. He bends over, his tail wagging furiously. You hear a loud grunt, and he rips the most horrific fart you have ever experienced  (and that's quite an accomplishment). The fart lasts for several seconds, getting higher in pitch as it goes on. a couple of wet, dark stains appear on his underpants. \"Whoo!\" He shouts, \"that was a big one\". You're certainly awake now. \"so what exactly is this place?\" You ask him, waiting for breakfast. \"Basically\" he explains \"we're outcasts. Misfits. Punks. Troublemakers. Pranksters. Not really accepted by humans or wolves. So here we are, defying all of their stupid rules and manners. totally free\" surprisingly, you can relate to what he's saying. you wolf down  (sorry) your meal, and go to relax in the pool with another group of wolves. The werewolves are telling the stories of pranpranks and crimes they pulled off last night, when a couple of bubbles float to the surface. you jokingly wave a paw in front of your nose, and notice the wolf beside you shut his eyes and screw up his face. more bubbles burst to the surface, with a low fart noise and a stench of eggs. suddenly more bubbles erupt to the surface and the pool becomes a jacuzzi  (a particularly foul one, but who are you to complain) you even contribute a few of your own bubbles. suddenly, you feel the water grow warmer, and notice the area around the wolf you spoke to earlier become something yellow in color. he blushes and grins sheepishly. </span></div></div>",

You lunge forward, your paw balled into a fist, aiming for the big jerk's fat snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings don't go as planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new wolf steps aside, grabbing your arm and pinning it behind your back. He then pushes your head toward his big fat stinking butt. Being so close, you can't help but realize that there's still some dung caught in his fur. The wolf raises his tail slowly \"so yer the new guy everyone's talkin about, huh?\" He rips the most profoundly foul fart you've ever smelled (and you've smelled a lot tonight) right into your face. A nuclear explosion of garlic and rotten eggs blows your fur back. \"Welcome to the pack\" he laughs. You struggle to get free, eventually slipping from his grasp. \"Ain't getting away that easily\" he yells, grabbing your tail. You wince in pain, and swing for his nose, this time catching him off guard. The wolf slips on the pile of poo you left on the ground, and falls, still holding tightly onto you, right into the crude hole in the outhouse floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land in a deep pit of wolf poop, up to your shoulders, with the other wolf right beside you. \"Name's kev by the way\" he smiles affably, scrunching up his face. A couple of bubbles rise in the semi-liquid dung, splattering waste onto the both of you when they pop.</span></div></div>",

So ya better get used to just takin a dump wherever\" this idea troubles you, but you can't deny there's a certain sense of anticipation. Maybe it won't be so hard adjusting to this way of life after all. \"Come on!\" Drogo calls out \"tour ain't done yet\" you pick up the pace, following after him. Being a werewolf, your senses seem much stronger. which is unfortunate because Drogo won't stop breaking wind in front of you. The two of you stop at a clearing. A large cliff face sits a couple feet away, overlooking a large pond. \"C'mon\" Drogo grins as he rushes forward. You look on in fear  as he leaps off of the cliff face. \"Cannonball!\" He yells as he splashes into the water. \"Come on down, the water's fine\" he calls up at you. You sigh, knowing that you'll regret this,as you charge forward, stumble, and fall screaming into the water. Drogo bursts out laughing, tears streaming down his face. You quickly change the subject, noticing that the whole pond seems to be bubbling. \"Hey, is this one of those natural hot springs?\" You ask him. \"Nope\" he proclaims, grinning as it dawns on you what's happening. \"Hey\" he smiles, looking almost vulnerable for a moment \"wanna just sit here for a while? Get to knoweach other.\" He relaxes, leaning toward you \"I'm tired\" he grins, killing the mood \"besides, I gotta pee\"</span></div></div>",

Even if he stinks like wet fur and old socks, and even though he's the one who got you into this whole mess, the big stinker's actually been pretty nice to you. Besides, it's getting cold out, and it's pretty warm in the pond. Of course, the warmth is because Drogo just peed. \"Dude\" you groan, as he pulls you in closer, unable to escape the growing yellow cloud. \"So how old are you, anyway?\" You ask him. He lays back, squeezing out a couple of fart bubbles \"heck, I lost count centuries ago\" he sighs. He floats on his back, and pats his round belly, inviting you to climb aboard. You jump onto him, and he groans, as a massive fart escapes. \"You know\" he says \"I think you got the potential to be a great werewolf one day. Ya just gotta embrace it\" you wonder what exactly he means by that. Drogo looks upward, and howls at the full moon. You soon join in, and you hear a few more calls from throughout the forest. Drogo suddenly rolls over, and you fall into the water. You feel the pressure in your gut increase, and know it's just a matter of time. Drogo reclines beside you at the edge of the pond, ripping another nasty fart bubble</span></div></div>",

You land with your chin resting on Drago's thigh, ass up in the air, with Drogo howling with laughter at your acrobatics. You only have a second to be dazed before you feel your bowels unceremoniously release, werewolf dung rolling down your thighs and loudly plopping into the water. Drago joins you as he barks with laughter, bubbling farts interrupted by squishing and crackling dung being pushed out just inches below your sensitive nose. Your cheeks burn with embarrassment, and you close your eyes, hoping nobody but Drago is watching you stain your own fur brown.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">If you like where this is going, continue to add chapters. It's about what would happen if a young man encountered a werewolf while walking home late at night. Keep in mind, this is actually a comedy. I should be thanking the author of the Dragon Prank IN, since it inspired me to make this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n1. Keep the violence minimal! Don't add chapters involving blood and guts and stuff.<br>\r\n2. The werewolf is a real prankster, so he likes to do funny things to unsuspecting victims.<br>\r\n3. No sexual content!<br>\r\n4. The werewolf is really disgusting and gross, so he tends to use toilet humor for comedy (fart jokes, poop jokes, burp contests, things dealing with pee and bad breath, stuff like that). In other words, don't be afraid to add chapters that are completely disgusting!<br>\r\n5. Do not kill off the werewolf or the main character. If anyone does die in the story, make sure it's someone not important.<br>\r\n6. Keep the swearing to only damn, ass, or hell. Anything beyond that isn't allowed.<br>\r\n7. The werewolf can walk upright just like a human being can.<br>\r\n8. The werewolf can also talk!<br>\r\n9. Unfortunately, the werewolf can't change into a human. He will always stay in his wolf form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can also e-mail me if you don't know if the chapter you're about to add feels right. Anyway, have fun reading the story and adding chapters!</td>",
