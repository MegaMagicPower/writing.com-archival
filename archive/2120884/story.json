She let out  heavy sigh until Finster, the genius creator of all her past monsters came in \"Empress Rita, I think I have come up with an idea to finally bring the Power Rangers down.\" He chuckled sinisterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita eyed at him with contempt \"Well, we don't have all day Einstein, spit out already!\" She sneered at her loyal assistant. Finster swallowed nervously at his empress' anger \"W-well my empress, I was thinking, what if I start to create monsters that are well, different from those I have created in the past?\" He gave a hopeful nod. Intrigued by the idea, Rita simply waved her hand for him to continue \"As in the past, my creations have been well violent toward the rangers, which have been well easily defeated at times.\" He twiddled his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought of how about I start creating monsters that are well more nurturing, maternal, and paternal. Monsters that aren't affected by the rangers attacks at all and just want to treat them like their own, maybe their own children or maybe pets.\" He turned his head nervously at his empress' reaction. A sly, sinister grin crept across Rita's face \"Hmm.. you know what Finster, that isn't a pretty bad idea.\" She cackled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinster looked at her in surprise \"Really my empress, do you really think so?\" Rita reached over to grab his chin in her hand \"Yes my dear servant. With these new brand of monsters, maybe the can help keep the rangers away from my chance of conquering Earth once and for all!\" She cackled as she looked at him \"Go on Finster and start creating!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinster nodded \"Yes my empress.\" He soon turned around and hurried back into his laboratory. As he scanned around at his clay models he thought to himself <i>Hmm.. what should I create first</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(After choosing the monster creation, set the description, powers and abilities)</span></div></div>",

Ah! But I have just the idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Rita know, but ever since Finster had laid his eyes on the Power Rangers, he wanted nothing more than to see them cradled in the arms of his monsters, doted on and treated like little children. They wore hero's uniforms and acted tough, but deep down Finster knew they were nothing more than scared little boys and girls looking for a mommy or daddy to make them feel safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving to the far corner of his lab, he pushed aside a curtain to reveal a shelf full of monsters he had been working on in secret. Though Rita would never allow it, Finster had already been working on a brood of overbearing, loving, parental monsters. He looked over his creations, his eyes lighting up as he spied a rather portly looking clay model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes! This will do the trick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe carried the model over to his machine and placed it on the conveyor belt, pulled a level and sent the model through the twists and turns of his infernal monster machine. After much banging and clanking, a tube descending from overhead belched a cloud of smoke. When it cleared, Finster almost shed a tear at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buk-kaw! Good to finally stretch my wings! But no time to waste - I have many little ones to attend to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding before Finster was a chicken, or more accurately a hen monster, standing 8 feet tall from comb to talon. Her chubby, pear-shaped body was plump and soft all over, covered in downy white feathers with a pleasantly round belly and a vast cushy rump that wobbled with every movement. Her arms spread out in true bird wings, but rather than pokey quills her long feathers looked and felt like two plush-filled blankets that could easily wrap around a smaller prey. Her beak was shiny yellow and rounded at the tip, perfect for giving pecky kisses, and rested just below two big bright eyes with long eyelashes that fluttered brimming with maternal love. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the hen was not just any fowl. A frilly pink apron decorated white hearts around the edge hung around her neck and barely reached the top of her tummy, looking padded with a zipper pouch at the bottom. Finster had made sure her apron would be filled with any tools a momma hen might need to play with her children. Over her shoulder was slung a shiny pink diaper bag, looking like a poofy pink pillow with a zipper on top - the perfect place for storing naughty children who needed a time-out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww,,,and who might you be little one? How rude of me to not introduce myself! My name is Miss Rumplefeather, and I've been looking for a cutie like you take under my wing and bring back to my nest for snuggly wuggly cuddle-time! *Buk-kaw* Are you lost dear? Do you need a mommy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hen waddled up to Finster without warning and scooped the little gnome up in her wings, squeezing him tight to her bosom and tickling his nose with the tip of her feather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Errr...I, uhhh...well, not exactly...\" Finster stammered, finding it hard to deny that he was enjoying every second of being doted on in such a patronizing way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finster! What is the meaning of this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tender moment was broken by Rita's shrill voice, coming into the lab to find a giant chicken canoodling with her minion. Blushing bright red, Finster wriggled free of his monster's embrace and stepped forward to introduce his latest creation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My queen, may I introduce to you Miss Rumplefeather. She is big, motherly, and the perfect nanny for the Power Rangers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A hen eh?\" Rita said incredulously, striding over as she looked the monster up and down. \"How is an overgrown bird going to stop those teens?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOffended, Miss Rumplefeather slammed a fat yellow foot on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teens are they? Well, if these Power...Rangers...think they are such tough adults, just wait until I get my wings wrapped around them and show them that they are just helpless little children who need their nanny to protect them.\" the monster let out a clucking guffaw at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my queen. And once the ranger succumb to her maternal control, my creation, errr, I mean, your monster can roost atop them in her nest - making them her children forever.\" Finster added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buk kaw! That's right! Soon these Power Rangers will be added to my flock of lovely chicks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and then you can take over the world, my queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita was convinced. A wicked smile grew on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done Finster! Now, time to send this momma hen to earth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Which ranger should Rita target first?)</span></div></div>",

She searched the entire area until her eyes fell on the yellow ranger, Trini in the Angel Grove Forest, and a smirk crept across her face <i>Aha..Trini, the calm, peacemaker of the bunch. Also, her power is that of the sabre toothed tiger. Oh, how fun it will be to watch her become a little kitten to Nanny Hen</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over to the large hen creation \"Now go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod, Miss Rumplefeather vanished with a bright pink flash. As she appeared in the forest she smiled warmly <i>Buk kaw! Now, where are one of those little sweetie pies at so I can cuddle them all to bits?</i> She chuckled softly as her  plump, feathery, soft belly jiggled up and down. She scanned the area until she saw a raven haired girl dressed in a light yellow t-shirt, jean coveralls, and white sneakers with yellow laces <i>Oh, she looks adorable!</i> Rumplefeather started to march her way toward the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrini was knelt down by a flower patch examining them until she heard the rustling and crunching of leaves and twigs. She snapped her head to see a massive hen approaching \"What in the world?\" She stood up and stood in a fighting chance, pointing a finger at the approaching, towering creature \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Rumplefeather stopped just a couple inches from the ranger and looked down at her motherly \"Oh, may aren't you just the cutest little thing I ever did see?!\" She clucked as she reached out a large, feathery wing patting Trini on the head \"Well, little one, my name is Miss Rumplefeather, I am here to give you all the snuggles, cuddles, and love that you deserve!\" She smiled motherly down at the ranger and leaned down with her large, fluffy wings spread opened \"Come here sweetie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrini eeped and jumped backwards as she looked up \"Stay away from you overgrown chicken!\" She reached into the back of her coveralls to pull out her morpher \"It's Morphing Time!\" Soon she morphed into her yellow ranger suit. She pointed up at the large hen monster \"Take this!\" She ran up and punched at feathery, plush, fluffy belly of the towering monster, but as she did, her gloved fist simply sunk into the softness. She gasped \"What the?\" She took her first out and punched with the other one, receiving the same reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bemused look, Miss Rumplefeather chuckled \"Buk kaw! Aww.. hehe.. that tickles little one.\" She gently patted Trini on her helmet \"So you are one of those Power Rangers that Mistress Rita spoke of. Well now, you don't seem so tough.\" She cooed as the yellow ranger continued to punch at the large, plush feathery belly. She smiled \"Aww.. you just need some snuggling little one, come here!\" She reached down and effortlessly scooped the yellow ranger up in her large, feathery wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrini yelped \"What the? Hey, what do you think you are doing? I will....MMpph!\" Suddenly Trini was brought forward into a large, engulfing warm, feathery hug. She was smooshed against the large, feathery plush bosom of Miss Rumplefeather, and she pounded on it with her small fists, but the hen monster, just held her safely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww.. you are just a cute little snuggly little thing!\" She looked down at the feathery wing engulfed ranger, chuckling as her bosom was jostled by the pounding of the teenaged girl \"Hehe.. you can try all you want little ranger, but you cannot hurt Nanny Rumplefeather.\" She held Trini against her large, feathery, plush bosom with a wing as she used the other one to pet her helmet \"Such a darling little one like you shouldn't be fighting, but just be taken care of, Buk kaw!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrini was starting to be come weaker the more she struggled as the energy was sapped into the large, plush, feathery body of the hen monster making Miss Rumplefeather grow even more \"Oh my sweetie, your struggling is making me grow even bigger! That is alright, the even more cuddling and snuggling I can give!\" She chuckled as she gently petted over her new little ranger from the top of her helmet down her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrini whimpered and felt so weak that her arms slowly fell to her side and she started to breathe in and out slowly 'W-why can't I hurt you?\" She cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Rumplefeather, peered down and pecked at the top of Trini's helmet in a kiss \"Aww.. because you are just a little child that needs to be cared for sweetie. But don't you worry your pretty little head, because I am going to cuddle, snuggle, and love all of you that you are going to love it!\"  She gently pulled Trini away holding her in a large, soft, feathery wing \"However, for being a naughty little chick, I am going to have to put you in a special place until I get you to your new home little one.\" She pulled her diaper bag in front of the little yellow ranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" Trini gasped, but shook nervously at the sight of massive diaper bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buk kaw! Well little one, I use this to store naughty little children to calm them down. However, don't worry my precious little chick.\" She used a feathery finger to poke at Trini's nose \"You are going to love it in here! It is very padded inside and you will be cuddled and snuggled so much , that the wonderful energy you have will be slowly drained leaving you wanting to be a good little child.\" She chuckled as she moved the wing Trini was on toward the opened top of the diaper bag and carefully slid her in \"Now behave in there sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N.no wait.. Let me go!\" Trini screamed, but as she fell she landed on top a large, soft, padded pillow and looked up and around at the surroundings. The inner walls were bright pink, and was starting to close in on her \"What, what's happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buk kaw! Well little one, the inside of my diaper bag will make sure that you don't cause any trouble as I take you to my home. They are going to hug, cuddle, and snuggle you all over and turn into you a meek little pet.\" Miss Rumplefeather looked down from above at the little ranger before zipping the bag up \"Now time to go home sweetie!\" With a flash, she disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Where should Miss Rumplefeather's home be?)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Trini felt her body shrink down as the magic of the monster's diaper bag reduced her to a proper size to fit inside, making her roughly one foot tall so that when she landed in the soft bag, the puffy pink walls towered around her. She jumped a few times trying to reach the lip of the bag, but it was just too high. She looked up in fear and saw the giant face of the hen monster peering down at her, the silly, maternal face filling her view and serving as a reminder of just how tiny she was compared to the monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buk kaw! Now you're really a little iddy bitty ranger! Don't worry my dear - the shrinky-dinky effects of my diaper bag are temporary, and you'll return to normal size....after my bag has snuggled and squeezed all your yummy ranger energy from your cute little body. Now get cozy my pet, it's a long trip back to my nest! There we will have all the privacy we need to snuggle and huggle all those silly adult thoughts away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go you stupid hen! I'm a power ranger, not some little kid that you can treat like a baby! You'll never get away with this!\" Trini said, looking up at the giant monster peering down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let you go? Ha! Now that I've got you all tucked away and trapped you will learn that the Power Rangers are no match for my motherly love! Struggle all you want - the more you fight my squishy lovely little diaper bag, the more energy it will sap out of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster's clucking laugh was the last thing Trini heard as the zipper of the diaper bag was pulled closed, plunging her into darkness. It was like a sensory deprivation chamber inside the magic bag, all the yellow ranger could hear was the muffled swishing of thickly padded plastic all around her and the soft caress of the pillowy walls hugging her gently from all sides. Trini let out a scream of frustration, pounding against the pliant walls with her fists and calling out in vain to be let out. She blushed in embarrassment at being so easily kidnapped by such a goofy monster, but that did nothing to improve her situation. After what seemed like hours of banging on the walls and trying to escape, the ranger finally gave up. The diaper bag seemed to react to this crack in her defenses, an odd inflating sound filling the chamber as the walls expanded outwards. Trini reached out her arms and felt the plastic padding closing in on her, pushing back as hard as she could but her hands just sunk into the billowy softness ineffectually. Soon the cramped confines became a snug, constricting hug, smooshing Trini into the middle of the giant crinkly pillow. She squirmed and punched against it, but it was no use as the pressure built until she was effectively immobilized in a full-body crinkly diaper embrace. As the padding tightened against her pulsated in slow waves, shifting pressure rolling up and down her body and making her skin tingle even under her protective spandex uniform. A sleepy warmth began to build inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh no...this stupid diaper bag is draining my energy!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't just energy it drained - as Trini felt herself become weaker and weaker physically, her mind was becoming fuzzy as thoughts were more and more muddled in her head. She tried to think back to her training and her previous fights to think up ways to beat this overgrown chicken, but as another wave of huggy squishes rolled over her all she could think about was how wonderful it felt to be snuggled and squeezed by the padding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanny Rumplefeather crowed triumphantly as she zipped her diaper bag closed and pat the side lovingly, feeling the bag puff up with the weight of it's new prisoner. Giving her big soft rump a wiggle, her long tailfeathers shook with a happy bounce as the monster lifted her wing and sent out a bolt of pink energy that created a tall glowing portal. Scratching the ground with her shiny yellow feet, the monster waddled through the portal as the doorway quickly shut behind her, leaving no trace of the monster or Power Ranger in the empty forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the portal opened again, it was into a dimly lit cave, but instead of dirt and rocks this cave was covered by a soft brown fleecey material, making the entire chamber soft and cartoonish. Around the corners of the cave the faux-earthen features were broken up by strange oversized pieces of furniture - a giant changing table, an enormous high chair, a large play area covered by a thick blanket with toony chickens emblazoned on the pattern, with odd toys like harnessed bouncy jumpers and big blocks that made the environs seem like it was a preschool for giant children. But the most prominent feature was the nest - an enormous sunken pillow 15' across with a thick puffed donut of satin fabric around the edge nearly 5' high that created an inviting hollow for a momma hen and her chicks to nestle together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hen looked down at her pink diaper bag and giggled. Before Trini had been tucked inside the bag was thinly padded and empty looking. Now, it had swollen up to the size of a basketball, plump and taut and faintly wiggling from the still-struggling passenger trapped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to come out my little one - time to see your new home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deft pinch from her plush feathers Nanny Rumplefeather tugged the zipper open, releasing a gush of pink energy that flowed up out of the bag and back down to the ground. Suddenly Trini's prone form could be seen within the ball of energy, and as the glow dissipated the yellow power ranger was deposited unceremoniously on the plush floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrini moaned and squirmed weakly as she lay on the ground, confused as to what just happened to her. Her muscles were drained, and she could barely hold herself upright. But now, free from the blush-inducing squeeze of her cocoon, her strength slowly returned as she lifted her head to see where the monster had taken her. The ranger gasped as she looked around and saw a veritable playground for tots all around her, the tall furniture telling her that these babyish implements were meant for someone like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the ranger's relief the monster didn't approach, but just looked down from above and cooed motherly at her squirmy little one. Undaunted, Trini finally managed to get to her feet, and defiantly dropped into a defensive stance ready to fight the monster. But a strange crinkling sound - and one coming from her own body - told her to look down. When she did, the sight that met her made Trini blush beet red. Around her waist was now affixed a large, overstuffed, pink diaper. The ranger reached down immediately to pull it off, but try as she might in her weakened state the diaper wouldn't budge an inch. Trini shifted uncomfortably, the diaper teasing her with a noisy crinkle with every movement she made and hugging around her waist in a constant reminder of her babyish attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to me??\" Trini asked with horror in her voice, still trying to fight to remove the diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buk...buk kaw! Oh your new diaper looks so cute on you my little chicky! Try all you like to remove it - your diaper can never be taken off! And any time you have a naughty thought, like that you are a Power Ranger and not just a cutesy little cuddle pet, the diaper will puff up and drain away your energy until you're brought right back to those happy childish thoughts of wanting to be snuggled up in your Momma's arms!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Trini struggled, Miss Rumplefeather waddled over and scooped Trini up in her arms, hugging her close to her chest and leaning in to plant a flurry of pecky-kisses with her beak on top of the ranger's helmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now is my widdle wanger ready to accept all my lovely snuggles and become my pretty little pet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, bug-for-brains! I'll never be your pet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time the hen monster looked peeved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's no way for a little girl to behave! From now on, you will refer to me as Nanny Rumplefeather - YOUR Nanny, now and forever more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster lifted Trini up in her embrace, exposing her poofy pink diaper that the hen spanked firmly with a big wing. The impact didn't hurt, but with each sway Trini felt a jolt of submissive thoughts rushing into her head, giving her the feeling that she was a naughty child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Trini wriggled in Nanny Rumplefeather's smothering embrace, she looked up at the monster with a sense of worry behind her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now my sweet little one - your choice - where should we start your training to become my loving child and snugglepet?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She gritted her teeth through the monster's motherly clucks and coos trying to focus on escape, but unable to free herself from the hen's energy-sapping embrace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...gotta...get outta...here!\" Trini said from within the smothering pillows of Nanny Rumplefeather's wings. As she shrunk the hug loosened, the ranger sinking into the cover of the wrapping plush wings making it harder for the monster to keep hold. Wriggling, struggling, and working her way deeper, Trini's feet felt freedom out the bottom of the feathers. As subtly as she could, Trini worked her body towards the opening and managed to pop out from under the wings. She slid down and hid herself under the hen's belly, a quick glance up showing Nanny Rumplefeather was distracted by teasing and rocking her wings back and forth, thinking Trini was still in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now's my chance!\" Trini said, but as she looked around everything seemed...bigger. The entrance of the nest further away, and the furniture massive. It was then the yellow ranger realized just how much she had shrunk - now less than 3 feet tall! She held back the shock and regained her determination to escape. Quietly, Trini began to tiptoe away from the monster. If she could get to the wall Trini could hide behind the changing table and toy chest on her way out the cave. But it only took one step for Trini to realize something was wrong. Her diaper felt even bigger, turning her normal gait into a bow-legged waddle. But when she caught sight of herself in a mirror standing to her side, the yellow ranger has to stifle a gasp. Not only was her diaper bigger, but her whole uniform had changed to look less like a mighty power ranger with the spirit of a sabre-toothed tiger, and more like a silly chubby yellow chick in a thick plush suit. The pink diaper had swelled into the poofy rump and tummy of a chicken, A frilly pink skirt lining the top side and had spread over her chest and shoulders to make a babyish onesie dress. But it wasn't just the clothing on top - the diaper had merged with Trini's yellow power ranger uniform, causing the spandex to plump all over with plush, creating a downy soft look to her suit. Little feathers sprouted from the bottom of her arms, leading down to thick yellow mittens and giving the appearance of budding wings. And lastly, to add insult to injury, around Trini's helmet a big silly open-faced chicken mask lay, her visored face peeking out of the beak of the costume. She looked down, and noticed her power coin - the object that tied her to her spirit animal and linked her to the morphing grid, had become corrupted, a chicken face starting to close its beak down over the sabre toothed tiger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of herself in the silly plush chick suit filled Trini with a rush of childish glee. She tried to fight it, but her mind was so weak from the draining that the ranger couldn't help herself and let out a little 'buk kaw!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrini eeped as the noisy swishing of Nanny Rumplefeather's cuddles ceased. She had been noticed! The panic helped Trini snap into action, her muddled mind knowing no other option than to run for it! Taking the first step, she saw her feet encased in thick plush chicken boots...but thankfully her legs were only covered with spandex tights. She nearly stumbled trying to run as normal, changing her pace to a slow, clumsy waddle. Her suit hugged all around as she lumbered away, thick tail waggling and diaper crinkling noisily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naughty chick! Trying to escape Momma's cuddles!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground shook as Nanny Rumplefeather stood up. Trini had a good three second head start, but in her shrunken state the giant hen monster was able to catch up with her easily. Just as Trini felt the sun on her face two massive blanket-like wings reached around and caught her and pulled her back into the nest, lifted up into the arms of the overbearing chicken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you think you're going little chick? It's dangerous out there without momma! There are mean people out there who want to take you away and remove your cute lil' chicky costume. Doesn't that make you scared?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanny Rumplefeather held Trini close to her face, giving her beaky kisses and gazing at the little ranger with fixed, loving eyes. Trini squirmed about at first, but when she caught sight of the monster's eyes she couldn't look away. New thoughts flooded her head. Yes, she had to stay here where it's safe. Mean people want to do harm to me. Take me away from Momma...the rational part of Trini's mind was shocked at how powerful those emotions were. Combined with the feeling of pillowy wings rubbing all over her costume, squeezing the fluff around her in a full-body hug, it was a dizzying hypnotic feeling that Trini was finding harder and harder to fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can go outside once you've grown into a full chick. Until then, you won't leave Momma's side. Isn't that right, little chick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrini tried to resist, but the chicken hood nodded for her, and the ranger found herself placed down on the ground by Nanny Rumplefeather. She would have been able to escape, but as she looked at the entrance to the cave she only saw the scary outside that the hen mommy had told her about. And so the thought never crossed her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good little chick! Oooh we're going to have SO MUCH fun together, you and I! All the happy games and fun activities to teach you all about being the best little baby you can be. Now...where should we start?\"</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Beginning <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason, Zack, Billy, Kimberly, Trini, a group of regular high school teenagers who live in the city of Angel Grove. One day they were living normal lives like any other teenager, going to school, hanging out at the local hangout for the kids, Ernie's Juice Bar, and on more than one occasion, being the targets of the school's local bullies, Bulk &amp; Skull. However, one day an earthquake struck Angel Grove and the juice bar where the gang was hanging out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly they were teleported to a secured location within a large structure. As they were unaware of their surroundings, everything inside looked futuristic as it were all created by machines. They would soon discover that it was a command center, operated by a powerful galactic being named Zordon and his trusted friend and loyal robotic assistant, Alpha 5. Zordon would to come to explain the cause of bringing the teens to the Command Center. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would go onto to tell them that the evil empress, Rita Ripulsa has been awoken from her eternal slumber on the moon and has decided to invade Earth to wreak havoc. Not alone, Rita brought with her, her loyal henchmen, Goldar, Baboo, Squatt, and Finster, who was the master creator of all of Rita's monsters. Zordon would gift the teens with special powers that would turn them into the group of heroes, the Mighty Morphing Power Rangers! With these powers, weapons, and zords, they would be able to defeat the forces of evil, and protect Earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason (Red Ranger) - Being the strong, loyal, leader of the group, Jason would control the power of the Tyrannosaurus Rex Megazord. Displaying great strength, and the power of fire, the t-rex megazord proved to be the true king of the prehistoric jungle. With the power saber as his chosen weapon, Jason would be able to cut enemies down to size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack (Black Ranger) - The cool, laid-back, and more relaxed member of the group, Zack would be in control of the King of the Arctic, the Mastadon Megazord. With the ability to put a freeze on the forces of evil, Zack and his trusted zord always made the battle seem more cool. However, Zack proved to be cool and battle ready with the power of his trusted Power Axe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly (Blue Ranger) - The stereotypical nerd of the group, Billy is the brains behind the Power Rangers, but also a brilliant inventor as he has helped his fellow rangers in many situations with his gadgets and improvements. With the same knowledge and thought, no wonder why the Triceratops was the perfect fit for Billy as his megazord. Able to dish out double the pain, Billy was given the weapon of the lance. With the appearance of a trident, he was able to separate it and use both ends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrini (Yellow Ranger) - If there is a fight or argument among the group or between anyone, the best one to call on is Trini. As the calm, tranquil one of the group, she has always been able to bring peace among the group and be a mediator. And that is why she matched perfectly with the Sabre Toothed Tiger as her zord. Ferocious yet cunning, the Saber Toothed Tiger along with Trini made a fearsome duo. Using her power daggers, Trini really showed that although she is calm, she can kick butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly (Pink Ranger) - Probably the most agile, spunky, and girly one of the group, Kimberly loves her friends, being a power ranger, but an equally big passion is gymnastics. So it wouldn't be too hard why Zordon paired her up with the Pterodactyl Megazord, for it is agile with it's flight, and graceful. Also, Robin Hood better look out, because with her bow and arrow, Kimberly can kick serious butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time of becoming the Power Rangers, the team would soon gain a new member, Tommy Oliver. Of course Rita had Tommy under a spell that turned him into the Evil Green Ranger who battled the rangers in a fierce rivalry ,but with determination, the strength of friendship, and with heart, they were able to bring Tommy out of the curse and onto the good side. Tommy would join the group as the co-leader and would become one of the most legendary power rangers of all time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with Angel Grove with it's heroes, Rita attempted on so many occasions to try and defeat the rangers, but would always come up short. Always Good would triumph over Evil! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita's New Plan <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter continuous attempts of trying to defeat the rangers, but always failing in the end, Rita came up with a new plan. Instead of defeating the rangers with cruel, cold hearted, vengeful monsters, what about having the rangers face monsters they have never faced before. What if the rangers came across monsters that were more of the motherly or fatherly demeanor. A sinister thought came to her mind as she thought, if she can't defeat the rangers, why don't she treat them with care. So came the plan for her to reach into one of her spell books to look for a size reducing spell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the rangers at their regular height of teenagers, the are physically imposing, but what about keeping them in their teenage forms, but make them smaller in height so the new breed of monsters could think of them as little ones. So searching through one of her spell books, she casted a curse on the rangers that would cause them to shrink down to just waist height of others, and with the yearning to be held, cuddled, snuggled, and cared for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with the rangers just the size of actual children, how will they fare against monsters of the more caring and parental demeanor? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
