Antiuck is a bustling market city full of back alleys and high rooftops, operating more as a mercantile city state that broke away from the kingdom than the average walled city, as such, the laws are more lax here.

The jeweler on Monty Street is giving them away!\" The man then glanced at your boots for a second, before moving on with his day. What a creep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case you need some money, maybe you could get one of them and pawn it off for gold? On the other hand, this seemed very unusual, it seemed all the men wearing these necklaces were giving odd untoward looks downwards...at each other's crotches...maybe their feet?

In fact, they were probably worth a dozen or so gold coins to a travelling salesmen. Specially, with the current demand for foot-related items in New Solesville... I made you shudder, just wondering how an entire city could become so obsessed with feet overnight. Still, you had to admit: those foot-shaped necklaces weren't <i>that</i> bad. Quite beautiful, actually! Captivating, even... (-1 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you waited in line for your turn, you manage to hit up a conversation with the lanky young man behind you. His brand new clothes and puffed-up chest denounce him as a proud member of the petty bourgeoisie. \"So, you're here to buy some supplies, eh?\" he asks, a slight hint of disdain in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod enthusiastically, and reply with as much conviction as your heart could muster: \"Yes. I've come here to buy some armour and training, and then I'm heading west, through the Crevices, to find and slay the Monster King!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe...\" the young man chuckles, clearly not impressed by your bravado. \"Sure you are. Lots of adventurers come through here singing that song, you know? Funny how we don't hear from them again... still, if you're that much of a hero, you're better off fighting serpent-boys in the wild, then here in Antiuck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\" you ask with morbid curiosity, the pain from your damaged ego immediately obscured by the man's cryptic statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's just say the Sisterhood doesn't like seeing men run around with armour over their shoulders and weapons around their waist. They say it's for our protection, of course, but they're really just projecting their daddy issues onto us, law-abiding citizens. I will be damned if those lesbian fanatics think we actually care for any of their sanctimonious bullshit! My suggestion: if they tell you to do something, just nod quietly and piss off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides... I hear there's rumours of something brewing down in the sewers. Something big. A revolution, maybe. Don't have a clue who's behind it yet, but I, for one, would gladly welcome the change of airs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to press the bourgeois for more information, when you hear a lisped, high-pitch voice calling: \"Next!\" You turn around to see you've finally reached the start of the queue, and are now standing before a large velvet table, lined with a hundred foot-shaped pendants. And behind the table sits a sickly young woman, her pale blue eyes staring right into yours as you feel her cold dead hands reach out to measure your neck. When she opens her mouth to talk, you swear you can feel the smell of cheese emanating from her throat... (-1 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, sire.\" she says, fitting a silver pendant encrusted with a polished malachite foot tightly around your neck. And as the necklace clicks into place, and you look into the exquisite pendant shining in your chest, right above your heart, all your doubts about their legitimacy fade away instantly (-3 MP). You walk away from the jeweller with an unprecedented sense of satisfaction and excitement, to the point of feeling a bit light-headed in the sun...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean against the wall of a nearby tavern, so as to catch your breath, but what you see next only makes you gasp even harder: a procession of monks marches down the street, their feet clad in nothing but a pair of thin leather sandals! And without realising, your eyes are helplessly drawn to the monks' visibly dirty (and no doubt, sweaty) soles. (-5 MP) Suddenly, it didn't feel wrong or even weird to stare at other men's feet. Not when you understood how subtly rough and beautiful they looked... not when their toes felt so strangely appetising and seductive... not when their soles suddenly held such a mesmerising power over you... (-5 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monks finally disappear down the street and you're crash-landed back into reality. Looking around you, you can see you weren't the only one left hypnotised by the show of parading male soles: at least a few dozen other people, all wearing the same foot-shaped pendants as you, remained with their eyes stuck on the spot where a few seconds ago, a young monk had laid down his sweaty foot. And looking down, you could see that, much like your fellow necklace-wearers, you had unwittingly pitched a massive tent in your trousers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head clear and your cock limp, you decide to ignore this incident, and promptly resume your business here in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour MP: 85/100 (-5 MP ongoing while the necklace is equipped)</span></div></div>",

As the day progresses, you regularly find yourself reminiscing about the morning's procession of sandalled monks, and their luscious, sweaty soles. (-5 MP) Thankfully for you, there are plenty more feet on display at the market: big feet, small feet, old feet, young feet, pretty feet, ugly feet, clean feet, dirty feet... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... dirty feet!\" you think to yourself as you catch sight of some young rascals washing their toes in a fountain. For a moment, you consider pledging your very own oral cleaning apparatus to help wash their feet, but the boys are too soon chased off by an angry Sisterhood guard, leaving you with nothing but lust and regret (-5 MP).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the sheer amount of barefoot plebs around you, shopping quickly became a strenuous task, demanding all your attention and focus. Despite your newfound foot fetish, you manage to purchase a rusted iron sword dealing 2 damage per hit for 4 gold, and bunch of dry lavender for 1 gold, to wear under your clothes and help mask unpleasant odours (even though your definition of 'unpleasant odour' was progressively shifting away from cheesy feet...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, your initial idea to sell the pendant for a couple more coins was silently forgotten in between gawking at other people's lower extremities, and thinking of clever ways to convince merchants to sell you their worn shoes. Not that money was useless... but, as strange as it sounded, you felt a kind of emotional attachment to the necklace. You felt a warmth throughout your body you had only experienced once before in your life - the first time you had ever fallen in love. You just loved the pendant, and loved feet. Specially feet. (-5 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after a long day's perving, your legs automatically found their way to the nearest inn, ever so ironically called \"The Rabbit's Paw\". As your stepped through the door, a chubby little woman rushed to welcome you into her establishment and present you with usual array of food and drink. Since toejam wasn't on the menu, you decided to ask for a beer. And another one. And another one... quite a few, actually. By the end of the night, the alcohol had done its part chipping away at your self-consciousness. (-5 MP) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, it didn't take long for you to try and have a taste of your drinking buddy's toes, before being triumphantly kicked and punched up the stairs, and toward your room. As you leaned on the doorframe, wiping the blood off your swollen lip, your eyes wander to the end of the corridor, where you saw a young gentleman of exotic descent, no doubt a Far-Southerner by his tanned skin, pitch-black hair and deep-blue eyes, slowly enter his bedroom. Your eyes bulge along with your nether regions as you look down to his shapely feet, encased in nothing but an exquisite leather sandal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your drunken stupor, the thought of storming into the young man's room and taking your frustration out on his soles does cross your mind... on the other hand, you had barely escaped alive minutes ago from a similar exploit.

You hold your trusty pendant between your fingers one last time, before falling into a deep, dreamful slumber... (-5 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***** <br>\r\nA foul smell permeated your nostrils. Even if you were conscious, you could barely describe its pungent perfection; but you transfixed by it. The smell, the wonderful cheesy smell, was all you saw. It was like a dense fog, swirling and twirling within your mind, leading you deeper... and deeper... and deeper... into nowhere. You were falling, and all you could hear was the rancid mist, rushing past your ears, singing, speaking... and as you fell into a sleeping trance, you could finally hear His words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ever close, my Stench draws near...<br>\r\nSmell it: your purpose is clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith eager hands you reclaim<br>\r\nwhat faithless minds thought profane...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at my Soles do you toil,<br>\r\nfor the Feet which rule your soil...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis verses echoed through your mind, and your body.

You worshipped His Feet, as you knew you should.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou planted a single, delicate kiss on the divine arches before you. The sight, the taste, the scent... it overwhelmed you.

(-4 MP.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe harpy laughs as your eyes glaze over. You're his now, and now he's going to use you! He puts his talon back on the ground and presses the tip of his cock against your lips. \"Time for your sweet treat, sweetie! Go ahead, suck it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou comply without the slightest hesitation. You open your mouth as wide as you can and stuff yourself full of harpy dick! The harpy lets out a satisfied moan as your warm, moist mouth engulfs about three quarters of his impressive length. \"Ngh...there you go. Goooood slave...\" He starts to stroke your head as you suckle on his meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour MP: 0, You've been enslaved! Congratulations!<br>\r\nHarpy Boy HP: 6/6</span></div></div>",

Maybe I should give you a little present for giving in so easily!\" He raises his right foot, wiggles his smelly toes, and with a motion as swift as lightning, cuts apart your pants and undergarments with the talons on his toes. \"Wow, you're so small, even for a human! No wonder you gave up, heehee!\" He then takes your modest cock between two of his toes and wiggles them. His sweat combined with your saliva created an excellent lubricant, causing the toes to easily slide across both sides of your shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe harpy boy edges closer and closer to an orgasm as you suck his dick. His hips move faster and faster, and he forcefully grabs the back of your head and shoves you against his cock, forcing you to deepthroat him.

His feet smelled, tasted and felt even better than the blue harpy boy's! After you finished cleaning both of his feet, you looked hungrily, but also fearfully up to his cock. It was easily twice the size of his friend's cock! As it dangled before you, it reached all the way down to the bottom of your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter admiring his massive cock, you picked the head up and opened your mouth. As you were about to insert it, your master stopped you.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't think it will even fit in your mouth boy!

Please master, I'll do whatever you want!\"<br>\r\n\"You are already doing whatever I want slut, but I like your begging so you may try!\"<br>\r\nWithout even trying to say thank you, you opened your mouth as wide as you could, and pushed the head into your mouth with great effort.

So you began licking, sucking and kissing the part of his cock that you could get to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short while, the green harpy boy took his cock out of your mouth, pushed you against a wall and rammed his cock into your mouth. The pain was matched only with your lust and satisfaction! He then started slowly pumping the entire length of his cock in and out of you, taunting and degrading you as he goes along. You can feel his cock hitting the bottom of your stomach!<br>\r\n\"Ung! So, are you humans typically this weak or is it just you? I think I could even lift you off the ground using only my cock!\"<br>\r\nThe harpy boy seemed to think this was actually a good idea! He was slowly starting to step backwards, while holding your hair to keep your face in his balls. After he walked about a metre backwards, he let go of your hair. He was right! There you are, dangling on his cock, unable to move and completely at his mercy!<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! Look at how pathetic you look!\"<br>\r\nYour master then grabbed your waist and starting pumping again. It didn't take long for him to burst his seed inside you. You were still dangling on his cock after he finished inside you, only touching the ground after he went soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green harpy boy then sat down on a bench nearby, ordering you to lick his feet. The blue harpy boy returned soon after. The two friends then laughed at the fact that you could dangle in mid air on the green harpy boy's cock. You noticed the blue harpy boy seemed a little nervous about his friend's size. The green boy suddenly said<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he was good! I think I'm going to keep him as my permanent slave.\" <br>\r\n\"No way man! I found him first and I broke him! Go find your own slut.\"<br>\r\n\"That doesn't mean that he is yours! You know the rules!\"<br>\r\n\"So you're challenging me then? Alright, lets get this over with!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two harpy boys were fighting over you! You could only watch in anticipation at which harpy boy would be your new master.<br>\r\nWho will become your new master? The stronger green harpy boy with his massive cock? Or the agile blue harpy boy with his unmatched beauty?</span></div></div>",

Due to his speed he will attack before anyone (except if you're ambushed). Also since he is a rogue, he can tell you if a chest is trapped or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Taiyo age 14, class priest. He has nothing but a wooden staff, since he is a priest he cannot attack monster boys (he can be targeted by them though). But thanks to his ability, he will heal you and himself after the end of a fight (+ 10 MP) and will also use minor heal spells on you and himself each the end of each chapter (+ 2 MP). He also has a kind of mental and invisible shield. That shield is always activated and while it doesn't protect from physical attacks (such as kicks in the face, or foot rubing) it will make your mind stronger against mental attacks (foot odors, teasing, verbal domination and ay kind of mental attacks), halving their damage on your mind. He can also negate any kind of curse (from a monster boy or a cursed item). Finally thanks to another passive skill, he will negate bonus monster boys can obtain by fighting while it's dark.All that seems really strong, but keep in mind he literally cannot attack monster boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose partners all have 80 MP except Taiyo who has 100 MP since he is a priest. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The kneeling, handsome, fox-eared man in front of you was a treasure, no doubt. But you came here for treasure you can sell, and you highly doubt anyone would buy a monster boy. Well, there might be some people, but they're weird..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay put. I want to have a look around this cave of yours.\" The Kitsune pouts as you reject his advances and instead opt to rob his cave. He doesn't say anything on the matter though, which you'd find suspicious if you weren't mesmerized by the huge piles of golden coins and trinkets in front of you! Forget weapons, you could probably hire a small army with all this! Everywhere you look there's something valuable, and you don't even know where to start! Eventually, your eyes settle on a small black box on top of one of the gold piles. It looks just like a box you'd hold a ring in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kitsune sees you walk towards it, and he immediately says, \"nonono! Do not take that ring! Please! Take anything else, but leave that alone! It's far too valuable to l-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pipe down, will you? This is my treasure now, so I'm not taking anything!\" His words only make you more curious about what's in the little box. You climb up the pile of coins and pluck it from its resting point at the top. When you open the box, as expected, you find a gold ring inside. What you didn't expect however, is the big, glowing, purple gem on it! This ring is definitely magical, and given how much the kitsune seems to want you to stay away from it, it's also probably very powerful! You take the ring out of the box, and can actually feel the energy coming from it! Without a moment's hesitation, you slip it on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figured the instant you put it on, you'd feel more powerful, but as it stands you feel largely the same. Except...your finger feels a bit...itchy. You look down at the ring, only to see that your finger is turning purple! Your eyes widen in shock, and when you try to pull the ring off, not only do you see that it's stuck, but your finger feels like it's made out of some kind of cloth! The purple cloth spreads to the rest of your hand and starts crawling up your arm. Also...does the Kitsune look...taller than he did before? Oh...no you're just shrinking. Oh no! You're shrinking! You drop the Kitsune boy's ball as you try to desperately yank the ring off! Said ball is immediately scooped up by one of his tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried to warn you about that ring. It's one of the most valuable items a monster boy can own! If a human puts it on, they turn into a sock! Serves you right. No actual hero would be so greedy. You'd have probably just given up your quest had our stupid king just bribed you. Luckily, I saved him some gold.\" He pulls off his left boot, making you feel sick as his overwhelming foot odor flows back out. Strangely enough, you don't lose any MP! \"Heh, you're going to go on this foot. And thanks to that special ring, you'll never get used to the smell, and you'll never go foot crazy like most humans! Heh, you won't even wear down and eventually die. You'll be stuck with my nasty feet for eternity!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to respond, but your mouth won't move! Your arms lay at your sides as your body turns entirely into purple cloth. A few moments later, you've turned completely into a purple, knee-high sock! The ring clatters to the ground, and the Kitsune picks both of you up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few moments are a blur. He puts you on, and your entire world is his godawful foot odor! You can feel the stench literally seep into your entire being. This truly is hell! You can't cry, or beg, or anything. All you can do is take in the smell of his feet, especially when everything goes dark as the boot is put back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kitsune makes good on his word. You spend an eternity suffering at his feet. No matter how much time passes, no matter how foul, filthy, and sweat-soaked you become, you never wear down. There's no escape. The only thing you can ever hope for anymore is that the Kitsune might make another human smell you. At least then you get a momentary break. Sadly, with how disgusting you become, those moments don't last long, and you're soon back to suffering in his sweltering boot.</span></div></div>",

His slender frame and unmarred, light skin make him seem so fragile. And so usable! Given his performance, you can only assume that this fox-eared boy WANTS you to fuck him anyways, so might as well! You hold his ball in one hand, and use the other to unbuckle and drop your trousers. Your cock is already starting to harden and form a tent in your underpants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirk down at the fox boy and hold his ball a bit tighter as you say, \"well, a little fun couldn't hurt! Alright foxy, get over here and pleasure me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kitsune grins eagerly and crawls over to you. His fingers gently wrap around your waistband and slowly slide your underpants down. His fluffy fox ears twitch a bit, and he licks his lips eagerly at the sight of your semi-hard cock. You think he's going to open up and start sucking, but instead, you see his tails inch closer and closer to your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne tail very gently brushes the tip of your penis, and an intense jolt of pleasure courses through your body! It feels so wonderful that your entire body, not just your cock, goes completely stiff! His tail is so wonderfully silky soft, it's like magic! Hell, it probably IS magic! Forget fucking him, you need as many tails on your dick as possible! Now! \"A-aaaahhh! U...use your tails! Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughs at how eager you are all of a sudden. \"Heh, so turns out I'm not so disgusting after all, hm? You seem to like my fluffy tails just fine!\" One of his silver tails lightly coils around the base of your dick, and just like that you're in heaven! He makes things even better by wrapping another tail just below the tip, and then...the stroking starts! The two luxuriously silky tails meet in the middle with each stroke. It feels so amazing that you're rendered completely speechless! He isn't done yet though! Another tail starts to brush over your sensitive tip, eliciting a moan of delight from you. You don't even seem to notice as his other tails slowly lower you down to the ground till you're lying on your back. He giggles mischievously and takes a seat on your chest, making sure to keep you in your pleasure trance as long as possible. It isn't terribly long though, because in a mere five minutes, you let out a scream as you paint his metallic colored tails white. The intense orgasm rocks your whole body, causing you to shiver and unknowingly drop the Kitsune boy's ball!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lie there with your eyes closed, sucking in deep breaths after such an intense experience. As you take in another breath though, the air suddenly reeks like hell again! (-20 MP) Your eyes shoot open just in time to see his filthy, bare foot stomp down on your face! His arch covers your mouth, and your nose is pushed right in between those filth-caked toes! Your face goes green in disgust, and your eyes widen in fear when you realize he has his ball back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I was kind of hoping you'd be the one. The guy who'd finally take out that fool we're forced to call king. After all, I've never seen a man or woman able to resist my feet after such a close sniff! Unfortunately, if you're THIS easily distracted by your lust, you couldn't possibly win against him. Better to just end your journey now! After all, I'm much nicer than some other monsters you'll meet. Or, would have met! Now come on! Breaaathe in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tails have your arms and legs pinned, and you're still weak from the tailjob he gave you. You don't have a choice! You still keep holding your breath till you're blue in the face, but in the end, you inhale. As you sniff his disgusting foot, both your nose and brain are overwhelmed by that potent, cheesy stink! It's so unbelievably foul! Way worse than anything people had described monster feet to smell like! Your nose burns like someone had just stuck a match in it! It's a sharp, vinegary odor, but with an insane intensity to it that just makes your brain sizzle! (-50 MP) Needless to say, you pass out almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor you, it feels like no time has passed at all, but in reality you've been unconscious for a couple of hours! While you were unconscious, all your clothes were removed, and you'd been chained to the cave wall with a golden collar and chain leash. You wake up and, after the initial confusion, look around for the Kitsune and those sexy, filthy feet of his! You see him sitting on a pile of gold with his feet tucked away in those boots he conjured up. \"You know, slave...I like these! They get my feet all hot and sweaty...why, they're probably toxic by now!\" The sound of that makes your mouth water, and you immediately crawl to his feet. \"Mmm, someone's eager to serve his master! Well, okay! Sit down and spread your legs!\" You do as commanded, and watch eagerly as he pulls off his boots with his tails! One is tossed away, but he places the opening of the other over your nose! It's so muggy inside, and as you take a whiff, your brain is again blasted with hot, putrid foot reek that makes you retch, but love all the same! (-100 MP!!!) You happily take the boot and start sniffing! Meanwhile, Master smirks and sandwiches your cock between his two filth-ridden, noxious feet! You moan in delight as he starts stroking you with those nasty things! \"Hehe! Enjoy my feet, slave! You'll be licking your own cum off them soon enough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus, your adventure came to an end. You dutifully served your Kitsune master for life. You spent your days sucking him off and worshipping his godawful feet,  hoping to be rewarded with another heavenly tailjob! Life could never be better.</span></div></div>",

Now give me a minute to pack my things please!\" You allow him a bit of time to do so, and he conjures up a backpack.

He didn't even have to tell you! Despite your gags and groans, you find yourself staring at those tiny, stinky feet with complete adoration! You can't stop sniffing their vile scent!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContent with his victory over you, the fairy plans his next move!</span></div></div>",

Over the course of a few years, you manage to hack, slash and poison your way to fortune. <i>And infamy</i>... your name became a taboo, your presence was a threat to king and peasant alike, your mere existence feared throughout the world. You earned many enemies, and many rivals. Sooner or later, they all fell before your blade...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when the rumours began to surface, of monster boys roaming the countryside, kidnapping innocent people and turning them into stinky-feet slaves, your greatest challenge appeared. Signed with the promise of 10 000 gold pieces, a contract <b>to locate and kill the Monster King himself!</b> After weeks of preparation, you slipped away under the cover of night, and began the long journey to the Monster King's realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of two months, you sneaked through the human realm, jumped the border to the Monster Lands undetected, covered the entire Sweatmarshes while defending yourself from the wandering packs of vampires and footwraiths, fought your way through the Beast Warrens, and survived the Labyrinth of Stench, before finally arriving at the doors of the Monster King's palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalling on your years of experience as a criminal, you managed to infiltrate the fortress, and work through its trapped passages one by one. You were on the antechamber to the Monster King's bedroom, <i>when the simplest trap turned into your bane:</i> stepping through a thin tripwire, you activated a mechanism which pumped footshroom spores into the room. As the place filled up with the bitter, cheesy stench of feet, a tall, imposing figure, wearing a dark, bulb-shaped crown, was the last thing you saw before passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up in the accursed citadel of Kaz-Mesmer, a prison for the Monster King's deadliest enemies. During your month-long captivity, you were subjected to the most cruel and disgusting punishments, forced to worship hundreds, if not thousands, of pairs of stinky monster boy feet, surviving on nothing but sweat and toejam, and victim to unspeakable sorceries which turned your brain into mush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of your imprisonment, your true self was long dead. All you knew was that you loved monster boy feet, that you longed to serve the Monster King's soles, and that it was your job to exact revenge on each and every one of his enemies. <i>Specially on your former contractors...</i> bent on seeing all of mankind kneel before the Monster King's feet, you ride out of Kaz-Mesmer and back to enemy lands!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you reach the border, it's only a matter of time for the monster boys. With your cunning and viciousness, the border kingdoms slowly crumble, one by one... their lords mysteriously disappear, or inexplicably pledge themselves to the Monster King; the monster boys find their way into the cities, unopposed by the guard; foot-worshipping cults proliferate; and soon enough, the peasantry is enslaved. All thanks to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour plots seem unstoppable... until an old nemesis strikes back. Thanks to an anonymous tip, the Sisterhood of Divine Protection burst into the Contessa's office in time to catch you trying to hypnotize their leader. You are once again captured and brought under captivity, this time in a secret fortress on the white slopes of the Snowy Mountains, where you spend many months being reprogrammed to serve the Sisterhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the last day of prison sentence, the chief Inquisitress visits your prison cell, closely followed by two Crusader-Sisters.

He then forcibly shoves the footshroom into your mouth, \"toes\" first. The mushroom tasted exquisite, almost like a real foot! It was salty, with sweat-like juices pouring out of it and down your throat! As you hungrily chewed the footshroom, its spores worked their magic on your mind, taking complete control of you and making any resistance towards monsterkind completely disappear. You were truly a bitch for the monster boys, now. (-25 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you swallowed the rest of the footshroom, making your leafy master very happy. \"Good girl,\" he cooed, \"I guess you earned the rest of my nasty feet! Bon appetit, slut!\" He sat down and pressed both his feet against your face, smothering your with all of his filthy toes. The strong, sweaty, earthy aroma invaded your entire being, further solidifying your desire to be beneath such a stinky, SEXY pair of feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his feet rubbed their disgusting muck into your face, you felt... strange. The footshroom actually did much more to you than make you subservient, as you were now finding out. You slowly came to realize it's hidden side-effect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour MP: 0/100<br>\r\n(You're a slave to monster boys and will do whatever they say just to be at their feet.)</span></div></div>",

You expression turned around as he retrieved another footshroom from his toga. (Where is he making the room for these? Are they growing on him?) You salivated just thinking about chomping down on another one of these beauties. However, the plant boy had another idea. He took the footshroom between his broad, green soles and mashed it up between them, coating his feet in footshroom gunk. After the footshroom was thoroughly mashed, he presented his feet back to you, scrunching his soles, inviting you to lick up the delicious footshroom from his equally delicious feet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you did. You slurped up each and every last bit of footshroom coating your master's sweaty, dirty feet. As you finished it up, the headache sensation returned. It faded as quickly as it came, and left a brand new footshroom in its wake! The both of them stood together atop your head, right next to each other. They formed a perfect pair of soles squishing into your hair, covering your head in their sweat-like juices oozing from them. They also seemed to be bigger, as if the more footshrooms you have attached to you, the bigger each individual one becomes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you didn't have to worry about it. Your master was feeding you the footshrooms, and he knows what's best for you. You have complete trust in him and his delicious feet. They would never lead you astray.

He was very satisfied at how thorough you were.<br>\r\n\"Huh, not a speck of dirt or filth on either of my feet!

Were you always this weak, or is it just your destiny to live as a foot slut to a rat boy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were feeling sorry for yourself, your master dirtied his feet again and then ordered you to clean them again. So you repeated the humiliating process again, licking in between his toes, sucking every last piece of dirt from his sexy feet. Once you finished again, he told you to follow him. He led you on a short walk to him home, which was a small cave nearby. When you entered the cave, he began explaining how your life would be from now on. You would wake him up in the morning by licking his feet clean, then you would make his food and once he left the cave you were to keep it neat and tidy. When he returns each day you would lick his feet and prepare his food again. When he goes to sleep, you are to sleep with your face in his feet. None of this bothered you one bit, in fact you were overwhelmed with joy at how much of his feet you would get in your new life! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>One year after enthusiastically serving your master, he returns home in a very good mood. After lustfully licking his feet clean and preparing him an excellent meal, he surprises you with a reward</i><br>\r\n\"This is good food slut! You've been excellent today! I think you have earned a reward that you have been hoping for!\"<br>\r\nYou look at your master surprised and pleased, you were only happy because he was happy. For the first time in a year, he reveals his massive cock! You had learnt from your previous mistake though, so you only gazed on it, admiring it's power and size. Your master then said:<br>\r\n\"Go on then, put it in your mouth. You've earned one load of my superior cum!\"<br>\r\nYou could hardly believe your ears! You were finally allowed the highest honour! You dived in between his legs again, taking his cock into your mouth, kissing, licking and sucking as much as you could! His cock was far tastier than you had ever imagined! It tasted like pure power and supremacy, a physical representation of his superiority over you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for your master to explode in your mouth. You swallowed and savoured every drop. You were sad that you had already made him explode, you were looking forward to serving his cock for so long and you barely got a minute of it! With extreme reluctance you took his cock out of your mouth and remained on your knees in front of him, having a sad expression. You looked up at your master, seeing that his was in deep thought while staring at you. After a moment he said:<br>\r\n\"You know what slave? I think it's your lucky day! I enjoyed having you take my cock like that, so I think I will allow you to do it as much as you like tonight. Only for tonight though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finished speaking, he grabbed the back of your head and rammed his cock into your mouth. You could feel the tip in your throat! The excitement was too much for you so you exploded as well. Just like the first time round, your master exploded in just over a minute of throat fucking you. He didn't take his cock out of your mouth though. Again, after a short while, he started fucking your mouth. This process would go on for about half and hour before your master was completely exhausted. You've never felt so much joy in your life before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Later that night, your master would make you clean his feet again. After that he would throw you onto his bed and fuck you in all of your holes in multiple humiliating positions. When the both of you finally settled down, you had time again to think about everything that has happened in the past year. Instead of feeling bad about it all, you felt happy! The humiliation of becoming complete and utter property to one of the weakest monster boys seemed to turn you on to no end!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is the story of how a young female adventurer, full of fire and determination, would go on to live under the feet of a rat boy and become utterly addicted to it!</b></span></div></div>",

While it barely covers your face, it covers the nose enough that chance of MP loss is weakened. Better be careful though, it looks rather fragile.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaving goodbye to the guards, you continue on your way. A dirt path is layed before you and you make certain to keep on it. While you aren't resorting to cowardice, you don't wish to be abused. The crunching of leaves and rocks under your feet give you a slight worry. Anything unsavory might be able to hear you coming a mile away. Luckily it seems nothing is about....in fact you hear nothing besides your steps. Coming to a large rock, you decide to sit down and plan your next course of action. Of course you knew the castle of the Monster King was your target but dashing straight in when you found it would be a foolish decision. You needed some way to get an edge on the beasts in there. Determined though you were, a rod and a frail mask would not be enough to keep your mind safe.</span></div></div>",

Her shell has devorative spikes and her slime is more yellow than green. The other new fighter, much to your suprise, is a horse boy. His white and black spotted fur is covered in dirt, similar to his black hooflike hands and feet. \"Jeez....\" The female snail said as she put up her fists. \"You always get the fighters, don't you?\" \"At least he finds humans. Let's knock her lights out!\" The horse simulated the punching motions, hitting the female squarely in the face.

It was mixed with other scents you would identify later, but the most important scent was the smell of monster feet.The campfire smoke didn't seem far away, so it made slight sense the smell was a little strong. (-1 MP) Your interest in feet queued you to head for the scene of the camp and rush off you did. As you came closer and closer you began to notice the other distinct scent mixed with the feet. It seemed....fruity...whatever it was, you were about to find out exactly what as you came upon the site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself in a clearing,3 small tent-like structures dotted the area.  What interested you was that for the smell of feet that brought you here, you didn't really see anyone around. All you could see were some patches of blue muck stuck in some holes. As you stepped out in curiosity, you could see some of the muck holes quivering. A few echoed yawns spread over the sight as you see the muck actually begin to rise up. Transfixed on the sight, your eyes stayed glued to the now pillar of muck closest to you. You other mounds come from the sides of the muck, actually becoming dripping arms and hands. The top of the blue sludge begins to shape as a masculine voice comes from it. \"Oh...*yawn*....another visitor, hello mam....*yawn*\" As other mucky beings began to take human form both male and female, you pulled out your rod and prepared for battle. All any of the creatures did in response to this was at most a yawn. \"There's *yawn* no need for that dear. We *yawn* Muckberries perfer nonviolence over...*yawn*. Many of these 'muckberries' began stepping out of thier holes, giving you a good view of thier slimy, dirty....feet...you yawn yourself, the tired vibe these monsters giving off slightly contagious. In a sleepy tone, the male muckberry stepped towards you with an inviting smile and said. \"You seem stressed, why not *yawn* join us for some relaxation?\" Already questions popped into your head, if they slept in holes than why the tents? What the heck were these muckberries doing if they said they were nonviolent? Why were you so tired all of a sudden? How long would you go without taking anymore interest in those feet?</span></div></div>",

Without hesitation, you push your hand into the hat and grabbed whatever this was. Pulling the possible intruder out, it appeared to be a journal. Curious, you opened and began to read to yourself with a yawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The girls kept joking as I set up the campsite. So that snail boy almost got me, I drove him off. Anyways, I had to agree with Macie. This spot seemed to be the perfect place to rest up, something about the area just had some sort of peaceful aura.

Either way, something just compelled you to head outside to see what your hosts were doing. As you stepped outside, you couldn't stop yourself from yawning again. It seemed most of the muckberries were asleep thrmselves, only 3 or 4 were moving about and even then they were just laying around. The male from before saw you and smiled. \"Ah...you're *yawn* awake. Come over here and *yawn* relax with us.\" Not wanting to seem rude, you accept the invitation and walk to him.  As you do so, one of the female muckberries tosses a few slimy blue spheres his way. \"Mmm...always enjoy...*yawn* some of these. Want one? Don't worry, it's *yawn* edible.\" As you sit down with a droop to your eyes, you shrug. It was hard for you to think about anything wrong with this and reach for the odd berry. Both your tired attitudes led to the muckberry dripping the snack....right in between his toes. \"Sorry...I just...*yawn*\" \"No...no...it's fine...I...*yawn* I don't mind doing this.\" Your liking of feet came through as you put your mouth to the blue foot for the little berry. It was amazing to say the least. It was almost like putting your face in a thick form of water. The blue muck smeared on your face as you gulped the blueberry taste from both the muck and your berry. Sure you still felt tired for some reason, but these feet were calling you to a little excitement. (-6 MP) \"Awww...\" One of the female muckberries said as she slithered over. \"I think she likes you.\" \"Oh quiet....Nacie? Is that your name?\" \"I forgot, our names mean nothing anymore anyways.\" Although hearing the conversation and the name spoken sounding familiar, you don't raise your raise to listen and instead continue to enjoy the muckberry feet. Neither did you notice when a darker muckberry rose up from her hole. \"Alright...I think it's about time we...*yawn* head out for home. We can...*yawn* leave all this here.\" The male muckberry looked to you and, without your notice, gave a sinister smile. \"Umm, mam? I *yawn* think I'd like to entertain our *yawn* guest some more.\" With her own gleam in the eye, the dark muckberry nodded and motioned those waking up to follow her. As they slowly slime off through the trees at the edge, the male led you with his feet back into your tent. \"So...you...*yawn* like that huh? Well here.\" You could feel sloshing as the entire structure of the foot broke off from the body.  An entire foot to enjoy, what a gift.(-8 MP) \"Nighty *yawn*...\" The muckberry didn't even finish before falling asleep himself. You could feel the blueberry deliciousness coursing through your body, as well as an urge to sleep. However, something in your mind told you to read more of that book you found....it did say something about feet. You make your decision, unaware of what the slime was really doing to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(37/100) MP</span></div></div>",

The hallway was lined with unnatural lights that were definitely not of your world, and signs with symbols unfamiliar to you. The whole way you walked, your gaze shifted between the feet of the aliens to your left and right. Unfortunately, you could only stare so long until you reached your destination. It was less of a room and more of a small box carved into the hallway. There was only enough for a small bed. At least you get that small comfort. The aliens threw you in, and right behind you, a wall of pink light covered the hole. You turned to your captors, stared at them tearfully through the pink glow, and muttered \"F...feet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe masculine alien chuckled while wiggling his toes. \"Fear not, human. You will definitely have further exposure to these so-called 'feet.' Your mind is easily broken, which a strong trait to have in a test subject.

Rejected......he didn't want you to worship his feet....you weren't worthy. Tears begin to well up in your eyes as you curl into a little ball of sadness. All you wanted was to worship his feet, to show him you understood your place. How monsters were above...no....just because they did have beautiful feet didn't mean they were immediately superior. Maybe his weren't even that good! (+10 MP) Oh who were you kidding, his feet were wonderful and filthy. But there were monsters elsewhere with bigger, better, more sweaty feet than that bat ever would. He did have a point though, beautiful feet didn't mean instant superiority.....or did it? Your messed up mind couldn't quite decide, but the important thing was that you were going to keep on trucking till....something happened. Taking your torch and rod, you continued on your journey through the dark caverns. As you walked along the rather linear pathway, your eyes wandered about the walls and began to notice a change in the rock. Most of what was behind you was natural and randomly shaped out, but this new tunnel was slightly more thought out and streamlined. As the walls continued to grow smoother, you began to accept that something dug out this way. No doubt it was some kind of monster, probably digging it out piece by piece with every part of thier body. Your thoughts began to drift as you imagined moles digging through. Thier bodies covered in dirt and sweat over thier hard work, lifting thier feet to check the damage. But there would be no damage, just a clawed foot begging to be cleaned by an inferior....like...you?  A glimmer of light broke you from your fantasy and your eyes gazed upon the wondrous sight before you. Rubies, sapphires and so many gems and minerals all hitting from the walls of the great expanse before you. The sounds of water echoed about, leading you to believe this was some kind of spring/grotto. As you walked through the enchanting field, you began to notice how some of theze crystals seemed to give off some sort of glow. An odd pulsing of light that couldn't be entirely ignored. It didn't help that they almost looked like...feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMP: 50/100</span></div></div>",

Instead, you're met with deafening silence. He glances to the rod embedded into his shoulder, then back to you, and sarcastically rolls his eyes.

Alright, my turn!\" Before he can act, you try to remove your weapon from the slime boy's body, but it's no use!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slime boy grabs ahold of you and pulls you closer in.

You pull and you pull, and miraculously, you free yourself! However, you stumble away and clumsily fall to your back. The slime boy, having predicted your fall, almost instantly plants a slimy, smelly foot on your chest! Already, his cock is back in his hand, and he continues stroking away.

You bite your lip as the slime stimulates your nipples, rubbing, squeezing, and vibrating against them. (-5 MP) Meanwhile, his toes stretch forward, growing a few inches in length, so they can tease your face without the slime having to move his entire foot. They rub across your face, leaving trails of malodorous slime spread across your face; he cups his toes around your mouth and nose, forcing you to breathe in the scent of his feet; he prods at your mouth with his toes, hoping to pry it open, but you have it sealed shut... for now. The whole assault is dizzying, he's trying every trick in the book to get you to submit to his feet... and it could be working.

Looking left and right revealed that more structures lined the area, giving the impression you were about to cross the border. Sure enough, one last sign stood in from of you. There was the same blood as before, but this sign seemed to have been vandalised with what was no doubt foot gunk.

In addition, compared to other classes the paladin class has one of the most restrictive codes of conduct in their single-mindedness and utter devotion to good. Paladin characters are expected to demonstrate and embody goodness, lest they want to offend the god they serve. they are beloved by all for their heroism and devotion to good, and as such often receive discounts at shops and taverns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Dark Knight</b><br>\r\nThe Dark Knight is a stark contrast to the Paladin. They refuse to follow the strict code of honor that the paladins follow, and as such their fighting style often includes using dirty tricks such as taunting the enemy or using illusion magic to gain an unfair advantage. Even through Dark knights aren't always a-moral thieves and marauders they are often treated as such due to not following the code of honor mentioned before.

You, as a prime woman in a small village, set out with merely an old rod that was gifted to her by the village priestess, and a backpack with enough food to last you to the next town where you'll have to buy some more, conveniently only possessing enough to purchase as much as well. Why leave a perfectly comfortable life, with the man of your choosing in your small home village? When you were at the age of 10, a small stealthy raid carried out by a local marauding tribe of weak goblins, orcs and trolls that only possessed the strength to attack helpless targets such as your home, kidnapped your mother and murdered your father in his sleep. They made off with a small fortune from your house too. This left you with a bitter resentment and hatred of the monsters, more than just the mere fear of your fellow kin. You weren't scared of them, you were furious at them, and you wanted to get them back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n11 years later, back to the present, you take in a deep breath while clutching your rod, packing it away in a neat pocket over your shoulder, you wave good bye to the priestess and began your journey along the trail into the hilly plains and light forest area. It'd be at least 2 or 3 days worth of travel before you could reach the town of Baxton. It was the local centre of trade, all the farmers from the local villages hauled their harvest to Baxton to sell and buy their goods. Officially, the town had outlawed monsters and set an eye raising bounty on the capture of, or the killing of any monsters, but in reality the human underground had a deal with a fair few of the various tribes in the area to smuggle monsters in to allow them to do their kidnapping, stealing and other unsavoury activities. It was your goal to attempt to seek employment, or at least, training from the town's guard so you can start pushing back against these beasts. The first challenge would be convincing them to even consider your offer however, as naturally they wouldn't let a woman into their barracks if they weren't a prostitute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">Turning your thoughts away from what you set out to do however, as you do have a few days alone to just think things through, you spot a nice looking, solitary tree at the top of a smallish hill just off your path. It's still fairly light, and you wager that you have an hour or two before you even need to think of setting up camp for the night. On one hand, if you continue then obviously you won't have to worry about walking extra distance tomorrow to cover for what you're losing now, but on the other hand, you may not find a more favourable place to stay for the night. It'd be horrible if you were attacked and kidnapped on the first night of your quest! What is the best course of action?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMP: 100</span></div></div>",

Taking a step back, you reach up with your one hand to grab your rod and the goblin immediately raises his own hands to try and calm you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"W-woah, woah there ma'am, I didn't mean to startle you! I'm merely a travelling merchant\"</span> He exclaims in a surprisingly.. well, let's just say intelligent tone. You lower your hand back down to your side and calm yourself, nodding. You had heard stories of lone goblins who weren't part of any raiding parties, ones who were far, far more intelligent compared to the vast majority of their brethren. Sometimes, they were friendly, attempting to integrate with which ever human society that would let them. Other times, they pretended to be friendly to achieve the same goal that most monsters were known for. These smarter goblins did have one advantage over most though, and that was their highly, <b>highly</b> addictive semen. One drop accidentally swallowed, even if it were mixed in with powerful alcohol, caused the victim to have an intense, insatiable desire for it. It was time to figure out whether this one was one of those, or merely what he claimed to be, a merchant. Though, regardless of the answer, it seemed like he wasn't much of a threat. He possessed no weapon that you could see, and he hardly looked like he could throw a punch that'd be more painful than walking your leg into a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Alright, alright, I'm sorry. Don't try anything funny though.\"</span> You reply in a hostile tone. You took a good look at him up and down. His skin was light grey, the only clothes he wore was a cloth wrapped around his waist and though he was small, he definitely looked well fed. Perhaps he was a wealthy merchant, or simply had a good meal recently. He had a long nose and fairly pointy ears which didn't really make his face look all that appealing, by human standards at least. His feet though, they were pretty big! Definitely bigger than most human's, they were more than double the size of yours, and pretty.. soft looking too. Standing up straight, keeping at least two metres or so distance between him and you, you wait for him to reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Like I said ma'am, I'm merely a travelling merchant! After getting harassed by patrolling guards from Baxton, I turned around and decided to seek out friendlier settlements. Would you ah.. know of any? Pardon me, but you don't seem like you have travelled very far just yet. Perhaps you could point me to where you have just come from?\"</span> He replied, seeming a bit more cautious now himself. That at least told you that he wasn't interested in aggravating you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"I uh.. Uh yeah, but it'll take half a day at least, and the road at night isn't really that safe\"</span> You say back, calming yourself more and laying off your hostile attitude. Sure, you absolutely despised monsters and wanted to see them burn, but you've never met ones like these. Perhaps he is to be given a chance?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding slowly, the goblin casts a look down the road behind you, then around as well. He remained silent for an uncomfortable moment before replying yet again.<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Thank you, ma'am. If that is the case, then perhaps.. we should camp together? That tree there looks like an excellent spot. I'm merely offering because we'd be safer together, but if you do not wish for someone like me to keep you company, then I'll be on my way.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis offer made you twitch you head a bit, you were about to exclaim 'no' before you thought about it. He had a point! Besides, he has been friendly so far despite you being rude to him.</span></div></div>",

Mine is Emily\"</span> You say after he caught up with you, in a noticeably more friendly tone. He smiled at this when you weren't looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Bogwart. A name of my own choosing, as the one given to me by my people was.. well, let's just say, ungraceful. Glad to have met you, Emily.\"</span> He lost his smile a small bit, but still, appeared pleased. When the two of you approached the tree, you began gathering kindle for a fire before he shook his head frantically at you. Surprised, you cocked your head and listened<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"No, no! That would be like a beacon, telling every possible raider around that we're here. It's fine, we won't get cold and I have food already\"</span> He said. Already, that made him trust you more, and it wasn't the offering of food, though of course that was nice! <span class=\"chotpink\">\"Oh! Oh, okay. Well, if you insist. Thank you for the food, but I have my own already. I'm a picky eater\"</span> You explain, gently throwing away the kindle before setting yourself down against the tree, Bogwart getting his creature to lay down opposite you while he leaned against it. From then on, the two of you chatted about many, many things, ranging from Bogwart being exiled and making his own living to what the two of you wanted to do. It seemed his dream was to open a large business one day to sell clothes made from exotic materials!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring all of this, you found your eyes being unnaturally drawn to his extended feet. One was pressed to the ground so you could only see the tops, while the other had it's sole directly pointed at you. They were slightly dirty and dusty, but still, unusually <b><i>enjoyable</i></b> to look at! (-10 MP) You tried to shake your gaze away, forcing yourself to stare at Bogwart's face, though that obviously didn't work, forcing yourself to look around at your environment but it all always ended the same - with you staring at his feet. Was he doing this, or was something inside of you compelling you to look? Why were you even looking, what was it that you wanted to do to them!? (-15 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBogwart saw you struggling, but made an effort to not react to it. <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">His plan was working.</font> <span class=\"clred\">\"Which brings me to my final point - the simple cloth and wool from this continent is appalling to make clothing with. It's simply appalling! I mean, that's why I don't even bother with shoes! Luckily, us goblins have feet that are far better for going bare than humans, even if they identically looking.\"</span> He finished off, making you snap out of your trance<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Wh-wha? Oh, yes! Absolutely. Appalling, totally appalling...\"</span> You stutter and trail off, clearly showing that you weren't listening. The two of you shared a smile, his a knowing one while yours guilty. <span class=\"chotpink\">\"Okay I promise I was listening at least a <i>little!</i>\"</span> You laugh before he waved his hand at you dismissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Worry not, Emily! It is merely the company, and perhaps the chance to talk freely that is enjoyable. I do not expect you to take interest in my passions, very few do. But, it is late now, and I do not wish to wake up after sunrise, so I'll be going to sleep.\"</span> He replied back in a comforting tone, finishing off with a yawn. <span class=\"clred\">\"I wish you the best of luck on your watch. Feel free to wake me if you need anything of me\"</span> Bogwart finished off before merely stretching his arms and feet out, rolling over and pressing his head against the belly of his creature and passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was that! You were to take the first watch of a few hours, and then wake him so that he could take his. It had been right to trust him after all, then. You'd even go so far as to say you enjoyed his company. Still though, as you survey the area idly, looking for movement or any signs of a raid, it becomes clear that the night is as calm as ever. The worst thing that could happen is that a stray rabbit wanders into your camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the minutes pass by, your eyes keep on getting lured into the same trap, staring at his exposed soles and toes. Why were they so smooth looking? So.. so.. <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">kissable?</font></span> (-10 MP) This had to stop, you couldn't keep on staring. Clearly something inside of you was wrong, or he was working some sort of magic. You should just sit on the other side of the tree to shield yourself from the sight of his feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand however, he was asleep, and clearly, totally unaware. He wouldn't even notice it if you just.. just sneaked over and took a closer look, right? <br>\r\nMP: 65/100</span></div></div>",

Breathing a bit heavily, the goblin seemed to be in deep sleep already, so you figured you were safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking in a deep breath, you lean over and examine his dusty, dirty, yet smooth and elegant soles up close. It was totally different from the rest of him, his feet were amazing! Bogwart seemed like a normal goblin in his appearance everywhere, except for his feet. They were well cared for, and just had that right look. Something inside of your stirred (-15 MP). You don't know how long your face was mere inches away from his soles, just staring and admiring away, idly taking in his foot scent which didn't seem that bad at first, but clearly was having an effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes, maybe even hours went by before you did something else. You cursed yourself for doing this, but, just like before, you couldn't help but give in to your urges. You pursed your lips, closed your eyes, and pressed a kiss to the middle of his sole on his right foot. Everything inside of you tingled with joy as your lips made contact, and when they left his sole, leaving a *smack* sound, you were left with a longing for more! You had to do it again!(-20 MP) Before you could contemplate your situation however, a voice spoke up. It was Bogwart's!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Good girl\"</span> He said in a soft tone, causing you to pull back in surprise, scurrying back to your spot by the tree. He shifted a bit and turned over, grinning with glee at you. <span class=\"chotpink\">\"I- Wha.. Don't call me that!\"</span> You reply indignantly, stuttering for a response. He just laughed at you. <span class=\"clred\">\"Why not, human? Clearly, you know your place already, so that makes you a good girl.\"</span> He cooed out teasingly. He didn't make any movements, but he was definitely showing his feet off a lot more, causing you to stare downwards as per usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"I had my suspicions as we spoke, but decided to give you the benefit of the doubt. You did, after all, give me a chance, so I decided to give you one, and this is how you spend it. Not that I'm complaining. I'm not even forcing you, or convincing you otherwise, you did this all on your own!\"</span> Bogwart reasoned, not really giving you room to reply. <span class=\"clred\">\"You're too embarrassed, too tense, little Emily! Relax. It's us two. If you wish to admit your inferiority and worship me as your superior through my feet, then go ahead. We can even make it our little arrangement if you so wish, but that will have strings attached of course. Don't answer that question just yet, you need to think on it! But, while you do, why don't you just contemplate what you have to gain?\"</span> Bogwart explained further, making you think more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was right in all his points. He never forced you, you did this on your own! You kissed his feet, you brought this upon yourself, and now he was offering you something that perhaps was the best possible outcome? Still though, this was disgraceful. You could never truly commit to your quest if you accepted this. Bogwart saw the struggle inside of your head and smiled more. He was pleased that you didn't merely have another outburst immediately. Perhaps he knew that you were his already?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"I know your desires, Emily. Go on. Kiss my feet, call me Master Bogwart, admit that I'm better than you, that you belong beneath me. I know it to be a fact, you merely need to accept it yourself.\"</span> He pushed further. As if to emphasise his point of him being better, he stood up, took a few cautious steps to stand right in front of you and loomed over you, his feet on the ground right in front of you while his face was above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMP: 30/100 </span></div></div>",

It's hopeless to try and help them, you can only spare them a beating. But as you creep past them, something catches you off guard. A zombie you hadn't noticed stumbles out in front of you, and you freeze. He still doesn't notice you, but at this distance the raw stink of his feet is palpable even past your bandanna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-5 MP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cranes his head towards the misty sky, sniffs around a bit, then staggers off, allowing you to move on. You sneak onward, following the noise in the distance. You reach what seems to be the center of the cemetery, where a large mausoleum sits. Your eyes are immediately drawn to the enormous stone door, which has been moved aside leaving the crypt wide open. But as you approach it, you hear that same, bizarre rustling noise behind you in the trees. Is the creature you seek hiding in the crypt, or did it escape from it? Then again, perhaps the noise you were following was a dead end? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(MP 90/100)</span></div></div>",

Your testimony may have saved the girl from a horrible fate.\" You get up and gather your armour, demanding a servant pack me food, a tent and supplies! You know the monsters that took them. They had to be the sugary savages from no other mountain...but Candy Mountain!

He had hypothesised that the hypnotic effects of monster boy feet were caused by a foul-smelling and volatile substance secreted from between their toes; a substance which, if there was any truth to the rumours of adventurers falling into a trance after mere seconds of exposure to an elf's soles, should be found in high concentrations in their sweat. Sadly, from what Dr. Kai could piece together, elves would only sweat voluntarily. This meant that, if he wanted to get any decent sample, he would have to bring a live elf to his laboratory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this was easier said than done... on one hand, elves weren't exactly hard to find - unlike most races of monster boys, elves were social beings who could live for thousands of years, seldom leaving their giant tree-cities. This meant that, once founded, elven colonies would rarely be abandoned. And fortunately for Dr. Kai, there was one such colony only a few miles north of his town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, hunting down an elf, particularly in his natural habitat, was a dangerous proposition. Besides the aforementioned allure of elven feet, elves had an innate connection with the forest and its dwellers. Their cunning and agility was unmatched in all of the known races. Even with the help of experienced mercenaries, capturing an elf was a tall order indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the same traits which made elves dangerous foes in their home country, also caused some of them to leave the forest and integrate the upper echelons on the Monster King's militia, as frightfully pungent warriors and generals. There were reports that an army of beast boys led by a elven marshwarden would soon pass by Dr. Kai's region on their way to besiege Antiuck. Assaulting the general's guard would require even more hired swords, but at least they would be fighting in roughly equal terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaand there was one last option... although the monster slavers would mostly trade in (more or less) foot-obsessed human beings, they would just as frequently sell other monster boys and girls. There was a good chance that if Dr. Kai were to infiltrate a monstrous slave market, he would be able to find a suitable subject for his experiments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those options in mind, Dr. Kai got busy planning the historically unprecedented capture of a living, breathing, stinking elf...</span></div></div>",

And even if they captured a general, monster forces would be on them to destroy the experiment. Dr.Kai decided that buying an elf would be the safest bet, and probably cheaper than mercenaries anyway, covered by the cost of his benefactor. He was a aware of a monster slave market a few miles south in a large cave. And, the crafty wizard could cast a spell of mirage on himself to make his appearance more monstrous! It seemed perfect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKai had decided to take on the appearance of an Orc, they were common enough to be seen as normal but threatening enough to be left alone by anyone with ill intent. Once the spell was cast and money was collected, the mage began the southern walk to the cave, trying to keep to himself and not arouse any suspicion. The cave itself reeked of monsters, enough the make the doctor cough the moment he approached the gaping maw of the cave. (-1 mp). He entered, the initial muddy path breaking into the interior proper, a makeshift market lit by bug filled lanterns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHundreds of humans were being sold, glazed looks on their eyes for most, a minority looked frightened by their surroundings, and monsters hungrily eyed them and attached chains to their new purchases. Other stalls held magics and artifacts of power that Kai had never seen or heard about before! The other stalls seemed trivial, to him at least. The footwear peddlers always had customers eager to buy, it seemed, and so did monsters shilling out strange devices made to torture feckless humans.</span></div></div>",

The prospect of learning more about those dark and forbidden arts had him immediately enthralled. Completely forgetting his mission, Kai happily wandered off into the sea of magical stalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne merchant in particular caught his attention. It was a tall, red-skinned lizardman, whose hissing voice stood out from the rest of the yelling salesmen: \"Ringssss of Tracking! Orbssss of Confusion! Chainssss of Sssubmission! Unleash your true foot ssscent with our patented Troll Ssspice perfume... fine Landrakkian craftssssmanship! Quality productsss at affordable pricesss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLandrakkian? Could it be true?! Kai pushed his way through the crowd, an easy task when he disguised as an orc, and arrived at the lizardman's stall. He looked at the elegant, horned figure before him, and he could barely believe what he was seeing: a true, breathing landrake! He had only heard of the dragon-human hybrid in legends, he had never presumed them to be real! A humanoid creature combining the inborn magical skills of a drake with the shrewd industriousness of mankind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What an honour, sir!\" Kai mumbled to the merchant, vigorously shaking his hand, clearly not realising how strange his behaviour was for a supposed monster boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thank you, my dear gentleman...\" the landrake muttered in response, trying to be polite. \"Feel free to browse my waressss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Kai's gaze was suddenly torn from the biological miracle before him, and to a table which was filled with most various and wonderful trinkets he had ever seen. Simple pieces of jewellery and orbs, clearly imbued with powerful dragon enchantments, and complex machines whose function he could only guess was to help destroy human minds and bind them to the will of their new masters... books, potions, weapons... it was hard to pick one mysterious item to bring home. Because, of course, it was only fair he bought something to support such an endangered species...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMP: 99/100</span></div></div>",

For as long as she could remember, monstrous being plagued the lands of Hyrule and it's people. These monsters however seemed to have a rather odd fascination with feet and an even worse habit of dominating others with them. Of course the Zora' s and a few other civilization didn't have too much trouble when they themselves weren't truly human. However, it was for that same reason that the Hyailns became more and more isolated. After years of near quiet, Princess Zelda had reached out to the Queen and therefore herself with the claim she had a way to end this madness. The problem itself being that Ruto' s mother would not be able to make the journey and so the trip was upon the princesses shoulders. Sure she had been outside before, but she really only stayed to the rivers and even then barely left the domain of her subjects. As Ruto stayed in thought, she was unaware of what was watching her in the darkness. She finally did become aware when the most rancid oder assaulted her nose. \"Oh disgusting.

        "created":1481597040,
        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This is a pseudo-spinoff of my other interactive story, Monster Girl Feet. Check it out here: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/2097160-Monster-Girl-Feet\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/2097160-Monster-Girl-Feet</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to demand, I've decided to write a story about monster boys. Not just any monster boys, mind you, ones who love to fight humans and tease and humiliate them with their feet! You can choose to be a boy or a girl, or a character from a different series (i.e. Naruto, Hunter x Hunter, Avatar, etc). Also, instead of having a pre-decided age and backstory for the main characters, you can choose one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, calato gave me the excellent idea of using an RPG-ish system. Characters have MP, gold, and an inventory. The MP stands for mind points, and as they're attacked/teased by a monster boy's feet, their MP drops, and they slowly start enjoying being dominated by the monster boy's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hero will have 100 MP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy did I choose 100 mind points? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause I want the hero to start to think differently as he loses MP. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he/she loses 1/4 of his MP or more (75 MP remaining or less), he/she'll realize monster boy's feet (cute monsters' feet) are not bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he/she loses 1/2 of his MP or more (50 MP remaining or less), he/she'll literally LOVE cute monsters' feet and will start to like uglier monsters' feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he/she loses 3/4 of his MP or more (25 MP remaining or less), then he/she'll love cute monsters' feet even more and will also love uglier monsters' feet a lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf his/her MP reach 0 then ... asolute slavery for all possible monsters' feet no matter who they're are ... only a miracle can save him/her from eternal foot slavery ^^.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About the battle system, I thought of something like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nif our hero attacks, her basc attack is 1 + 1 for a her steel rod. Which means she will deal 2 dmgs. If the enemy has an armor of 0 he'll take 2 dmgs, if his armor is 1 he'll reduce dmg by 1 and will receive only 1 dmg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSame goes for her: but since she has basic clothes her armor should be 0 so she'll receive maybe 5 dmgs from the goblin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRULES:<br>\r\n-<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">No female feet. I made another story for that, remember? :P</span> (ADDENDUM: After thinking about just how much I like both, and how making a  \"Monster Girl + Boy Feet\" would be a needless split, I've decided to allow SOME female feet involved. HOWEVER, monster boy feet are to always be at the front and center, and a scene cannot feature female feet without also having a strong focus on male feet. For example, a scene where a monster boy and his monster girl mate both use their stinky feet to enslave an adventurer would be okay. A scene where that monster girl dominates with no input from her mate is unacceptable. If this rule serves to be particularly controversial, I will strike it down immediately.
