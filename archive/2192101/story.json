Thanks dad!\" Your mother places a plate of food In front of you. \"So how does it feel being 13 now jake?\" You stop your self from the scoop of scrambled eggs on your fork. \"It feels great mom! I'm no longer a kid, and I'm a teen now.\" You say feeling proud of yourself. \"Your right kiddo\" your dad says \"and that means you now hove bigger responsibilities. Like maybe a certain gift your getting today.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep today you sure are getting a big responsibility. Just last week, a little stable was built on your property for a horse. A horse you are getting for your birthday present! So after breakfast your parents blind fold you, and bring you out to the stables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three... Two... One... Happy birthday!\" Your parents say ripping off your blind fold. You expect to see a awesome horse in front of you, but instead. It's standing. On two legs! \"What is this!\" You yell. Your dad laughs. \"Haha. Didn't expect us to do such a great job son. And I know what your thinking, but getting a pure breed was a little out of our price range, but I'm sure you won't mind a Shire mixed with a Clydesdale. Anyways. We will leave you two to get acquainted. See ya later.\" He says leaving with your mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it's just you and this big anthro horse standing in front of you. You eventually speak up. \"S...so can you talk like people?\" You ask. The mare just rolls her eyes \"of course I can, but it seems like no one cares. I mean your parents just saw me as a regular horse. Even though I was labeled anthro.\" she sits down on a fresh hay bail. \"But at least you seem to want to talk with me, so I guess I got lucky.\" Feeling a little bad for this horse, you decide to sit down beside her. \"Don't be so upset. You can still have fun here. My parents got you as more of a pet for me. So your not going to have to do any hard work.\" You say patting her back. She smiles a little and says. \"ya I guess. The other guy who wanted to buy me was gonna have my pulling farm equipment.\" \"See\" you say \"now do you want to do anything? Like go for a walk, or just sit here and talk?\" She thinks about it for a second...</span></div></div>",

You both get up and head out the door. \"I know a great trail around out property. Just follow me.\" You say leading the mare to the trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later you both were walking this path in the woods, making small talk. \"So what was you name again?\" You ask \"it's Charlie. And yours is jake right?\" She asked in return. \"Ya it is.\" You say. As your walking you start to take in the feature of this horse. She is about 7 feet tall, has at least DD breasts, and as you start to fall behind her a little, you notice her big firm ass! You feel guilty to stare, but her body is so intriguing, that you can't help yourself. To take you mind off her body, you ask another question. \"So what kinda food do you eat Charlie?\" She just shrugs. \"They've been feeding me the regular horse stuff for years. So things like oats, hey, carrots. It gets kinda bland after a while.\" You say to her. \"Don't worry. Maybe I can sneak off some house food for ya.\" Charlie give a little smile. \"Thanks jake, that's very kind of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both continue walking for a bit, until you notice her tail raise wile your walking. Your wondering what's happening, with her anus now exposed. Then suddenly *PPPPPFFFFfffffffffeeeeeerrrrrrtttttt* you were engulfed in a cloud of gas. You coughed a few times, and Charlie says. \"Watch out, if your gonna walk behind me, beware of my gas\" your cough a few more times. \"*cough* now you tell me *cough*\" Charlie just giggles at your situation. That's until.</span></div></div>",

At the old farm, they had spcial toilets for us anthros. Kinda like big human toilets.\" You feel bad for her now, considering your parents never accounted for a anthro toilet. \"Im sorry. But we dont have any toilets for anthros here, we built the stable in mind for a regular horse.\" Chester just lets out a big sigh. \"I guess ill have to go out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Chester step off to the side of the path, and crouch behind a bush. \"You know, you should give a lady a little privacy when shes doing her business.\" She says with a angry tone as your crouched two feet in front of her. To your defense you say. \"Well ive seen regular horses poop before. I dont see how this is any difrent.\" She seems kinda angry with your logic. \"Well for 1. I have a human level of intelligence, and 2. I walk on two... *PPPPPfffeerrrrtt* oh fuck it. If you want to stay, just dont complane about the smell.\" She then lets out a sigh of relief as she loosened her anus, and let the massive log inside her intestines slip out. You look down and see the head of the turd slowly making its way to the ground below. At first you just thought of Chester pooping would be like any other horse, but you were wrong. Now that you think of it, she is much closer to a human than a horse, and youve never seen another human poop before! You watch as the first log breaks off under its own weight and hits the grass with a loud thud. Your eyes then focus on the next section of the log thats making its way out. Yor so fixated on watching Chester poop, you hardly notice her talking to you. \"Wait, was that?\" You say shaking your mind. \"I said, do you like watching me poop?\" She said pointing to a third log making its way out. You blush and try to avoid looking at her face. \"Im sorry. I.. i didnt think i would find it interesting. But... now that i look, its bring up all these wird feeling. Like... Like its so forbidden to see another person poop. I though it would be no big deal like seeing a dog, or a cow, or even another horse poop, but you were right, this is way difrent!\" Chester just smiles and laughs. \"Hahahaha omg, you thought it would be no big deal watching me poop, and now you have a fetish for watching people take a dump! I bet next time youll listen when i say somthing.\" Your just left blushing, and silent as you cover your face with your hands, but still watching through the gaps of your fingers as you see Chester build a pile under her ass that looks like it was made by a non anthro horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the last nugget falls on the pile below. Chester grabs your hands and pulls them away from your face, and she tilts your head up to talk to you face to face. \"Jake. Im sorry for being a bitch when i had to go earlier. Thats becaus i had to go, and ive never had to go in front of anyone befor, and you can under stand why to respect a woman's privacy right?\" She asked in a stern tone. You nodded to what she said. \"Good. So from now on, if i ask you not to look, or go away, youll respect that. As for your new intrests in woman going to the bathroom. I will show you some respect, and i wont tell your parents.\" Its a little hard for you to get a word out, but eventually manage to say. \"So... so your not mad that i like watching you poop?\" She just smiles \"of course not, but if im going to cater to your needs, im going to need a few favors in exchange. Now, what should we do now?\" She askes.</span></div></div>",

Though it's a nice day maybe it's time to give up, and head back to the camp. Oh well there's always tomorrow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As your walking back, you can't believe your luck! You see a pair of antlers sticking out from a bush! You shoulder your rifle, and calm your self down. It's now a waiting game for the buck to expose its self, but that would be short lived, as something strikes you on the back of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour laying face down on the ground and you feel your rifle taken from your hands. \"Hey sis! I got him! You can put down those shed antlers.\" You hear the attacker yell above you. You look up and are shocked by what you see! You see a human like deer run out from behind the bush. This can't be real, can it? The other doe runs over and puts her knee in your back as you scream out in pain \"Ahhhhh what the fuck is this!?!?\" The other doe holding your rifle lifts up your face and looks you in the eye. \"This is revenge! I've seen lots of people like you kill our kind. It's now pay back time.\" She says with a evil grin, suddenly the other doe flips you over and cuts off your clothes after a bit of struggling, but eventually your left naked and defenseless on the forest floor. The first doe says to you \"I'm Kayla, and this is my sister Lora, and were gonna make sure you never want to hunt again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey start moving close to you as you back to a tree stump in fear.

Beer in one hand, and a plate of nachos In front of you, And of course your local team is loosing! \"Oh come on! He wasn't even off side! That ref is stupid.\" You shout at the TV. \"Man, I need something to take my mind off this dumb game. If only the author would add something interesting.\" Suddenly you hear a sound of a trash can tipping over. 'Fucking raccoons agian' you think to your self. You get up, and grab your .22 rifle and set out to deal with the trash thieves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get outside, your met with a light night rain. you see the trash can tipped over, but the garbage bag is still intact. 'This is very strange' you think. Then out of the corner of your eye you notice the shed door was open slightly. Walking over you can hear crying inside. \"What the hell?\" You say to your self. Then you open up the door and flick on the lights, and say \"what the hell are you doping in here!\" Suddenly a black and white lump in the corner sits up, still crying \"I'm.. Im sorry mister, my last owner kicked me out, and, and I had no place to go, and I needed shelter.\" The dog says trying to hold back some tears. You lower your rifle, and you feel pretty bad for this border collie. \"Hey don't cry, it's ok\" you say trying to comfort her. \"Do you want to come inside? It's warm, and there's food.\" She takes a deep breath to calm herself. \"Are... Are you sure?\" She says. You reach out a hand to lift her up. \"Yes I'm sure. It would be cruel not to.\" She takes your hand, and you lead her inside<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, you grab a towel and dry her off. Starting at her head, and going down to the feet. \"There we go. All dry!\" You say as you throw the towel aside. \"Now let's go the living room, you can help yourself to all the nachos on the plate\" you say leading her to the living room. As soon as you enter. The border collie drops to he knees, and starts eating all the nachos on the coffee table. With tears in her she looks at you and says. \"I'm sorry, I'm just so hungry. And these taste so good!\" You laugh a little and say. \"Don't worry, just eat till you feel better. I'll go and fix anther plate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou come back in to see the dog licking the plate clean. \"I take it you like my microwave skills eh\" she stops licking \"ya it's the best food I've had in days!\" You place the next plate in front of her, and watch her chow down. \"So what's you name?\" You ask the dog. She swallows her moth full. \"I'm Jessica, and you are?\" \"I'm Hayden\" you say. \"So why did your last owner kick you out?\" Jessica stops eating and looks down. \"I can be very gassy at times, and he did not like it. A few days ago he got a but plug to keep my gas in, and he told me not to remove it. It was in for about 3 days, until I couldn't hold it anymore, and my poop forced the plug out, it landed on the carpet with the rest of my load. He got very mad and chased me out of the house, screaming to never come back.\" You feel bad for what this dog had to go threw. \"Don't worry. I'll never make you do something like that. Your old owner was a bad person.\" Jessica stand up, and gives you a hug. \"Think you. Your the kindest person I know.\" After she lets you go from the hug, what happens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your mother passed away due to complications, and your father not mentally, or financially prepared to raise you alone, made the difficult decision to give you up for adoption. Your mothers death was hard on your father, but he eventually found peace with it, and remarried to a wonderful woman. As for you, you were ready for adoption in 3 months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow normally for an adoption, they select anthro babies for anthro parents, and human babies for human parents, but its not a set rule, and when your new mother saw you. The connection was instant, and strong! Even though she was a husky, and you were a human, but that didnt matter much to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkip forward 16 years, and its the first say of summer break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom, im home!\" You shout out as you throw your back pack into the closet. You walk into kitchen and see your mother. Jannet taking off her apron. \"Hey kade! How was your last day of school?\" She said taking a seat at the kitchen table. You smile and say. \"It was awesome! Very easy things to do, just playing kahoot, watching movies, and at the end of the day, a kid pulled the fire alarm just minutes befor the final bell!\" Your mother looks a little surprised \"what! He really pulled it!?\" \"Haha ya he did, when the school bus left, we saw the police walking with him to the principles office.\" You say also sitting down. \"Oof, just remeber not to do that. I dont want to sit threw a boring lecture by your principal, or a cop.\" She says it a semi joking, yet serous way. \"Dont worry mom. Im not that dumb. Say what type of cookies are you makeing? They smell great!\" Jannet just smiles \"just good old chocolate chip. They will be ready in about 10 minutes.\" \"Sounds great mom, and by the way you said we were going do somthing fun tonight to celebrate the first day of summer break, what were you thinking?\" You ask interested in whats going to happen. Your mother leans forward and says. \"Well. I was thinking of...\"</span></div></div>",

You've already set up your site, built your tent, got the things needed to make a fire, and everything else is good to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sprayed some Bug Spray on yourself to advoid mosquito bites and anything that might try to feast on ya. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around 5 in the evening, so you decided to have a stroll, keeping a flashlight on you in case it gets too dark. You admire the sky of stars to light up the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop however as a strange odor struck your nose, followed by the sound of leaves. You hold your flashlight firmly,<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Who's there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say aloud, as a silowet of a character came into view, it was too dark to tell what it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... h-hello..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure said shyly, by the sound of it, it was a male and he was DEFINITELY the source of the smell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you?\" You ask <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I ask the same thing?\" He responded, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm camping in these woods for the week to clear my mind for a bit\", You stopped for a moment \"Can you come out from there please?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", it responded as it came out from the shrubs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped for a moment, he was a SKUNK! but he can talk and walk like a human, but has no clothes on at all, leaveing his shealth and balls exposed, are you dreaming? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a walking, talking anthropomorphic skunk?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I don't get visitors often around, I didn't think they care about camping\", <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to lighten the mood <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I do, most people don't have the guts to do so\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skunk agreed with you on the statement, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is (Y/N), what's yours?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake hands... paws... whatever the case is here with John. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must head back to my camp now, I'll see you later\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, I'll see you around (Y/N)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to run back to your site, lucky for you, you've made a fire ahead of time to help you find your way back from the dark. The smell of John still haunts your nostrils and the site of his naked body makes you slightly uncomfortable. You shake off the thought though as you put out the fire and went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, you woke up refreshed and better than ever, this was the best idea you've had all your life, but then you smelled that some odor from last night, could it be? Surely not... You covered nose and peaked out of your tent and surprise surprise, you see John eating the leftover food bits on an old bag of peanuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John? Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey (Y/N), I was just eating some breakfast, how'd ya sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, but how did you find me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kinda followed you back last night, I kinda get lonely at night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can stay with me if you want, but ask next time ok? I don't want to find out that all my food went missing and have to leave early\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right sorry\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't really like the smell of John however, was it a good idea to let him stay? He might be of some use, plus you may get used of his scent eventually. You come out of your tent and cleaned up the mess you've made. While you were cleaning up, you can't help but notice that John skunk penis was half erect, what made him horny? You looked away quickly as to not let John see you staring at his cock. After about 20 minutes, you both sat down to talk about things, what should you both talk about?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When you had finished tidying up your campsite and taking a quick inventory, you found John sitting on a length of log you placed near the fire pit. Yesterday you'd rolled it from it's resting spot on the side of the gravel road, probably left there by a park ranger who needed to clear a fallen tree after a storm, and you were hoping that you could take an afternoon and chop all the firewood you could need for the week. Of course, now you had an unexpected guest, and you didn't anticipate needing a second camping chair so for now the timber would have to remain intact. Plus, you thought, considering how bad John smelled from only feet away, anything he sat on for longer than thirty seconds was probably too saturated with his smell to be safely burned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat next to John on the rough bark, trying your best to breathe through your mouth. He had moved on to eating directly from your trash can, and while the scraps of roasted vegetables and mushrooms from last night were by no means rotten the thought of him eating from your garbage was still a bit uncomfortable. You clear your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, John. Where do you live, around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I live here.\" He kept eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, but, where do you <i>live</i>? Like, where do you sleep, usually?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugs. \"Trees, usually. There's a cave nearby that's good if it's raining too hard, but when the weather's nice like this I can sleep anywhere. When it gets cold I den up somewhere, but I won't have to worry about that for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds rough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugs again and finishes off the last of the trash bag with a handful of coffee grounds. \"It's not bad. Besides, this is my home, you know? All this land is just for me.\" He looks over at you and continues. \"And guests, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're taken back a little bit by that last comment. You'd felt like you were doing him a favor by letting him stay, but it seems he has the exact opposite opinion; you're on his land, and he's tolerating <i>your</i> presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as if to demonstrate how comfortable he is in your campsite, John raises his tail a bit and blows a long fart against the timber. You struggle not to hold your nose, not eager to offend the mephit, but John barely seems to register your presence. He is a skunk, after all, and you doubt he has very much of a reason to be modest when strutting around his own patch of the forest. You do note, however, that his penis seemed to twitch and swell just a little bit more as he farted. You really hope that was just a coincidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn stands up, stretches, and starts picking around your campsite, examining your setup. As he stands you take a morbidly curious peek at the patch of log where he was sitting, and you can almost see a somewhat darker patch of bark right underneath where he was seated. <br>\r\nThe skunk examines your camping equipment. You came well prepared, covering every emergency situation you could think of so you wouldn't have to cut your vacation short, and so he has plenty to sift through. He has questions about some of your less common pieces of kit (although he thankfully overlooks your food storage) and the two of you share some pleasant chatter while he absolutely rips ass all through your campsite. Despite the morning breeze blowing through the pines, his stench seems to cling the ground like a dense fog, not able to obscure your vision, but certainly enough to keep your from smelling anything but his funk. After briefly trying to balance on your gear-laden mountain bike (and, to your chagrin, leaving a dark brown smear on the seat) he finally gets to your tent. Without even thinking to ask your permission, he fumbles with the zipper and starts to force the tent flap open. You panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, that's my tent!\" you half-shout, balancing your need to stay on this skunk's good graces with your desire to not be huffing his residual fumes for the next five nights. He pauses, and turns back at you inquisitively. Your mind races to think of a lie. \"I just... uh... be careful not to break the zipper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods, and (carefully) squirms his way into the tent. Your heart drops, and you follow him inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter struggling with the newly-jammed zipper for thirty seconds, you sigh and crawl in through the same small flap John entered through. The nylon has enough stretch to allow you to make it in, even with the newly-jammed zipper keeping the entrance tight, but you didn't have much room to maneuver. You squirm and crawl, and pull your legs in behind you, before triumphantly rolling over, lifting up\u2026 and very nearly bumping nose-first into John's inky black tail hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In a panic you freeze, and breathe in sharply - a costly mistake. You're not sure he even farted, but the raw power of John's stench sears itself into your brain. You throw yourself backwards, clasp your hands over your mouth and try very, very hard not to gag. Startling a skunk is already a bad idea, but if you make a scene behind a skunk of this size, the smell might never come out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few seconds your senses return, and the skunky, funky air of your tent smells downright floral compared to the concentrated shot of skunk butt you just inhaled. You look back over at John, and see his rear still sticking out of the mouth of your sleeping bag, which he seems to have decided to investigate head-first. After a few more seconds of squirming his tail and legs disappear inside, and his head pops out in their place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is nice!\" he exclaims, wiggling around in your sleeping bag. \"It's really warm. Is this for sleeping?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile politely, and nod. You're not thrilled to have secondhand skunk polluting the one thing keeping you reasonably warm at night, but after the experience you just had, the lingering odor will surely be small peanuts in comparison. He wiggles a bit more, enjoying the texture, and you hear a muffled poot as he settles in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two share the silence of the tent for a few minutes, John resting, half-awake in your sleeping bag and you cross-legged on the tent floor, and you reflect on your trip so far. This chance encounter with John was proving to be a bit more consequential then you thought, but so far you\u2019d managed not to offend him or give him cause for retribution, and he\u2019s given you someone to talk to, despite his rear-end butting into the conversation more than you\u2019d like. The two of you strike a conversation back up, trading some inconsequential chatter about human life versus life in the woods. <br>\r\nYour new conversation is unfortunately short lived, however. In the middle of talking John cuts himself off with a wince and a soft groan, and she shifts uncomfortably on his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d you ask, assuming a tree root or something was poking him in a bad spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really. Just a tummyache. Human food doesn\u2019t always agree with me,\u201d he responds with a slight pain in his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That\u2019s what you get for eating out of my trash!</i>, you think, but you make the wise choice to express some concern. \u201cOh, no. I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re not feeling well. Do you need to step outside?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skunk shakes his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll be fine. Just gotta let it all out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re not entirely sure you understand until you see his eyes close and his tail flag upwards, tenting your sleeping bag behind his rear. Even though the fabric you hear a loud, wet-sounding fart erupt from his backside as he prepares to\u2026 oh, no!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime slows down as your mind conjures an image of John flooding your sleeping back with skunk muck, and your mind goes into overdrive. The farting you could live with, but there was NO way you could salvage the trip if he craps himself inside your sleeping bag! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJOHN!\u201d you shout, surprising both the skunk and yourself with your volume. \u201cCome on, not in my tent! Get out!\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were wrong unfortunately, as you looked at a now very angry skunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to say that again (Y/N)?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice became deeper a tad, this made you worried for a moment.

Take a dump? Listen here (Y/N), I'll have you know that this is MY forest, therefore I'M allowed to do whatever I want, whenever I desire. Your not the boss of me here, so unless you want some trouble, I suggest you shut the fuck up! GOT IT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but here's the t-thing here, this tent is from m-my best friend's cousin and I don't want you to ruined it, otherwise I would have to pay the c-consequence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn eases a little from that statement, but still feels offended in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruin it? As in what? Fart in it? Poop in it? Piss in it? Your concern in not MY problem here, I could SPRAY you and this... whatever you keep calling it.. right now and that woyld be the end of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn is now furious, you can clearly see the log of shit that is halfway out of his anus, there has to be a way to fix this mess. Your afraid to move and you've notice that the smell from John has gotten worse, perhaps his scent gets worse if he's angry. What can you do to help save yourself?</span></div></div>",

You also made sure to get a face mask to prevent getting shit in your mouth and nose because that would probably lead to some health issues and awkward questions from the doctor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made your way over to a desert oasis that Elephants gather around frequently in the day. As you approached you saw no sign of life other than the oasis itself. You looked for a rock a little back from the water and sat beside it facing the lake because an elephant would stand right in front of you with it's back to your face while obliviously drinking water. You decided to relax for a big, and while doing that you drifted into sleep. When you awoke...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: There was a pink ring right in front of your face and a furry tail on top of your head.<br>\r\nB: There was a couple of elephants drinking from the oasis, but none near you. <br>\r\nC: The Oasis was still Baren, you had probably missed them.</span></div></div>",
