He rubbed the cotton from his eyes and saw a canine muzzle.  \"Stop that, Misty,\" he said, thinking his border collie had climbed into bed during the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty?\"  asked Claire's voice, only more guttural and slightly lisping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim's vision came into clarity and he gasped.  \"Oh God.\"  Claire's now had almost fully formed, and as she looked at Jim her long tongue hung out of her mouth. Claire was<br>\r\nchanging into a dog.  The hair on her head had changed completely into black fur. White fur grew up her chest, over her shrinking human breasts and barreling chest, and over the underside of her muzzle.  Black fur was beginning to cover Claire's sides and back, and Jim could see a nearly two-foot tail, tipped with white fur, wagging slowly behind her.  Her ears, with tips of white fur, were on top of her head. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n     Claire was standing awkwardly, on all fours, in front of him and Jim could see that her thighs and calves were much shorter, while her feet were much longer.  Black pads covered the bottom of her feet and the palms of her hands.  Her hands were actually paws now, but her feet still had some time to go.  \"Jim, what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Jim jumped straight out of bed, grabbed his robe and ran out of the room.  Claire<br>\r\nlooked after him, then hopped off the bed.  Expecting she could still stand up straight, she tried to land only on two feet.  She fell over, catching herself on her forepaws.  As she stood again, Claire could only stand on the balls of her feet and had to walk stooped over.  She was precariously over-balanced to the front as she walked carefully after Jim.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jim slides the ring onto his pinky finger. He doesn\u2019t know why, it just seems like the thing to do. Suddenly it starts feeling very hot in the car. Jim reaches over and turns up the AC. Even though it is on high it still does little to cool him of. Jim reaches up, loosens his tie, and undoes the top couple of buttons of his shirt. Beads of sweat begin to form on his forehead and he goes to wipe them off. As his hand travel back he feels his hair. It feels unusually long. \u201cThat\u2019s weird, I just got a hair cut\u201d, he says. Then his chest begins to itch. He reaches his hand in to scratch and says, \u201cDamn, in need to get back to the gym\u201d, after feeling an abundance of soft flesh. He continues to scratch and scraps his nipple, which for some reason has become so sensitive that that scratch causes him to lift of his seat. \u201cShit\u201d, he yells, pulls out his hand, and looks at it. He turns his hand over looking at it in disbelief. It looks slender, soft, and his fingernails have grown out. He then feels a severe pain at his groin and nearly runs off the road. He manages to pull the car over into a nearby parking lot. The pain is blinding, it\u2019s as if someone very large has kicked him in the balls. The pain travels up into stomach as if his guts are being twisted. He doubles up over the steering wheel holding his stomach with his eyes closed. He can hear things literally moving around inside and his bones cracking. The pain then travel through the rest of his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He feels himself starting to blackout and just like that the pain is gone. He sit there a while still hunched over the steering covered in sweat trying to catch his breath. He then opens his eyes and looks up into the mirror. Something catches his eye and he adjusts the mirror to see a young woman\u2019s face staring back, \u201cWhat the hell\u201d, he says and then is alarmed at the sound of his voice which has become high pitched. He looks down to see two large objects under his shirt stretching the fabric threatening to pop off the buttons. Before he can investigate someone knocks on the window. Jim looks over to see a cop. He rolls down the window and says, \u201cCan I help you officer\u201d. \u201cI was going to ask you the same thing miss, I saw you swerve back there\u201d, he answers. He then sees that you\u2019re covered in sweat and asks, \u201cAre feeling ok\u201d. Jim responds, \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t really been feeling myself today officer, but I\u2019m heading home now\u201d. The officer tells him to be careful and walks back to his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jim sits there for a while and then grabs the two large lumps on his chest. \u201cHoly shit, they\u2019re real\u201d, he yells! He then jabs a hand down between his legs and does not find his old friend. \u201cHoly shit, I\u2019m a girl\u201d, he shouts! Jim then jumps out of the car. His now oversized pants nearly fall off. He\u2019s also about eight inches shorter now so the pant\u2019s legs are bunches up around his ankles. He notices that he is in a parking lot of a mall with people all around and suddenly feels very exposed. Jim jumps back in the car and locks the doors.</span></div></div>",

He hears a few footsteps and then the door opens with his daughter holding the door. She looks up the young attractive woman wearing an oversized men\u2019s business suit and asks, \u201cCan I help you with something\u201d? \u201cIt\u2019s me Carrie, your Dad\u201d, Jim blurts out. \u201cRight, the clinic is around the block. Have a nice day\u201d, Carrie answers and goes to shut the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jim quickly puts his foot in the door and shouts, \u201cCarrie, it\u2019s really me. Four your seventh birthday I bought you a teddy bear. You loved that bear and cried when our dog Toby ate it when your were twelve. On your first date you caught me following you when you went to park with Fred Harper. I came and got you when you went to that party when you were seventeen and got drunk and never told your mother. Please Carrie, I need your help\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Carrie opens the door back up with a look of shock. \u201cDad\u201d, she says? Jim pulls out his wallet and shows her his wedding ring, which is loose on his finger. \u201cOk, come in\u201d, Carrie says still in shock. Jim walks in and drops down on the coach. \u201cWhat the, how the, why are you a woman, dad\u201d, Carrie asks while staring at her father. Jim explains the whole things as much as he knows about how he was just driving along and started changing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHoney, you were into all that witchcraft Goth stuff in Jr. High and I paid to send you to Med school I was hoping you could explain it somehow\u201d, Jim says. Carrie shakes her head no and answers, \u201cDad, that witchcraft stuff was just make believe when I was a kid and as for Med school I never heard of someone having a spontaneous sex change let alone growing younger by twenty years\u201d. Jim leans forward with her head in hands. \u201cI can\u2019t go home to your mother looking like this\u201d, he says muffled by his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Carrie sits down beside him throws her arm over his shoulder and says, \u201cLets go to the kitchen and I\u2019ll fix you your favorite drink\u201d. Jim nods his head and gets up with her. Her pants immediately fall to the floor. \u201cWe probably should get you something else to wear to, Dad\u201d, Carrie laughs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim kicks the pants the rest of the way off and follows Carrie to the kitchen. Jim downs a couple of shots of scotch, which begins to calm his nerves. \u201cOk now for the clothes\u201d, Carrie says dragging him to her bedroom. \u201cOk, strip down so I can see what we\u2019re working with\u201d, she says smiling. Jim reluctantly undresses in front of his daughter to her underwear and t-shirt. \u201cAll of it Dad. You don\u2019t have anything that I don\u2019t have\u201d, Carrie orders. \u201cDon\u2019t remind me\u201d, Jim mutters and strips down the rest of the way. \u201cDamn Dad, at least I know where I got my boobs from now you\u2019re as big as me and even perkier\u201d, Carrie remarks. \u201cPlease Carrie I\u2019m having a hard time dealing with this the way it is\u201d, Jim cries. Carrie pulls out a few things and begins to help Jim get dressed. \u201cJesus, how do you girls get used to this thing\u201d, Jim yells tugging at her bra. \u201cJust put the rest of the things I laid out on. They should fit. I\u2019m going to call Mom and tell her you\u2019re helping me move some things. Carrie walks off and Jim finishes getting dressed. She turns around looking at herself in the mirror. \u201cDamn, I am hot\u201d, she mutters looking at the stacked young attractive woman in the mirror.<br>\r\nCarrie comes back in after a few minutes and says, \u201cDad I got a hold of Mom and she bought it. We may be able to stretch it tomorrow, but you\u2019re going to have to tell her. I\u2019ve made plans tonight to go out with some friends that I can\u2019t break. You're welcome to come with us, or you can just hang in the apartment\u201d.</span></div></div>",

Carrie explains while driving to the pub that it\u2019s just going to be a typical night out. Jim isn\u2019t really listening. She\u2019s still trying to take everything in. Carrie arrives at the pub with Jim in tow. It\u2019s a typical twenty something crowd. Jim looks around and begins to remember what it was like to be that age. A quick look in a passing mirror reminds her she is that age again though a different gender this time around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Carrie looks around the pub and spots her friends at one of the cozies. Carrie walks over with Jim close behind. It\u2019s a mixed bunch of girls and guys. Everybody seems pretty nice. \u201cCarrie aren\u2019t you going to introduce us to your friend\u201d, one of the guys asks. Carrie stammers and turns around looking at her father. Jim recovers quickly and answers, \u201cJamie, I\u2019m Carrie\u2019s cousin Jamie\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n They both sit down and the man who introduced himself as Mike buys Jamie a drink. He\u2019s a little surprised though to see a woman drink scotch neat. After a few more drink and trays of pub food Carrie looks at her watch and says, \u201cThe club should be opening soon. We\u2019d better head over and get in line\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jamie gets up and nearly falls right back down. She quickly learns she can\u2019t drink the same way she did as when she was a man named Jim. \u201cShit, I\u2019m already plastered\u201d, Jamie giggles as Carrie and Mike help her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Thankfully the club is not that far away and Jamie recovers somewhat along the way at least enough to walk. The line is still short and they make it up to the door quickly. \u201cID\u201d, orders the large man at the door with no neck. Jamie starts to pull out hers when she realizes her ID is that of a 45year old man. She looks to Carrie with panic in her eyes. \u201cHey, little lady. Do you have ID\u201d, the man asks again? Jim answers\u2026.</span></div></div>",

Look in a mirror lately?\" She walked to the door. \"Seriously Dad, just call if you need anything.\" With that, she left to see her friends, leaving Jim alone, sitting on the couch. \"Now what?\" she mutters, \"I can't go back to work like this!\" She then lays on her back and puts her hands over her eyes. \"This HAS to be a dream!\" However, it is indeed reality. A thought occurred to her as she glanced down at her large breasts, and she went very red. \"No,\" Jim said firmly, \"No no no no NO. Thats just wrong. Sick and wrong.\" But the more she thinks about her chance to see this young lady in all her glory, the more he thinks back to how he was married, had a daughter, and WAS IN HER APARTMENT FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!

One person should never put both rings on at the same time\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Matt leaves the store and starts heading back his apartment to get ready for his date with Kim tonight. As he is driving towards his place he\u2019s admiring the rings. \u201cDamn, I didn\u2019t get them sized. Oh well, maybe they\u2019ll fit anyway\u201d, he says out loud.</span></div></div>",

However once she changed into the fair beauty and married a rich lord the maiden became obsessed with maintaining her beauty. She became obsessed with her new looks more and more every day until one day she know longer remembered her humble beginings. So the moon goddess placed a curse on the band changing its power to only work at night when touched by the moons light. The maiden was then forced to live her life split between beautiful and ugly always at war with herself.\" The shop keep said as he rung up the ring and handed it to Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...wow....that's...uhh...an interesting story...\" Matt said not knowing what to say.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hours later, Matt woke up with a start. He sat up straight in his bed breathing heavily. As he calmed down from what must have been a bad dream, he began to take a look at himself and surroundings. The clock said he had been in bed for 3 hours. He felt warm and had broken out in a sweat. He had felt a little nauseous and slightly dizzy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up slowly and delicately and proceeded to the bathroom halfway down the hall to grab some Tylenol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flipped on the light and was blinded by the brightness. Shielding his eyes, he opened the medicine cabinet and took out two pills. He grabbed the cup by the sink and filled it with water. Soon, he had those two painkillers traveling down to his stomach to hopefully ease his pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he closed the cabinet, he caught a look of himself in the mirror. He was pale and sweaty. He looked very sick. He felt his hands start to shake when he thought he noticed something different. His eyes... no, it couldn't be. But wait, yes, they were green. For as long as he could remember, his eyes had always been brown, day in and day out. However, there was no mistaking it that tonight, his eyes were indeed green in color. He was concentrating so hard on his eyes that he almost missed something else. Looking up, he noticed his hair looked shaggier than usual. That was something he would need to take care of when he felt better. But, as he continued to look at it, it seemed to get even shaggier. Before long, there was no mistaking that his hair was visibly growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, he was very freaked out. Yet it seemed all he could do was continue to watch as his hair slowly covered up his ears and approached his neckline. He had no idea what was going on. He start to run his shaky hands through his growing locks of brown hair. It was now long enough he could pull it in front of his face and look at it. He was focusing on his hair when just beyond it, the mirror seemed to slide up the wall. As he looked around the room, it seemed everything was slowly getting taller. Looking down, he saw the ground was getting closer. He let out a yelp. His voice cracked as he did so, which reminded him of his years going through puberty. Looking back at the mirror, he saw that it was no longer moving. He took this to mean he had stopped shrinking. He was able to gauge that he had lost about 7 inches from height of 6'2\". This made him about 5'6\". Taking a look at his hair again, he saw it had stopped growing at a length just passed his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at his eyes again, when he thought he saw his face change. His cheekbones became more defined. His skin seemed smoother, and his lips looked fuller. Looking down at the rest of his, he saw the muscle he had worked so hard to build, was slowly deteriorating. His hands, arms and legs became slender. His waist was shrinking. However, his hips seemed to be doing the opposite. He could feel his shorts get tighter around the waistband. Looking back, he saw his ass fill out. He was definitely becoming very girlish in his figure. However, it became official as he felt his manhood shrink away, and a warmth grow in his crotch. Reaching down, he felt smoothness and folds of skin. He was now female. He screamed, but stopped short as he heard the cry of a girl escape his mouth. He covered his mouth with his hands hoping to stop the sound from ever leaving again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThats when he felt tingling on his chest. Pulling up his shirt, he looked down and saw that his nipples were a lot larger than normal. The area around them was darker and larger as well. However, he could barely believe it when he saw them being pushed out away from his chest forming two, distinguishable bumps. These bumps grew bigger. He could feel the weight increasing on his chest as they continued to swell. He slid his hands over them and jumped as he felt and electric surge when his nipples were brushed. He cupped his boobs, for thats what they were, and could feel them pressing against his hands as they continued to gain mass. The weight was getting heavier when suddenly, the growth stopped. He dropped his boobs and felt them tug at his chest. They bounced and swayed slightly before coming to a rest. Looking back at the mirror he saw a face he recognized all too well. He let out a high pitched, feminine scream as he saw the face of his sister looking back at him in the mirror. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Matt slipped the ring on his finger.  As he did he really felt exhausted.  He thought all the running around he did had finally caught up with him.  He laid down in his bed and passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Matt was out cold, the night was far from inactive. The ring started to shimmer and a tingling sensation coursed through Matt's body, but he couldn't quite feel it while knocked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first of the changes to come began with his hair. His short, brown hairs slowly lengthened and pushed further out from his head. They continued to grow longer and longer, locks fluttering about his form as he lay. The lengthening hair continued and then stopped once those flowing brown hairs reached down to his mid back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tingly spread, consuming his form as the hairs that covered his body got sucked into his skin. As each hair was drawn back, his rough skin softened and took on a light tan. What muscles he had deflated while his body continued to soften. Even his face was affected by this change. Cheeks puffed slightly and that same, silky look appeared there as well. Eyelashes pressed onwards though they did not grow much farther. Nose slimmed and pulled inwards as his lips filled with a red color and swelled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this portion of the change complete, the tingly ceased and moved onto his chest. Slowly but surely, fat and flesh piled onto his once masculine chest. Underneath his nipples, his skin swelled and pressed outwards. At first, there wasn't much more then simple swellings there. Those swellings grew however and took on a rounded shape as they pushed against his shirt. The circular shape upon them grew more defined and soon, Matt was now sporting a blossoming set of breasts which appeared to be set in the B-range, which fit his slim form. Once small nipples, lengthened, the aureoles growing in diameter. Those nubs darkened to a pink shade as those nipples shifted to match the newly feminine look on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe change then began to dive downwards towards his hips and thighs. Fat began to cause his thighs to grow just a tad, hips spreading apart as Matt's feminine curves came into being. His rear was also assaulted by the addition of flesh and rounded outwards. His waist slimmed considerably, but the most drastic change was just starting between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis manhood was slowly being drawn backwards towards his body. As each moment passed, that shaft shrunk. Smaller and smaller it had gotten, the head sinking into the rest of it. Soon, that head was nonexistent. His member was now a small shaft, smooth and ending in a round point. The slit where the once head of his length was closed and soon, what had once been his manhood was little more then a small nub upon his skin. It wasn't done shifting though. The round sack underneath that shaft was drawn close to his body. With a pop, both balls slipped back into his insides. Scrotum continued to draw backwards and as his groin nearly smoothed over, an indentation formed in the middle of it. Soon, that indentation split and vertically lengthened. The small nub that was his shaft disappeared into his growing slit where it fell into place as his newly acquired clitoris. His balls were still moving and shifted upwards, reforming into a pair of feminine ovaries. Estrogen was already staring to be produced by them as they assumed their new role. His slit had nearly reached it's full form, when Matt's insides shifted as a uterus was forming inside. Where his manhood had once been, now was the soft delicate folds of a female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only hair that remained on his body now were the long locks on his head and his brown pubic hair. That hair down below had already shifted, the edges of it drawing back in until he was left with a small triangle of hair above his new slit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former boy, lay upon the bed, unaware of the changes to his...now her...body. But things weren't quite finished yet. The jeans she wore were suddenly engulfed in a white light and then...faded from his form. Matt's lower body was now only covered in his boxers which was now beginning to tighten around her body. The legs of the underwear shrunk and drew upwards. Tighter and tighter, her boxer got until they fit him like a glove. Where her boxers once were, a set of panties now covered her slit, the material forming nicely around his curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shirt was next to change and in that shimmer of light it compressed quickly. Sleeves disappeared and shifted into small, thin straps. The lower section of her shirt drew upwards while the area around her breasts tightened and formed into circular cups. Now, her shirt was nothing more then a bra to confine those mounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt moaned, voice a good deal higher then it had been before and she rolled over, hair cascading about her body. The ring shimmered brightly, and then it's glow completely faded. </span></div></div>",

After another five minutes, she felt a sharp pain in her ass made her moan in anguish.  Once again, she positioned herself the right way and tried to get home as soon as she can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long drive, Lauren finally made it home and left the car to feel free from the pain she felt.  When she entered the house, she yelled out loud, \u201cMom, I\u2019m home!\u201d  Waiting for a response, her mom called in a calming voice, \u201cWelcome home Lauren.  Did you find what your gift for your birthday?\u201d  \u201cOh yes mom,\u201d she answered, \u201cand I love it!\u201d  \u201cWell hurry up and get dressed!  We have to be at the restaurant in an hour.\u201d  Lauren nodded and hurried upstairs into her room.  She then head to the close to pick our her birthday clothes that included a long dark blue dress, a pair of dark blue shoes, and teenage pantyhose.  Lauren immediately undresses herself and was about to put on her clothes for dinner.  But the moment she was down to her B-cup Bra and panties, she noticed something that wasn\u2019t right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what she can tell, something was squirming around within her panties and on her butt.  Curious by this, Lauren took off her panties to see what\u2019s in them.  What he saw was truly shocking.  Growing out of her ass was a small nub about a foot in length that had a sprinkle of black hairs, the same color as the hair on top of her head.  She felt a little confused by what she saw, but just as she was imagining things, she saw her nub growing a few more inches.  Not only that, but under a shocking reaction, the nub swung a little bit, developing a bit of muscle.  After much speculation, Lauren realized that this nub was actually a growing tail of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering what\u2019s happening Lauren looked into the mirror to see if there were any other changes happening to her.  To her surprise, she noticed her ears were getting a little pointy at the top of her head.  She then opened her mouth and saw her canine teeth are getting a little longer and sharper.  Looking at these changes, she realized that she was turning into a dog.  But how is that possible?  That\u2019s when Lauren remembered the ring with the dog she got back at the jewelry store.  She look down at it and wondered if that\u2019s what causing the changes.  Just as she wondered about it, her fingernails was loosing its red color and getting sharper by the second.  That gave her the conclusion she needed.  Watching the transformation take place, Lauren\u2019s reaction was\u2026</span></div></div>",

Her nails continued sharpening and hardening, until they were really more claws than nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair also started growing, lengthening from barely below her shoulders to somewhere just above her butt.
