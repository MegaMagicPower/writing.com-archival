The house you lived in sat on top of a hill, allowing you a nice environment to live in with your Pokemon. You layed down and closed your eyes thinking over your life up intill now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were ten years old, you discovered a injured anthro Eevee near your house. The Pokemon had been orphaned by a forest fire and was alone. You helped him and after he was healed the both of you decided to become partners. Over the next ten years the both of you battled against other trainers and helped take down evil organizations bent on enslaving Pokemon. Just last year, your Eevee finally decided what evolution stone he wanted. And so, Eevee evolved into Vaporeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvolving came with some notable changes. Vaporeon gained a more lean muscled body and grew from his 6'4 height to his 7'3 height. Additionally his feet grew larger, almost reaching from your hand to elbow. While you were amazed at his new look, you also got annoyed whenever he teased your 5'3 height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were brought out of your reminiscing when you heard footsteps crunching the sand and getting closer to you. Opening your eyes you saw Vaporeon looming over, hands on his hips and slyly grinning. The water Pokemon was dressed in white silk pants and was topless, showing his muscled torso. He oddly had on a pair of dark blue sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lost in ya thoughts partner\", Vaporeon asked in his deep voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat up and looked over your shoulder, smiling at him. \"I was just thinking about the past.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon gained a sincere smile. He then sat down behind you, before pulling your body into his lap. His large and smooth blue arms snaked around you and pressed your body against his strong chest. You listened to his loud heartbeat and looked forward at his large sandaled feet easily dwarfing your own. You felt safe in Vaporeon's hold, his muscled embraced always put you at ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really glad I met you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh?\", looking up you saw Vaporeon looking out at the water smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've always been there to help me. I feel happy when we win, not just because of the victory but also since you smile and the hug you give me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the arms tighten around you and the heartbeat seem to quicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't imagine anyone else being my partner. The way you look up at me, let me carry you into the water, and even how you rub my feet sometimes. That's why....i care about you so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon began to show signs of nervousness. From his arms tightening to his toes beginning to wiggle. You caught onto what he was saying and......you felt the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up you.............</span></div></div>",

And while you sat there you saw a six foot well muscled Jolteon heading your way wearing nothing but a blue speedo and pair of goggles on his head along with a blanket and basket in his each of his hands since you two were going to be having a panic together. Seeing him in this little of clothing though didn't really surprise you since this \"rare\" Pokemon always made sure to swim or run in the morning to keep himself in shape. Although unlike normal Pokemon you never caught him or anything. You both just ran into each other one day and instantly became friends. But when the two of you were out in public you sometimes had to act like you were his Trainer when someone tried to battle you. And surprisingly upon just getting one look at the Anthro Jolteon the person wanted to battle you decided against it and then left you two alone. Thankfully this did not happen that often sot he two of you were able to have a normal like friendship. But in the back of your mind you hoped that perhaps it could become more then just friendship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you got lost in your thoughts you had failed to noticed the buff electric type canine had set down the blanket and basket on the grass a few inches away from where you were sitting. And when you did notice this it was only because the Jolteon had gently shook your left shoulder when he asked, \"Hey, are you going to keep daydreaming on me? Or are you going to join me over here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this caused you to break away from your thoughts as you rubbed the back of your neck and confessed, \"Oh, sorry about that Jolteon. I guess I got distracted on old memories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying this you thne sat down next to him to which he smiled at you and replied, \"No problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you then began to enjoy your panic together. However, after some time had passed you soon realized that lunch was .....</span></div></div>",

T-Thank you, Kasai.\u201d You softly replied, before you felt yourself start to get tired again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you completely fell asleep you felt the well muscled anthro fire fox Pokemon softly kiss the top of your head as he told you, \u201cYou are most welcome. Now please rest for now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the last thing you remembered before you let sleep take you over for her second time now in the Ninetales arms in his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout two hours had passed before you had woken up in Kasai\u201ds bed no feeling cold.

Sitting up you looked around, but couldn't find Kasai anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where'd he go?\", you wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up from the bed, you made your way towards the door and opened it . Your eyes widened as you were immediately blasted with the snowy wind. Concern filled you as the thought of Kasai being out there worried you. Wrapping the blanket around you tighter, you braved your way outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through the snow was tough with the wind blasting you and the familar cold returning. You yelled out for Kasai, hoping he would answer only to recieve the howling of the wind in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the midst of your searching you suddenly bumped into something wooden.  A wall on wood stood before you, but looking up we a a platform of sorts. Backing up your eyes widened as you saw the wooden structure was that of a giant sandal. Perched on top were giant furred toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the midst of confusion you felt lighter for some reason. You soon yelled in surprise as your body lifted of the ground and into the sky. Traveling up you passed a familier orange robe of the giant. Eventually you were placed on a pale yellow furry surface with heat immediately beginning to warm your body. Looking up, your jaw dropped as the giant face of Kasai filled the sky!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ninetales had a worried look as he examined your body in his palm. \"Young man! Are you ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K...asai what is this!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai sighed before looking up. With a wave of his paw the cloud blasting the snow moved, making the snow less intense and letting the moonlight shine through. He soon looked back down at you and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose an explanation is needed. You see ____ I have the ability to adjust my size to what I please. Sometimes I may grow a little just for fun and other times I grow this big if the weather get's a little too intense to help balance it. I know this may a lot to take in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought over everything Kasai said. Not only was he an anthro ninetails that seemed VERY nice to you, he could grow into a giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So little one, what you like me to do? I could shrink back down to my normal size, or I could stay like this. If you like I could also go somewhere in between.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought of Kasai's offer.

And once he had done this he added,\u201dJust allow me to take care of something before we head back inside.\u201d You saw the anthro Ninetales smal two of his to which you found yourself staring in shock when you saw Kasai\u2019s home had instantly increased in size to better suit his full size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that was amazing.\u201d You remarked, as the Ninetales walked and moved you to his robe covered pectorals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon doing this you saw them bounce a little once he had chuckled again before he responded back with, \u201cThank you young man, that is quite kind of you to say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that had said you saw Kasai open the door you had just walked out of and walk down a small hallway before he entered a giant sized living room that had an armchair, a sofa, a large dinning table, and a fireplace just like the one that was in his bedroom.

He was unkind to both humans and Pokemon despite being a human himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened in shock, how was Kasai's grandfather a human?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He would mistreat any Pokemon he came across, feeling no remorse. One day he found a Ninetales near his home, but when he threw a rock at it something terrible happened. The Ninetales cursed my father and his descendents to suffer from his mistreatment of Pokemon by living as a hybrid of both human and Pokemon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so, my grandfather was turned into a anthro Ninetales. My father turned into one as well and since my mother was married to him at the time, she was technically part of the family and transformed as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My father was outraged, blaming my grandfather and cutting all ties with him. Since they were now anthro Pokemon, my father and mother fled to the mountains so that they wouldn't face any trouble with the humans that wished to exploit them. I was born up here, I came out as a vulpix and my family adapted to the changes. We embraced our new forms and practiced with our abilities and made a life up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai opened his eyes which now held a sorrowful look. \"Still, this happiness didn't last long. A few days after i evolved, my parents decided to go look for more supplies. However, when they went out into the blizzardly night...they didn't return.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai closed his eyes again, as the hurt he felt back then seem to return. You frowned, before making a decision. Carefully you climbed down the sleeve of the yukata and slide down to the opening. You walked over the top of his hand like paw and hugged his index finger. From above Kasai looked down at you in confusion before smiling. Gently putting you in his left palm the Ninetales brought you up to his face and pressed you to his right cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much young man, your affection makes me feel at peace.\", after pulling you away from his cheek, Kasai lightly pressed his giant lips to your body adding more warmth and making you laugh slightly from the tickling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai's smile widened as he heard your laugh.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nYou and Kasai spend a good amount of time talking.

You let out a breath as you put the plate down, only for it to levitate to the rest as Kasai exited the room with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile grew on your face as the Ninetales returned and helped you up. Kasai then wrapped his arm around your shoulder and brought you over to his couch.

And upon doing so you felt him help you up onto your feet while he explained, \u201cThere, now both you and I have a change of clothes once we are finished with our bath.\u201d You felt his hand remove itself from your own hand before you felt it on your side.

The Pokemon pulled the garment down, giving a view of his defined six pack. After pulling his arms out, you saw that he had toned biceps and his large pecs were fully shown. After completely undressing, Kasai stood only dressed in a fundoshi, hugging a large bulge and exposing his large thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed at the now towering and nearly nude Ninetales. \"K-kasai...what are you.?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai chuckled as he folded his yukata. \"Well young man, when taking a bath you do it nude correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly nodded getting Kasai to smile and turn to a nearby shelve. Your gaze found his toned backside, along with his firm buttcheeks that remain uncovered by the fundoshi strap. All of Kasai's tails seem to move eagerly as he hummed and swayed his hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he placed his robe on the shelve, Kasai brought his paws to the back and grabbed the underwear, pulling them down. With a bounce of his butt you also saw his balls between his thighs. Turning around, Kasai presented to you his manly glory. His penis looked to large despite being currently limp. Kasai's foot paws slapped the ground and shook it as he approached, placing his feet on both sides of you. You looked up in awe as Kasai smiled over his pecs down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So my little human, are you ready to bathe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and watched as Kasai squatted down, making his thighs bulge as he reached down and scooped you up. Holding you to his pecs, Kasai walked over to the bath and slowly stepped in. Letting out a ahh in relaxation, you realized you were still clothed. Quickly undressing and putting your clothes in a pile, you found Kasai's gaze on you. The Ninetales smiled as he used his thumb and finger to pick your clothes up and set them aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kasai...your body is really amazing.\", you spoke as the water soaked his fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai chuckled before bringing up an arm, to your surprise he placed you on the hard bicep.

In order to evolve i needed to do more then age, training my body helped me gain strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering his arm, you were placed in the warm water and near Kasai's right pectoral. Swimming over to the chest you leaned against the pec and relaxed the rhythmic heartbeat. Kasai grinned at the cute sight of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Kasai, your bath is like the ones they have at public baths. Why is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai hummed and bounced his pecs a little. \"Well my father said he always enjoyed visiting bathhouses, after his transformation he wasn't able to go to them anymore. So he made his own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and hummed as you swam to the crevice of Kasai's pecs.

Folding up his robe and laying your clothes on top, he carried them out while keeping you floating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hovered near the Ninetale's head as he walked through the halls. He was quiet but you noticed a dash of pink across his snout. Soon you arrived in the familiar bedroom and Kasai placed the clothing on a dresser before walking over to the bed and sitting down. Your body soon lowered to the center of Kasai's large palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could ask anything, the Pokemon smiled, leaning down and gave a large kiss. You blushed and kissed the top lip as your body was massaged with the warm appendages. The red on Kasai's face had darkened as he pulled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So my little human, how would you feel about a little...fun?\", Kasai spoke deeply in a seductive like tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou widened your eyes. Being with the Ninetales already sparked something in you, this could be arousal on a whole new level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...I would love to!\", you said looking up at the handsome face looming above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai smiled. \"Then I won't delay any further, but first....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing his snout forward, Kasai stuck his tongue out and slowly licked your body. The wet muscle despite being as big as you, lightly saturated your crotch and rubbed your hardening dick. You felt pleasure hit you as the tongue licked your penis and sent waves of ecstasy through your veins. Only a little precum dripped out, but Kasai licked it all up and swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmn, you taste quite sweet~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting his body, Kasai scooted to the center of his bed. \"Now then, I'll let you enjoy my body to your heart's content.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying this Kasai.......</span></div></div>",

The yellow furred biceps layed on your back and the large paws rested on your back and above your rear. Warmth spread throughout your body as your head rested in the center of the two pecs, bigger then your head. You felt the soft yet firm abs of Kasai against your flat stomach. Finally you bit your lips in pleasure as the Ninetale's harden member pressed against your smaller one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt Kasai lift your chin up with a large paw before gently pressing his lips against your. A hum escaped you as the tender lips connected with yours and pulled you into the kiss. You soon felt a large tongue insert into your mouth and wrap around yours, dominating it with it's size and hot temperature. Kasai had a peaceful look as his ears flicked at the shared pleasure between you and him. He ran a paw through your short hair, ruffling it up not that you cared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling away, Kasai brought your face back down to his chest as ran his fingers through your hair and produced a large heartbeat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about everything up intill now. Kasai had helped you and given you love, with his various abilities he could do so much. You wanted to make him feel great pleasure for all he's done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning up to pull yourself out of Kasai's embrace, you began crawling down the bed to wear you could sit in between Kasai's large thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ninetales looked in confusion at your action. \"Darling, is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head before lowering your gaze. In your eyesight was the crotch of Kasai, with his penis fully erect and his large balls resting against the bed. Focusing of the member, you closed your eyes and leaned down while opening your mouth....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to be stopped as a weight suddenly pushed against your right shoulder. Opening your eyes, you saw yellow furred abs now standing tall. Looking up, you saw Kasai sitting up and looking at you shocked. A dark red bar now ran across the Ninetale's snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Um ____.........you really don't....have to do that!\", Kasai quickly explained flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lightly smiled. \"Kasai....I want to do this. You've helped me so much and been so caring, now......I want to give you pleasure!\", a thick blush decorated your cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai looked off to the side for a few seconds before looking back at you. \"Alright then, if you ever want to stop then please do so!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, you nodded and watched as Kasai layed back down, placing his hands on his chest. Lowering your head again, you slowly stuck your tongue out and licked the pink tip of Kasai's penis. The large furry body shook as a jolt of pleasure hit the Ninetale's nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving on, you opened up and slid the large cock into your mouth. The large member filled your maw and you ran your tongue over the veiny shaft and began sucking the thick meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai bit his lips and bucked his hips. The feeling of oral pleasure made his body shocked with ecstasy with each suck. His muscles flexed as his heartbeat increased and bounced his pecs. His buttcheeks clenched and he wiggled his toes plus tails as he felt his climax rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah....ahhh....HAAAA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinually sucking the penis you tasted the sweat precum dripping out of the tip. Finally, with one last large suck the cock shock and became limp as it shot of its cum and filled your mouth. Slipping the cock out of your mouth, you gulped the thick substance down your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt Kasai cradle your face with his two large paws before bring your face up. The Ninetales licked up the few cum drops dripping from your mouth before locking your lips in a passionate kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling away, Kasai gave a tired smile as he panted. \"Haa....tha..nk you love. That was....the greatest pleas...ure I've had in a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and rested your head against Kasai's pecs, listening to the calming heartbeat and enjoying his paws rubbing your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, what may I do for you now?\", Kasai quietly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to ask Kasai.....</span></div></div>",

But I assure you that there is no need to be embarrassed about asking me such a question.\" You then felt one his furry hands gently cup your chin before he went on with, \"Because as my mate you should know that I'll everything within my abilities to keep you safe from harm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this though only caused your blush go grow darker in color as you let out, \"I'll be sure to remember that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you had let these words slip through your lips however,you felt Kasai move his hand away from you chin before he put it at his side.After he had done this you saw him close his eyes and right before your eyes you saw the anthro Ninetales begin to grow back to his 100 foot size yet again. And as he did this you thought for certain that nine tailed anthro fox was flexing various muscles for you while his body grow in size. And within a few seconds Kasai was back to being the giant that you had come to love. You then could carely see over his giant sized pecs as the fire fox opened both of his eyes and used his abilities to lift you up into the air before gently placing you in-between his massive pecs. Upon doing this this you were surrounded by the Ninetales's warmth and msucle along with his strong heartbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd within a few seconds you felt the muscles gently press around you as Kasai laid back down in his bed. Once he had done this you felt one of his huge find it's way in-between his pecs before it gently rubbed the top of your head as he told you, \"Goodnight, my special human. I hope you'll sleep well tonight.\" In response to this you took a hold of the finger and gently kissed it to which you felt him stop moving his finger for a moment. You then felt his pecs bounce again as the heavily muscled Ninetales added, \"Thank you for that, darling. Now go to sleep and I'll see you in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then felt Kasai remove his finger from between his pecs and as you laid there you felt your eyes getting heavy.

Kasai's firm pecs and soft firm no longer surrounded you and you were wrapped up in a blanket on his now normal size bed. You let out a sigh as all the memories last night, sucking off Kasai and making out with him warmed your heart and made you want to be with him and not break off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were brought out of your thoughts as the door to the bedroom opened and Kasai reentered the room wearing his ropes. The Ninetales smiled as he saw you awake and sitting up, coming over the anthro sat on the bed and leaned over to press a kiss to your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning my human, are you feeling well?\", Kasai asked as he grasped your hand with his soft paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"Yes very much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ninetales warmly smiled and pressed a kiss to your hand before letting go, getting up from the bed Kasai walked over to his dresser and picked up your a robe before coming back over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I washed your clothes though they are drying at the moment. Intill then, you can wear this robe from when I was younger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took the robe and stared in awe. The yukata was a rich orange and very soft. \"Thank you very much Kasai.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of bed, you blushed as you were still nude. Slipping on the robe, you relaxed as the soft fabric hugged your body and gave you warmth. Kasai stood up and smiled as he saw you wearing the robe, he pulled you into a embrace that you accepted as he heard his heartbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for last night love, if I may ask will you take a walk with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and followed after the taller anthro to the entrance of his home. Before he opened the door, Kasai gave you a hanten and helped you put it on before offering you a hand. You held the warm paw as the both of you walked out into the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was out and offered a nice warm light despite the cold air and snow on the ground. You did get a chill but it disappeared as Kasai hooked his elbow with yours and held you close to his warm body. You began to walk through the snow that lightly crunched as you and the anthro Ninetales walked through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the snow decreased intill the ground was visible and you and Kasai approached a plane of Sakura trees that strangely seem to be in bloom despite the cold. A comfortable silence held the air with the exception of the breeze and clanking of Kasai's shoes. After passing all the trees, one remained at the end bigger and having strange carvings in it. Once before the tree, Kasai reached out a paw and ran it over the trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ninetales looked at you with a sad smile. \"When my father and mother fled here they put thier names on this tree to signify thier new future together, a future where they would bound by their love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared wide eyes and Kasai held up a finger and had a claw pop out. The Ninetales looked at you with a conflicted face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So darling what I'm asking.....is will you put your name here with mine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed at his words. Kasai held love for you and found you worthy enough to be bound in love with him. You were in love with the Ninetales too and wanted to be with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kasai...i... would be honored.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai gained a warm smile before turning toward the tree and underneath the names of his parents began carving some new intials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u706b\u707d ____<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to tear up as you saw your name and Kasai's. The Ninetales held your chin softly and wiped your tears with his furry thumb. The two of you then shared a warm kiss and you felt your heart flutter as the anthro brought you to his chest and held you in a loving hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was next?</span></div></div>",

You sat at the table and smiled as the house felt even more comfortable now that you and Kasai were now together. A new life full of your buff Ninetales protecting you and giving all the love you could want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai soon joined you and set down a tray full of food and sauce. You thanked him and got a smile as he reached over and gently squeezed your hand before picking up a dish. Following his lead, you ate Kasai's food and felt a burst of flavor at the mouth watering dishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden knocking came from the front door, pausing dinner as you looked at the door that made the echoing noises. You were a bit nervous, Kasai was the only resident you knew lived up here. The Ninetales got up and gave a reassuring stroke to your head while smiling. Kasai then made his way to his door and opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard Kasai let out a small gasp before laughing happily. \"Ah, I wasn't expecting a vist!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard the door close and soon the sound of paws walking across the floor came closer, although a second pair was accompanying Kasai's. Soon the Ninetales walked back into the livingroom and you looked in awe as beside Kasai was a Alolan Ninetales!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Alolan pokemon was about as tall as Kasai and like him wore a yukata, though it was a blue that faded to a white near the bottom. The opening showed his snowy blue pecs and top of abs despite the fabric being slightly more closed. The poofy head fur he had was in a small wavy ponytail draped over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ice Ninetales spotted you and widened his eyes before quickly clasping his paws and bowing. \"Ah! Please excuse me, I didn't mean to intrude.\", he replied in a deep voice that was respectful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai smiled and placed a paw on the visitor's shoulder. \"Come now, I'm joyful of your visit cousin! In fact I can introduce to someone special.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised that this new visitor was Kasai's cousin, you didn't dwell on it for long as your lover motioned you over. Standing up, you walked to the front of the two taller and more muscled anthros. Kasai walked behind you and placed his hands on your shoulders. The Alolan Ninetales gave a kind smile and bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello my name is K\u014dri, I am the cousin of Kasai. Thank you very much for giving him companionship up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou worked up courage and lightly mumbled. \"My name is ___, and.... I am dating Kasai!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large paws on your shoulders soon moved as Kasai wrapped his strong arms around you and held you to his buff chest. K\u014dri's face lit up as he placed his paws on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kasai how wonderful! Please tell me everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon everyone sat down at the table, Kasai made another batch of Nori rolls to go around. K\u014dri gratefully accepted the food and patiently listened about your meeting with Kasai and your marks of love. The Alolan cousin was delighted to to hear that you too were a pair. Soon after finishing dinner, you all moved to the couches and sat next to Kasai who wrapped a buff arm around you. Looking at the two buff Ninetales you felt a question rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...if you mind me asking K\u014dri, how are you and Kasai.....different Ninetales.\", you nervously asked the ice anthro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nK\u014dri giggled and closed his eyes. \"It's no issue. You see when the curse was placed on our family my parents had been traveling through the Alola region. It seems this played a part as they were morphed into that region's version. While it is difficult, I do enjoy traveling and visiting Kasai.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasai chuckled. \"Me as well cousin. Now I need to wash those dishes, I'll let you two get acquitted.\", The anthro gave a quick kiss to your cheek before getting up and walking to his kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nK\u014dri looked at you with his bright eyes with a happy smile. \"I want to thank you ___, for being here for my cousin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed before waving your hands. \"Ah you don't have to do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Alolan anthro shook his head. \"Oh but I must! Whenever I visited Kasai he acted in high spirits and would smile, but I could feel his true feelings. It's so lonely up here and you've kept him company and love him so I thank you for helping Kasai.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and felt warmth, you were here for Kasai. He no longer was alone and you would love him as much as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nK\u014dri looked to the side and chuckled. \"Now only if I could find someone to love as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and K\u014dri chatted for a while about his travels and family history.

You then saw the two embrace one another in a hug before the Alolian nine tailed fox walked to the door and was on his way. And once that had happened you saw Kasai bend down in front of the couch before you were gently engulfed in his yellow furred hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then found yourself being moved to his face and as one of Kasai's red eyes stared at you he commented, \"Well that was certainly a surprise. But now I think we'd best move this to the bedroom. Because this is where my true surprise is for, my love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then found yourself blushing after hearing him tell you this. And as he made his way to the bedroom you wondering what the surprise was. However, once you had been gently placed onto this bed you soon realized that Kasai's surprise was in fact going to involve him.......</span></div></div>",

When in reality there are worlds MUCH bigger then ours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been a Pokemon trainer going on eight years now. Just a week after your eighteenth birthday, you and your Pikachu were sitting out on a field having a picnic. In the midst of eating you spotted a glint in the grass, and lifting the object up you and Pikachu gazed at the crystal-like item curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the crystal began to glow, and you felt yourself blacking out. The last thing you heard was the concerned cries of your Pikachu.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nComing to, you immediately noticed something was wrong. As you sat up, the ground felt wooden and smooth. Looking up your eyes widened in shock as you saw a dressing room fit for a giant! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were multiple casual clothes draped over numerous chairs and fancy suits all hung up in a open closet. You soon heard a door click, and looking at the giant inhabitant entering the room, your jaw dropped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant had the body structure of a 6'7 tall man, however his body was covered in yellow fur and his head was that of a Pikachu! Looking at his body you couldn't help but blush. The anthro Pikachu had a defined six pack, a pair of bulging biceps, two large pecs, and a pair of large feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was dressed in a tight orange and black fighting suit that squeezed his muscles, allowing a clear view of them. In his right hand was a mask with the same colors as the suit. The Pikachu ran a paw through his messy hair as he brought his hulking body to a mirror, giving you a view of his muscled back and firm rump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They put up a good fight, but In the end I still won!\", the anthro spoke passionately as he flexed both of his arms, making the veins bulge out and his tail wag happily. His voice was deep but had an energetic flare to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pikachu suddenly turned around, walking to the desk you sat on. You watched in amazement as the muscle god began to loom over you. Looking up the face of the Pokemon was mostly covered by his large pecs. You decided getting his attention might be the best choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um hey! Down here!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pikachu's ear twitch and he looked over his strong chest down at you. At first he squinted his eyes before leaning down. The Pikachu raised an eyebrow at you. \"That noise. Was...that you little guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pikachu's face suddenly lit up as he grinned. \"I can't believe it! Can you speak again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H..hello\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pikachu let out a cute chu~ as he smiled at you. His eyes suddenly widened and he gasped. \"Oh sorry! I haven't introduced myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClenching a fist, the Pikachu hit his toned chest and grinned. \"The names Zapp! I'm the fifth time Pokemon Tournament champion!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my name is _____. And I'm a Pokemon trainer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp looked at you awe. \"Whoa! You train Pokemon, at that size? You must have a good routine, even The Machamps aren't given that much respect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sweatdropped at Zapp's misconception. Still you should roll with it. \"Um yeah, I train with a Pikachu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah cool! Maybe we can compete sometime!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly felt a wave of sadness. The last thing you remember was your Pikachu, worryingly calling out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"____? You ok man?\", Zapp asked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's just....i got separated from my partner. And I'm....worried about him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly felt a smooth and furry warmth rub your head. Looking up, you saw Zapp rubbing your head with his thumb pad. He gently smiled at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey don't get sad now, I can tell by looking at you that the bond you have with your Pikachu will help you find him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling gratefully, you nodded and Zapp gave a thumbs up. <br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nAfter some time, you and Zapp began to chat. Within minutes, the Pikachu acted like everything was normal. He drank from a water bottle and kicked his large feet up on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are all Pokemon in the tournament so....buff?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm not all of them. There have been a few lean champions, my trainer just gives me a strict routine to follow. In the end I get all this!\", Zapp smiled as he flexed his biceps and legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept your head down to hide your blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you decided to...........</span></div></div>",

Both were in casual clothes and smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next one had a Raichu in a white tuxedo with a Pikachu in a wedding dress. The Raichu was holding the Pikachu's head to his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last one had Zapp in his fighting outfit, and next to him was an anthro Greninja in a yukata. Zapp had his arm around the Greninja and both were kissing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh your looking at my photos?\", Zapp's voice brought you out of your observing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and soon pointed to the photo of the Pichu. \"Is that your son?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp chuckled at the question. \"No that's my little brother Spark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then, are those your parents?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah....they are.\" You noticed Zapp's voice had gained a sad tone. Looking up, you saw the Pikachu looking at the photo with a sad gaze. \"Zapp? Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh yeah sorry. It's just....looking at that picture brings up some bad memories.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\", you noticed Zapp began to rub his fingers together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My parents....passed away a few years ago. Spark was only a baby when it happened.\", Zapp soon rested his fingers back on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. I'm sorry Zapp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp shook his head. \"It's ok. It was hard at first taking care of him and trying to finish school. But luckily I was scouted to become a fighter, and now Spark is one of my best supporters!\", Zapp began to speak passionately again as he crashed his knuckles together. \"When I hear him cheering for me, i have more then enough strength to win!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled at his energy. \"Yeah I can relate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ____ do you have a sibling too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly. I grew up in a orphanage. Me and a lot of older kids helped take care of the younger ones. Though in the end they were adopted while I wasn't.\", you explained as the past memories began to plague your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly felt Zapp scoop you up in his palm, before hugging you by pressing you against his right pectoral. His loud heartbeat and soft fur put you at ease. Both of you sat in silence, though you could hear light sniffling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the talk ___. It's been a long time since I could open up to someone like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp set you back down on the desk, and you and him smiled at each other.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little, the mood lighten up. Zapp had taken off his top to let his muscled torso breath. You decided to ask about the last picture. \"So who's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Kaeru, he's currently my ex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Currently?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp scratched his cheek. \"Yeah, he left to go tour the regions about a month ago. We figured it be best to take a break and try to reconcile when he gets back.\", The Pikachu leaned back in his chair. He suddenly clapped and looked back down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, we visited the past enough for one day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp placed his palm beside you. And taking the offer you crawl onto the soft paw pad. Standing up from his seat, he made his way to the closet and began to pick an outfit. He seem to be dressing up to meet someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say ____ wanna meet..........</span></div></div>",

However, if the anthro Pikachu was taking you with him, then you obviously didn't have a choice. And along with that the giant electric mouse seemed to be excited to introduce you to his trainer. And so with keeping that in mind you looked up at him and replied, \"Sure, I don't see why not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! So just let me get dressed. Then we can go and see him at a local diner that's close.\" Zapp said, with joy clear in his voice as he grabbed a sleeveless shirt and a pair of jeans before walking back towards the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once he had done this you were then gently placed back onto the wooden surface and he walked a few feet away from you to get changed. While he did this though you quickly looked away to give him some sort of privacy upon seeing him remove the bottom part of his wrestling gear. However, from the corner of your eyes you could easily see a large bulge inside of a pair of tight looking red underwear. This caused you to blush a deep red as you saw him blush a little as well once he had saw you look away. You then heard the giant anthro Pokemon let out a light chuckle of embarrassment while he let out, \"Oh sorry about just changing right in front like that, litle guy? I guess I'm just so used to there being no else in my dressing room with me that it's kind of become a habit of mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing his explanation you let out a light cough to get rid of your blush when you replied, \"I-It's okay. But um anyway what's your trainer like, Zapp?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a little while you heard nothing but silence from the giant anthro mouse. That is until you saw his shadow go over you again and he placed his hand in front of you to get onto it again. And as you did this you saw a bag that was over his right shoulder which you figured he had put his wrestling gear into as he told you, \"Well, my trainer is a pretty strict guy when it comes to getting me ready for my matches. But outside of training his one of nicest people I've ever met. He was even one of the people who suggested I become a wrestler to support myself and my little bro.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Oh I see. In that case then I can't wait to meet him.\" You responded back, while Zapp began to walk out of his dressing room after closing the door to it.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nIt took about ten minutes or so until Zapp arrived at a small diner with you still in his right hand. And once he had entered the room you heard an deeper voice then Zapp's greet him when it commented, \"Ah, there you are, Zapp. Glad you could make since we've have to go over tactics for your upcoming opponent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this caused you to towards one of the tables in the diner. And once you ahd done so you felt your eyes go wide in both shock and amazement as the giant Pokemon that was walking towards both you Zapp was in fact a heavily muscled....</span></div></div>",

He wore jeans that stretched over his toned legs and noticeable bulge. On top he wore a button up shirt with the top four buttons undone, giving you a glimpse of his black fur pecs. The sleeves seem to be painted on with his bulging biceps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face had a few lines along with a little gray in his creme fur, showing his age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two pokemon grasped hands, flexing thier biceps as they smiled at each other. Zapp then followed the Arcanine back to the table, keeping you leveled with his strong chest. After the both of them sat down, Zapp looked at his trainer with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, before we start I wanna introduce you to someone!\", Zapp excitingly said before holding his palm with you on it out to the Arcanine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nervously looked into the dog Pokemon's eyes. The Arcanine's eyes narrowed, thoroughly examining you. You decided an introduction was needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um..hello sir! My name is ____!\", you called out, trying not to stutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Arcanine brought his face closer to you. You could feel his hot breath blast your body, and his dark eyes stare into yours . Eventually the Pokemon leaned back and looked at you with a slight smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I know me and Zapp are tall but this is just ridiculous!\", the Arcanine joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard Zapp begin to laugh and you looked down as your face heated up. Bringing your head back up you saw the Arcanine bring one of his giant fingers forward and smile at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice ta meet cha kid. The name's Blaze.\", you slowly grasped the furry finger and gave a shake before giving a grin and nodding.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nAfter the introductions, Zapp set you on the table. Giving you a below view of the two giants and their occasional flexing. The both of them discussed battle tactics, mostly about Zapp facing rock and grass types. They would occasionally make small talk on other topics, asking you for your personal thoughts. You also took bites out of Zapp's berry pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the table shifted as....</span></div></div>",

Oh, ___ you can have the rest of my pie!\", Zapp cheerfully said as he rushed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, you saw Blaze gazing at you. He soon brought his orange paw down, which you climbed onto. The Arcanine rested his head on his other paw as he looked calmly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...do you compete too?\", you asked, trying to start a conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze chuckled before giving you a friendly smile. \"Not anymore, but you better believe I was once in my prime. I had an eight year winning streak! But now, I help out Zapp and make sure he gives his all.\", Blaze finished flashing a toothy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awed at the Arcanine words. \"Wow l thought you fought in tournaments too\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze gave a good flex with his bicep, making you see the veins pulse through the fur. \"I might not compete anymore kid, but these muscles aren't going anywhere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your blush come back before a thought struck your mind. \"So, how did you and Zapp meet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze gained a somber smile. \"I'm taking it he told you about his family?\". You nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze signed. \"Well when I met Zapp he wasn't the same happy Pikachu. Back then, I saw a kid struggling to finish high school and take care of his brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't he have someone to look after him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze closed his eyes and sighed before scratching the back of his head. \"No. Zapp had just turn eighteen and it was either getting separated from his brother or becoming his legal guardian. All that stress can mess up someone his age, and so I told him to meet me at the gym. When we worked out I told him to turn all his stress, anger, and sadness....into strength. With that strength we discovered his passion of fighting and entered him into tournament fighting. Now, he has a good source of money and a passion for fighting that rivals many senior fighters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Blaze's story, you felt amazed but also sad. Not only could you relate to Zapp's past, but you felt even more separated from your Pikachu. Blaze picked up on your dillema as he felt water drip onto his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"_____, You ok kid?\", Blaze asked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm....so..rry\", you sniffed rubbing your eyes. \"It's just....i can relate to Zapp and I wish the bad memories didn't come....back\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could remember all the young kids you helped raise at the orphanage. How they cried and wanted you to be adopted with them. But you had to put on a fake smile and persuade them to go. Your Pikachu became your family, you stuck together despite the trials. And being separated from him was making the stress eat you alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon felt a cool surface embrace your body. Looking up Blaze had pressed his snout against your body and closed his eyes. \"I can tell. You have negative feelings as well. But it's okay, I helped Zapp so now....I'll help you.\", Blaze brought his head up and smiled at you. You soon smiled and wrapped your arms around his snout feeling the warmth from his body.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n\"So I'm thinking we can start with some sit ups and maybe you and Zapp can spar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the match would last a second! All he would have to do is stomp me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I don't condone cheap tactics!\" , Blaze explained as you took another bite of pie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for the wait, there was a line!\", Zapp called out as he arrived back at the table. You and Blaze smiled at the Pikachu. You would wait intill the next training session to tell Zapp the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while the two pokemon........</span></div></div>",

Blaze got up to pay at the counter, while Zapp held you close to his chest to hide you. Soon the two Pokemon walked out of the diner into the bright lit night streets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey so you still up for that nightime workup?\", Blaze asked Zapp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pikachu gained a surprise look before looking down at you with a sheepish smile. \"Ah man, sorry ___ I  forgot me and Blaze were gonna hit the gym after we ate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. \"It's okay. In fact I think going to the gym would be cool. I'm hoping we can have a workout together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp gained a happy grin. \"Really? Man I can't wait! I can show you my moves and compare muscles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Blaze smiled as Zapp happily ranted. You were only here a few hours, but you came to like the giant Pikachu.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nIt being nightime, there weren't many other Pokemon out. Because of this, Zapp placed you on his large broad shoulder. Having a view up here, allowed you to see all the brightly lit up buildings and signs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way to the gym Zapp told you about this city. It was called New Kanto, and was the largest city in the region. It functioned mostly as a place for visitors with numerous stadiums, restaurants, hotels, and activity centers. Most Pokemon were actually tourists as the few residents here were either celebrities like Zapp or workers running the facilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the three of you arrived in front of a large white building. \"Whoa, that's the gym?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze chuckled. \"Yep, not only does it have the best equipment, but you also get the chance to relax in the bath house when your done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp gently grabbed you and held you to his chest as they entered. Once inside a Machamp gave a friendly greeting before giving them both keys with thier name on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were finally removed from the yellow chest fur as Zapp placed you in a locker. \"Hey sorry about that. You gonna be ok working out in that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still wore the clothes from your world. A pair of jeans with a black and yellow shirt. You nodded up at the Pikachu, receiving a grin in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp began to strip out of his attire. You blushed as the furred muscles were revealed. Bending over to pick up his clothes you saw Zapp's underwear ride up in between his firm cheeks. The Pikachu then put on a black tank top and gym shorts, and a pair of leg guards that went from his shin to the bottom of his paw. Finally he took the longer fur on the top of his head and pulled it back in a small ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing his hand down, you crawled into Zapp's warm palm. Blaze walked next to Zapp, wearing similar attire. As they walked out of the locker room, you looked at the other pokemon. There was a buff Lucario lifting weights, and a surprisingly muscled Snorlax doing push ups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then!\", Blaze clapped his paws as he gained a more serious look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"_____ if your going to work out with us, you need to work just as hard. Even if your small that doesn't mean I'll go any easier on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a nod In understanding. Blaze gained a slight grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'm thinking we can start with........</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Upon hearing that you were going to lift some weights with the two giant sized anthro Pokemon made you a little nervous. Especially since they were huge compared to you. As a matter of fact when you looked back over at the anthro Arcanine you noticed that besides having slightly larger muscles then the anthro Pikachu, he also seemed to be about five inches taller then Zapp. This caused you to realize that he would be at seven feet exactly if he was at a normal human height. However, these thoughts were quickly put to the side when you saw the buff Pikachu look down at you when he asked, \"So are you ready to start working out, little buddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could answer though you heard a very deep voice when it interjected with, \"I know it's not any of my business. But I do not think making that human use the same equipment is very smart. Which I'm surprised either one of you didn't take that into account. I mean I know you both train hard. But there is surely an easier way for that little one to become stronger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that had been said you felt app turn around ot face whoever had said this. And upon doing so you realized that it was the heavily muscled Lucario you saw earlier. And as you took a better look at him you noticed that he seemed to be about a few inches taller then Zapp, but shorter then Blaze, which to you meant that he must be six feet and ten inches in height. However, unlike both of them he seemed to have the largest and most defined muscles out of the three. But once you had stopped starting at the tight looking black workout shorts he was wearing you saw that he had put down the weights he had been lifting and was wiping his forehead off with a towel. While he did this you heard Blaze let out a light chuckle when he commented, \"You know I wouldn't expect anything less from you, Lucas. Since you always did look out for the smaller people once you became a fighter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that had been said you saw the two anthros shake hands before Zapp also shook his hand before he told him, \"It's good to see you again, friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to see both of you as well. But if you are both going to workout then please allow me to hold onto that small human for you. Because I'd hate for him to get hurt by accident.\" Lucas suggested, as he extended a hand towards the Pikachu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon doing so though you saw a sad expression on the well muscled anthro's face as he let out, \"Sorry buddy, I guess we won't be working out together after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's not true, Zapp. I mean sure I might not be able to do any weight lifting. But I'll find out another way to workout. Like doing some yoga or something.\" You reassured the anthro Pikachu, to which he handed you over to the very buff Lucario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that had been done you saw Zapp grab two dumbbells before he started to lift some weights. When you looked over at Blaze though you saw that he was instead going to flit a pair of even heavier looking dumbbells. And once you had made eye contact you saw the older anthro wink at you before he started his own workout. Upon doing so however, you heard Zapp let out a light chuckle before he started to push himself even harder. And if you hadn't known any better it seemed like the two of them were trying to impress you or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis prompted you to blush and look away while you thought to yourself, \"<i>No, there's no way that both Zapp and Blaze are interested in me.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Actually that is exactly what they are doing, little one.</i>\" Lucas mentally replied, which caused to you look back and up at his smiling face. Once you had done this he continued, \"<i>Forgive me for invading your aura like that young man. But I just thought you should know the truth is all.</i>\" You then felt a light blush spread across his face while he added on, \"<i>And if I am being honest I also feel that our auras match up well together even though this is in fact our first meeting each other.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hmm, really? That's interesting. I wonder if I trust you three because I had the same kind of Pokemon on my team back in my world. Granted of course they were more animal like in nature. But I still cared a lot for my Pikachu, Lucario, and Arcanine, along with my other three Pokemon too.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you had told him this you saw a proud smile form on Lucas's face before he bounced his massive pecs one after one another and told you, \"<i>I see. Then I suppose you wouldn't mind if you and I became closer with one another would you?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um sure. I don't see why not.\" You replied, before you the Lucario nod in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he done this however, you soon realized that the heavily muscled Lucario was about to get closer to you by......</span></div></div>",

The concept of getting in a bath with the buff Lucario made your body start to heat up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp gave a happy grin, before flashing a thumbs up. \"Ok! Have fun ____!\" , the Pikachu happily said to you before resuming his lifting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze however, had a knowing smirk on his face. \"Yeah, have fun kid~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas then walked across the room to enter the locker room. Making his way to a blue colored locker, Lucas opened the metal door before placing you inside. You then watched as the lucario stepped away and pulled his gym shorts down, before tugging his dark blue jock strap off as well allowing his black furred member and balls to pop out. You looked in awe as the long limp penis rested against his bigger then life balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFolding up his gym wear, Lucas looked down at you with a slight blush. \"Little one, It be best if you undressed now. If not, then your clothes will become drenched.\" Your blush darkened as you nodded, removing your jeans and shirt before folding them up. Now naked you stepped onto Lucas's outstretched palm, seeing that he now had a white towel wrapped around his waist. The Lucario placed his workout attire in his locker before closing the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas then walked over to a different door, opening it to reveal a long wooden hallway. The Lucario placed your body on his collar bone, letting you feel the warmth from the thick blue neck. Lucas walked down the hallway, looking at the doors and seeing them have a red mark on the lock. Finally he found a lock with a green mark. Opening the wooden shoji style door, you and Lucas made you're way in before he locked the door and put the both of you in warm steam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large room had wooden stools lining the  wall as well shelves holding numerous soaps and folded towels. Finally the center of the room was a large bath. The large square looked big enough to fit ten large anthro Pokemon, steam was rising from the surface confirming it's perfect temperature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to a table, Lucas grabbed you and set you down on a table, the Lucario removed his towel once again showing his manly glory. Lucas then scooped you up and placed you on the floor in front of his black furred toes. You looked up in awe as Lucas's hulking body loomed over you as he peered over his creme colored pecs, smiling down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have no fear little one, i'll be able to sense your location through our aura connection. I just need to gather a few things, you can head over to the water.\", Lucas said as he turned back to the table. You began walking to the large body of water, taking a second to look over at Lucas's toned back and firm rump. Arriving at the ledge to the bath, you slowly lowered yourself in immediately feeling the warm water relax your body. After a minute, you heard Lucas's paw pads slapping the tile as he approached. The Lucario then arrived at the ledge, you watched him slowly get in and created waves with his hulking body. Swimming over to the front of his pecs, you watched Lucas sigh and close his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creme pecs went half a foot out from Lucas's body, you swore the water was rippling from his massive heartbeat. Surfacing slightly from the water was his two big pink nipples, you couldn't help but swim over and boldly touch the soft mount on the right. The pec suddenly bounced creating a wave, looking up you saw Lucas looking down at you with a small smile and blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sorry Lucas!\", you quickly apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas just chuckled. \"No need for that little one. A dear friend of mine said that intimacy between two beings is a path to a strong connection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt Lucas bring his hand up from underneath you, letting water fall between his fingers as you were brought to his face. \"I believed that bathing would help our connection, but if you want we can do more.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lucario bounced his pecs as his voice gained a seductive tone. You blushed brightly, being close to Lucas was one thing but....the prospect of doing more then that compelled you. You gave a nod to Lucas who in return smiled more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas then lifted his buff body out of the warm water before sitting on the edge with a loud slap of his butt, leaving his legs in the water. The Lucario then lowered you to in between his thick thighs, having the blue fur walls tower over you like a canyon. You were only a few inches away from Lucas's manhood and notice his member begin to harden and rise. You saw the pair of balls rested underneath, looking bigger then you. Lucas then placed his hands on his thighs before leaning down and flexing his abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, little one what would you like to do?\", the Lucario spoke slowly with a thick blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought of what to do. Lucas had a impressive penis, that begged for attention. There were also the large balls. However, you also took note of his large butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucas......</span></div></div>",

Because I assure you that I won't force you to do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. For if you wish to stop then we can stop here if you'd like.\" The heavily muscled Lucario answered back, with an understanding expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing such word from the anthro Pokemon only fueled you evne more as you let out, \"I-I want to do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter uttered these words you saw the Lucario nod his head before you stood up and slowly made your way to giant member that was towering above you. And seeing it only made your heart beat faster as you extended your hands towards that had began to shake a little. But once you had placed your hands on it you weren't for certain if Lucas had felt your touch since you were so small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you soon learned that he in fact had felt your touch once you had heard him let out a low moan while he said, \"Yes, little one. Just like that. But if you need to, take all of the time you need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this caused your blush to deepen while you let out, \"Okay....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut right when you were about to start and rub your entire body against Lucas's penis the heavily muscled Aura Pokemon had quickly move you away from that part of his body due to the fact that the door was being opened.

And upon doing so he wmlied and then winked atyou while he mentally went on with, \"<i>Well, I am quite disappointed that you and I weren't able to truly enjoy or finish our bonding time. However, I am certain we shall have another chance to do so someday.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this caused you to blush before you saw him unlock the door and let the other two muscled anthro Pokemon into the room. And once they had walked into the room he closed the door and locked it again. You saw him turn around to face both Zapp and Blaze to which you felt your blush deepen in color when you saw well muscled anthro Pikachu remove his towel with his back to you which gave you a very good view of his wide muscled back along with his firm yellow furred butt. And when you turned to look away you then saw Blaze with his back to you to which you saw hi mane like hair that went down to his shoulder blades. And like with Zapp you saw his orange and black strapped butt, however, since his tail was large and fluffy it blocked most of it from your view. You then did your best not to become hard when Lucas walked back to the water and sank into it. Because once he had done this you then saw the other two anthro Pokemon's muscled bodies along with their large balls and currently soft members that were on top of them with Blaze being black in color while Zapp's was yellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you soon calmed yourself down when both of them got into the water and let out sighs of relief. Right after they did this though you saw Zapp look over at you when he asked the Lucario, \"Hey Lucas, you don't mind if I hold onto the little guy now do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No of course not.\" The heavily muscled Aura Pokemon replied, before you found yourself being handed over to the well muscled anthro Pikachu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that had happened you and the electric Pokemon started up a conversation while he gently rubbed the top and back of your body with one of his fingers. But while he did this Blaze looked over at Lucas with a smirk while he started a telepathic conversation and asked him, \"<i>So how far did you get with the kid, Lucas?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Not that far thanks to both you and Zapp showing up when you did.</i>\" The heavily muscled Lucario slightly bitterly shot back, before he let out a sigh. After doing this he added, \"<i>Although please understand that I am not mad or anything. I'm just disappointed. However, I am certain the little one and I will have another chance to finish what we had started today.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh? Are you sure about that. Because if you ask me I bet the kid could use a big and strong Daddy figure like me in his life.</i>\" The well muscled Arcanine countered, while he crossed his arms over his large chest. He then continued with, \"<i>And besides I'm certain Zapp cares for the kid too. So I guess to the winner goes the spoils huh?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Yes, I suppose so.</i>\" Lucas mentally replied, now with his own smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===========<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout thirty more minutes had passed until the three giant anthro Pokeon had left the bath area with you still in Zapp's hand.

The only Pokemon still out were late night workers and drunk partygoers being put in taxis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait to show you my home!\", Zapp gave a toothy grin as he approached a large apartment complex that had very few cars outside of it. Though you did remember the Pikachu saying that only celebrities and workers live in Neo Kanto. Entering the building Zapp made his way up to the tenth floor by elevator, though he pouted since he wanted to take the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to a white door with a Z, The Pikachu unlocked and opened it. Inside was a large living room with two long couches, a flat screen, and a balcony. You widened your eyes, just how much did Zapp make from fighting?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nii-san?\", a tired squeaky voice suddenly called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp in the next second quickly pulled the neck of his shirt, before gently pushing you into the crevice between his pecs. You still could see over the neckline of the shirt as the furry muscles lightly squeezed you. The Pikachu gave a small pat on his chest, before turning towards the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the pecs you saw a familar Pichu standing in a entryway. He had black and yellow Pjs with messy fur on the top of his head. He rubbed his eye and yawned as he looked tired. You remember now, this was Spark from the picture on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp gave a warm smile. \"Hey buddy, what're you doing up?\" Zapp approached his brother before picking him up and carrying him on his hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't sleep, then I heard you enter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into a room filled with toys and posters of fighters, Zapp laid his brother down and tucked him in. Rubbing Spark's head, \"Well get some rest, you got that playdate with Mizu tommarow.\" Giving a nod the brothers wished each other good night as Zapp left his brother's room. You smiled as you replayed the scene. The Pikachu was really the whole package nice, buff, and cheerful. You hoped when you returned to your world, Zapp and his friends could be with you somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp soon entered what you presumed to be his room, with the trophys and photos of him and other anthro Pokemon. Using two fingers, Zapp pulled you out of his pecs and looked at you apologetically. \"Sorry about that. I didn't know how I'd explain you to him.\". You shook your saying it was fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp placed you down on his pillow before walking over to a dresser. Your blush returned as the Pikachu stripped out of his clothes before putting on a pair of sweats and a small tank top that hugged his pecs and abs. Laying down in front of you, Zapp layed his pecs on his folded arms as he smiled at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tonight was really fun ___.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\", you nodded smiling in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp then looked off in thought.\"You know maybe I could make you a little bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zapp...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and you can come to my match next week!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zapp..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next year, me and Lucas are going touring around Hoenn next year, you should ta-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ZAPP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pikachu blinked surprised at your outburst. You sighed and closed your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zapp, all that sounds great and I'd love to do it. But.....getting home is a top priority for me. My friends are there without me and I need to get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pikachu's ears dropped as he frowned and looked to the side. \"Oh right. I'm sorry i got ahead of myself, it's just...i feel really close to you ____.\" Zapp's head turned back to you. You could see a small blush and his eyes watering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being with You, I feel more happier then I've been a while. You, Blaze, and Lucas are the only people I can open up too. When in public I have to be a powerful fighter, and at home I need to act strong for Spark's sake. I wish there was a way you could stay here, but I'm not gonna be selfish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tears began to drip down his cheeks, as Zapp let out his emotions. You couldn't believe it Blaze was right Zapp wasn't always the cheerful Pikachu he had pain not dealt with. You walked forward towards Zapp's folded arms, and embraced them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok Zapp, I know you still feel hurt. But I promise, it's all going to be ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly felt yourself get scooped up by the yellow furry fingers. You were surprised as Zapp pressed you against his lips. Although shocked, you found yourself melting into the kiss as his lips massaged your body. Pulling you away, Zapp was smiling and blushing deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I underatand ____, do matter what I'll help you get back.\"<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nSoon after, Zapp turned off the lights and layed down. He then placed you on his right pectoral before covering you with his right paw. You felt comfortable listening to Zapp's strong heartbeat and feeling the weight of his furry hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a warmth inside you, a feeling that told you to stay close with Zapp. Falling asleep with the giant brought safety to your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the sun rose, and with it........</span></div></div>",

And right after the first phone you felt and saw Zapp get up before he gently removed you from his right pectoral and placed you onto his pillow. Once he did this you saw him reach over and grab the cellphone that was on his right nightstand as he let out, \"Hello?\" Upon uttering that somewhat tired greeting you saw his ears shoot upward before he added, \"Blaze?! Why are you calling me at 9 in the morning?\" The well muscled anthro Pikachu's head then moved up and down when he went on, \"Oh, you're heading over here? Wait, your heading up the stairs right now?! Okay, I'll be at the front door to let you in. But please try to be quiet since Spark is still sleeping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the conversation was done you saw Zapp turn off the cellphone and then place it back onto his nightstand before he stood up and then faced you on the bed. After he did this you saw a sheepish smile form on his face while he confessed, \"Well, this wasn't exactly how I expected my day to start out.\" He then placed a hand down for you to get onto as he continued, \"But oh well, I honestly should have seen this coming since Blaze has always called me early in the morning when I needed to train for a match.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded your head in understanding before you asked, \"Yeah, that does make sense. But did he mention why he was heading over here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually he didn't.\" Zapp let out, before you saw he was standing in front of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that happened you saw the giant anthro electric Pokemon turn the knob and then open the door. Doing so revealed the well muscled anthro Arcanine, who was wearing a pair of tight black pants and a white button up shirt. Which you quickly noticed that a few of buttons were left undone which gave you a view of the fire type Pokemon large chest. This caused you to blush a bit while Blaze said to Zapp, \"Hey Zapp, glad to see you and the kid are up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it kind of couldn't be helped since you called out of the blue like that.\" Zapp let out, while he let out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon doing so you saw Blaze release a light chuckle before he replied, \"Yeah sorry about that. But you see I wanted to stop over and pick up the kid. This way I can spend some one on one time with him before the three of us hang out with Lucas again today. Of course that is if it's alright with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this caused you to look up at the well muscled Pikachu as you weren't for certain how he'd react. However, to your surprise you saw him give his trainer a big smile as he told him, \"Sure, I don't see why not. Besides this'll work out great since I have to take my little brother to play date in a few hours. Once I do that though I'll shoot both you text message on where to meet both Lucas and I at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSounds good to me.\" Blaze responded back with, before you were then gently handed off to the well muscled Pokemon canine. Once that happened both you and Blaze waved goodbye to Zapp. And while the Arcanine began to walk away he kept going with, \"So kid, I know I apologized to Lucas yesterday. But I should apologize to you to for interrupting you and Luca's \"fun time\".\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um that's okay. W-We didn't end up getting that far...\" You confessed, now with a deep blush on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's good to know.\" The well muscled fire dog told you, with a smile on his face. Mentally though he added on, \"<i>Besides now I have a better chance at winning your over. At least I hope I do, pup.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce your blush had went away you looked up at the giant fire Pokemon and asked, \"So what exactly will we be doing together until we hang out with Zapp and Lucas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you had uttered these words though you saw Blaze look down at you with a big smile on his face when he told you, \"Well, I was thinking you and I could.....</span></div></div>",

The Arcanine looked forward as he walked but continued to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's been awhile since I got a new pair. I tried one of my current ones on and it ripped with one flex!\", Blaze annoyingly sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where do I come in?\", you asked, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumming a little, you felt the pec you were up against bounce a little. \"Well kid, I think the best swimsuit is one that gets the wearer a good look at. So I'm gonna need you to tell me which one looks best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your body heat up. Blaze was going to model some swim wear and needed your opinion. You got a good look back at the bath, but still felt eager at seeing more of the Arcanine's 7ft hulking body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the both of arrived at a clothing store. You peaked out as a anthro Sylveon in a pink suit excitingly greeted Blaze. After informing the fairy type of his problem, the Sylveon eagerly shoved different swimsuits into Blaze's toned arms and escorted him to a change room. Gently picking you up between his thumb and finger, Blaze set you on the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up in awe as the Arcanine unbuttoned his shirt and fully exposed his pecs and abs. He then tugged his black pants down with a little difficulty, leaving his toned orange legs on display and now looming over you only in a black jock strap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright I'll start with......this!\", picking up one of the suits, Blaze walked over to the mirror in the changing room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as he slid down his jock strap, giving you a side view of his large manly glory and firm rump. Looking away to allow some privacy, you heard Blaze slightly grunting and finally letting out a relieved sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back over, you saw the Arcanine in a pair of ankle length swimwear. The back had a small v opening, allowing his tail and top of crack to show. The suit clung tightly to his thighs and bulge, as Blaze placed his foot on a stool and flexed his bulging muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, a little tight. What do you think little guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh um, yeah it's very tight!\", you blushed furiously as you stuttered. Blaze soon walked over to pick another suit. Bending over his large butt looked ready to rip the fabric as it sat a few inches away from your body. Unknown to you Blaze smirked and \"unconsciously\" swung his hips a little, bouncing his cheeks slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze then put on a speedo next, hugging his bulge and running up between his cheeks. \"Ahh~ that's better\", Blaze gave a relaxed breath as he bounced his pecs and gave a good bicep flex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't look away. The Arcanine's body pulsed and breathed power. You didn't notice Blaze walking over intill you heard him chuckle above you. Looking down at you over his creme pecs, Blaze had a sly grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya know kid, if you what.....you can check out my body.\", Blaze then placed his palms on the wall and leaned forward, filling your sky with his abs and pecs. The Arcanine then smirked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything you want, this daddy can give it to ya~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flushed, there was no fear just awe. Blaze showed affection to you as well. Zapp was nice and hot, but Blaze was more dominating and had a body that could give the greatest pleasure. This was bad, your feelings were so conflicted on what to do. Hopefully you can come to terms with this feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze soon stood back up and chuckled. \"Well maybe not now, but if you ever what to get \"adventurous\" I'll be here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nBlaze soon tried on the rest on the swimsuits, including a thong (which was more like a piece of string). He soon made his purchase and was given a cheerful farewell by the Sylveon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked out of the store with you in the previous pocket, his phone suddenly vibrated. Checking the screen, Blaze grinned and began walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zapp just texted me, told me where to meet him and Lucas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we meeting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze grinned as he said..........</span></div></div>",

However, you did your best to control this side of you since you were stil unsure of who you were attracted to the most. Becuase you knew taht you liked Zapp and Blaze, and even though you hadn't spent much time with Lucas, you couldn't deny that the Lucario obviously liked you just like the other two did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh to try to calm yourself down while you thought, \"<i>Okay, you can do this. All you have to do is spend more time with these three hot anthro Pokemon guys. And maybe myou'll be able to figure out who you like the most.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few minutes though you were broken out of your thoughts when you felt two of Blaze's fingers lift you up out of the pocket and then set down onto a bench in a huge locker room. Once that happened you saw both Zapp and Lucas looming over you with big smiles on their faces. But when you realized that the two anthro Pokemon were wearing nothing more then speedos you couldn't ehlp but blush. And upon a closer look you saw that Zapp was wearing a black speedo while Lucas was wearing a bright red speedo. And when you heard the anthro Arcanine let out a light chuckle you turned and saw that he was wearing one of the swimsuits he had modeled for you, that being a purple colored one. However, the one thing that all three had in common was the fact that their swimwear was clinging to their members and balls which caused large bugles to easily be seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while you stared you soon found yourself being lifted up into the air again before you were gently placed onto Zapp's open palm. Once that happened you looked up at the well muscled eletric mouse when he asked, \"So are you ready to have some fun while poolside, little guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um sure. But I don't have a swimsuit. And what if someone sees me? Won't cause a lot fo unwanted attention?\" You confessed, as the three each grabbed their towels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not worry little one, because since Zapp and I are fighters and Blaze was a former champion we were able to request to enjoy the pool to ourselves for a few hours.\" Lucas explained, while the three walked out into the empty pool area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see.\" You let out, before the three set their towles down onto three nearby folding chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that had been you soon found out that the muscled anthro Pokemon had decided to......</span></div></div>",

In  addition the pikachu opened up a magazine with different fighters and placed it in front of you. The trio walked a good distance away, leaving you to read the magazine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's up?\", Zapp asked, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze crossed his arms as he closed his eyes. \"I take it that we all feel a certain way about the little guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would be correct in that regard.\", Lucas nodded in confirmation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then, I have a proposition. A little race for a night with the little guy.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp and Lucas looked at each other and nodded. If they gave some alone time with you then chances are the connections built could strengthen into more then just intimate bonding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze smirked as he began to walk back. \"Just so you know I don't intend to go easy on you both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't have it any other way\", Zapp said with a determined grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas gave a small smile. \"I can sense the adrenaline exuding off of us. I can't help but feel excited.\"<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nYou sat on the fluffy towel, reading the magazine Zapp gave you. On the right was Zapp in his fighting outfit, listed below him was all his victories and notable facts. The left side had Lucas dressed in a black gi, similar feats listed as well. On a previous page, Blaze was featured dressed in a orange robe with red flame designs. The sound of the anthros returning brought your head up as they loomed above, a eager glint in thier eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for the wait kid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. \"It's ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"_____, we we're wondering if you could help us\", Lucas asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity caught you at the request. \"I asked these two to a race, could you be the referee?\", Blaze asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly agreed, much to thier delight. Scooping you up, Zapp carried you to the side of the pool before setting your body near the ledge. The ground shook as the giants rushed to the end and got into a starting stance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three had thoughts racing through thier heads as they waited to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I haven't felt like this in a long time. I will get closer to ____!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Our aura feels one when we're close. Is this what true love is?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Get ready kid, this daddy is gonna be all yours!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready, set, GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon blasted into the water, soon emerging and rustling the water with thier toned arms and legs. They seem to be neck and neck, passing then falling behind by a inch. The anthros didn't relent as they reached the wall and turned back to the start at full force. A nice long night with you awaited one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, furred fingers touched the ledge. Your eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe winner was.......</span></div></div>",

It was strange, a rural style home in the middle of a metropolis city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it might seem strange, but the designers took my saying of making it feel like home to the extreme\", Lucas said in a slightly embarrassed tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding open the door and closing it, Lucas picked you out of his pocket and placed you on his large palm. Although you grew up in a city orphanage, you often saw pictures of the homes out in Viridian forest and Lucas's resembled them perfectly. As he walked into the living room, you saw photos of a larger Lucario and a small Riolu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my father and me when I was little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up as Lucas spoke. He soon sat on a sofa and looked down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo how did you get into fighting ?\", you hesitantly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas smiled as he looked off. \"My father trained me since I was young. I learned not only his combat, but his aura techniques as well. While we lived in Sinnoh my father came across beings like you, calling themselves humans. They consisted of a husband and wife with thier son, my father took them in and gave them care. I was saddened when I heard that they escaped captivity after they were presented as a show act. Seeing how they struggled made me want to protect those who are smaller, and by fighting I am able to bring awareness to this issue. Though I never knew what happened to the human family, my father simply said that he returned them home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took in the information. Shock filled you, there had been humans before you and they returned home! Warmth filled you also as you realized what meant by Blaze saying Lucas \"looked out for the little guys\". The Lucario fought because he wanted to let people know of others pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your dad brought them home?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding. \"Yes and I actually may have the same solution.\", getting up Lucas walked over to a shelf before picking up a case. Opening it your eyes widened, it was the same stone you discovered at your picnic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This stone is capable of opening small tears in reality. Doing so will cause a link between two worlds. If I'm correct, you may have encountered this stone before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah that's what sent me here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was great! You could get back home and see your Pokemon! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut wait...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe case closed, and looking up you saw Lucas smiling sadly over his pecs at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of c-course I am happy for you ____. It's just...you going away would mean our connection would break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour excitement was replaced with dread.

So then I guess we\u2019ll just have to wait and bring up this idea to them tomorrow, then won\u2019t we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d The heavily muscled Lucario let out, as the two of you sat in contentment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever this did not last long as Lucas got up and said, \u201cForgive me for ending our relaxing moment little one. But I just remembered that I should prepare something for us to eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun had already set once Lucas had taken you into his bedroom. He then placed you onto a nearby nightstand. And upon doing this you reflected on your day with Luxas which mostly consisted of you two sitting on the couch after eating and watching movies for whole. However, these thoughts were quickly thrown to the side upon seeing the giant aura Pokemon remove his clothes thus giving you a view of his huge muscles once again. He then put on a pair of tight briefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after doing this Lucas took a hold of you and then laid on top of his sheets in his bed. And instead of sleeping you and Lucas ended up.....</span></div></div>",

Maybe we could... do it again?\", you hesitantly asked Lucas while twisting the hem of your shirt. Looking up, the Lucario looked down at you with a smile and chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course little one, this time we don't have to worry about interruptions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas pulled the front of his briefs forward and slide them down, letting his penis and balls bounce out. He then brought up his left leg making his thigh bulge, before passing it over you to the other side of the bed. he then sat his firm rump down a few feet away from you, making the bed bounce and placing his right leg on the bed. Both of Lucas's blue thighs stood above you on both sides like canyons, leading to his giant black crotch with a penis already beginning to harden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lucario then bounced his creme pecs and placed his hands on the top of his thighs, looking down at you with a eager glint in his eyes. \"Now then, we can enjoy ourselves. After all....we have the night together~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, your blush no longer of embarrassment but excitement. Taking off your clothes you walking down the blue trail to his crotch, the shadow of Lucas's penis began to cover the area as you stood in front of his balls. Your sky was filled by his shaft, only seeing from the sides Lucas putting his arms behind his head. You soon began by snuggling up to the testicles, sinking into the warm furry flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas began to feel you rubbing into his sack, he bucked his hips as a small wave of pleasure hit him. you then started to climb up his penis, almost struggling with how thick it was. Your body started to hump the large organ, Lucas's panting grew louder as he bend his knees and clenched his butt. The Lucario licked his lips as his blush darkened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of dripping aleterted you to the precum that started pouring out of Lucas's slit.You took this as an initiative to hump the penis harding and lick up the sweet and salty cum that dripped down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadow soon covered you as Lucas wrapped a black paw around you and the penis firm but gently. He then started to rub his foreskin up and down, making more precum hit you and feel the pulse from the cock as it tensed up. Your body heated up as the large muscle released it's heat and smell onto you, making you hard as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye..es just...li..ke....THAT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally with a loud grunt, Lucas released a wave of white cum from his penis, landing on his sheets and thighs. As you were pulled from the penis, most of your body was drenched in semen and musk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas brought you to his face, he had a blush with a tired smile. The Lucario then sticked out his tongue and slid it over your body covering you in saliva and massaging you with the giant wet muscle until you were clean. He then guled the cum down his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...was amazing little one. Thank you for the pleasure\", Lucas smiled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y..eah i enj..oyed it too.\", you panted out. <br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nAfter your bonding, Lucas cleaned you and himself up and changed the sheets. He then layed down and placed you on his right pec.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do believe it be best if we sleep now. We can think of a way to tell Zapp and Blaze about the plan in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and closed your eyes, starting to fall asleep to the heartbeat beneath you. \"Good night Lucas\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sleep consumed you, one of Lucas's fingers started to rub you head affectionately. \"Sleep well little one.\"<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ <br>\r\nOpening your eyes, you found the ground was no longer furred and beating but soft and cushioning. Your body was now resting on a giant pillow instead of Lucas's pec.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to the room then opened and The Lucario walked into the room dressed in a blue tank top and black sweats. Lucas smiled warmly at you. \"Ah, good morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a greeting in return and watched as the Lucario walked over and scooped you up into his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured it be best if we told the two of your planned trip right away.\" Lucas told you as he walked out of his home. \"It just so turns out today is a special occasion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head tilted at that. \"what's going on today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well today......</span></div></div>",

And once he done this he then mentally told you, \u201c<i>I can just by reading your aura that this news not only surprises you, but you are worried as well. However, please do not fear little one. For as you know he and I have had many matches and yet we are still very good friends.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this caused you to sigh in relief as you let out, \u201cWell that\u2019s good to know...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you had muttered these words you felt movement as Lucas began to walk.

Once he had done this you took a look around and saw thst you were in the Lucario\u2019s locker room. However, before you could s good look around you were taken away from Blaze, who greeted you with large grin when he said, \u201cHey kid, hope you had good time with Lucas last night. Because while he and Zapp are taking part in their match you\u2019ll be hanging out with me.\u201d He then began to walk out of locker room after you and he had wished Lucas luck. But as once he had shut the door he leaned in closer and whispered, \u201cSo did you miss your Daddy, little guy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the heavily muscled fire fig\u2019s comment caused you to blush as you nodded your head up and down giving him a wordless yes for an answer. After doing this you heard the Arcanine let out light chuckle before you realized that you were now inside of his locker room. Which when you looked around you saw that it was modesty in style with only a few posters and one large locker and armchair. But as you looked around Blaze took the chance to sit into the chair before turning on the monitor to watch the fight betweenZapp and Luxas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once it had turned on you saw both Zapp and Lucas in the middle of the ring both in their fighter gear before they shook hands and went to opposing corners in the ring.

Blaze set you on the edge of the seat cushion, already warm from his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched in awe as Blaze began peeling off his tight red short sleeve muscle shirt. He made sure to flex his black furred abs and make his neck fur ruffle by bouncing his huge pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire daddy then pulled off his jean shorts letting you see a black thong doing a poor job at containing his junk. As he pulled the strap forward, Blaze swung his large hips and brought the small undergarment down. The large penis and balls popped out and bounced against his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply observed the godly figure before you. Blaze's body towered into the sky, bulging with power. With on simple move the Arcanine's muscles flexed and enlarged with the veins pulsing. You watched as Blaze squatted down and his thighs flexed. Even when squatting, Blaze's height made his manly glory go above the seat cushion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what you see~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze spoke in his deep seductive voice, feeling his natural dominance come out as he watched you admire him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon stood back up and turned around, giving you a view of his muscled back and his large firm butt. His creme tail was moving excessively in excitement. You watched in amazement as the furry rump filled your sky and pass over, followed by the giant balls. The cushion shook and rose as Blaze sat down and both of his thighs crashed down beside you. Tumbling from the shift in the ground, you fell into the warm furry wall that was Blaze's thigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike with Lucas, Blaze's legs were more closed and his penis was already standing tall. The cushion shifted as Blaze swayed his butt cheeks side to side, finally stopping with a heavy sigh from the buff Arcanine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze brought his arms behind his head, making his biceps bulge. He then bounced his black pecs and looked down at you, a little speck in comparison to his large body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA seductive smirk graced his face. \"So little man, what fun do you want to have with your fire daddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Blaze.... </span></div></div>",

You then felt your blush return as you were gently put in-between the fire type anthro Pokemon\u2019s huge black furred pecs. You then leaned your head up against the white fur that was right above his chest. Once you did you felt one of his fingers gently rub the top of your head while he added in the form of a question, \u201cComfy, boy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, very much so.\u201d You replied, before your blush darkened. After that happened you continued with, \u201cYour muscles are so huge and well defined, Big Daddy....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon saying this you felt the two pectorals squeeze you a little bit before Blaze let out a slight growl of lust and said, \u201cMmmm, yeah Daddy likes it when you call him that along with complimenting the hard work I\u2019ve done on my body over the years.\u201d To your surprise though you then felt the giant fire dog up out of the chair as he went on with, \u201cAnd as much as I\u2019d love to rub one out while you rubbed and kissed my myscles I think we\u2019d best wait and do that another time, pup.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would you say that, Blaze?\u201d You asked, while he began to get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd upon doing so he sat back down into the chair when he pointed out, \u201cWell, it\u2019s because it seems Zapp just beat Lucas.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis prompted you to look at the TV screen and see the well muscled Pikachu with his right arm being raised in the air in victory.

Still, this connection you felt, you didn't want to sever it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you guys...i was hoping that you could.....come back with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at the three, you saw a look of surprise fall on them.

Well not only can you go home but I'm sure we can find out a way to visit each other!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at Zapp's words. It was true, that crystal brought you here, who's to say it can't again? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas placed his paw on his chin. \"That certainly is a possibility. One that i will participate in testing.\" The lucario finished with a small grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze chuckled deeply. \"Yeah anywhere you go pup I'll follow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned at all of them. \"Alright.....thank you guys. I haven't known you that long but i feel too close to be separated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pikachu, Aracanie, and Lucario smiled warmly before grouping together. Hugging each other you were gently pressed against thier toned chests. The powerful heartbeat filling your sky.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nWalking back to Lucas's home, you sat in the crook of Blaze's neck against the thick muscle. You leaned back into the soft creme fur with a sigh, garnering a chuckle from Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio and thier human soon reached the house. Walking into the home, Lucas rushed and retrieved the box containing the portal crustal. Opening the case, the Lucario set the crystal on the table followed by Blaze placing you in front of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, now from what i was told you need to focus and envision where you wish to go.\", Lucas explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and walked towards the crystal that now was bigger then you. Touching the smooth surface, you cleared your head. Old memories filled your head such as your travels, training with your team, and all the close bonds you formed. You wanted to be there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright light filled the room, gaining confused grunts from above. They were silenced as your consciousness faded.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n\"___ wa...up....wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening your eyes, through the blurriness you saw the bright blue sky and a familiar head of blue fur. But wait, Lucas's voice wasn't booming as much and he seemed....lower then before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up you saw creme colored pecs covered by a blue tank top, but.....smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasped as your vision cleared. Before you Lucas was kneeling down but not as a giant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lucario grinned before helping you up. \"Yes it was quite the surprise when i woke up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could question more, a pair of toned yellow furred arms wrapped around you and pulled you into a strong chest. Looking up, you saw Zapp grinning down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"____! Your normal size!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awkwardly smiled before feeling a large paw being placed on your head. A deep chuckled rang as Blaze slyly grinned down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even normal sized, you still a squirt compared to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pouted slightly before laughing. The others followed as they took in your happy face.

And how once you reached as certain age you went on a journey throughout your entire region to try and be the best trainer you could be.

Thankfully though after telling them that only certain types partake in what they did in their world. So thankfully they promised not to cause any problems, but you did end up having to promise to take them to a gym so that they could keep with their training. To which of course you were more then happy to do so after showing them around town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut upon reading the start of the town after finally getting out of the forest you were shocked to see a Pokemon Center was built right next to the orphanage you grew up in.This made you really curious since there was never one there during all those years you lived in this town. In fact if you remember right you had heard talk of them wanting to build a Pokemon Center, but work hadn't even been started on it yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now you were really curious as to who could be running it since no Nurse Joy lived in your town.

After gazing at each he let out a happy cry with a small spark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas smiled as his eyes flashed again. \"He says thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucas you can understand him?\", you asked curiously, getting a nod in return. An idea struck you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Pikachu, can you tell us what happened after I vanished?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu eagerly nodded, he began to quickly speak and move his paws as if gesturing to everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, he says after you vanished a massive power outage hit every building in town.\", Lucas explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou widened your eyes. Did the crystal cause the loss of power? You nodded at Pikachu to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so... after you disappeared I decided to help give some temporary power. The others were stuck in their pokeballs so I haven't been able to get them out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBending down, you rubbed Pikachu's head. \"Great job in helping everyone buddy.\", a cute chu~ was your reply. \"But can you show me the others so I can see them please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu quickly bounced up and ran over to a cart at the end of the room. You and the three anthros walked over to the cart holding two pokeballs. One had a fire sticker while the other had a blue flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo your team is in those balls?\", Zapp said curiosity in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, grabbing both of the pokeballs and turning to the open lobby. Taking a breath you pressed the buttons and threw the balls in the air as they opened and released two white rays of energy. As the light cleared you found yourself knocked to the floor by a heavy and furry weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ark!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening your eyes you smiled as you saw a familiar Arcanine nuzzling you. You rubbed his head as you sat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Arcanine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over, you saw a blue jackal like pokemon standing. He had a serious gaze as he approached you. Standing up, you were a little shorter as Lucario stood in front of you. The Lucario closed his eyes and sighed as he pulled you into an embrace, being careful of his chest spike. You smiled as you rubbed the aura pokemon's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were brought out of the tender moment when Arcanine let out a growl. Turning, you saw the fire type taking a battle stance as he spotted the anthros. While Zapp and Lucas tried to appear calm, Blaze was taking a fighting stance as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anthro smirked as he brought up his fists. \"So you wanna fight fire with fire~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk first, you could've sworn that was a reference. Second, this was gonna get out of hand! Luckily your Lucario stepped in between the two and held up his paw, showing a blue flame. Arcanine began to calm down and Blaze as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok guys, these three helped me out. Their world is just....different from ours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then went on to explain everything. From your disappearance to meeting all three anthros. Your pokemon were slightly surprised, but by the end walked up to the three and all gave their collective thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp, Lucas, and Blaze smiled as they formally introduced themselves. Your pokemon were just as enthusiastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you were reunited with your team, what was your next plan of action?</span></div></div>",

But after seeing that everything seemed to be going well you suggested, \"Hey you guys. Why don't we head to my house before I show you around town?\" You then looked down at your Pikachu when you added, \"So what do you say buddy? Did you, Arcanine, and Lucario want to come with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight those words had left your lips though you quite surprised when you saw the three Pokemon look at each other before your partner look up at you and shook it's head before it made it's response. And as if on cue Lucas translated as he told you, \"He says they'd love to. But he promised the head nurse that he watched over the Pokemon Center while she was out to ask someone to get the power back on. And since you let out Arcanine and Lucario, he says that this'll make it that much easier to keep the hurt Pokemon safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this caught you a little off guard at first. However, you knew your three Pokemon were very protective of not only you, but of any other Pokemon that you four would run into that was hurt and needed to be taken to a Pokemon Center. And so knowing how the three main members of your team were you smiled at them and replied, \"Of course, I know how three you are. So you guys do a good job protecting alll of the Pokemon here, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this you saw all three of your team members nod their heads before you, Zapp, Blaze, and Lucas walked out of he building after giving your farewells. And after doing so you turned the three as Zapp asked, \"So where do you live?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I'll show you. It's actually not that far form here.\" You explained, before the three of you started to walk down the dirt road once again. And after about ten minutes of walking you brought the three anthros to a modest two story home that was next to a lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd upon seeing the layout the Lucas commented, \"It's very nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, now come on let's head inside.\" You utged on, as you then walked towards the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then got the spare key left under the welcome mat to which you unlocked the front door and turned on the light before ushering the three heavily muscled anthro Pokemon inside. Once you had done this you then started to show them around the house. But while you did this.......</span></div></div>",

A sudden thump accompanied by a \"OW!\" rang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, you saw Zapp rubbing his head with crouching over. There was a small red mark on the yellow fur and the door way had a small dent at the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah man Zapp, you ok?\", Blaze asked as he came over concern on his snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pikachu soon smiled before rising again. \"It's ok, I just bumped my head a little!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were relieved he was fine, but you held in a sigh as you saw Zapp standing to his full height. Before he was the shortest out of the anthros. But somehow, Zapp now looked....taller then Blaze!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't the only one to notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what the, Zapp when did you grow a few inches!\", Blaze asked as he now had to look up to see the Pikachu's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp was stunned at the sudden shift in size. Everything in this world had been the same size back home, and all of a sudden everything seems smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm.....maybe I had a growth spurt?\", Zapp awkwardly grinned as he shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze gained a tick mark on his head. \"You haven't had a growth spurt in years! Not to mention you don't suddenly grow a few feet from a growth spurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas stayed quiet while the two went back and forth about the issue at hand. You looked over at the Lucario as he rubbed his chin and looked deep in thought. Approaching him, you set a hand on his toned blue arm snapping him out of his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucas...are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lucario smiled and patted your shoulder. \"Yes ____, I apologize I was in deep thought about the situation at hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and smiled in return before deciding to calm down the two. Walking over you saw Zapp had a look of panic on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Arceus, what if I got some rare sickness!\", the Pikachu rubbed the fur on his head furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly tried to calm the situation. Rushing forward, you wrapped your arms around Zapp's large body and placed your head against the area beneath his pecs. His large yellow furred muscles were stretching his clothes more and made them look painted on. Zapp stopped his worrying and looked down in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to be fine Zapp, we'll figure this out ok.\", you softly spoke as you rubbed the hard muscled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp blushed a little before nodding and placing his large paws on your back to return the embrace. \"Ok....thank you ___.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling away you smiled and pointed towards another room. \"Come on, I'll show you guys the rest of my house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lead the way the sound of the loud thuds followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After you had finished up your tour of your house to Blaze, Lucas, and the now 8 foot tall Zapp. The three of you headed back outside just in case the anthro electric mouse had another growth spurt. Or one of the other anthros had one of their growth spurts. And somehow not to your surprise as the three of you sat out in the open by the water you heard the heavily muscled Lucario let out a gasp/grunt which caused you, Blaze, and Zapp to look at him. And upon doing so the three of you gasped yourselves as you watched in amazement and shock as the Aura Pokemon began to grow right front of you guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this caused you to become a bit concerned as you asked, \"Lucas, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Yes, I am fine. I sense no changes in my aura.</i>\" Lucas mentally replied, while you saw him grow in both height and muscle which caused his clothes to become even more skin tight then Zapp's were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once he was done growing you saw that he had grown up to 9 feet in height. Along with that his clothes looked like they could tear apart at the slightest flex of any of his huge muscles. However, upon knowing that two of the three anthros had grown you soon realized what was going on here. And with that in mind you walked over to the sitting Lucario and told him and the other two, \"Guys, I think I know what's going on. Although it might seem odd. But I just remembered that anthro like Pokemon like you guys seem to have growth spurts. Sadly there's no real reason behind it. For some reason it just happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you've seen this before, kid?\" Blaze asked, as he stood up and walked towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, kind of. Because you see when I and my team were traveling I did run into a few different trainers who had these giant sized anthro Pokemon with them. But I guess they didn't use them for normal like battles. Therefore they didn't count as one of the six Pokmeon you could have on your team.\" You explained, as you rubbed the back of your head. You then let out a light chuckle and added, \"Of course back then I never gave it much thought about the matter back then. But now it remembering that and seeing in person, it all makes sense honestly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you know how big we'll grow up to then?\" Zap, asked, while he also stood up onto his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head from side to side and responded back with, \"No. Sadly I have no idea how big you guys will get. But I'm sure it won't be too big since the ones I met were in the heights of between 10 or 15 feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well as reassuring as that is. I believe we'd best go get some new clothes until we have another growth spurt.\" Lucas suggested, before he stood up onto his feet as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded your head in agreement as the three of you heard the Lucario's clothes kind of tear a little in some spots. And so you made sure to grab some money to buy Zapp and Lucas some new clothes along with extra money just in case something happened along the way into town. And as it so happened while you and the three anthro Pokemon walked into town......</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you walked into town with the three large anthros, people looked in awe as your group passed by. Anthro pokemon were rare and if you could remember the only one in your town worked at the clothes store coincidently. However, just as you were about to turn the corner to the block where the store was, a series of tears rang out from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, you grew a blush as you saw Zapp and Lucas' clothes suffered a large casualty. Lucas' shirt had teared open and his creme pecs popped out, his sweatpants grew rips that let his blue thighs poke through. Zapp's pants teared to where only they remained from his thighs down and a rip formed in the back and his boxers that made his firm yellow cheeks exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two large pokemon looked in surprise at their exposed bodies and ripped clothes. You were brought out of your staring as Blaze patted your shoulder and pointed at the street. The people on the street were all staring with a blush, boys and girls alike at the perfect furry muscles now free of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoughing into your fist, you got the attention of the two and gestured with your head while trying covering your blush. All of you resumed your walk with the occasional tear, intill you stood in front of the store. All the anthros needed to duck in order to enter the store.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nThe store was currently empty and the only one present was a anthro Primeape reading a magazine. He wore a black tank top and gym shorts that showed his athletic form. As the door bell rang he looked up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, what can i...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magazine dropped from the Primeabe's paws as he looked at the door. You were standing before three anthros taller then you, heck two were taller then the door. The tallest were half naked as thier clothes were almost destroyed. The Arcanine had an amused grin as he pointed a thumb at the 8 and 9 foot anthros. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These two went through one of those sudden growth spurts. You got anything that could fit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Primeabe cleared his throat and nodded now over his surprise. \"I've got some shipments in but it may be a little limited.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up, the Primeabe headed back to the storeroom and looked through the shipment. Having anthro pokemon that would grow randomly, led to stores pushing to have larger clothes just in case. Grabbing two of the boxes the store worker brought them to the fitting room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Primeabe let out a breath and patted the boxes. \"Alright, here are some choices to choose from. Feel free to try whatever on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp and Lucas thanked the Primeabe  before each grabbing a box that they could carrying with one paw. Just as the cashier was about to head back to his desk, another loud tear came from behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah what the hell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, your blush returned as you saw Blaze had grown as well! The Arcanine took back his place as the tallest as he now stood at 10 feet tall. His red shirt teared below his pecs and the bottom slid down to show his valley of abs. His jean button and zipper came undone, letting his clothed bulge hang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned back to the cashier only to find the Primeabe already heading back to the storeroom and coming back with another box before handing it to Blaze. The fire daddy chuckled and thanked him before heading to the fitting room and ducking after almost hitting the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the three anthros had on a new outfit and a good selection. Zapp had on a black shirt that looked painted on his muscles and black pants with a yellow belt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas had on a white tank top that gave a peak of his pecs and black sweatpants that still showed the roundness of his butt. He also had a half foot of sports tape running up from his wrist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze had on another red shirt that was a size too short. The bottom of his abs were showing and the clothing squeezing his firm muscles. The Arcanine wore a pair of jeans that hugged all his muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou payed the Primeabe and thanked him. The cashier smiled and put his feet on the desk and resumed his magazine reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, the names Owada and if you need anything just call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and started to pick up the bags of extra clothes only for Blaze to pick them up with his palm. \"Don't worry I got it kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the three anthros made your way back to your home. Most people were inside now as the sky turned orange and the sun began to set. It was strange how the pokemon towered over you again, not on the same scale as before but your head was barely above thier waists now.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nBack at home you and the settled in doing different things. While you were looking in your kitchen looking for something to cook you looked into the living room to three different sights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBending down to enter the bathroom was Blaze who had a towel meaning he was going to bathe. Zapp was laying on his stomach watching T.V as he watched the pokemon match like a giddy child. Finally, Lucas was sitting on the porch connected to your house. His toned back was facing you as he seem to be meditating in the moonlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a strange urge to interact with one of them. The question is who?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to spend time with....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You found yourself wanting to go spent some time with Lucas outside. Although you were a bit worried about dinner overcooking. Although since he was right outside on the back porch you knew you could probably be able to keep an eye on it if need be. And so you walked away from cooking food and walked towards the kitchen door before you opened it and proceeded to walk outside. And once you had done so you found yourself blushing when you saw that the heavily muscled Lucario wasn't wearing a shirt thus giving you a great view of his huge pecs and rock hard abs. But while you stared you heard a voice in head when the Aura Pokemon remarked, \"<i>I don't mind you staring at my body like that considering what you and I have already done together. But if you wish to talk with me, then I am more then willing to have a conversation with you.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this though only caused your blush to darken while you let out, \"Oh, um, yes. That's why I came out here actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after you had said this you saw one of Lucas's red eyes open before it fell onto you as he asked, \"<i>So then, what would you like to talk about?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um well I'm not sure actually.\" You admitted, while you took a few seconds to think of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you thought of a topic to talk over with Lucas you heard the Lucario let out a light chuckle before you saw him stand up and then face you. Once he had done this you then felt one of his paws lay itself onto your right shoulder while he reassured you with, \"You are quite a adorable when you're flustered like this. However, you do not need to feel as though you have to force yourself to spend time with any of us. For I am certain that both Zapp and Blaze felt the same way about you as I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you, Lucas.\" You replied, as you found yourself staring into his red eyes. But while you did this you added, \"So how has your first day in my world been for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has been just fine. In fact the Aura here is no different then the Aura in our world.\" Lucas explained, You felt that same paw move from your shoulder and then place itself underneath your chin when the heavily muscled Pokemon went on with, \"But now even though you could have chosen to spend some time with either one of us. I will admit that I am glad that you choose me first.\" You then saw him lean down until his lips gently pressed themselves against in a short kiss. And even though the kiss was a bit awkward due to the size difference you didn't care as you could tell that Lucas was being very gentle. You then saw him break the kiss as he smiled at you and suggested, \"Now with that said you had best go see how the other two are doing. But do not worry about the food overcooking for I will keep an eye on dinner for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Lucas.\" You let out, to which you saw the Lucario nod his head and the two of you headed back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon doing so you felt that same paw that had been underneath your chin place itself onto your back as he rubbed it a few times and then walked away. After he had done this you then looked out in the living room and now instead of a excited expression on Zapp's face you saw a confused one. This must of meant that second Pomeon match didn't involve either fighting Pokemon along with not taking place in a boxing ring anymore. So you figured that you'd have to explain things to the heavily muscled anthro mouse Pokemon. However, once you looked at the closed bathroom door you beacme worried since you knew that you bathtub wasn't the biggest which must of menat that Blaze might be having trouble bathing. So he might need to help too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after taking a few seconds to think things over you decided that you would go help out......</span></div></div>",

You let out a surprised yelp as the anthro pulled you to his strong chest and wrapped his large furry arms around you. You blushed as your head was against the bottom of his large pecs and your waist right in between his thighs, his furred feet paws were much larger and rested in front of yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's weird...thier not throwing any kicks or punches, thier only using their type attacks.\", Zapp squinted his eyes as he focused on the Infernape striking Electivire with a fire wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumming as you heard the heartbeat behind you. \"Well...here in my world Pokemon battle with thier type moves to get stronger and evolve. How do you train Zapp?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anthro Pikachu rubbed the back of his head. \"Well when I was around 13 is when I evolved into a Pikachu. When I got into fighting and started working out I learned more moves to incorporate, all I'd known before training was thundershock and tail whip. But after I took up Blaze as a couch he gave me the regiment and I learned how to use electro ball and iron tail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded against the firm chest. \"I see, while you do train and get stronger through training here, a pokemon get's stronger by working with a trainer and cooperating during a battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....so here pokemon get stronger and battle through trainers like you.\", Zapp grinned as he gave you light hug to squeeze you with his buff arms. \"Like you and your pokemon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at his excitement and the comforting pressure being applied. Looking up, Zapp had his eyes closed as he hugged you and simply enjoyed having you in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp soon released you from the hug as you stood up. You smiled and rubbed the head of the anthro getting a deep chu~ in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna check on Blaze then we'll eat dinner ok?\", you asked getting a happy nod before Zapp began watching the battle again with restored interest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon...</span></div></div>",

Sure it isn't small, but you doubted that a 10 foot heavily muscled anthor Arcanine could fit in the tub without having some sort of issues. And so after you had knocked on the door you asked, \"Hey Blaze, are you doing okay in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at frist you didn't get a response from the anthro Pokemon. But after a few seconds had passed you saw the door being slowly opened until the head of the buff fire dog could stick out of it. And upon doing so you saw him smile at you when he replied, \"Oh hey there, kid. That's sweet of you to check up on me. But I didn't have much trouble taking a bath. Sure it might of been a tricky to be comfortable, but that's alright due what happened earlier day and everything.\" However, right after he had spoken these words you saw a grin form on the Arcanine's face as he went on with, \"But I could use your help with something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay.\" You let out, before Blaze opened the door for you and you walked inside the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you had done this though you heard the door being closed and then locked. You then heard Blaze walk up to you until he was right behind you. You found yourself being held in the heavily muscled anthro Pokemon canine's arms as you heard him inahle your scent to which he told you in a husky toned voice, \"There. Now Daddy and his boy can enjoy each other's company without anyone else getting in. Unless they knock on the door of course.\" You then felt his huge tongue stick out of his mouth before you felt it move up and down the left side of your neck. Upon doing this you heard Blaze let out a hum of pleasure while he continued, \"Mmm, Daddy is really happy that you're here though, boy. So let me just hold you up against this huge beefy body of mine for a while. Unless you wanted to do something else with me? To which I'm more then happy to do with such a cute human like yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just found yourself blushing a dark shade of red as you were held up against Blaze's rock hard stomach. And along with this the top of your head was just barely touching the bottom of Blaze's huge black furred pecs. You then found yourself letting a slight moan once you felt Blaze start to kiss and then suck the same side of your neck that he had licked a few seconds ago to which you found yourself being almost engulfed in the Arcanine's huge muscled arms. Along with this you then saw a large bulge form on the inside of Blaze's towel which you knew meant that the anthro Pokemon was starting to get turned on. Although so to were you as you felt one of Blaze's huge hands go down to the front of your pants and then gently squeeze your own balls and growing member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before the two of you could really do anything else there was a knock on the door.

The reason why you were going into this cave though was because you had heard that there had been sightings of a Mewtwo in this cave. And the description of it is what brought you here since people had said that it looked like a normal Mewtwo. The only difference however was that it had large and well defined muscles around over his body. And so once you had learned of this you knew that you had to try and search cave to see if it was true. But while you carefully made your way through the cave's narrow pathway you heard the large noise causing you to turn and look upward only to see some loose rocks from the roof of the cave start to fall towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this made you do what came naturally which was let out a loud gasp of shock and close your eyes while you put your arms in front of yourself. Once you did this though you were surprised when you never felt the rocks make contact with your body. This rpompted you to open your eyes and see that the rocks were being held in place in the air. You then heard a voice inside your head that was deep and yet full of curiosity as it asked, \"<i>Why have you come here, human? You are quite lucky that I had stopped those rocks form falling onto you.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this you turned your head and let out another gasp when you saw the well muscled Mewtwo a few feet away from you with his left arm extended upward in the air. You then saw him extend his right hand before you felt yourself being pulled towards the Physic type Pokemon. Once this happened you found yourself standing in front of the anthro like Pokemon's well muscled chest before he lowered both of his arms which caused the rocks to fall to the ground thus blocking the way to the entrance of the cave. This caused you to worry a little although that did not last long though as Mewtwo placed a hand onto one of your shoulders and told you, \"<i>Do not worry human, the front entrance to the cave may be blocked. But I can take you the to the other entrance on the other side of the cave if you'd like.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? That would be great. Thank you, Mewtwo.\" You replied, relief clear in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before the two of you could start making your way to the other entrance you saw the well muscled Pokemon's eyes widen for a moment before he started to grow right in front of you.

Today had been a rather slow day, not much had happened, and you were sitting on the sandy beach in front of your house, staring out into the glistening waves lit brilliantly by the sun's light. You closed your eyes and laid back, basking in the sun's warmth. Sadly, your soaking of the sun's rays was abruptly interrupted by a sudden appearance of a thick overcast. A small wind picked up, and the waves began to beat more intensely against the shore. Knowing full well how dangerous a rough wave was, you stood up and started to head back in to your home when you heard something burst forth out of the waves, uttering a loud, regal cry. Along with the darkened skies, you heard the rumble of thunder in the distance, and felt rain start to fall. Rain, wind, darkened skies, something coming out of the ocean. Your heart skipped a beat, it couldn't be!

You were 7 years old and had no parents, you didn't know if your parents are dead or alive.  You've been out here for two days and didn't know what to do.  Wait for death or keep on living.  <br>\r\nWhen you were thinking of doing something you heard noise in the back of the deep dark cave.  You turn to the entrance to run when you trip on a root growing out of a crack.  To make matters worse the root was stuck to your boot.  You cower in fear of what creature could try and eat you.  You the heard somebody say something here let me help you.  You then felt a twig break and you were lifted up into the air.  You had your eyes closed, but you opened them to see a blue eyed Lucario.  This would be nice this Lucario wasn't 30 feet tall.<br>\r\n\"Hello little human.\"  He said.  His voice was strong and deep, which told you he was male.  But you were afraid of him,  he looks like if a Pokemon kept using growth.  You also heard his voice.  You remembered that when you were born you had the ability to understand what Pokemon said.<br>\r\nYou then mustered up all the courage you had and said while stuttering, \"H-h-hi-i-i.\"<br>\r\n\"What's your name?\"  You covered your eyes as if it would protect you.  He then saw you were scared and said, \"Hey don't be scared, I won't hurt you I promise.\"  As he rubs your back.<br>\r\nYou then were calmed down by this and said, \"I don't remember.\"<br>\r\n\"Well my name is Arlio.\"  He said, as he made a pose.  You had to admit he was kinda funny.<br>\r\n\"Alrio I'm sorry if I passed into your home.\"<br>\r\n\"That's okay.  I allow Pokemon or humans to come in, it gets kinda lonley around here.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh okay. Well I don't know where else to go?\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't remember anything.  I sometimes just go anywhere.\"<br>\r\n\"Well.....\" He then had an idea.  \"You could stay with me.\"<br>\r\nYou looked at him not sure what to say or how to react.  Sure he was nice, but he's big.<br>\r\nHe then broke your thought by saying please.  I promise with my soul I will protect you.\"  He then made the Lillapup face.<br>\r\nYou laughed at this and realized that you decided to stay with him.  \"Sure.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!  H said, as he hugged you, but gently, also his fur was soft and warm kinda like a pillow.<br>\r\nHe hen sat down and said,  \"What do you want to do?\"<br>\r\nYou thought and said....</span></div></div>",

You ve always like pokemon.. bigger. To you, there's nothing like soft, plush pokebelly, with its dimples and rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Currently, you were walking through a forest as you're cheeks flushed from the previous embarrassing self assessment. Youre charmeleon waddling behind you, you noticed something about the forest. It was extremely fertile, was the only way you could put it. The trees and bushes branches sagged, overburden with plump juicy fruit. Youre charmeleon had already plucked an apple bigger than his head and was already munching away. This was all odd to you, but a happy fatty charmeleon chirp in delite at his treat quelled your anxietys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this peacefulness was suddenly interrupted by a loud; THOOM sound, followed by what sounded like ravenous eating. You quickly hid behind a bush, chameleon following suit. You were reneed further confused by the resounding 'UUUUUURRP' that echoed throuought the woods. The belch was monstrous, making your ears ring. but then you saw it. What you thought were trees lifted themselves from the ground and prover themselves to portly legs and paws. Following those feet up you were then met with door jammin hips and a wide waist riddied with rolls and folds. The massive  cream colored gut and the spike buried between his moobs, proved that this was an lucario who was.</span></div></div>",

Now yes you had been a trainer when you were younger, but of course that was before you turned 18. Once this happened you decided to leave your Pokemon with your mother so that she wasn't lonely while you headed out alone on a more person journey of sorts. That being that you had heard rumors of a 3000 foot Lucario with huge muscles and none the less wearing clothes close to a huge mountain. Of course you knew not to get your hopes up too high since they were rumors after all. But in the back of your mind you hoped that they were real since it would amazing to seeing such a creature with your own eyes. And besides how knew maybe you and the giant Pokemon could become friends. Or perhaps even more....which having such a thought caused your face to turn a bright red. This was because well you found yourself attracted to males more specifically the more muscled male Pokemon. Of course the ones you had traveled with when you were younger you had never done anything since you considered a part of your family. So that's why you hoped that these rumors were true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy while you walked along the path you quickly took note of how dark it suddenly got. This caused you to turn to your right, and upon doing so you let out a loud gasp of shock. There off in the distance about a good yard away from you was in the giant clothed Lucario that the rumors had spoken of. And they were not wrong as you saw nothing but the yellow fur of the Aura Pokemon underneath the white color sleeveless shirt which gave an awesome view of his large arms. And upon looking lower you saw a bright red speedo which showed off the creature's firm looking butt and short tail. And before you knew it the Lucario turned around giving you a view of huge chest which was clearly visible with the type of shirt he was wearing. In fact you could carely see the spike in the middle of his pecs from all of the muscle he had. And by the looks of it he was lifted two very huge boulders in each of hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now that you found this amazing giant Pokemon how do you get his attention? Do you just walk up to him? Or do you try a different method to get him to notice you?</span></div></div>",

This way you and I can have a easier time talking with each other.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure....\" You let out, as you got onto the right paw and stood in the center of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon doing this though gave you a clear view of the Lucario's large and firm chest to which you could also see both of his nipples that were partly visible on both sides of his sleeveless shirt. Seeing caused a blush to once again spread across your face to which you tried to look elsewhere to get rid of these sexual thoughts. However, when you tried to do this you only saw the large right bicep of the Aura Pokemon that was huge even though he wasn't flexing it at all. And so you decided to look up at the giant muscled Lucario's face and apologize for staring. But when you did move your gaze to his face you saw a very sfot expression had formed on it as you then felt his other paw move towards you before it gently rubbed your head. And as you looked into his red yes he told you, \"<i>There is no need to apologize for having sexual thoughts about me. Because in truth I have always wanted a companion to care, and protect.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have?\" You asked, clearly caught off guard by the Pokemon's response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then saw the Luario nod his head before he turned and started to walk away from where he had been standing causing huge pawprints on the ground. And within a few minutes of time had passed you soon saw the giant muscled Lucario had taken you to......</span></div></div>",

You just had to make sure he saw you first. You make your way around his body till your face to face with his massive maw. Carefully scaling Charizard's snout you position yourself in front of his eyes and as loud as you can shout his name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharizard shifts a little hearing his name being called by a small voice. He's about to yawn when he hears that same voice shouting at him not to. Wondering why, the giant Pokemon slowly opens his eyes. He blinks a few times to clear his vision as he spots something on his snout. Is it a bug? No not a bug, it looks familiar somehow. Blinking a few more times Charizard see's the little thing clearly now. It's his trainer! Blinking a few more times to make sure he's not hallucinating or dreaming, the big fire type Pokemon sees that is without a doubt his trainer. Your just very very tiny to him. He hears you trying to tell you something and listens closely to make out your words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charizard, Thank Arceus your awake. Listen you grew in your sleep. Your massive now. Be very careful moving around.\" Your not sure if your Pokemon can hear you. Your about to talk to him again when you let out a startled epp. Charizard uses a massive digit to gently pin you to his snout as he stands up. When Charizard is at his full height he removes the digit pinning you and allows you to move around a bit. \"Well at least, he can hear me\", you say to yourself. Still what are you going to do now. Charizard is way to big to take into battles or even fight gyms. Hell he'd probably crush the gyms if he wasn't careful. You know that Pokemon grow sometimes but never this much. At best Pokemon grow a few feet not hundreds. On the other hand who would actually say no to something this collusive. As you ponder what to do, Charizard startles you again by picking you up and placing you carefully on the ground. As he begins lay down on his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharizard looks at the minture pond in front of him. It was a lake last night but now he could see the bottom of it. No pokemon seemed to be living in it and it smelled alright. You giant Pokemon looks at you for second just to make sure your safe before sticking his head into the water and drinking it. You watch in amazement as Charizard just gulps down gallon after gallon of water. When Charizard if finished the lake is completely drained. Charizard sits up and pats his belly. He looks down at you wondering what to do now after a couple of seconds Charizard picks you up and places you gently in his palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He then points to you, then to him and makes a gesture with his free hand. While a little confusing the message eventually gets to you. \"I'll follow you anywhere.\" You gently rub your Pokemon's big snout. \"Thanks big guy. Well why don't we do a bit of exploring. We haven't seen any towns or cities for awhile. So I think it's safe to say this place is uncharted. Who knows what we can find.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look towards the sky. \"I just wish it wasn't so cloudy out.\" Just then Charizard lowers you back down to the ground. You get off and wonder what your big Pokemon was going to do. You watch as Charizard opens his mouth and you can see particles of energy gathering close to the big zard's mouth. Before you ask what your big partner was doing. Charizard sweeps his head in an arc firing the biggest hyper beam you'd ever seen across the sky. The resulting blast tore open the sky as sunlight broke through the clouds and illuminated the ground. The area around you was now bathed in sunlight as if the cloudy day had just been illusion. Charizard smiles down at you happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour shocked. You knew hyper beam was a powerful move but powerful enough to cleave the clouds. You gaze up in wonder at you Pokemon. \"Charizard... that was amazing!\", you exclaim. Charizard smiles down at you, happy to have been of assistance. Your still awe struck by what just happened. Charizard, your Charizard had just created a sunny day in the most extreme way possible. With a single display your Pokemon has proved without a doubt to be the strongest Pokemon alive. You decided that you wanted to see more of what Charizard was capable. \"Okay big guy pick me back up, and get my camping supplies. We're going to...</span></div></div>",

The massive Charizard leaped into the air and flapped his wings creating small tornadoes as he easily gained height. From this you gathered Charizard was just as excited to see what he could do as you were. Gently closing his paw into a fist making extra sure not to hurt you, your Pokemon rocketed across the sky. You realized that the sheer speed and wind you were going would have hurt so your Pokemon kept you in a fist to protect you from those hazards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about twenty minutes of flying you wondered where Charizard was heading. Just as you were about to ask, you felt the gargantuan fire type slow to a stop. When he opened his palm, you realized you were at the whirl islands in Johto. Which surprised you because the last you checked you were somewhere in Kanto. It took even the fastest train at least four hours to get from Kanto to Johto so this was another fun surprise about Charizard's new size. Your Pokemon set you down on the roof of one of the four caves that made up the island. He then made a gesture with his paws to his horns. You got the message. \"Cover your ears.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou routed around in your bag to find your Noise cancelling headphones and strapped them on. Charizard landed in the water with a thud, the waves not even making it up to his waist. He sucked in air and gave a massively deafening roar. Even with your headphones on your head rang as your Pokemon made his intentions clear. All other Pokemon and even other trainers, any who heard that knew to stay as far away as possible from here. In addition to making sure this match would be uninterrupted, Charizard managed to wake the Guardian of the sea, Lugia from his slumber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Legendary Pokemon shot out of the ocean and into the air to see what could have caused such a commotion. Lugia in all his glory would have been a marvel for any to see, but next to the five hundred foot tall Charizard, the guardian of the sea looked like a bigger then average bug. Lugia looked upwards in shook to see the biggest Pokemon he had ever seen. Charizard looked down at Lugia and snorted loudly. As if to say, \"This was a legendary Pokemon?\" He then made a taunting gesture with his paw, urging Lugia to hit him with it's best shot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia took offense to this disrespect and decided to teach this over sized salamander who was boss. He reeled back his head and hit Charizard square in the chest with a powerful aeroblast. Charizard didn't even budge. The blast didn't even tickle. Lugia tried a different attack and hit Charizard with a hydro pump. Surely just because Charizard was big didn't mean he was invulnerable to his own types weakness did it? Turns out it did. Charizard looked where Lugia had hit him with his hydro pump and flicked away the water. Looking at the guardian at the sea questionably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia did not let up though despite his two failed attempts he was determined to prove to this Salamander that he was powerful. The guardian of the sea hit Charizard with everything he had. Aeroblast, hydro pumps, psychics, ancient power, everything.  But no matter what Lugia dis your titanic Pokemon just took it all. Not budging an inch. When Lugia exhausted nearly everything, in a last ditch effort to do some damage to this monstrosity, Lugia gathered all his power and hit Charizard with the biggest psychic he had. Like all the other attacks however it did nothing. He looked up in fear at Charizard wondering what he was going to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharizard wasn't mad, he was just disappointed. Using two scaled digits the gigantic Pokemon gave Lugia a weak flick. This weak flick sent Lugia hurtling to the ground. Despite the fall Lugia remained mostly unfazed. He was however, unfortunately exhausted. And could do nothing but watch and wonder what this Charizard had planned for him. Lugia didn't have to wait long as Charizard reached down and plucked his tiny form from the ground and gently brushed off the sand. Before bringing Lugia to his mouth and popping the little legendary in like a piece of candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharizard didn't swallow or chew Lugia he simply sucked on the Pokemon feeling his weak struggles as the so called Guardian of the sea was tossed around his mouth. Getting sucked on by his gums and licked by his mouth. Charizard admitted the only thing Legendary about the guardian of the sea was his taste. It was like salt water taffy. Sweet and slightly salty. Fitting, Charizard mused. As this continued until Lugia lost the will to even struggle as his body was simply tossed around by this giant Pokemon. Finally after what felt like an eternity, Charizard reached into his mouth a pulled out the tasty little morsel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia gasped for air, as his body was coated in a sticky warm saliva. He didn't get to rest long however as Charizard lowered Lugia down to you and pinned the tiny legendary under a single digit. Charizard then pointed at your belt that held your Pokeballs and pointed at Lugia and gave a questioning look. \"Oh, do I want to catch Lugia?\" You looked at the legendary pinned under your partner and back at Charizard. It was any trainer's dream to catch a legendary Pokemon, much less see one. But then you realized that Charizard was now greater then any legendary could ever be. \"Hm, nah, but thanks for the offer Charizard. As long as I have you I'm happy.\" Your Pokemon knelt down and gave you an affectionate kiss, also coating you in saliva. \"But if you want.\" You start to say. \"You can keep him. You seem to like him. Just don't hurt him or swallow him.\" Charizard beamed at you and then lifted Lugia back up to his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharizard began talking to Lugia in the Pokemon language. \"Hear that, I get to keep you. My legendary little snack. Better get used to being in my mouth.\" Lugia to weak to talk just grimaced. \"And if I like maybe, I'll put you in other places as well.\" Lugia eyes widened a little at that. And was about to try to say something but was merely tossed back in Charizard's mouth. Charizard continued sucking on Lugia loving his new little toy's taste. He wondered how other legendary's might taste. And looked back down at you happily. You didn't get the exchange that Charizard had with Lugia but, you assumed it was fine. \"So you like Lugia huh, big guy. Keeping him safe in your mouth so you din't squish him, good call.\" You say this oblivious to your Charizard's mischievous nature. \"Well why don't we find some other Legendaries to challenge. Charizard beams at you again and scoops you up. Eager to find more toys. </span></div></div>",

Turning your head, the source of warmth was spotted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was your Charizard Kaen , wrapping his strong arms around you and holding your body to his chest with his chin resting on your head. Kaen wasn't like other Pokemon, he was part of a rare type called anthro Pokemon. His body was more human like and he had a more muscular physique, complete with toned arms, pecs, and a six pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt ten years old you started your Pokemon journey. However, rather then choosing a starter you went on the journey with Kaen a Charmander, after you helped him escape a forest fire. The next ten years were full of you and him traveling and getting stronger through battles and thwarting the evil plans of Pokemon crime syndicates. Now at the age of twenty, you've decided to take a break and try a hand in running a farm just to live a peaceful life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you started to get up, the strong arms of Kaen pulled you back as he let out a tired grunt. You sighed at the action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaen, I gotta get up. There's work to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Charizard grunted and pulled you into his warm chest, making you blush at his warm skin. \"Well you....*yawn* can do it later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled, before turning and looking up to see Kaen tiredly smiling down at you. \"I wish, but I gotta make sure all the berries are well watered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaen sighed and sat up, pulling you with him. \"Well then I'll make us some breakfast.\" He said climbing out of the bed and walking out of your shared bedroom. Wearing only a pair of grey sweatpants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found your eyes on his back, toned with muscle. The back of his sweatpants was down slightly down due to his tail and let the top of his large firm orange butt hang out. You could hear his large three toed clawed feet slapping the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStretching your limbs, you decided to get ready. Climbing out of bed you put on a pair of cargo short and a red T-shirt.

You still want breakfast, so you grab some bread make a quick sandwich and head outside. Your farm is pretty spacious and more that little isolated. It was pretty far out there nothing but plains to the north for days. The only company you got was the monthly delivery truck, that would come and take your products back to the city. But you liked the quiet so this wasn't really a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, you see where Kean is and make your way over to him. He's standing before a strange looking berry bush. You'd never seen this type before. It looked like a rainbow had wrapped itself around the berry and it was shaped like a diamond. Kaen has one in his hands and is looking it over sniffing it. His eyes seemed to be locked on to the fruit, to the point where he can't hear you call out his name until you give him a light push. He snaps out of it looking at you still kind of in daze. \"What\", he says still a little groggy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this what you called me out here for\", you ask pointing to the berries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh\", he still seems a little out of it. \"Oh yeah\", he says. \"I think it might be some kind of mutation. I've never seen this kind though. Wonder what it taste like?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stares at the berry again his eyes glossing over like he's being hypnotized. Before you can say anything he pops the berry into his mouth. His eyes light up as he chews, then without any warning Kaen turns towords the bush and begins rapidly picking and devouring the berries as if possessed by some sort of force. You try to get him to stop but he's much stronger then you so he doesn't even notice you. Not wanting to lose your hands by trying to nab the berries away from his sharp teeth, you unfortunately wait until he's finished. After the last berry has been eaten he seems to be back to his regular self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaen\", what in Arceus's name were you thinking\", you snap at him. \"We've never seen this type of berry before it could be poisonous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry buddy I\", you cut him off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't sorry buddy me\", you shout. \"What was with you, you devoured them like you were in a trance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were just so good I couldn't...\", Kaen trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You couldn't what? Stop! Is that it Kaen you couldn't stop. What kind of excuse is...\", now it's your turn to trail off. You look at your Charizard and see him looking crestfallen and hurt. Sighing you address him. \"Look Kaen, I'm sorry I yelled. I was just worried about you. We don't know anything about those berries, and now we may never.\" You look at the bush no completely devoid and slowly withering away. \"You pat his snout. \"But you don't look hurt now come on we need to...\", you trail off and stare baffled and somewhat scared at Kaen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pokemon has stared glowing with all the colors of the rainbow. You back away slightly and Kaen notices and looks down at himself. \"What the what's going...ow!\" Kaen suddenly grabs his head and gets on his knees before moving one of his hands to his chest. You watch as your Charizard starts breathing heavily and the glow around him intensifies. It's blinding you at this point, but you rush up and hug Kaen telling him that your here. You feel Kaen wrap his arms around you and falls flat on his back. Light engulfs you both as you pass out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while all you see is darkness but then you hear a voice. Kaen's voice. It's loud and muffled at first and you can pick out tidbits at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap... Cra... ap... ho... id ... s... pen\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou focus a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Com... on... ake... up. I... eed... ou.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly your eyes snap open and you sit bolt up right. You look around. Your sitting in the middle of the farm, it's a little dark how long have you been out. Wait, where's Kaen. Suddenly a loud voice booms out above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank Arceus, your awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly trail your eyes upwards and take in the view of a one hundred foot tall charizard leaning down over you looking worried. You try to move your mouth but it doesn't seem to work. You sit there in shock as it talks down at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was really worried, you know. You were out for hours Anyway I think those berries did this. But I'm so glad your awake now, you've only been out for a few hours but am I ever glad that your awake.\" You sit there mouth agape. \"I finished all the work today. Being a hundred  feet tall kind of makes farm work a breeze. But I could really use your help right now.\" You just stare up in awe. \" \"Uh buddy, you okay. It's me it's Kaen.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brain slowly starts to process what happens and you struggle to your feet and slip and nearly fall flat on your face. But Kaen reaches down and gently uses one of his fingers to break your fall. \"Careful\", you hear his voice boom out above you. Grapping the digit you slowly push your self upwards and look up into your Charizard's eyes. They stare back in concern. After managing to right yourself. You watch as Kaen looks down at you, a little worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaen\", you start. \"Is that really you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah\" he replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your... your huge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I noticed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But ho- those berries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup\" is all he can say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They did this to you, we need to figure out how to fix this. I need to do some research.\" You start heading off towards your house, when Kaen sit's down with a large thud. The impact knocking you off your feet and your Charizard once again reaching down to stop your fall. Kaen has now one hundred percent blocked off your route to the house. You start to try and climb over Kaen but he merely picks you up around your waist and put's you in his palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, woe, buddy. Who says we need to fix this.\" He asks you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare dumbfounded up at him. \"Kaen look at you your huge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but why do we need to fix this. I think this is a good thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How it this a good thing\", you ask shocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well for starters, didn't you hear me when I said I did an entire day's work in an hour. Think about it, buddy. I did a whole day's work in an hour. Do you have any idea how much time that frees up? It's more time for us to relax.\" You can't believe what your hearing. \"plus as you've said I'm huge. Stray Pokemon aren't going to come anywhere near me, when i'm this big. So no more of our berries getting eaten. And I can scare off any wild Pokemon that get to close to our Miltank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what'll you eat\", you asks back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Berries\", Kaen replies. They don't take that long to grow and we have plenty of land all we need to do is expand. Plus I can just get water from the nearby rivers and lake. and because were so isolated no one's going to see me and if they do what can they do about it?\" Kaen smiles. You find it very hard to argue with his logic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what are you going to wear. You can't just wear those sweatpants everyday.\" While your thankful that Kaen's pants grew with him, you knew this wasn't a compelling argument. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'll just wash them and go o natural for a while.\" you suddenly turn bright red just picturing that. Your Charizard sees and smiles slyly. \"Not that you'd have any problem with that, what with how often you look at me.\" You go even redder, and try to retort but Kaen nearly picks you up and places you on his warm chest. \"Besides, I think you like seeing me this big, I certainly like you being this small. He gently pushes you between his six pacts and you pray to god he doesn't notice that your arousal. You catch his eyes, and know that he does. You sigh in defeat. \"Now then\", he says</span></div></div>",

This was something you and your partner, a shiny Charizard, always mega evolved as Mega Y had become very good at doing. After the latest victory, you and your partner fly off to Mt. Silver. It had been a long time since you were here but you and Charizard enjoyed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you say, Reflet?\u201d You ask as your partner lands. He roars wanting more. A smirk forms on your face. You\u2019ve been together since Kanto, he\u2019s been your partner since day one. And he always hungered for more power, for stronger foes. And you? You were always wanting the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set up camp for the night, letting Reflet stay out of his ball. He was a shiny Charizard, black scales, red on his wings, cream colored belly, and the piercing red eyes. But the strange thing was he had markings on his back, his head, tail and arms. (Think Charizardtwo from Mewtwo Strikes Back) You knew it made him special, that and the silver mane he had grown on his head and down his neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s try Mega evolving outside of battle.\u201d You say, it was something both you and Reflet had been working on. He nods to you, ready to begin. Your keystone lights up as does the Charizardite Y in his armlet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright flash engulfs Reflet as he Mega evolves. But something unexpected happens. Your eyes widen as you see not only did your partner Mega evolve into Mega Charizard Y but he grew to a massive level. Reflet looks around confused, then quickly looks down. \u201cReflet!\u201d You call up to him. His red eyes look down at you. Both of you share a brief sigh of relief before Reflet reaches down and picks you up. You gauge he has to be at least a couple hundred feet tall. Maybe and very likely bigger. You\u2019re best guess is he\u2019s at least 150 meters in height. He brings you to eye level and watches you closely. You swallow nervously once your eye to eye with Reflet. Sure he\u2019s your partner but at this size, he completely dominates you.</span></div></div>",

Although unlike normal trainers you never took part in normal Pokemon battles. Instead Shadow ended up evolving by doing intense training and taking part in matches against other anthro Pokemon. And you still couldn\u2019t believe that when he evolved from a thin Houndour to a well muscled anthro Houndoom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, these memories were quickly pushed to the side when you heard loud grunts coming from a room at the end of the hallway.

He was dressed in a small tank to that showed the bottom of his eight pack and some short gym bottoms that went to the middle of his thighs, both seemed painted on his black furred muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Shadow?\", you called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow soon put the weight in it's holder before sitting up.

He wrapped the towel around his neck and began to down the water. A few droops missed his mouth and dripped down with his sweat into the crevice of his muscles. You felt a blush creep on you so you turned away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...n-no problem! Well I got some...work to do! Enjoy your workout!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you started to leave, a large weight suddenly wrapped around your waist and pulled you into a hard and warm wall.

Your face turned more red as you realized Shadow pulled you into his lap!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were naturally short and fit right between his legs and your head reached the bottom of his pecs.

Plus you do look cute down there~\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in so much shock. Shadow was acting very affectionate, but aren't the two of you just friends?

Your gaze then went to his orange furrred eight pack stomach which of course led to his right looking gym shorts. And before you could say anything you saw Shadow bounce his pecs and flex his abs before he bent down and removed his gym shirts which gave you a view of his large muscles thighs that were black on the outside along with his muscled legs while the inner part of his thighs that were next to his large silver colored jock strap covered bulge were orange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while you stared with your mouht now agape you saw Shadow wink at you before he turned around this giving you a view of his huge and wide black furry back which also had bones spread across it from top to bottom.

You talked with him and blushed when he slyly grinned and said he was disappointed they couldn\u2019t have their fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground soon shook, though it wasn\u2019t Shadow since his body stayed still. Out in the distance, a large black mass made his way towards your location. The mass was a anthro Umbreon, wearing a pair of jeans. His torso was naked showing off his defined muscles. His left hand was facing up and in front of his pecs, seeming to hold a speck. It was Lune, and soon he stopped in front of Shadow and looked down at you with his usual blank face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou called for us little one?\u201d, Lune asked in his deep voice. You gave a nod and watched as he brought his palm to Shadow\u2019s, revealing a smiling Alex sitting on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSup dude! Sorry for the wait.\u201d, Alex excitingly said with a wave. You smiled at your human friend\u2019s greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShadow, Lune could you put us down so we can talk?\u201d, the two giants nodded and placed you down between their feet followed by Alex. While you and your friend talked, the giant Pok\u00e9mon looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow smirked and put his paws on his hips. \u201cSo I see you haven\u2019t missed a workout day Lune.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLune simply closed his eyes and folded his toned arms across his strong chest. \u201cOf course, one missed day is a wasted opportunity to get stronger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo then, you outta be on my level by now.\u201d, Shadow said bouncing his pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small smirk graced Lune\u2019s lips. \u201cWhy of course. I have been for a while now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two anthros brought up a paw and grasped each other\u2019s, making their biceps flex and giving off a fighting aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below, you and Alex looked up at the two titanic friendly rivals. You sighed and gained a sweat drop while Alex simply laughed at the display.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n\u201cI apologize, these were the only spare pants I could find at the moment.\u201d, Lune said as he unfolded the clothing he brought for Shadow. A pair of skinny jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeh it\u2019s alright, better then nothing.\u201d, Shadow said taking the jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Houndoom backed away from the three others. He started to slip on the pants over his toned legs, which immediately looked difficult with how much the muscles bulged against the fabric and slowly slid up. The waist band took a bit of tugging to go over Shadow large butt and unfortunately (or fortunately) Lune didn\u2019t have any underwear to spare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finally buttoning the jeans, Shadow did a little flexing. His thighs, butt, and bulge all stretched the fabric and seem ready to burst. Hopefully the pants will last long enough to get some clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm, alright a bit tight! But it\u2019ll do.\u201d, Shadow smiled as he came back over and scooped you up, followed by Lune doing the same to Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, Shadow was clothed. What should they do now?</span></div></div>",

But also if they could build Shadow\u2019s house for him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, no problem.\u201d Alex cheerfully replied, before both giant anthro Pokemon went into town and then their separate ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you and Shadow had entered the clothing store you were greeted by a heavily muscled anthro Rhydon who you saw had a young human woman as a partner. After you had explained what had happened a few hours ago the woman said that she wasn\u2019t surprised. And that once your Houndoom had gotten enough clothes he just had to bring them up to the counter so that you could pay for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that conversation had ended Shadow carries you into a changing room and placed you onto a bench before he walked out. And within a few seconds you saw your dark and fire type partner walk into the room with a large handful of clothes. You then saw him close the door before he slowly and carefully removed Lune\u2019s skinny jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd upon doing so he let out a sigh of relief as he commented, \u201cAh, that\u2019s better. Now let\u2019s see what we have to work with here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that had been said Shadow began by trying on all of the jockstraps he had grabbed. And this caused you to blush upon noticing how close his orange balls and his orange and black tipped cock was to you each time he changed jockstraps. However, Shadow seemed non the wiser to it as he checked himself out in the mirror. And by the look on his face he seemed to like the feel of the undergarments. He then moved on to shorts and pants that hugged his butt, which he again seemed to like. He then moved on to shirts which consisted of short sleeve shorts, tank tops, and A muscle shirts. You even saw him try on a few speedos as well before he was satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow carried you in his right hand now sporting a short sleeve white colored shirt, a pair of jean shorts, and a light blue jockstrap for underwear. Although the Houndoom did end up leaving with six bags of clothes, but he just put three on each arm when he left the clothing store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while he made his way back to your home your cellphone ran. And since you knew it was Alex you greeted him with, \u201cHey Alex, how did it go talking to the builders?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it went fine. Although I\u2019m sorry to say that Lune and I have to head home. So Shadow can keep the skinny jeans if he wants.\u201d Your friend cheerfully told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright cool.\u201d You let out, as you knew your Houndoom had in fact decided to keep the jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then heard your friend\u2019s voice again when he explained, \u201cAlthough I won\u2019t lie to you dude. You\u2019re lucky that one of their partners was a Psychic type. Because not only were they able to fix up your house in no time. They also.......</span></div></div>",

You then saw him wink at you before he brought you up to his mouth and put your lower body inside of it before he pressed his lips together thus keeping that part of your body in place. You then started to moan out in pleasure yourself once the fire and dark type anthro had started to use his tongue to lick your balls and cock. You then heard him groan while he did this as he started to use his left hand to rub his member while his right hand pinched and twisted his right nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for some time until you let out a loud groan and released your load to which he lapped up and swallowed without much trouble. You then saw him close his eyes before Shadow also released his load from his own member which landed on his mostly on his rock hard abs. He then stood there with your lower body still in his mouth.

Your anthro Houndoom hummed as he saw you and bounced his pecs most likely remembering the pleasure you both shared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well buddy, we're both a little dirty not to mention hot. So let's take a shower and some rest ok?\", Shadow said gently as he walked to the shower and began turning the knob to sent cool cascading water down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking in, Shadow held you away from the blasting water and used his body to take the water's hit. The Houndoom sighed blissfully as his sweat was washed away and the intense heat he formed from his passionate fun was cooled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquatting down and making his muscles clench, Shadow placed you on the floor between his huge paws. Shadow you a warm grin which you returned before he stood up again and towered over you. It was incredible, seeing Shadow stretch into the sky like a mountain, his large muscles glisten as water ran between the furry crevices. You could barely see Shadow's face as his pecs mostly covered his snout, but you had faith your partner would make sure your safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe excess water dripping off of Shadow's large body served as your shower. But after washing you did a little observing, mostly by moving directly under Shadow. You saw the large balls bouncing as the Houndoom's swayed his hips and the butt crack you stayed in. All clenching and bouncing as Shadow ran his paws over his muscles and messages them, rubbing circles in his cheeks and crunching his abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the water stopped flowing and you watched as the black and orange thighs flexed as Shadow squatted to scoop you up. The Houndoom reached for a towel and ran it over his firm muscles and flexed on the towel to get the water out. Using a corner, Shadow gently rubbed you to quickly dry you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrapping the towel around his waist, Shadow made his way to his bedroom. After a while you where a pair of gym shorts and a red T-shirt. Your partner has on a black tank too that showed the top of his orange and blac pecs and bottom of his abs. Sitting down and holding you to his chest, Shadow seem to have a pleading look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey buddy I was thinking, how about tonight you sleep with me!  You can lay anywhere you want on me and I'll keep you cozy!\", Shadow grinned warmly as he bounced his pecs again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um..sure I would love to spend the night.....on your body\", you explained nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow hummed as he began moving you towards.....</span></div></div>",

My skarmory flew behind me, confused but unwilling to leave me, and as I was carried by the blaziken out of the woods, the pain in my stomach melted away. He dropped me off just before the exit of the woods, and wordlessly walked away. \u201cThanks!\u201d I called towards him. I watched as he started running, and jumped out of sight.

The warmth had gotten just ever so slightly warmer, and combined with his thick, fluffy feathers, it took all I had not to fall back asleep. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll stay the night out here with you. I\u2019ll just tell my mom I\u2019m trying to catch a Pok\u00e9mon, or something. This is worlds better than whatever bed I have at home, anyway.\u201d I told him, already drifting off as he sat back down, my legs now resting on his, only his were at least 5 times thicker than mine and much warmer, and much softer, and he was nuzzling me deeper into his chest, and I was falling asleep, and then it was morning, and...</span></div></div>",

Obsession is probably the right word. I didn\u2019t own any, I never had the money to spare for pokeballs, but I\u2019d always foster a wild one, and I\u2019d saved many Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s lives before. I\u2019m not trying to say I\u2019m better than the Pok\u00e9mon center, but it takes time to get there and I don\u2019t always get that much time. Most of them never stay more than a day, only to drink a little water, have some food, or maybe warm up if it\u2019s winter, and I\u2019ve seen nearly 500 Pok\u00e9mon in my lifetime, but the ones I\u2019m most entranced by are always the ones I don\u2019t get to see. Obviously legendaries aren\u2019t really ever gonna need my help, but there were a lot of Pok\u00e9mon I surprisingly never got to see. Fire types were common, whether due to winter or rain, but one of the only ones I\u2019d never seen was litten. And of course a litten was the Pok\u00e9mon I wanted most. We had one when I was a kid, but it never evolved and died when I was about 5 due to... well, I don\u2019t even remember why, but it was too complicated for my little kid brain. So imagine my surprise, when, on a perfectly warm summer day, one literally just walks up to me. It was hurt, but it\u2019s body seemed to be OK. One of the main things that makes pokemon healing so hard is the fact that they can have both physical injuries and type-specific injuries, which is why most pets are a normal or flying type, they don\u2019t require much work to take care of. All color was gone from the litten\u2019s eyes, and it struggled to stand. It was skinny to the point it looked like it had a vacuum suck any space between its skin and bone from it. I had a few potions and berries, but that wasn\u2019t enough for this. The skinniness wasn\u2019t even natural, it\u2019s hard to explain, but it just looked artificial. I brought it inside, grabbed one of just 3 full restored I owned for emergencies, and sprayed it all over the litten. When I rolled it onto it\u2019s back, I saw a literal hole in its stomach, which probably explained the whole vacuum thing, but was still a problem. I had seen these types of holes before, but only on dead Pok\u00e9mon. This had managed to escape, if barely, but still. Whatever attacked it had sucked the life energy out of it, and judging by its looks, there was none left. It\u2019s existence was solely because of its will to live. It was a lot stronger than I was giving it credit for, then. All I could really do was keep it warm and try to start a fire. To get the life energy back for a pokemon, you can never fully restore it, but there are some ways. For a fire type, that would be with a fire, and luckily I happen to have a fireplace. I got a fire started, put the litten next to it, it\u2019s a him, I think, and watched as the flame was funneled through that hole back into its body. This is when I could tell he was special, and why he was drained in the first place. Most Pok\u00e9mon would\u2019ve only had a pretty small amount restored, but he got way more than a normal Pok\u00e9mon would\u2019ve. Immediately, color came back to his eyes, and that vacuum sealed look was gone. He had even gotten a decent bit bigger, but was still pretty small when you remember he\u2019s a litten. Just a little over 2 feet tall, and the hole he\u2019d been drained from was healed over. He jumped into my lap and purred as he promptly fell asleep in my arms. That\u2019s when I noticed a team rocket R on his stomach, right where that hole had been. As soon as I touched it, he woke up and visibly shivered. He tried to hide it by walking back over to the fire, and of course he absorbed some of the heat, being decently bigger because of it, now at almost 3 feet tall. He looked at me and...</span></div></div>",

They were using me to make some Pok\u00e9mon bigger than you\u2019ve ever seen, but without me they can\u2019t get them any bigger without killing tons of Pok\u00e9mon just to make it a few feet taller. I barely got out, would\u2019ve died if you were 15 seconds slower. Every Pok\u00e9mon they have there\u2019s been brainwashed to the point they could never be fixed, I only escaped it by pretending to be willing to go with them, and it took me 14 years to get a chance to escape.\u201d I\u2019m 19, my pet litten \u201cdied\u201d 14 years ago. \u201cOh my god, you\u2019re not...\u201d \u201cYeah, it\u2019s me.

I\u2019m gonna need to be a decent bit bigger if we wanna take them down. At least an Incineroar.\u201d I went with that, adding a lot more to it, and watched as he evolved into a torracat, and was nearly 5 feet tall, right on the edge of becoming an Incineroar. The fired died down before he could evolve, and I was out of wood. \u201cThis\u2019ll be enough, we can take down some of the weaker rocket grounts, those Pok\u00e9mon aren\u2019t even alive anymore, the only good thing in them left would be their life energy. And they want to lose it. That last part of them that\u2019s still alive, I can hear it. They beg for it to just be over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe went out and found a couple rocket grunts, and it was enough to get him to evolve into an Incineroar, and a pretty big one at that. He was just under 7 feet tall, and definitely had more muscle than a normal Incineroar. And to think that earlier today he was about to die. The next stop was...</span></div></div>",

He immediately started running there, me on his back, blushing at how strong it obviously was. As soon as we arrived, we hit our first major problem. Incineroar was strong and could easily take most of the grunts guarding the outside, just not all at once. The question was just how to lure them away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr not, as he just rushed in there when no one was looking in our direction and took them all down. The grunts were all knocked out, and the Pok\u00e9mon literally threw their life energy to him. It was a lot when added up, and Incineroar was over 8 feet tall now, and with a lot more muscle to go with the added height. He broke down the door and I followed, blushing furiously and trying not to look at him, looking down. That turned out to be a good thing, because I noticed a wire along where we were walking, and was able to get out of the way just before the bomb connected to the wire blew up. Incineroar wasn\u2019t so lucky. Or, he wouldn\u2019t have been if he didn\u2019t absorb the blast. \u201cAn explosion still counts as fire.\u201d he said to me with a smirk, looking down on me with his nearly 9 feet tall body. \u201cAnd a doorway shouldn\u2019t be an obstacle.\u201d I said, trying to cover up all the feelings I had for him right now with a joke.\u201dYou can just admit I\u2019m hot.\u201d he jokingly told me as he picked me up and pulled us both over a ledge onto the next floor, thanks to the hole the bomb left behind. \u201cThey really should\u2019ve planned that better...\u201d I said as I slid out of his grip and we continued walking. We didn\u2019t see any other grunts, or even any other Pok\u00e9mon for an unnervingly long amount of time. We then found 15, all standing in front of a suspiciously armored door.\u201dYou think you can take them?\u201d I asked. \u201cHonestly? No.\u201d There was a sadness there, he\u2019d never not been able to take a challenge yet. We turned around, only to find our way out blocked off by tons of wreckage. He slowly started lifting at the rubble, and though it took some time, he was getting through it. He threw the last piece away only to be met face to face with a rocket elite. Or, face to chest for the rocket member, who\u2019s cocky smirk melted into fear as Incineroar picked him up, knocked him out, and released all his Pok\u00e9mon, who sacrificed their life energy to him. \u201cI can hear them, speaking to me. Telling me things like where some hidden passages are, where grunts hide, and even a life energy stockpile.\u201d The energy the Pok\u00e9mon had given him had started to kick in, and this growth spurt left him at 11 feet tall exactly, and somehow fit even more muscle onto his already massive frame. \u201cNow I think we can take those guys.\u201d He dropped down from the hole, his shoulders almost getting caught, and easily taking them all down. 15 grunts with a few Pok\u00e9mon each meant this was his biggest spurt yet. He was over 15 feet tall, and at least half that wide. With that obstacle down, a new one was created. The doorway. He was just too big to get through. So he just made a bigger door. He could literally walk through the steel unfazed. Entering the room, we were met with...</span></div></div>",

Of course it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding out your parents are crime bosses isn\u2019t exactly something good to hear, especially when you just found out they almost killed your childhood pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m gonna kill you both.\u201d Incineroar said, with shaking anger in his deep, powerful voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rocket Pok\u00e9mon may be stronger than him, but Incineroar has the advantage of his mind with him, the other Pok\u00e9mon were just big brick walls. In the time Incineroar had already knocked 3 of them out, the other 7 Pok\u00e9mon had only just started moving. Once they did move bough, there was the problem of the 1v7 currently happening. He was barely dodging them, and he looked to me with panic in his eyes. What could I do? I couldn\u2019t look away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut neither could the rocket members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were distracted by the titans, I was able to call their Pok\u00e9mon back, all except for one, giving the fair fight he deserved. It took the elites time to realize what I did, but Incineroar easily won the one on one, and received the biggest flow of life energy yet. Most of these Pok\u00e9mon were already stuffed full of the energy due to how many Pok\u00e9mon rocket drained, and it showed here. He was now 25 feet tall, and was packing even more tons of muscle on top of what was already there. It was around this time the rocket elites realized what I did and released the 6 remaining Pok\u00e9mon. However, those other 3 from the start? Incineroar was being fed their energy as the remaining 6 came out. He was easily 50 feet tall now, and had at least doubled his musculature once more. Any sign of a neck he had was swallowed by his traps, and he still moved with impossible agility. The 6 remaining Pok\u00e9mon were no match. They were all drained back to what they should\u2019ve had anyway, and were picked up and released from their captivity by a 100 foot tall Incineroar back into the wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth my parents lunged at me, but not before Incineroar swept me up. \u201cThe police are coming. One movement from any of you and you\u2019re all dead. One noise from any of you and you\u2019re all dead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey complied, and Incineroar somehow managed to hide himself while the rocket members were arrested. \u201cHow did you get them to be like this?\u201d An officer asked. \u201cAh, I\u2019ve got some pretty strong pokemon. Had them since I was a kid, actually.\u201d She seemed to wave it off, probably just happy to not have to go on a wild goose chase every other day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were all gone, me and Incineroar were left at the ruins of their base and the area around it. I watched him nick a hole in his stomach where that original hole had been when I first found him, and watched as tons of life energy spilled out of him. He was still way bigger than normal, 8 feet tall on the dot, but all the plants were restored, and then some. What had been the team rocket headquarters had turned into a beautiful place for Pok\u00e9mon in an ever shrinking wilderness. It reached far, too. Hundreds of areas around the country received this treatment, making nearly 1000 new square miles of forests and general areas for wild Pok\u00e9mon. And with team rocket gone, everyone could breathe easy and enjoy what the world had to offer for a while.</span></div></div>",

Essentially, you're not only in a world where pokemon and anthro pokemon exist, you're also in a world where pokemon and anthro pokemon will somehow change size for whatever reason you can think of (But you can't shrink, it's not allowed). However, before we get started on this enormous escapade, I'd just like to lay down some rules:<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAll Pok\u00e9mon are all males (Pokemon that are female are not allowed I'm sorry)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey can become anthro Pok\u00e9mon if they want to but make sure they are friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can allow specific Mega Pok\u00e9mon like Mega Lucarios, Mega Lopunny and Mega Manectric.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\nYou can choose which pokemon you like eg: luxray Buizel, Floatzel, Vulpix, Eevee and their 7 Eeveelutions, Electrike, Manectric, Shinx Luxio yellow umbreon riolu and lucario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you start with that character do not forget to put a chapter of that is unique like a 7'3 foot tall gold eyed lucario and a 8'9 foot tall red eyed muscle floatzel that wants more muscle and size while being friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- The story is observed primarily by the main character, who is to remain nondescript and human (EDIT: I originaly had gender-neutral, as well, but there's some situations where it makes more sense for the character to have a gender). This allows the reader to use their imagination and insert whoever they want into the role of the protagonist. You can change POV if you want, but leave a choice to continue as the main if you do.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n- No killing the main.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- no sex and gay stuff. I'm really sorry <br>\r\n <br>\r\n- No vore, but nonliving things can be eaten (Exception: Living fish can be eaten if it makes sense in context. IE: Lugia passed by a school of fish and gobbled them all up. Just don't overplay it or anything).<br>\r\n <br>\r\n- The pokemon can be as kind as you wish (They can't become evil or be evil at the start I'm sorry but thems the breaks), just remember the previous rules.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThat about sums it up (Note how I've made no rules on sexual content. Take that as you will.). Have fun.<br>\r\n </td>",
