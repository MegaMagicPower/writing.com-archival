After a couple of moment to get the positioning right, she pulls the thick cloth padding up between her legs, face beet red with embarrassment.  Going through with her plan, she pins the diapers on and, knowing they'd be nearly useless otherwise, she dons a transparent black pair of plastic pants printed with bats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning heavily at the infantile garment now hugging her hips, she sets aside the box of baby stuff and tries to pull on her sweatpants.  No matter how hard she tries, though, the sweatpants don't seem to want to go on.  Either they're just too tight or the diaper is too thick...either way, Marceline decides she can go without.  Laying down in bed, sighing heavily, she tries to forget the events of the evening and get to sleep.  Tossing and turning, sleep keeps eluding her, perhaps in part because of the awkwardness of her different protection.  Ending up on her side, she ends up glancing back towards the baby box.  Something gleams at the top: a pacifier.  <i>It's crazy and dumb...</i> She thinks to herself <i>I'm a grown woman!  I don't need a pacifier to get to sleep...it's just these stupid diapers...they're uncomfortable...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs another hour passes, Marceline, desperate for sleep, decides she needs to do something.

She yanked down her pull-up as fast as she could, spurting uncontrollably, but in her haste sat on the toilet and got to finish there. She was glad she was able to hold it, but couldn't take too much pride; she had still let out many a spurt into her pants.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was another fine day in the Candy Kingdom where Princess Bubblegum was busy, constructing her latest invention. As she did, Peppermint Butler came into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair princess,\" The butler said. \"I believe you have a visitor downstairs...and it's not Finn and Jake, surprisingly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoever it is, they can probably wait. I'm in the middle of an important tinkering and I'd like to get this finished posthaste.\" Princess Bubblegum said to him, not once even looking away from what she was working on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeppermint Butler hissed his tongue in hesitation and replied, \"Well, she's not the type to say no to anyone, your majesty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well just who is it then?\" She asked, wondering who could be so stubborn as to interrupt her while she was busy with such important work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a guess.\" said a familar voice whispering RIGHT into Bubblegum's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving expected as much, being surprised like that had little effect on Bubblegum. \"I figured as much. Marceline what is it you want? I'm in the middle of something extremely important.\" She said. Marceline giggled to herself as she floated away from Bubblegum. \"Aww, come on, Bonnie\". the vampire chuckled. \"Don't be such a sour-ball....I need something to borrow\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want Marceline?\" Bubblegum said as she finally took her eyes of her work to keep them on Marceline, not wanting her to touch anything she shouldn't be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarceline looked around quickly, making sure no one was around; Peppermint Butler had left the room for the sake of privacy and the guards were all outside parolling. The vampire floated close to Bubblegum and said, \"I need to borrow some thread for Hambo.\" Marceline then pulled out her scruffy-looking old teddy bear from her bag, one of the buttons missing again. \"It's really important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you don't have any thread at home? Or you couldn't find any on your way here? I find it a little hard to believe you had to come all the way to me for something as simple as a bit of thread.\" Bubblegum said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pffftt, you got better thread than all of the cheap ones I can find out there.\" scoffed Marceline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine fine. Whatever, if it'll get you out of my hair and get me back to work faster then sure.\" Bubblegum said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bubblegum huffed and looked around for thread, Marceline spotted a glimpse of PB's newest device...it somewhat looked like a large handheld machine that almost resembled a pacifier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...soooo what'cha making?\" The vampire asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bubblegum looked around she explained. \"It's a new device I'm working on that can reverse the ageing process. Though it's not entirely finished.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarceline smirked, \"Reverse aging, huh? You know, you could just get an aging spell or something\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBubblegum just rolled her eyes at that. Opening a cupboard and seeing a spool of thread inside. She grabbed it and brought it over to Marceline. \"Except this device reverses age, within set parameters that's safe to use, or at least it will be once it's complete.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarceline then asked, \"What does it do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it can only set back a persons mental age back just for now, and even then it's a bit iffy on the exact age to go back to.\" She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever tested it out on someone?\" Marceline said smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no, I wanted to try and steady up it's range of regression a bit more, though I think with the few adjustments I've recently made it might be ready for a test run, at least of it's mental regressing capabilities.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" The vampire said. \"Who's your test-monkey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have one at the moment, seeing as the device is one way, I need to find someone who I can use to take control data from first.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarceline paused for a moment and then smirked a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bonnie,\" she asked. \"...mind if I check that thing out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess? It's not even very interesting to look at yet. I'm going to work on the visual appeal after it's working fully.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Marceline picked up the device and turned around to the control panel; it had various dials and switches set for ages of sorts. \"So....how does this thing work?\" She said confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the dials on the left are supposed to be for changing a persons physical age, which doesn't work yet. At the most it could make your younger by about a year or so. The other dial on the right is for mental age. Which works, but I'm not sure if I fixed it's problem with either making it younger than the displayed age or not getting to the displayed age, though it should only be off by about a year or two.\" Bubblegum explained to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampire queen tinkered with the controls playfully, flipping the mental age down to a 1-year-old level. \"Like this?\" Marceline said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Essentially yes, it's supposed to work like a gun. Though it could have far more practical applications than just using it to defend yourself.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarceline said, \"Ah, like making you relax and less tense?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes, but it could also have rehabilitation applications.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops.\" Marceline said casually, as if on purposed as she flipped the on-switch of the machine, blasting a pink and baby blue beam at Bubblegum, engulfing her in it.</span></div></div>",

Look at you, you're still standing all normal-like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't say anything, she began to sway slightly though, as if her balance had suddenly been impacted.

She sighed in annoyance before pushing her beloved toy into Bubblegum's arms, holding to appease her crying.
