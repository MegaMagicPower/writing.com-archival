Often you'd daydream you'd be whisked away on a crazy adventure, given mystical powers, fighting some evil government entity.  But today was going to be just another normal day, filled with classes, dorm life, extracurricular activities and maybe a little hanky panky with your girlfriend, Nguyen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked down to the mailroom in your college dorm building, you pass by a few men in trenchcoats who were all standing near the doorway.  You ask a few people who they were, but no one knew and they didn't really care.  You shrugged it off and continued on your way.  When you opened your mailbox, you found a package inside with a note attached.  It was from you Dad!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside of the note, it read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\">Dear Son,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm so sorry to ask you of this, but there is no one else I can trust.  I have to disappear for a while, to get the government off of my tail.  In the mean time, I want to hide this watch with you.  Keep it secret, keep it safe!  Below are all the details about what it can do.  Use it sparingly, if at all!  And keep it away from anyone who look suspicious!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLove, <br>\r\nDad</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou read over what the watch can do:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Allows you to change the way everyone sees reality on a global or local scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. The watch can create whole new stories and events in reality to account for the changes you make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. The changes only last for two hours, unless you press the Permanent button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. If you tell someone about the watch's power, they become immune to its effects and will know how reality shifts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't really believe it, so you decide to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This is my normal look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe watch changes colors on the display. When it displays 'Complete' you feel ripples around your waist and legs. To your amazement, your pants turn into a skirt, and when it stops, you realize you have smooth, pantyhose encased legs and are wearing heels!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my word! It worked! I better change back!\" But before you can, your friend Roger comes walking up to you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiles, \"Hey! Are you and Nguyen making any plans for tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn red, but then realize that he is not reacting to you skirt at all. You decide on a test. \"Not yet, but I haven't gotten to talk to her yet.\" You pause, then say, \"Hey, would you look at the back of my skirt? I think I might have sat on something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks as you turn around, \"Nope. Looks as good as always.\" But he has no other reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp on the inside!

Soon, you see them thinning out ever so slightly, before a cold chitin progressively spread onto them. And, before you could try to do anything, the change strike your legs, making you losing your balance. Similarly to your hands and arm, your legs were getting covered in the same chitin. A yellow fur spreads onto the untouched skin, as your head painfully reshape itself. Stripes of black appears onto your chest, as two mounds sprouts on it, filling out your bra with firm B-cup breasts. Your noses retracts into your newly shaped head, without removing your sense of smell, while your ears gets absorbed away. For a moment you couldn't hear anything until a pair of antennas sprouts off your head, reacting to every sounds in your surroundings, giving you a better hearing than you had. Thinking the changes were over, you try to search for your high heels.. To no avail. You try to stand up, so you would check out if anyone was in the toilets, for safe keeping, but fall again.. Your toes were fusing up and thinning up into single-toed chitinous feet. You let out a shriek of pain while your pairs of wings sprouts onto your back, and while your cock retracts away, relieving you to some extend, given your pants weren't so tight anymore..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that everyone heard you, you make a run, barefooted, to the door leading off the toilets. But, as you make it out, you bump into someone, and at the same time, your last changes occurs: your ass becomes more pronounced, while a large insect abdomen sprouts onto your backside, causing your skirt to be lifted up. You blush and tries to cover your suddenly revealed panties, as you notice you bumped into..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Right now, you just wanted to teleport off, or to just disappear from others' sight. Not overly because of what you became, but more because you thought your previous scream would attract unwanted attention, not helped by the fact that your revealed pants would very probably attract boys' gazes. But the one you had bumped into had a very different reaction from what you'd expect, and is probably the last one you actually hoped to bump into. What if Nguyen gets scared when she notices that you became a huge insect?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to flee, <i>*again, and probably once too much at that*</i>, when Nguyen speaks up, 'Oi.. Wait.. Robert? Can't you see where you are going? And.. Why are you blushing?... <i>*Were you in the boys' toilets ?*</i>. You stutter, 'I-i.. Er.. Its..! T-tha..'. You facepalms, given you couldn't muster any proper explanation, then sighs. You think of just grabbing your girlfriend's hand and lead her into a calmer place, but you shrug it off. It would certainly worsen things more than anything. Instead, you say, 'Follow me, Nguyen. There's something i have to show you.'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move out onto a less crowded corner, and peer around. More to see if there was no one around than to check if Nguyen had followed. Thankfully, both stands true, as the girl meets you up. She starts, 'Robert, i know that you've always been a boy mind in a girl's body, but that's not a reason to go were you sho..-'. You cut her discussion off as you says, 'But <i>*i'm*</i> a boy. W-with.. O-okay fine. I was one. Also, don't you notice anything weird about me? Like fur and.. The fact i'm not a human?'. 'Robert, are you alright? Well.. Sure. You are different, but you weren't so.. Snappy about it. Besides.. I always loved that you acted like a boy, even then you were a cute girl! It makes me.. Accept myself a bit more.. Which is funny, given i don't like how i am..'. She wraps her arms around you, and let her tears flow down onto her cheeks. 'Robert, don't leave me..'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't felt to try to explain or do anything for the moment. Nguyen was really crying, that much you could tell. And what she said is.. Just so heartwrenching..<br>\r\nYou run a finger onto her wet eyes to dry her eyes up and smiles. 'Don't worry.. But there's a thing i want to tell you about.'. You grab the Reality Shift Watch and shows it. She says, 'A watch..?'. 'Yes. One that allows me to do all the wishes i want!'. 'Oh Robert.. Why are you trying to imply that it's not you? You've always been a bee girl!'. You sigh. You needed to prove the watch's power. You ponder what you could do with it, before you come up with an idea. 'Nguyen, can you wait a moment? There's a thing i want to do. Real quick! I promise i'll be back!'. Nguyen lets you and and weakly smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab the watch, leaving it on Local, in case she wouldn't like the change, then, you tell the RSW, 'I wish that Nguyen becomes a sexy and tall anthropomorphic female black raptoress!'. You wait a bit, leaving time to let the wish occur, when you hear Nguyen!  You rush back at her, and blushes. The once petite vietnam girl that stood is now looking completly different. Standing at 9 ft tall, the black-scaled raptoress bolsters a pair of D-cup breasts, forcing her white t-shirt to be lifted up in such a manner that it shows her cute bellybutton. Her backside had plumpened out, just enough to fill up her jean, while a long tail stood on it, standing straight. Her arms and legs are athletic, without any flab on them. While her hands remains similarly human to yours, with small claws, her feet had became powerful three-clawed-toes talons, making her stand onto the torn remaining of her shoes, all onto a digitigrade stance. The fact that, on her new elongated head, hair were no more, didn't impeded her look in anyway, rather, it was complimentaring her azur-colored eyes all the more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cries again, 'R-robert! W-what happened to me..!'. You proudly says, 'Told you! It's the watch! But i can always revert it if you want..?'. On her raptor head, her emotions were still visible, much like she was human, and you could tell that the answer is no: on her visage, despite her tears, she was smiling. 'Thanks.. I'm loving my new body! Also.. That's a cool watch! You wonder what we could do with it!?'. You idly nod. But..</span></div></div>",

And would continued on his way, if Nguyen didn't, mischievously, spoke up. 'Did you heard us speaking a watch that allows whoever's owning it to wish everything he or she wants, adapting the reality so the changes appears as perfectly normal to everyone aside from the wisher and whoever being told the watch's effects? Oh, and did you noticed that i've became a dream of a raptor girl?'. Roger tilts his head, 'What..? Beside.. Even if you're sexy, you're not muscular to make me dream.', while you facepalms. 'Nguyen, why did you told him that..?'. She grins, 'Did you knew that Robert went into the boys' toilet too? Surely she wanted to act naughtily!'. You blush and Roger laughs. 'Daww. Robert wanted to see my cock? Unless she want to be as strong and beautiful as me!'. You shout, 'Dream away, pervert!'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNguyen asks you, 'Why were you in the boys' toilet?'. You stutter, 'I-i wasn't..! I.. It.. Err.. I-it wasn't what you think..! It was purely and entirely based on unintentional and strictly normal and understandable reasons..!'. The raptoress moves behind you and grabs your breasts, causing you to flail and blush more. 'L-let me go..!'. 'Only if you tell why you were in the toilets.~'. You sighs. 'Fine..'. You explain to Roger what the watch does, quoting to both how the watch works. You also explain how you got it and that you were a male before you wished to become a bee girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth nods, as Nguyen playfully let you go, while Roger crosses his arms, seemingly in deep thoughts. You were about to ask Roger if he was feeling well when he says, 'If that's true, then surely you c-..'. You snappily grumble. 'No. No hyper muscular girls.'. 'Robert, you're no fun. If that's true then surely you just lied.'. Roger turns and is about to leave when you grab the watch and wishes, 'I wish that my friend Roger have gigantic breasts.', grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger sighs, and walks off by a few steps, before she freeze up. Suddenly, you notice that two orbs of flesh grows, looking like breasts. Having not precised a size, the watch merely gave the man breasts so big it would easily cover his whole chest, going down to his knees. His clothing even had been changed into a floral blouse to accommodate his new size! He yells, 'Robert! That's not fair! Thoses things are way too heavy.. Besides! Why you should be the only one having fun!? Pretty sure that Nguyen thinks like me when i say that we want to use it too!'. The raptoress agrees. You sigh. 'Okay, tell you what? Let me place a watch in a hand.. Roger, you pick one. If you find it, you can use it. Otherwise it's Nguyen's turn. And if you lose, i'll buy you a hot-dog.. Okay?~'. Roger grumbles and says, 'Okay! But you'd better keep your word!'. You giggle. Roger could never resist the offer of free food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger picks a hand.</span></div></div>",

Her belly stars to swell rapid not unlike a montage of a pregnancy, her bee abdomen also swells somewhat balancing her belly. A new set of arms appears beneath the original set, her breasts start to grow.<br>\r\nHer hips widen, her butt swells, she becomes 6ft tall, beneath her fur and chitin muscles expand just enough to support her weight, after the muscles are done a layer of fat makes itself known giving her chubby and motherly look, the end result a anthro bee girl 6ft tall with four arms, two breasts dripping honey from their now bigger nipples, said breasts rested on her prodigious pregnant belly, all of this balanced by her engorged and bloated bee abdomen that was almost touching the ground. She was lucky that her cloths transformed with her.<br>\r\nRoger was shamelessly excited after seeing the transformation not bothered that his once male friend and roommate is now a hot MILF anthro bee.<br>\r\nNguyen, back at being a 9ft tall raptoress, squealed \"OOOHH MY GOSH!!!! You are so cute!\" She immediately got in on her knees and hugged her girlfriend squeezing tightly while she gently nuzzles her with her snout.<br>\r\n\"Hey, not so tight or i going to drop a few eggs here! \" Robert protested.<br>\r\n\"Oh right, sorry but you are so cute like this, i couldn't help myself.\" Nguyen loosens her hold on on the bee girl and keeps nuzzling her.<br>\r\n\"Girls not to ruin the moment but unless she makes more changes its my turn.\" Roger spoke.<br>\r\n\"Ok there are just a few things i want to change then its your turn.\" Nguyen stated.<br>\r\n\"Can't we go somewhere else more comfortable, like either one of our houses, before we change anything?\" Robert asked, not wanting to be standing in the hallway of the university for the rest of the day.<br>\r\n\"Of course my little queen bee.\" Nguyen cooed at Robert before releasing her and get up, Robert thought that Nguyen new attitude while a little embarrassing was not unwelcome, she kinda likes this way.<br>\r\n\"Who is going to drive?\" Both of them looked at Roger, and he relented. \"You are lucky that i am using pickup truck while he is on vacations, where to?\"</span></div></div>",

Nguyen yells, 'Wait, what!? What if he transform us into some kind of toys in some sort of toys in a twisted reality!?'. You smile, 'Nah. Pretty sure he'd start with something light. Besides, he wouldn't willingly harm his friends. And at worst, we could always revert changes.'. Or do you'd hope, given Roger had moved out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are greeted by an odd machine. You are sure it's Roger's doing, but have, otherwise, no idea of what it is for sure. The machine is about as tall as you, all covered in metal, aside from a short jean and a silky bra, covering a generous pair of C-cup breasts. The machine also looks like human in all regard, if you exclude the aforementioned skin, a pair of large wings in a V-shape, each wing bolstering two turbo-reactors, a stability tail on her back, two small rotors on her back, and a cone-shaped head, on which stands a small cockpit, used for sight, and remplacing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoting that you weren't reacting, Roger says, 'Hey! It's me, Roger! Don't you recognize me?'. You answer, 'Ah! I wasn't sure.'. You facepalms and laughs at the same time. Roger grumbles, 'What's the matter!?'. You smirk, 'Nothing, Just that i'm pleasantly surprised by your work. How's your body's made?'. Roger says, 'Oh shush, you want? As for my body, it's made of a reinforced aerodynamic ferrous material, with deceiving fuel capacity, as well as i remain a living being, so i can still eat and drink. Besides.. Where's my hot-dog?'. 'Roger, i promised you one, but <i>*only if you lost*</i>. Seriously, you're so dense sometimes..'. Roger shows her generous backside, showing a painted flying and roaring wyrm, and says, 'Also, if you didn't noticed, i'm an anthro VTOL fighter, and, as such, i carry an heavy machinegun, as well as air-air and air-ground missiles.'. 'Why i'm not surprised..'. You sigh again. 'Give me the watch back, you want?'. 'Err.. Robert? I don't have it anymore..'. You shout, 'How could y-..!'. 'Hey boys!~ I have it!~'. It was Nguyen. But something was off. It sounded.. Heavenly. You and Roger look at the raptoress, before being in awe, as you both say, 'Woah..'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raptoress had grown by a good feet, while floating gently off the ground. Her clothing was remplaced by a white gown, outlined by a gold armor on her chest, while her cloth and armor still shows off her cleavage and belly. Two pairs of wing, one of a wingspan of twice her arms' size, the other of her arms' wingpan stands on her back. A light halo floated on top of her head. For some reasons, Nguyen had wished to become an angel. Then you notice she hit the permament button on the watch, making all your changes permanent, until further notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pouts, 'Are you trying to make me jealous!?'. Roger and Nguyen giggles, then they grin as Roger moves next to Nguyen. You didn't liked that, as Roger whispers to the watch. You couldn't hear anything, but soon enough, you felt a tingle in your body. Your breasts expands up, reaching E in cup, straining onto your top, before your abdomen throbs with life, expanding until it is roughly three times as big as your chest, bare the breasts. To finish the transformation, you feel a slight amount of pudge going into your belly, giving you a motherly look. Roger laughs up, 'All hail the new Queen!'. You were about to jump on the VTOL fighter to give Roger a piece of your mind, when Nguyen wishes up as well, 'I wish that Robert gets an armor and weapon fitting her new body!'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou meep as your body slowly get encased into a silver-colored regal armor, progressively covering your whole body, while being surprisingly snug and comfy, like it wouldn't impede your movements in any way. And while your head remains actually uncovered, plates of more silver-colored gets onto your large abdomen, giving you a better protection for your sensible backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven that, by the time you did all the wishes, it was almost night time, you..</span></div></div>",

But then as your mind began wandering through more gender bending fantasies, an idea came to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My penis has the ability to retract into a vagina-like opening when not being used, leaving nothing but a smooth slit that has all the same sensations as a female vagina.  My hips are wider to accommodate this new anatomy, and I have normal female breasts that are capable of lactating after getting a woman pregnant, to help with breast feeding.  My voice is still my own, but with narrower vocal chords.\"  You say all this as you hold the watch up in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you felt a pain in your pelvis, as your penis was rapidly sucked up inside you, pushing your hips outwards to make room.  Your chest ballooned out to B cup breasts, comfortably safe within your new bra.  You patted the front of your skirt and felt no bulge, just smoothness, and the outline of a slit between your thighs.  As you ran your finger along the purple cotton panties, you felt a new sense of arousal.  You felt something within your body start to harden and push out against the lips covering it.  A bulge began to form once gain under your skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like that's still there...\"  You said with a higher pitched and softer sounding voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gently tried to relax and think unsexy thoughts, and your hidden penis softened.  It quickly retracted itself back inside, making the bulge completely disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One last thing to do!\"  You said as you once again brought out the watch and pressed a button on the side.  Which button did you press?</span></div></div>",

It wasn't even a conscious walk, just the way your body was structured now made it happen.  You smirked as you saw Roger glance up from his phone, briefly giving your body a glance over.  When he finally made eye contact with you, he hurriedly looked away, realizing it was you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Robert!  You're back already?  You ah... you ready to go?\"  He said, apparently acting almost nervous around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe definitely recognized you, and didn't seem to comment on anything being unusual.  But perhaps... you looking like an attractive woman was making your friendship with him uncomfortable.  He likely knew you still had a male anatomy between your legs, and was questioning his sexuality by finding you attractive.  For some reason, this just amused you to no end.  You considered making a wish to put his mind at ease, but you decided against it, leaving him to figure out his own emotions for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!  I'm all set, you study for that test we have later today?\"  You respond, strangely cheerfully in your new feminine voice, enjoying the tone that it made.  You found yourself speaking more chipper than usual, as though testing the limits of your new range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger's face went pale however, \"Shit...no I didn't... Look I'm sure I'll be fine.  Maybe... do you think Nguyen can give me a quick crash course review at lunch, last minute kind of thing?  I know she took the class already, so could you... idk, sweet talk her for me, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reality, the test was the least of your concern right now, with a magic wishing watch, you could fix all of this easily.  But you didn't want to clue Roger in on any of it, so you simply played along.  \"It'll be fine, if she can't help then I'll do my best to go over things with you, it's really not as hard as you're making it out to be.

Let me fix that.\" Before you could stop him, he took out the watch and says, \"I wish Nguyen would enjoy and even prefer being female along with everything it might mean, be content and even happy with her petite size, and is proud of her Vietnamese descent. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour words of protest die on your lips.

We need to be careful changing reality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe agreed. As you were walking to you first class though, you were not aware of a new reality wave that passed though you. It never crossed your mind to think it strange that you now considered it normal to suck your boyfriend's cock for his recreation and pleasure when asked, and that you especially loved the taste of Robert's cum.

Since you knew about the watch, you were aware of the changes it made, and you now realized what Robert had done to you! As you wondered what to do, you kept heading to you next class. As you thought about it, you remembered that, unless the 'Permanent' button was pushed, things would revert back within two hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went through your first class, and into your second. That ended and you had a break, and through yet another class and nothing happened. You sighed. Apparently Robert had not forgotten to make the changes permanent. You were really going to lay into Robert when you saw him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did see him sitting there at lunch. You stormed up to him, \"Robert! How dare you make that change to me without my permission?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe acted innocent, \"What changes are you talking about Nguyen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself looking down at his crotch and realized that your mouth was watering! \"You know damn well what I am talking about!

When we are done eating, we can go up to your room and I will undo it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did not like it, but you had no choice, so you agreed. When you were both done eating, Robert walked you up to your room. Thankfully your roommate was not there. When you got there, Robert said, \"Now what did you want to talk about Nguyen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had not even answered yet, and you were already down on your knees and undoing Robert's pants. \"I am talking about this! You made me want to do this!\" Your mouth was watering at the sight of Robert's cock! \"I can't believe you did thith tu muh\u2026.\" The end of your sentence was slurred as you started to suck Robert's cock. You wanted to please Robert so much you couldn't make yourself stop! You also were anxious for a taste of his cum. When he did cum, you sucked down every drop. The worst part was, you loved every moment of it, and the taste of his cum was the most wonderful thing you ever tasted in your life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finished, Robert said, \"I really couldn't' understand the last part. Did you want me to undo this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem was, you were hooked. You loved it, and it seemed normal now, even though you knew it shouldn't be. \"Yes, I mean no, I mean, you shouldn't change me without asking my permission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, \"Okay baby, I promise not to do it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to clean yourself up and don't even realize that you are accepting something you should stay angry about. \"You need to use that watch responsibly Robert. I don't think your dad would approve of some of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed, \"But don't you see Nguyen? I can do almost anything with this!\" He opened the watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the door burst open and two large men came in with guns. They looked at Robert, \"Hold it right there! The Boss wants that watch, right now! So hand it over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert smiled, \"Of course gentlemen. You know, I wish you were both two-year-old girls and those guns were your favorite dollies instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they knew what was going on, the guns they were holding changed into dolls in their hands. They began to realize what was next and started to run, but it would not help them. They were shrinking rapidly, and they were looking more and more feminine. Before they got to the end of the hallway, Robert easily rounded up the new toddlers and brought them in, clinging instinctively to their dolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one looked way up at him, \"Make me back!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert grinned, \"Maybe with a new life, you will grow up as nice girls. I wish you both no longer knew how to read, write, or go potty outside of your diapers.\" He looked at the one who seemed to be a follower, \"I wish you were the daughter of a farm family in Iowa, love being female, and your greatest desire is and will aways be to get married and have lots of children.\" She was crying as the waves made her disappear. She was now an Iowa farm girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert looked at the other one. \"You though, like things rough. Okay, I wish you were the daughter of a very poor family in Mexico. You will not remember any English, and will only have the vocabulary of a two-year-old Mexican girl. You will never be able to learn another language, or how to read or write, and you will grow up to be both beautiful and very fertile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was screaming, \"No!\" as she vanished to somewhere in Mexico.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Robert, \"Don't you see? People are after this watch! Dangerous people! You need to get rid of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert fixed the door and closed it. \"Don't worry Nguyen. My dad was afraid to use it. I am not.\"</span></div></div>",

The only way to do that is to somehow get the watch from him. Fortunately, your body can be useful for that. You look up at him, \"I understand Robert. I am just worried about you.\" You walk up to him and hug him, making sure your breasts are pressing firmly against him. Then you step back. \"We need to finish classes. But afterward, could we explore these bodies a whole lot more? I want you to be my 'first'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, \"That sounds good to me baby. And don't worry about me.

You had always wondered what sex would be like as a female, and now that you were one, you wanted to know it even more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you met Robert after school, you acted very upset. It did not take a whole lot to act that way, and you hated yourself for what you were about to do. Robert looked at you, \"What is wrong Nguyen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou worked up some teary eyes, then looked up at him and said, \"It was Jeff. You know who I mean. He is such a bigot, and he was harassing me about being a Vietnamese girl again.\" You sighed, \"I wish he knew what it was like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert grinned, \"I think that is a great idea.\" He pulled out the watch. \"I wish that Jeff would become an attractive Chinese girl, the same build and height as Nguyen. I wish that she would have a great body, but had poor vision and would be legally blind without her thick glasses. I also wish that she would remember who she really was, but would not be able to tell anyone, nor to stop hoping for love and to become a wife and mother some day.\" He smiled, \"I also wish she was from a first-generation family, and spoke Chinese as her first language, and speaks English with a thick, Chinese accent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe watch glowed. You hated what you just caused to be done to Jeff, but if your plan worked out, you could undo it. It was not all made up either, so maybe a short time as a Chinese girl would do Jeff some good. Now for the next part. You walked up to Robert, \"Thank you! Now, let's explore these bodies and let me show you how much I appreciate you!\" You rubbed his crotch as you said it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you were kissing passionately and undressing each other! You could not believe how wonderful it felt to have Robert caressing your breasts, an then sucking on your nipples!. It seriously began to make you wonder what it would be like to feel a baby suckling from your breasts. When he began to stroke your pussy, you really began to moan, and it was incredible to feel yourself being penetrated for the first time! Maybe it was a female thing, but as you felt him inside of you, you truly wondered what it would be like to feel a child growing inside of your womb? You screamed in orgasm as he came inside of you! It was incredible to think of his sperm inside of you, swimming faithfully to try to find an egg in your body to fertilize!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were both done, you kissed him and thanked him for being your lover! You ended up making love two more times that night, and the last time, Robert actually fell asleep on top of you as soon as he had dumped his load inside of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you loved the feeling of him inside of you, you needed to get up. It took you over twenty minutes to figure out how to roll Robert off of you. When you did at last, you kissed Robert, \"Thank you again my love.\" You smiled as he gave a satisfying snore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got out of bed as quietly as possible. It was not hard to move silently as you went to the other side of the bed and gently picked up the watch. You were tense as you made your way to the bathroom, and you did not relax at all until you were inside of the bathroom and had the door locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened up the watch and looked at its glowing face. Now you can wish for control over it and Robert, and perhaps undo a few things.</span></div></div>",

Jeff would have no memory of ever being female, but Robert would remember who he was, and know how he got that way, but would be compelled to behave in every way as the girl she was, and act like she was deeply in love with Jeff. On the other hand, Jeff\u2019s anti-Asian bigotry would be replaced by a deep love for Mei-Lien, and the desire to marry her and have children with her. He would even hope his daughters looked just lie their mother!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you got dressed, you made it so that you had your own apartment and this was now Jeff\u2019s place, and Mei-Lien was his girlfriend, but still living at home with her Chinese parents. You arranged it so that you could speak fluent Chinese, and that Mei-Lien would wake up when you were back in you new place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after you arrived at home, your cell phone rang. You chuckled at you heard a deeply accented girl\u2019s voice say, \u201cHello? Is this Nguyen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled as you began to speak to her in Chinese, \u201cYes. Hello Mei-Lien. How are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fired back in angry Chinese, \u201cHow did you get the watch? Why did you do this to me? Change me back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned, \u201cWhy should I change you Mei?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe replied, \u201cListen you stupid bitch! Change me back now or else!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you got mad, \u201cOkay, have it your way. But hear this first. I wish that every day, at least once a day, you will have an overwhelming urge to suck Jeff\u2019s cock. You will also do it automatically any time you are alone and he desires it, even if he does not say so. You will not like the taste, but you will always swallow every drop of his cum.\u201d You smiled, \u201cOkay. Ready to change back to a guy now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe yelled, \u201cNo! Wait! I am sorry. I should not have called you a bitch. I am really, really sorry. I am asking you, I am begging you not to do this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, \u201cI am sorry Mei. You are my friend and I love you dearly. I love you enough to want you to learn why this device is too powerful for us to use. I think a week or so an Mei-Lien will do the job. Meet me at lunch tomorrow and we will talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to argue with you when in the background you could hear Jeff say, \u201cWho are you talking to baby? Is that your parents? Tell them I will bring you right home.\u201d With that you hung up. You knew that she would have to give her attention to Jeff now, even though she wanted to talk to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, you had to keep the watch. At least until you changed Robert back and fixed other things. But what do you do now? A sudden pounding on the door startles you.</span></div></div>",

When you looked out, you saw a small woman, just a bit taller than you, who looked very afraid. She did not seem to be a threat. You cracked the door open, \u201cCan I help you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe actually begged, \u201cPlease let me in!\u201d She looked over her shoulder and down the hall.

Please don\u2019t! He doesn\u2019t mean it! He loves me! He is just upset because he got laid off and he is a bit drunk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then we heard pounding on other doors and a man\u2019s voice. \u201cOh my word! He is coming looking for me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI told her, \u201cGo hide in my bedroom! Quick! I will handle him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finally came knocking on my door, he glared down on me, \u201cDid you see my wife? She might be sick and I need to find her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo not only was he obviously a drunk and coward, but a liar as well. Okay, so no problem with lying to him then, \u201cNo. I am alone here. I hope she is alright when you find her though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held my door open, \u201cShe might have snuck in here. I should look around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glared at him, \u201cI have been here all day and my door was locked. Now please go away or I will call the police.\u201d He glared at me, then walked away. I sighed in relief as I closed and locked the door. I waited a while, then peeked out in the hall. It was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked back to my bedroom. \u201cIt is okay. He is gone. Do you need medical attention?\u201d But when I looked over, I saw that she had somehow found the watch!

Your ribs still ached where you landed on the edge of the coffee table. You looked at the wedding ring on your hand. Memories flooded your head. Dating Jake. Falling in love with him. Ignoring his aggressive behavior. Marrying him, and the conflict you had between your incredible love for him, and your constant fear of yet another beating that you lived with every day since. You knew you were now Nguyen Conner, Jake\u2019s wife!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at her, \u201cNo! Quick! Give the watch to me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned, \u201cWait! That worked?

Instead, you were filled with an overwhelming fear of Jake\u2019s anger. Maybe if you went back to him and told him how much you loved him, he would stop beating you! You needed to go right away, before he got too angry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you got up and moved toward the door, the woman said, \u201cWait. I can do this much for you. He was always angry that I never got pregnant. I never had the courage to tell him that the doctor said I never could get pregnant. So maybe you can be happy. I wish that he would make love to you and you would get pregnant tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in shock! \u201cNo! That is a bad idea! Please undo that wish!\u201d But you were too much afraid to stop and say more. You hurried \u2018home\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you walked in the door, Jake was there, \u201cWhere have you been you stupid bitch? I was looking all over for you!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt yourself begin to quiver. \u201cI, I just went for a walk Jake. Really!\u201d In spite of yourself, you threw yourself on him and hugged him. \u201cI love you Jake! I love you more than the whole world! Please! Please don\u2019t hurt me again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently he had calmed down some, \u201cJust don\u2019t run away like that again baby. Now come here. Daddy needs some sugar.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifted your chin and began kissing you as though nothing had ever happened. You did not complain about the pain from your bruises as he crushed you in a hug, then picked you up and carried you to the bedroom. You did not resist as he undressed you, and when he climbed into bed with you, you tried desperately to think of a way to satisfy your husband without ending up pregnant before you had a chance to get the watch back!</span></div></div>",

Long before you are even close to an orgasm, you feel his hot seed begin pumped inside of you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he was done, Jake pulls out of you, flops on his back and passes out. You \u2018know\u2019 from experience that he will be out for a while, probably until morning. You climb out of be very carefully, and quietly leave the room. You slip into the bathroom, close the door, and begin to cry in deep sobs! What will you do now? Even if you succeed in getting the watch back, you know the power of the wishes. There is zero chance that you won\u2019t conceive from what you just did with Jake. No matter what, you will give birth to his child!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull yourself together, and soon find yourself cleaning the bathroom. Jake likes thing clean and neat. As you worked, you tried desperately to think about that to do. The watch was now in the hands of a woman who\u2019s name you never even got. You were now not only pregnant, but married to and deeply in love with a man who will beat you at the drop of a hat. Even if you get the watch, you have already learned that you love Jake to much to hurt him. Already you wouldn\u2019t want to undo your marriage to him. Unless someone else, like the mystery woman, undoes this, you will not have the will to overcome your new love of Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst things first though. You had to get that watch back, if only to prevent further damage. If only you could think! You also wished like hell that you could satisfy your sexual needs. Jake always left you wanting. Then something occurred to you. Jake would sleep through a tornado when he is like this. What if you could\u2026?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sneak back into the bedroom, undress, and move next to Jake. It has been a while, and he is sleeping on his back. You begin to play with his cock, and even suck it, until he is fully erect. Then you straddle him and guide him inside of you. It feels so good! Jake moans softly, but does not wake up. You ride him slowly, steadily, driving him deep inside of you then out again. After a lot of pleasure, you have what is, in this new life, your first orgasm ever. Its strength and intensity catch you off guard and you let out a scream of pleasure before you realize what you just did!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly look down to see that\u2026</span></div></div>",

I am determined to give you the children you want! I want to get as much of your seed inside of me as I can! Can you forgive me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake, who in five years of marriage only ever allowed the missionary position, was pleasantly surprised at how nice it was to have his wife riding him. \u201cOkay. Well, I haven\u2019t come yet, so why don\u2019t you keep doing what you were doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did just that, taking it slow as you were, driving yourself closer to another orgasm. Jake finds that he loves playing with your bouncing breasts as you do. When he finally does come, you scream in another orgasm!  Wow! From zero orgasms in your life, (based on the new reality,) to two in one session! You keep riding him until he finishes pumping into you, then you collapse on top of Jake, laying there panting as you feel him still twitching inside of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake stroked you hair, \u201cThat was incredible babe! Where did you learn to do that?\u201d You could tell he was a little suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled and said, \u201cRemember that movie we watched the other night. That was how the girl made love to her husband.\u201d You knew he didn\u2019t remember, but it worked. You wiggled your hips to move his cock inside of you. \u201cPlease stay in me as long as you can my love. I really believe we can do it this time. I want your baby so much!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake smiled, \u201cNo problem babe. I like the way this feels. We will have to do it again some time! Maybe even find some other new positions.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made love to Jake two more times that night. Jake discovered the doggie style, and you were worried that he would grow to like ti too much. Not that that would be too bad. He slowed down enough there for you to have one orgasm as least. He liked being dominant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Jake went out to look for a job. As soon as you had cleaned up from breakfast, you headed to what should have been your apartment. You were afraid as you knocked on the door. You kept knocking, but there was no answer. You think, if it was you, you would have a spare key hidden somewhere. Sure enough, you find it! You slip inside and begin to search for the watch!</span></div></div>",

It was eerily quiet, and when you looked around, the whole place seemed so different.  The lady that used to be Jake's wife had obviously been using the watch.  There was expensive electronics and art and all kinds of things decorating the apartment now.  She obviously liked material possessions, as everything in the house looked like she was now very wealthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou worked your way to the bedroom, able to step softly and silently in your tiny petite body.  You slowly opening the door to check that no one was inside, and began searching the cabinets and drawers and anywhere that it might be.  Finally you see a computer desk with an incredibly high end computer sitting there.  It was still logged in, and you saw a list of people, and a browser full of Facebook profiles was open on another monitor.  She had obviously been doing some reality changes, possibly taking money or other things from these people who she was researching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut none of that mattered however, as you realized the watch was sitting right there next to the computer!  You poked it with a pen just to make sure it wasn't booby trapped or something, and then grabbed it and quickly made a wish.  \"I wish Jake didn't beat me and that he was more of a loving husband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't the wish you had intended, but you were madly in love with Jake now, due to the woman's wish, and you couldn't help yourself.

You felt happier knowing that Jake and you could get along happily now too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard the creaking of a door opening, and realized you'd left the front door unlocked...  If the lady was back home and wanted her watch back, you weren't sure what you'd do.  But she had made a hateful wish to put you in a life you didn't belong in, and you felt like she was misusing the watch already.

You had to think of something quickly, so instead you got down on your knees and surprised him by taking his less than average sized cock in your mouth.  You realized that Robert's previous wish was still in effect somehow, and you had started blowing your new husband without even thinking about it.  You enjoyed every minute of taking it down as far as it could go in your throat, and then when he was finally done, slurping up every drop of cum.  He moaned and seemed pleased that you were able to get him off, but now you were incredibly turned on, and he was done for the night already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, you found yourself being happy that you could drink some of his seed instead of having it in your womb.  You felt yourself starting to cry, but you weren't sure if it was from the pain of the bruises, or some kind of twisted tears of joy forced out of you by the wish to be his loving wife.  But you were still horny and there was no way he'd satisfy you tonight.  You curled up on the bed, refusing to move, and continued crying and rubbing your  pussy which was aching from the need to be penetrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for that babe, you did an amazing job... I'm sorry for everything... you know how it is though.  You know I love you.\"  Jake said, though you weren't sure the words were sincere.  He was just riding on the high of getting off, and you knew from your new memories that his nice attitude wouldn't last long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to say something that might help the situation, but somehow the words that came out were,  \"Jake I know... I love you too.  I think tomorrow we should try for a baby again, I've been waiting soo long...  And I know you have too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't what you meant to say, but the wish had made you start thinking thoughts like these already.  Jake's previous wife had made you WANT to get pregnant, and now the words coming out of your mouth were your honest desires, they had only taken some time to work their way into your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Jake said nothing after this, and you knew he had already fallen asleep.  You continued to lie there rubbing your aching pussy, and decided to relieve the pressure.  You began fingering yourself, fondling your clit and stifling the girlish moans that would come out of your mouth.  Finally you managed to do what Jake couldn't, and brought yourself to orgasm, quivering and shaking in the bed.  Not wanting to go to bed, you simply licked your fingers clean, and found that you actually enjoyed the taste of your own juices.  You weren't sure which of the many wishes had caused you to enjoy the taste, but at this point you didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you didn't do something, this was going to be your new life.  The loving wife of an abusive husband, and if you didn't do something, you might soon end up pregnant with his child.  Now there was nothing left to do but fall asleep and worry about this tomorrow.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sitting down on the closed lid of the toilet, you decide that your first order of business should be to assure that neither Robert nor anyone else but you can use the watch -- you just can't trust him, to say nothing of the rest of the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou depress the \"Permanent\" and \"Global\" buttons and say, \"I wish I --\" Only nothing's coming out of your mouth. You try a whisper, no sound. A little louder than you'd tried to speak at first, still nothing. You don't want to try yelling for now, since you might wake up Robert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close the cover of the watch and whisper, \"Testing, one, two.\" This time, sound emerges from your mouth. You sigh, realizing that the Robert must have booby-trapped the watch so you wouldn't be able to use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But what if he'd been a little sloppy with his phrasing?</i> you wonder. Maybe he'd used the phrase \"speak a wish,\" and yelling <i>would</i> work. Besides, even if you woke him up by yelling, you would have already completed the crucial wish, and he wouldn't be able to do anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath, reformulate the proper wish in your head, then flip open the watch and yell, \"I wish I --\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not working. You're not making a peep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe short fingernails on the hand that's holding the watch suddenly grow out by about an inch, perfectly shaped and manicured with white tips. You're stunned enough that you almost fall off the toilet, your other arm catching yourself on the towel rack, where you see that its fingernails have grown as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to catch your balance and get to a standing position. You look in the mirror above the sink, where you see in the dim light that your shoulder-length dark brown hair is speedily growing -- you realize you can feel it extending down your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour breasts grow outward, the weight on your chest steadily increasing, the bottom hem of your T-shirt creeping upward to reveal that your already petite waist is cinching inward and a silver bauble dangles from a now-pierced navel. Your panties strain against hips and ass that are expanding nearly as much as your breasts, giving you a serious hourglass figure. Just as it seems the panties are about to split at a seam, they morph into a tiny black thong. Your T-shirt changes as well, into a skimpy black lace teddy that barely contains your breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a split-second, you feel as if you're growing taller, but then you realize it's because your bare feet are now in high-heeled shoes that are forcing you onto your tiptoes and forcing you to thrust your chest further forward. What concerns you more, though, is that your face now appears to be thickly painted with heavy makeup, complete with thicker and longer eyelashes and glossy red lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then notice a small makeup bag on the bathroom counter fade out of existence. You experiment on your face with a washcloth, and don't even make a dent -- it appears that the reality shift has made the appearance of your face permanent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo this was another booby trap, you realize -- the <i>second</i> time you tried to use the watch, you got transformed to look like a hooker or a porn star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quietly groan and take another look in the mirror at your hip-length hair, colorful face, and altered body, something straight out of a horny male's fantasies. At least you can cover up in Robert's terrycloth bathrobe, which is hanging from the hook on the back of the bathroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put it on and it almost instantly shrinks and alters its material to become a skimpy version of a kimono, in green silk with white accents, cut to reveal much of your copious cleavage and the lower half of your ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it,\" you say out loud now that the watch is closed again.</span></div></div>",

If you keep abusing it like this they're going to catch up to you sooner or later.  Will you be able to protect yourself at all hours?  What if they showed up while you're sleeping, or what if they hurt me to get to you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert looked down at you, since he stood a good 9 inches taller than your short Vietnamese body as Nguyen.  You could tell he was considering what you'd said, and at least he wasn't entirely lost yet\u2026 you hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right Nguyen, I won't be able to defend myself forever.  And I certainly don't want you to be helpless and used as an object to get to me.  Believe me that's the last thing I want, love.  So since it was your idea, I think I have an idea of how you can help protect me.\"  Robert said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tilted your head curiously as he pulled out the watch again.  You started to yell, \"Hey!  Don't make another wish--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nguyen please!  Just let me make this wish ok?  Then we can discuss this.\"  He said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself stop talking as though you were dutifully obeying his request.  You didn't want to upset him, and you did still love him and respect him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert then made his wish, with the permanent button pressed, \"I wish that Nguyen Minh-Ho was now a special agent that works for me and is completely loyal to me.  I wish that her first mission is to find the boss of the group that is looking for this watch, and she will do anything to stop him, even kill him if necessary.  I wish that Nguyen has all the skills necessary to be an undercover agent, including, but not limited to, marksmanship, deception, and seduction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  What's all this?  Seduction?!\"  You asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were going to ask where he was going with this, but suddenly you felt a tingling all over.  Your clothes began to transform from your usual Nguyen street clothes, into something a bit more fitting of a special agent.  You were now wearing a tight black jumpsuit that felt like it hugged your every curve, and was likely made out of a bullet resistant fabric.  You also had leather boots with a three inch heel that threw you off balance for a second, but you quickly got used to them as though you always wore heels.  Your outfit also now contained straps and pockets for gadgets and holsters for pistols.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still the same old Nguyen physically, but you suddenly felt like you were actually capable of all the things he listed out, and more.  New memories flooded into your head of years of special agent training, and how you'd done it all to protect your boyfriend Robert.  You had a new sense of undying loyalty to him, and felt like you would do anything he asked of you, including kill a man at his request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\u2026 what did you do Robert.  I feel like a god damn super hero or something\u2026\"  You said, noting your outfit looked like something out of the recent Marvel movies.  A sexy but mostly practical outfit for a female agent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt your hips were two pistols that you quickly un-holstered and found that you could draw them ready to fire before you even realized you were doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive, that wish worked out better than I planned.  You look like a damn sexy spy now Nguyen\u2026\"  He said, bending over to kiss you on the neck, just above where the outfit stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled and enjoyed the attention he was giving you, and kissed him on the lips.  \"This is actually really cool\u2026 but what's the point?  These people know about the watch, so if they see me they will likely know exactly who I am, and that I'm with you!  Kind of useless for an 'undercover agent' don\u2019t you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've thought of that as well\u2026\" Robert said, preparing another wish.

And I wish that whenever she caused someone to orgasm, she could choose to copy their appearance onto herself as a disguise for twenty four hours.  I wish that she could always return to looking like herself at any time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief glow on the watch and then it was over.  You weren't sure yet if his wish had actually worked, but you liked the sound of it.  The idea of being a master of disguise secret agent with the ability to change your appearance was actually turning you on.<br>\r\n\"Well let's see if it works\u2026\"  You said as you stood on your tip-toes to kiss Robert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sudden shock on your lips like you'd kissed an electrical socket.  Somehow you knew at this moment you would have to decide in a few seconds if you wanted to change, or you'd lose the opportunity.  You decided to accept the change, and within seconds you found yourself shooting up in height and becoming a man once again.  In fact you now looked like an identical copy of Robert, or rather, your old body.  You still remember growing up your whole life as Nguyen however, so being Robert was almost alien to you now.  You felt a very strange feeling between your legs and then you remembered you had a penis now\u2026 at least for two hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange thing however, was that you were still wearing the black spy outfit like before, but it was fitted for your current body shape.  The boots had lost their high heels apparently, which didn't come with the male version.  Thanks to Robert's earlier wish, you now enjoyed and preferred being a small female, so having Robert's body made you very uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit\u2026 this is amazing!\"  You said in Robert's male voice.  \"I'm still Nguyen deep down, but I look like you now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert smiled, \"That's definitely going to be useful, you're going to make an excellent spy Nguyen.  But I'd prefer if you didn't use my appearance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged, \"That's fine, I wasn't planning on staying like this.  Being a guy is just\u2026 ugh it's so weird having one of these things between my legs.  I mean, attached to me of course.\"  You said, sticking your tongue out.  You certainly didn\u2019t mind his penis between your legs when it was penetrating you, not part of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided you had enough of being Robert for now, and willed yourself to change back.  In a second you found yourself shrinking drastically again, until you were 5 foot tall Nguyen with the same three inch heels as before.  This made you happy, as being female was much more pleasurable to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Robert\u2026 if I'm going to do this, I'm really not comfortable with having to become a guy when I seduce a guy\u2026  Being a female is just so much more familiar to me.\"  You told him with a pouty face.  \"And it's not like I'm very good at seducing other women, since they likely wouldn't be into me, and I'm not into them.\"</span></div></div>",

Once again you felt in your mind that you've had all of these powers since birth and it made you the excellent spy you were today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if we test it again?  I want to see what happens...\"  You ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, just, no kissing on the lips this time.\"  He said, unzipping his pants, and pointing to his penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt yourself start to lose control again, as his previous wish was still in effect.  You had the uncontrollable urge to please him orally, and did so without question.  You slurped up every last bit of his seed, taking him deep inside your throat.  When he was finally done orgasming, you felt extremely satisfied and relished in the flavor.  You almost forgot to activate your power however, and noticed that you now had the feeling of being able to choose whether you should activate a male or female disguise.  You chose female of course, since his earlier wish had made you most comfortable being female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were once again growing, but not into a male.  This time you grew in height only enough to match Robert's, and with your high heels it made you taller than him.  You were no longer Vietnamese, and looked like essentially Robert's female twin sister.  Your hair was brown and long, and you had much bigger breasts than you had as Nguyen.  Being in this body made you feel somehow more sexy than before...  And it was all yours for 24 hours now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God damn I look good as a girl!\"  Robert said, admiring your body in its skin tight spy outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, this body is pretty sexy, too bad you weren't born female\u2026  So are you getting any kind of weird memories when you look at me?\"  You ask in a new and unfamiliar voice.  It was a female voice but sounded different than Nguyen's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I'm not sure.  I look at you and see a female version of myself, but it also seems normal.  My memories are a bit fuzzy, but I feel like the wish is making me believe that its normal for me to be a woman.\"  Robert explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!  I know, we should see how Roger reacts when he sees me.  Do you think he would see me as a female you or as some stranger he's never met?\"  You say excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to leave the dorm and head down the hallway to your friend Roger's dorm.  Your wider hips tend to sway now with these high heels, and you notice this body is so much curvier than Nguyen's\u2026  Finally you get to Roger's dorm and knock on the door.</span></div></div>",

He finally snapped out of it.  \"Oh, yeah no I totally agree.  That outfit really does need more cleavage I think\u2026 definitely\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, knowing it was working perfectly.  You took another drink and then unzipped the top of your skintight black outfit, exposing your cleavage to the world.  \"You see I thought it would be better when it looks like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger simply nodded, mesmerized by your sexy figure.  \"Yeah that\u2019s definitely better\u2026  So you know, Robert\u2026 if you ever decide to break up with Nguyen\u2026  I'm still single you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were shocked he was actually flirting with you, and very openly at that!  You finished your drink and stood up, getting ready to leave.  \"Uhh\u2026 yeah if that ever happens I'll let you know.  But I don't think a little spat like this is going to break us up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up and approached you.  \"Oh no I didn't mean it like that, I was just saying.  Oh damn I've made an ass of myself haven't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself giggling actually, and decided to experiment with a kiss.  You leaned in and pecked him on the lips.  \"This doesn't mean anything, but don't worry.  You're a very handsome guy and I'm sure you'll find someone for you.  Don't wait around for Nguyen and I to break up, you deserve someone who is there for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that kiss, you left his dorm and closed his door behind you.

Apparently you only had a minute after the kiss to decide if you wanted to change.  You triggered the female change and found yourself getting even taller, growing to 6 foot, plus another 3 inches with heels, since Roger was quite a tall guy.  Your hair color changed to a brilliant orange ginger and you saw in a reflection that your face was quite cute with many freckles.  This is what Roger would have looked like as a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour breasts were still quite impressive, and filled out the spy outfit well.  You realized you were still showing your cleavage to the world, and decided to leave it that way for now.  You went back to Robert's dorm room and knocked.  Robert opened the door and saw you standing there, it took him a moment to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roger\u2026?  What are you doing here?  How come you're dressed like\u2026  OH!  You cheeky\u2026 get in here already!\"  He said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled and went inside, smiling to him as you walked past.  \"So what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could swear you're Roger\u2026 the only way I know is that sexy outfit, she'd never wear something like that.  So you went over to her dorm and kissed her I guess?  Looks like the disguise wish works perfectly!\"  Robert said, rather proud of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, realizing that Robert now believed Roger was ACTUALLY female, thanks to his own wish.  As long as you were in this form around Robert, he would think this was Roger's true appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it worked perfectly.  'She' believed I was actually you, even though I was the female version of you.  To her it was like you'd always been a woman, and she even tried flirting with me!  That's when I kissed 'her'.\"  You said, slightly emphasizing 'she' and 'her' cause you knew it was a lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't seem to catch on however, and looked like he was actually getting turned on by you as a tall redhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robert!  Don't tell me you're attracted to Roger!  I'm still your girlfriend you know!\"  You told him, reminding him that you're Nguyen deep down (also false, but thanks to his wish you felt this way).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right I'm sorry, that body is just so sexy in that outfit\u2026  Do you mind if we\u2026  I mean I've always been curious about her\u2026\"  Robert said uncomfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and unzipped his pants right then and there, grabbing his cock.  \"Fine, if you want it from Roger so bad, I'm going to give it to you, but don't you dare say I never do anything for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sense of loyalty that he gave you meant that you pretty much had to do anything he said, even if it made you unhappy, because you were loyal to him.  You spent the next hour rocking his world as a sexy redhead, the female equivalent of his best friend.  In the end he fell asleep in your arms, and the two of you napped for an hour in peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you both woke up, two hours had passed and you felt yourself changing again.  The transformation only lasted two hours because it was just a kiss, but you felt odd that you weren't becoming Nguyen again.  When it was over, you noticed you were once again the female Robert instead, just this time you were buck naked on the real Robert's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert saw you transform and suddenly snapped awake.  \"What the\u2026 did I just fuck Roger?  Oh my god\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, no that was me, don't you remember?\"  You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but you looked like Roger, and Roger's a guy\u2026?\"  He seemed really confused now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t help but laugh now, \"That just proves that your wish works.  I was a female version of Roger, the real Roger is still male of course\u2026  It messed with your memories to make you think Roger had always been female, and you seemed to have no problem screwing me when I looked like 'her'.\"\"I do kind of remember, but I don't remember you being female, it's all kind of a blur.  I do remember enjoying it quite a bit, and I can't see myself doing that with a guy.\"  Robert said, seemingly missing the irony that he used to like guys as Nguyen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't worry, I'm learning more and more about this power you gave me\u2026  Did you notice I changed back to looking like female you?  It must be because I made you orgasm and so I have 24 hours looking like this.  I supposed I could change back to Nguyen but\u2026 this is more fun honestly.\"  You said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you two could continue, there was a loud knock at the door that startled you.</span></div></div>",

I wish Nguyen would be able to act just like Ashley when she needed to, but deep down was still Nguyen and was completely loyal to me.\"  Robert said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered who this Ashley was, and how Robert planned on changing you when your previous wish had said that you must be Nguyen until the end of the school year.  Somehow it must have worked, however, since you felt yourself beginning to change.  You grew about six inches taller, and your petite Asian body began to fill out its curves, until you had D cup breasts and a round ass.  Your previously black hair was now golden blonde, and very soft, and was long enough to nearly touch your butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you\u2026\"  You started to say, but you noticed your voice was different.  It was less high pitched than Nguyen's, but also a little more sultry.  \"Robert\u2026 what did you do?  You turned me into some blonde bimbo or something?  How am I going to infiltrate them when I stand out like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gestured at your body, particularly your large breasts, which you saw Robert was staring at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally snapped out of it and said, \"Not a bimbo, you're actually quite smart.  What you haven't seen yet is that the watch created an entire reality for Ashley Collins, who is about to be recruited into their organization.  Ashley never existed before today, but you are going to fill in that role and be the perfect spy.  The watch doesn't seem to want to tell me anything about these people, but apparently it's ok with changing reality to make you their newest recruit.  What a weird loophole\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you felt a vibration in your pocket and realized it was a cell phone ringing.  You decided it would be best to answer it.  \"Hello?\"  You said, unsure of yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley Collins?  You expressed interest in joining our organization correct?\"  A distorted voice asked, probably to disguise their identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes\u2026 This is Ashley, I am definitely still interested.\"  You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just had two positions open up, and would like to offer you one.  We have heard very high praise of your skills, and would be happy to see those skills in action.  Meet us at the location we're about to text you, and we will provide transportation the rest of the way.\"  The distorted voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, I look forward to it.\"  You said in Ashley's voice, not even realizing you were taking on her mannerisms.  Of course since Ashley was a completely made up person, those mannerisms were just programmed into this identity by Robert's wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the call was hung up, you looked to Robert who was observing you, and gave him a nasty look.  \"What?  This is your fault by the way.  Thanks to you now I'm joining some evil organization that I know nothing about and I'm a completely different person!  Though I gotta say I feel pretty powerful as this Ashley chick, she's in really good shape!  I feel like I could kick some ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, you gotta focus on the job.\"  Robert said, putting his hand on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a split second your instincts took over and grabbed his arm, twisting it backwards and flipping him onto the ground.  He landed with a loud thud, and the wind was completely knocked out of him as he lay there staring up at you.  It was then that you realized you had drawn your gun and was aiming it at his face.  It all happened so fast, you hadn't even thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nguyen\u2026 remember who you are loyal to.  You're still you, remember?\"  Robert said calmly as he looked into your eyes.</span></div></div>",

Your boyfriend\u2026?\"  Robert said, trying to maintain his calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still didn't flinch, debating with yourself whether you should pull the trigger or not.  He had the watch, and was already proving himself to be dangerous.  On the other hand, you still loved him, and would die for him.  You reminded yourself that before all this happened, YOU were Robert, and Robert was Nguyen.  He was your beautiful girlfriend until you swapped your two identities.  Then he basically erased Nguyen from existence and replaced her with this Ashley girl that you'd become\u2026 Though you weren't sure if Ashley replaced Nguyen or if Nguyen's identity is still in this reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, he was screwing with reality way too much, and you couldn't even keep track of it all.  Worstly, he had used the permanent button on the watch, which meant all of these changes were never going to change back unless another wish was made!  It was quite possible you were going to be stuck as Ashley Collins, a double agent spy, for the rest of your life.  It could be a worse life, but you wanted control of your own destiny, rather than Robert to be in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your mind battled over what to do, Robert began to slowly reach for the watch.

I was almost ready to shoot you for a second there.\"  You admit to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe breathes a sigh of relief and puts the watch back in his pocket.  \"You were starting to scare me, but with an act like that, you'll be a perfect spy.  You managed to fool me even.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't fooling you because it was real!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, it's fine.  Real is better, because they will never suspect a thing.  The best spy has to BECOME their disguise, though you took it a bit more literal than most\u2026\"  Robert joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't find it funny, but forced a chuckle anyways.  Right now Ashley's personality was making you laser focused on the mission.  \"Listen Robert, we should focus on this mission.  If you want me to be your agent, you have to trust me to do what needs to be done in the field.  But if things go wrong\u2026 maybe I should have some way to contact you in an emergency?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine, I'll give us a telepathic link so we can communicate remotely without radios or anything.\"  He suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as you can't read my thoughts\u2026 I guess.  But I would prefer if we only used that for emergencies.  If you are constantly telepathically speaking to me it might distract me from the mission.\"  You told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine, I wish Nguyen and I could transmit messages to each other telepathically, but only information that we choose to send.\"  Robert said into the watch, and it was so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to try it out.  (Can you hear me?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then got the sensation in your mind that a message was ready to play.  You 'opened' it, and heard Robert's voice say, &lt;Wow this is cool, I hear your voice in my head, but it's like I have to open up a voice mail first.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(I have a question\u2026)  You thought to Robert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Ok go ahead?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Do I still exist?  I mean Nguyen.  I noticed you still used that name when wishing about me, as though it's my real identity.  But you said the wish created a whole identity and history for Ashley Collins?  Which one am I really?  I feel like I have both personalities in my head and they are fighting over which one's real.)  You thought to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused for a moment and looked deep in thought.  \"I suppose both of you are real.\"  He said.  \"In this reality Nguyen exists, but she is nowhere to be found.  You are Nguyen, and yet you're Ashley as well.  Anyone who knows Nguyen may start looking for her, but in your current state they will see you as a stranger\u2026  It's the best way for you to be undercover if no one knows that identity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you were now a hybrid of two women, and your original self.  You had vague memories of once being Robert, but very strong memories of growing up as Nguyen.  Yet your physical body was that of Ashley Collins, and your personality had been largely suppressed by Ashley's in order to easily maintain cover.   You knew this would be hard, but Robert's wish had made sure you were focused on completing the mission.  You would find out who wants the watch, and eliminate them as a threat.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I wish 'Ashley' was now in possession of all of her belongings, including her nice car parked right outside.\"  Robert said, holding the watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't notice anything change at first, until you felt one of the pockets in your jumpsuit now contained car keys and a wallet.  Pulling out your wallet you noticed the driver's license read: \"Ashley Collins, Female, 24, 5'6\" Blonde Hair Blue Eyes.\"  It even included an address which you somehow knew was your new house, and contained all of 'your' belongings.

You didn't really have much choice other than to follow his orders, but you were seriously starting to worry that this wishing power might be going to his head.  He'd changed you into this\u2026 sexy super spy without even asking, and now you were compelled to follow through with his every whim.

You were still dressed a bit conspicuously like a spy or an agent of some kind, but you realized that the people who wanted to recruit you were expecting just that.  However, you decided maybe you should go 'home' and get a change of clothes for first impressions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reached the street, you looked around to find your new car, and beeped the remote, realizing that the red Ferrari in front of the house was apparently yours!  Robert had really outdone himself with this wish\u2026  You hopped in the car, noticing that all the mirrors and seats were adjusted for your current body, and you instantly knew how to drive stick shift, though you had no experience in it before.  Your body simply drove you to your new house on autopilot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were expecting an apartment like Nguyen's, but no, Ashley, you, now lived in a rather expensive looking two story house with a big garage.  The inside was neatly decorated with art and other expensive d\u00e9cor, and you wondered just how you afforded things like this in this new reality\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I some kind of jewel thief or something?  How do I have so much money\u2026\"  You said in your new Ashley voice, still marveling at how smooth and classy it sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly found your way upstairs, and began browsing through your massive walk in closet, full of female clothing.  You found all sorts of clothes inside, but you were in a hurry so you picked out a simple, yet attractive outfit.  In minutes you had changed out of your 'secret agent' outfit, and were now wearing some casual black pants, a red camisole that exposed a bit of cleavage, and you kept the same boots you were already wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your spy outfit in a duffel bag, you threw it in the back of your car and drove down to the GPS location your contact sent you.  It was nearly an hour drive away, and you found yourself on the outskirts of a nearby town, outside of an abandoned warehouse.  You carefully parked your Ferrari outside, not wanting to get it dirty, and brought your duffel bag inside with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?  Is anyone here?\"  You called out, hearing your voice reverberate through the building, with no response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe building was completely empty, and you started to wonder if you'd been tricked.  The only sound was the clopping of your thick heeled boots echoing on the concrete floor.  You set your bag of things down on the ground, and sat your little butt on top of it.  Strands of your long blonde hair fell in your face as you rested your chin on your hand, waiting for someone to show up\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about fifteen minutes later when you heard two vehicles pulling up outside.  You somehow knew just from the sound, and could count six people's footsteps approaching.  Your ears had been trained to identify threats, and these men were not trying to hide their presence.  Though\u2026 you suspected they weren't all men.  You heard two of them break off and guard the entrance, while four people entered the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You managed to find us in a timely manner, I assume you know why you're here.\"  One of the men said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey approached you, all wearing mostly black outfits with guns holstered to their side, and trench coats that concealed who knows what else.  There were two women and two men, but one of the men looked like he was in authority here.  He took the lead and was the first to call you out.  You carefully stood up to meet them on their level and looked at each of their faces calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More or less.  I'm Ashley Collins, we spoke on the phone.  You told me there was a job opening\u2026\"  You stated plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman standing next to the lead man was looking you over in scrutiny, obviously judging your casual state of dress.  You started to wonder if you had misjudged them and should have worn your agent outfit, but you kept your cool and didn't give her anything.  She was a tall raven haired woman with tan skin of unknown ethnicity, but she had an intense look in her eyes that made you wary of her immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lead man replied, \"It wasn't me who spoke with you, but yes there is a job opening.  I'm not sure why my boss was interested in you, so you must have made an impression on the right people.  They claim you're skilled in what we need, but I find it hard to believe.  We need someone who is skilled in combat, deception, and most of all\u2026 is <i>loyal</i>.\"</span></div></div>",

Nguyen, sorry.  You said you hated being a girl and being Vietnamese, but you didn't say you weren't attracted to guys.  Was our whole relationship fake up to this point?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it wasn't.  I did love YOU as a person, even though I could never find myself attracted to you.  I hated my life as a girl and I always wanted to be born male and have a girlfriend of my own.  And now that this has happened, I couldn't be happier!  I feel so attracted to you right now, and I think it's a mix of my own feelings and yours.\"  Robert said, as he put his hand under your chin and caused you to look into his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no.. this isn't right.  I love you as you loved me... but now I am starting to understand why you disliked this body so much.  I feel so small and worthless, and I kinda wish I could go back to being a guy.\"  You said, turning your eyes away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because you are now Nguyen, born and raised that way.  Apparently it caused you to grow up with the same gender issues that I did, plus that combined with the fact that you have memories of being Robert, probably makes the pain even worse... It's too bad you wished that you couldn't undo this until the end of the school year.\"  Robert shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought for a moment, feeling more and more uncomfortable in your body by the minute.  It still felt like YOUR body since you had been born in it in this reality, but it didn't feel like you belonged in it.  You already started to feel what Nguyen had described to you just before the wish.

You hadn't realized it before, but you were so uncomfortable being in this body, that it was now like a huge burden had been lifted from you.  You looked down and saw your petite female body, and felt a few strands of your jet black hair fall in your face.

You stepped away from him and looked down to see your entire body shape transforming.  You (Nguyen) had always been a very petite girl, but you had very little curves to speak of.  In a second your chest started to inflate, and you now had trouble seeing your feet past the E cup breasts that now sat under your narrow shoulders.  They looked quite large on a girl of your small stature, but they somehow managed to look sexy without looking ridiculous.  Your ass also expanded to bubbly proportions, and and you found your posture adjusting to flaunt your assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all before your clothing transformed.  You thought you were growing in height, but it turned out you were now wearing 5 inch platform heeled leather boots.  The heels further exaggerated your sexy posture, cocking your hips to one side and sticking your chest out.  You were also now wearing a black flared cotton skirt and thigh high socks that stopped just beneath the skirt's hem.  For a top you wore a purple blouse that had just enough buttons undone to reveal a generous amount of cleavage.  Your hair suddenly grew somehow even longer than before, staying silky jet black color, but extending so long it was nearly touching the hem of your skirt!  If you had a mirror you would have also noticed you were now wearing makeup, including smoky eyeshadow and expertly applied eyeliner, that exaggerated your Vietnamese eyes.  To top it all off was a faint hint of pinkish purple lip gloss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert stood there in shock, and you noticed his eyes fixating on your curves, specifically your chest, which was much larger than before.  \"W-wow... Nguyen...  Did you intend to wish for that?  Cause holy shit it worked...  You look like you could be a super model or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter examining yourself you finally replied, \"Well no I didn't really intend to...\"  And you noticed your voice had even altered slightly, to have you speaking in a cuter, but also slightly sexier manner of speaking.  \"Weird my voice sounds different too!  I didn't intend to make a wish but... I think I like these changes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bounced up and down on your high heels just to try out the new body, and admired the way your new breasts bounced around inside your blouse.  You hadn't even realized it at first, but you also had absolutely no trouble walking around in these shoes, as if you'd worn them your whole life.  The wish had taken care of everything, and due to your new feminine outlook and desire to please Robert, you were absolutely loving the changes.  The way your chest moved, the insane length of your hair reaching the bottom of your skirt, and the roundness of your ass, were all exactly what you now wanted to look like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second thought, you pulled out the watch, and put your finger on the permanent button, \"Robert... I want to stay this way forever, with you.\"  And then you pressed it.</span></div></div>",

On one side, you knew you didn't want to stop experimenting with the watch just yet. On the other, you knew that you didn't often get to mess with Roger, much less to the extent that the watch now allows.<br>\r\n     \"Okay, okay. Don't get your panties in a bunch,\" you say coyly. Roger looked like he wanted to stare a hole through your head, but you weren't going to make him wait any longer. Opening the watch yet again and say, \"Roger is wearing the same pants, socks, and shoes that he was wearing prior to my last statement. As previous, he is aware of any and all changes that I have made so far with the watch.\"<br>\r\n     \"Oh thank God!\" Roger exclaimed as the mini-skirt lengthened and separated so that it was once again the same pair of pants he first put on this morning. It didn't take long before he noticed one little change that you didn't reverse. \"Hey, what about my leg hair? My pants feel strange this way.\"<br>\r\n     \"Oh, come on. Where's your sense of adventure? It's not like anyone will notice it under your pants. I can always change it back later.\"<br>\r\n     Roger didn't look totally convinced, but considering you didn't leave him stranded in a skirt, he didn't argue too much in return. Instead he leaned in closer and asked, \"What else can your watch do?\" Noticing the Permanent button, he asked you about its purpose. Telling him that it was supposed to set the way things currently are as the default reality a devious grin grew on his face.<br>\r\n     \"Okay, wise guy. If I have to have my legs shaved for the rest of the day, you should stay the way you are for just as long. Hit the permanent button so we don't change back after time's up.\"<br>\r\n     You look at the skirt you are currently wearing and think about the ramifications of his request. Still, knowing you can change things back at any point in time, you went ahead and hit the button. A nearly invisibly wave of energy shot out from the watch traveling as far as the eye could see.<br>\r\n     \"Wow, I didn't think you'd actually do it. Hey, we need to experiment with this more, but I need to head over to the computer lab to work on a group project. I'll call you when I get out?\"<br>\r\n     You readily agree to meet up with him later, and you each part ways for now. You can only laugh to yourself with the knowledge that you didn't change Roger completely back to normal. As far as everyone else is concerned, Roger's \"normal\" look is still wearing a skirt, hose, and heels. The only question now is what to do next.</span></div></div>",

You knew Nguyen didn't have class today so she'd probably be in her dorm right about now. Normally the RA's were pretty strict about not letting guys into the girl's dormitory, but with the watch, you figured you could wiggle your way around that rule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe click-clack of your heels striking the walkway you were on still struck you as strange. You knew how powerful the watch was, but you still had the sinking feeling that at any moment, people would suddenly realize you shouldn't be walking around campus in a skirt and heels. Still, the freedom you were experiencing right now was mesmerizing. Who could have imagined that something like this was even possible. You mind raced with dozens of gender-bending fantasies that you could experiment with. For now though, you were content to stick with things as they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at Nguyen's dorm, the Resident Assistant spotted you before you even got with 20 feet of the main entrance. \"You know you can't come in here Robert. Just because you're wearing a skirt, it doesn't change the fact that men aren't allowed to come into the building.\" She looked at you sternly and you knew there would normally not be a way to change her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, her comment gave you an idea. Turning around momentarily, you opened the watch and whispered into it. \"According to the University's policy, as long as I am wearing a skirt, for all intents and purposes I am considered female while on campus. I'd be expected to stay in the women's dorm, use women's restrooms, and if I wanted to join a frat, I'd be expected to pledge with a sorority instead.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After you made your wish, the young woman who was previously blocking your way, seemed to wonder why she was accosting you in the first place.  \"Oh, hey Robert, good to see you again!  Tell Nguyen I said hi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, no problem!\"  You said as you shrugged her off and hurried inside, savoring the power you held in your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short time later you arrived at Nguyen's dorm, wondering if you were in fact living here now.  You checked your pockets for keys but quickly realized your new skirt had no pockets, and you weren't carrying anything but the watch in one hand.  You sighed, \"I am carrying a nice looking purse that had my wallet and cell phone and keys inside, and it is normal for me to carry purses wherever I go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that simple command, a purple leather purse appeared on your shoulder, and sure enough, it had all your usual belongings.  You rifled through it a moment to find your keys, and began trying various ones on the door.  Finally you saw one that was similar to your old dorm key, and just as the lock clicked, the door was opened from the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!  Oops, I'm sorry Robert, I heard you trying to get in so I thought you'd forgotten your purse again!\"  Nguyen said, beaming cheerfully up at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, noticing how much taller you were than her.  Without these high heels you were already much taller than her, but now it felt a bit ridiculous.  The tiny Vietnamese girl who you knew so well just seemed like a midget from this height.  You figured you could fix that later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Nguyen!  Yeah I just found the right key, sorry!\"  You casually tried to play along.  You still weren't sure how reality had changed, but it was off to a good start as she let you in without question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't ever been allowed in her dorm before, and hadn't had the balls to sneak inside until the watch came along.  The inside looked different than you imagined.  You figured her room would be packed with girly things of all colors, and clothes everywhere.  But in fact, it was actually quite tidy.  She had her Tennis bag sat on the floor, the TV was on low volume in the background, and only a few small stuffed animals were propped up on the bottom bunk bed.  Bunk bed?  Yeah, it looked like the bed in her room was for two people to sleep separately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no problem, I just didn't think you'd be by so early.\"  Nguyen said as she casually walked away, sitting on the bottom bunk, curling her legs up comfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered why she seemed to barely pay much attention to you now that you were here.  Almost like she was more interested in the TV show.  You set your purse down on a chair and sat down right next to her, on the bed.  You reached your arm around her shoulder and leaned in to kiss her cheek, like you'd done a hundred times before with her, but she jumped in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aahh... Robert?  What are you doing?\"  She said as she pulled away almost in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kissing my girlfriend?\"  You said, baffled by her reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your girlfriend?  Listen, we may be girlfriends but not THAT kind of girlfriends, I don't roll that way hon, you know I'm not into other girls.  What's gotten into you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood there with your mouth hanging open, almost heartbroken by what she was saying.  Then it hit you.  The way you had phrased your reality change... everyone would treat you as female, even Nguyen.  So in this reality, you'd just been a girl roommate to her, and nothing more.  Despite your obviously male body, she thought of you as female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look I'm sorry I...  well this is awkward.\"  You mumbled, scratching the back of your head.  You tried to think fast how you could fix the situation.</span></div></div>",

Parts of my body will change to best suit the piece of clothing that was last worn on them, and everyone will find this normal.  Nguyen is completely bisexual and is attracted to me whether I'm male or female.  Nguyen and I are once again a loving couple as we were before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed Nguyen seemed lost in a daze as you spoke to the watch, and as soon as you finished, she blinked and snapped out of it.  But it wasn't until a moment later that your lower body began to tingle, and the second part of your wish came true.  You felt your male bits shrivel up in an instant, and get sucked into your body, as they were replaced by female genitalia, which fit much better in the panties you currently wore under your skirt and pantyhose.  Your butt ballooned outwards a bit, giving your skirt a nice flare that it lacked before.  Finally your legs shrunk by a few inches in length, and remained as hairless as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, well that's new...\" You said under your breath, giving your flat crotch a rub through your skirt momentarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNguyen looked up at you with a smile, \"What's that sweetie?\"</span></div></div>",

Not a girl?  How is that possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew Nguyen was not this dense, so it had to be the power of the watch altering her perception, or something.  She was a brilliant girl after all.  You sighed and before she could react, you swiftly pulled your skirt down, stepping out of it as it fell to the ground in a pile.  You noticed you were wearing women's panties that barely contained your bulge, but you left them there for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this look like a girl to you?\"  You asked, trying to get her to see the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNguyen's eyes went wide, and she jumped back up against the wall while curled up on her bed, \"What the fuck?!  Robert?  You're a guy?  How did I not notice before?  That's... you've got a dick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I do, and I always have.

But it wouldn't explain how she magically believed what was hidden in plain sight was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I know that's a rule, but I never thought...  What are you some kind of pervert?\"  She looked at you disgusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your skirt back on, slipping it up over your butt, and suddenly she looked at you differently again.

If someone sees me not wearing a skirt, they will treat me as a male without questioning any previous interaction with me as a female.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put the watch down again, and observed as Nguyen snapped out of what looked like a strange blank stare.  She blinked a few times, \"Robert, you ok?

However you now towered nearly thirteen inches over her in your heels, and she could only kiss your chest.  \"You're so weird, but I love you all the same.  You sure everything's ok?\"  She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I'm fine.  Say, does it ever bother you when I wear heels like this?

Oddly you feel more comfortable when you spot that you're both still wearing your rings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwisting at the waist, you take the chance to admire your body from some different angles. You find that the only thing that's jarring is the over-sized man's watch on your wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Phan.\" she gestures you over. You recognise the name as your own, and soon you are cuddling. It's a little odd, given how significant both your chests are, but you can make allowances, and the press of the warm flesh is more than pleasing. Nguyen obviously feels the same, as you watch her eyes flutter, when you meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point, both sets of nipples brush against one another, and you both let loose, a needy little whimper of sexual arousal.</span></div></div>",

It wouldn't do for someone to just pick it up and discover it's powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNguyen leans in and kisses you deeply, you melt into the kiss. The spicy aroma of her body, mixes with the freshly shampooed hair, and you give a giggle. As a woman you find it harder to ... to concentrate ... and...

Nguyen gasps in surprise, and the lets out a giggle. \"Again, Phan?\" she asks. \"Is there something wrong with that?\" you say. She giggles again and says \"No, not at all. But I want to ask you about this watch.\" She lifts it up in front of you, and you see a timer on it that's counting down from one hour and twenty minutes. The arousal and stimulation caused by your breasts makes it hard for you to concentrate on anything, let alone remembering. You do remember that it is important somehow, but you aren't sure why it's important. You feel like you can trust Nguyen to hold onto it, however. \"It's pretty. You can wear it for a while, if you want,\" you tell her. She flashes a smile and puts it on her wrist. She then kisses you on the lips, and you two make out for about a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's been fun, Phan, but I need to head to class.\" Nguyen says, putting her clothes back on. \"Class?\" you say confusedly. You then remember that you're in college, and you giggle at your sillyness. Nguyen giggles too, and says \"I love you\" before walking out. This shocks you for a moment, but then you remember that you're married. You can't remember a wedding, however... A sinking feeling starts to form in your gut. You rub your breasts, but that doesn't help. You look at the window, and see that every woman has breasts as big as yours and Nguyen's. That's when it finally clicks. You gave your girlfriend the most powerful watch in the world! And she might be in danger! You distinctly remember your father saying that people would try to get the watch, and they might go after Nguyen! You quickly start changing clothes, while trying to remember Nguyen's schedule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the hallways, Nguyen...</span></div></div>",

You hold your breath, calming yourself as best you can. But have to release it in a shuddering gasp. Opening your eyes, you see the hairy tree trunks of a pair of men's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive cock flopping meatily just inches from your face. Ripping your gaze from it, and the musky aroma that works unbidden on your body, you look up. Your gaze rising over a muscular stomach, coated in a mat of black hair... Rising higher, beyond a muscular chest, with tiny nipples. A vague disconcerting sense of jealousy, that you aren't sure you like sends a shiver down your spine. Finally, your gaze reaches the chiselled jaw, and masculine face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are enough traces of Nyugen there for you to see your wife behind those features. Especially, with the confusion on his face. It looks like he triggered the change accidentally, or....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warm contact breaks your concentration, and your eyes snap back to the cock. Stiffening, thickening, pressing more firmly, more insistently with each passing moment. You lick your lips, as your mouth feels incredibly, impossibly dry. In passing your tongue brushes over Nyugen's cock. It twitches in response, you gasp. Your hot breath causing it to twitch once more. A groan comes from Nyugen, and his hands drop to your shoulders, to your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis grip tightens, as you try to lean back. Sensing what he wants, dreading it, you go to protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you open your mouth to speak, Nyugen shifts his hips, and you feel the tip of his cock, brush over your lips. With a thrust, you cough, and choke, as his cock finds a warm, wet embrace in your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grip is too strong to fight, and he physically shifts your head back and forth. Your neck aches in protest, and despite your fears, you have to relax your neck muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking it as consent, Nyugen's pace increases. Soon his grunting increases in volume and rapidity. It becomes more guttural, more animalistic, until with a bellow. He cums. Your mouth fills with the slick salty cum. Having to swallow to allow you to breathe, you gulp it down like a thirsty man after leaving a desert island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pats your head, as you look up to him, your eyes swimming with questions. He looks down, the contempt, on his face as he sees your cum-smeared visage. The look of superiority is hard to ignore. You feel humiliated.</span></div></div>",

Fighting that pride, you spot something on the floor. It looks like knitwear. Hoping it's a jumper, you hold it up for examination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's barely recognisable, being so different to fit your new physique, you pull it on, happy for any additional layers. Alas, it doesn't do anything to disguise your sumptuous bust. The reflection in the patio doors causing you once more to scowl at her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/UltronShack92/8062769/76660685/pun27.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/Ultr...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA final desperate bid, has you cover it with your arms, maybe you can tug the neckline higher, cover more... any of that well displayed flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/UltronShack92/8062769/1940139294/pun26.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/Ultr...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nArms dropping to your side, defeated, you walk around the garden.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decide to use the Reality Shift Watch (RSW).  You take it and see two settings, local and global.  From what you saw in the note, you set the watch to local and then think hard about what to do.  As you're thinking, a girl passes by your door.  \"Hey Robert!\" she calls out.  You look up and see Pamela Goldberg, the hottest girl on your floor.  She's got beautiful blonde hair, big blue eyes, and huge bouncing breasts.  She was also rather tall, almost coming up to your height.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Pamela,\" you said slightly flustered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" she asked, pointing at the watch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately put a hand over it. \"Oh, just a gift from my dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty cool!  Hey, I was wondering if you might help me with some of that chemistry work we have?  I'm having a little trouble figuring it out.\"  She leaned against the door, crossing her arms.  The motion squeezed her breasts together, forming a deep valley of cleavage that you couldn't help but gawk at.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-s-sure,\" you say, getting a hold of yourself.  Pamela giggled at your response, then winked and said goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to the watch, you suddenly had an idea.  You speak into the watch's receiver and say, \"I wish I had boobs as big as Pamela's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of having Pamela's breasts excited you, and you stared down at your shirt half-excited for the results.  At first it looked like nothing had happened, but after beeping for three seconds, the watch's screen turned green and then shut off.  Then, it started.  Your own pair of breasts began bursting forth from your chest, growing quickly and filling up your shirt.  In fact, your shirt ripped down the middle from the sheer size of her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't a problem.  The RSW changed reality, giving you a cute, light green blouse to go with your now gigantic boobs.  Your chest finally stopped expanding, and you couldn't believe what had just happened.  In shock, you reach for your chest and squeeze.  The sensation was like nothing you had ever had before.  You then remember what the rest of the note had said.  Reality completely shifted around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with your new, bouncing chest you climb off your bed and walk to your closet.  \"Well, that was different,\" you say slyly as your breasts bounce up and down in your shirt.  You open the closet and see that instead of normal t-shirts, you have a variety of blouses, shirts, and tank tops to choose from.  You then open your underwear drawer, and next to your boxers are neatly folded bras.  You are amazed at the powers of the watch, and can't believe it.  Taking a quick look at it, you see that there's a tiny countdown at the top right of the screen.  You had about 118 minutes still left in your transformed state.  \"Awesome,\" you say, squeezing your breasts again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's awesome?\" you hear Roger's voice ask, as he leans in the doorway. \"Nice watch!\" he says, pointing at the RSW, \"Where'd you get it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gift from my dad.  Come on, let's go see Nguyen,\" you reply, shutting your drawer.  You both get up to leave to see your girlfriend play tennis.  She was on the university's team, and today was going to be her first match of the season.  You didn't want to miss it.  But you also thought about the RSW and what it could do...it could fulfill all of your fantasies!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut should you tell Roger?</span></div></div>",

I think <i>someone</i> else should know about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dNot</i> a gift from your dad?\u201d Roger retorts. \u201cWhat, you steal it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No!\u201d you protest, but, of course, Roger is just grinning. You roll your eyes and say, \u201cIt <i>is</i> from my dad. A special project he was working on, I guess, and he sent it to me to keep it safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, wouldn\u2019t want a <i>watch</i> to fall into the wrong hands,\u201d jokes Roger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, I\u2019m serious,\u201d you say, and you manage to briefly explain the Reality Shift Watch without your friend interrupting you further, finishing up just as you arrive at the entrance gate. Admission is free for students, so the two of you merely swipe your IDs through a card reader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger looks thoughtful as the two of you take seats among the sparse crowd in the stands. You spot Nguyen on the court among the team, and she gives you a little wave, but she\u2019s otherwise all business in her blue-and-white tennis dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Roger speaks. \u201cOkay, so you gave yourself breasts.  That's a little weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was just because Pam came up to my door, I swear,\" you say, absent-mindedly tugging up your blouse.  Having breasts had become second nature to you suddenly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but are you gonna use that for anything big?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what?\u201d you respond, just as the P.A. system crackles to life with, \u201cPlease rise for our national anthem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you stand up as a scratchy recording of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d plays. You place your right hand on your breast, and get a slight tingle again.  That was something you'd never get used to, and always enjoy.  Then Roger whispers in your ear, \u201cWhat if you make the national anthem \u2018Bad to the Bone\u2019 or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes and whisper back, \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly because you\u2019re used to <i>this</i> as our reality!\u201d insists Roger.  As the anthem finishes and you both sit back down, he says, \u201cOh, hey, what do you think your dad did to test it out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? I don\u2019t...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe he changed your mom so she was more his type.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat strikes a bit of a chord with you. Your mother <i>is</i> attractive, and looks young for her age, but surely he wouldn\u2019t have --<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger suggests, \u201cAnd maybe he changed <i>himself</i> to be better-looking, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn\u2019t occur to you until that very moment: your father is 6\u20193\u201d, well-muscled, and handsome, looking nothing like the stereotypical research scientist, more like the stereotypical male model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd, hey, maybe he had a daughter but wanted a son. Maybe you were originally a girl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at your heaving chest.  The irony hits you hard. Could something like that really be possible -- that your life had been completely altered without you knowing about it? Actually, if he\u2019d changed <i>his</i> life, or your mother\u2019s, then that would have had ripple effects to change your life <i>and</i> your sister\u2019s, if she was even really supposed to be your sister --<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what are you gonna do next?\u201d asks Roger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d You have to massage your temples a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should help out your girlfriend,\u201d Roger suggests, nodding toward the court. You were too busy thinking about the watch and the potential previous reality shifts to notice that Nguyen\u2019s match had started. You watch just as she\u2019s unable to reach a shot in the back corner of the court, and she loses a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t really want to use this thing to <i>cheat,\u201d</i> you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean just tell the watch \u2018Nguyen is going to win her match\u2019?\u201d Roger asks. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want that, either. That\u2019d be boring. No, just help her out -- like, I mean, I\u2019m sure she\u2019d be better if she were even just a few inches taller. Although if you wanted to give her the body of Venus or Serena Williams, I\u2019m sure that\u2019d be even better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHer body\u2019s fine,\u201d you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t have to be just \u2018fine,\u2019\u201d points out Roger. \u201cYou could do anything you want. Tweak her so she\u2019s a little sexier. Longer hair. Bigger tits --\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think bigger tits would help with the tennis!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if you gave <i>all</i> women bigger tits? Then it would be a wash!\u201d Roger\u2019s looking a bit excited. \u201cBut, okay, tennis? So just do a little something to make this more interesting -- uh, what if tennis outfits looked more like the kinds of stuff porn stars wore?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Despite yourself, you have a vision of Nguyen and her opponent playing in skimpy lingerie and moving around perfectly well despite wearing platform shoes with spike heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a suggestion, man, but come on,\u201d says Roger. \u201cYou\u2019ve got this incredibly powerful thing and all you\u2019ve done so far is give yourself a pair of breasts that in all honesty I believe you've always had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, do you see any other guys with boobs as big as mine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger shakes his head, \"No, but I also know what you have is a severe form of gynecomastia mixed with an estrogen imbalance.  If you want me to believe you about that watch, prove it. I want to see something happen!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d you sigh. You make sure the switch is set to \"local\" -- you don't want to try changing the whole world just yet -- then press the button on the watch and say...</span></div></div>",

Spelling out clearly each different rule and thinking over any possible inconsistencies. Roger had moved two seats away, just to make sure he couldn't hear anything. Not that it would be easy over the noise of the cheering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finished your wish and nodded to Roger so that he could return.<br>\r\n\"Alright. It'll take effect immediately after this match. And it'll reset everything in two hours just to be safe unless we decide to keep it this way. So, prepare for a ride\" You said.<br>\r\n\"I'm looking forward to it\" Roger replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe match concluded and the announcer let everyone know that there would be a ten minute break while they prepare for the next set of matches. A few people stood up to go get refreshments but both you and Roger stayed in your seats.<br>\r\n\"Looks the same to me\" Roger said.<br>\r\n\"Hasn't started yet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor you, the following then minutes was a breeze. For Roger it was agonizing as he tried to see if anything had changed. But as of yet it was still ordinary earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe announcer cracked again, saying that the next match would be starting now. Two girls stood up from their benches and walked to their positions.<br>\r\n\"Wait, there's neither of them have a tennis ball\" Roger said.<br>\r\nYou smiled lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, and with no cries of alarm from the audience, both girls pulled their heads off, leaving bare skin on their necks, and proceeded to use their own heads in place of the tennis balls - but at the same time so there were now two projectiles flying at once. Through means unknown, the girls bodies proceeded to play the tennis match, with fierce determination they continued to bat the heads back at one another. The heads meanwhile, appeared to undergo no ill effects while being smashed by the tennis rackets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is both absolutely mental and amazing\" Roger gasped.<br>\r\n\"Only place on earth to do this. But you haven't seen the half of it yet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, one of the girls won with a double knockout, and both heads were returned to the center line where an attendant was waiting. Both bodies walked to the center, and the winning girl announced that she would be taking control of the losing body.<br>\r\n\"The hell is the usefulness of owning somebody's body?\" Roger asked.<br>\r\n\"Wait and see dude. Seriously, it's almost over\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth heads were returned to their respective owners and reattached. Then the truly amazing thing happened. The winning girl merged her body with the losing girl, fully absorbing her essence into her body and morphing under the effects. It was as if she were taking the best parts of the loser and combining them into herself to make herself more powerful. She grew in height, nearly doubling her muscle strength while retaining her toned appearance. Her breasts increased in size slightly and her outfit fully stretched and contorted itself to comfortably fit this new body. She very much looked like a far more attractive version of her previous self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was... amazing\" Roger gasped.<br>\r\n\"Sometimes I have good ideas\"</span></div></div>",

But you had methods of ensuring that that wouldn't be a problem.<br>\r\n\"Want to make a bet that Nguyen can still win?\" You asked Roger.<br>\r\n\"That seems unfair considering you have the ability to change the results\"<br>\r\n\"Would I ever cheat?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes\"<br>\r\n\"Alright, fair point\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats the bet\" Roger asked.<br>\r\n\"Nguyen wins, you have to play one of the tennis matches\"<br>\r\n\"And if I win?\" Roger asked, raising an eyebrow. But the expression on his face showed interest.<br>\r\n\"I'll grant you one wish - within reason - for whatever you want and even make it permanent if you like\" You said proudly. There was no way Roger could back down from something so grand as that. Except as soon as he accepted, he'd have lost.<br>\r\nRoger rubbed his chin and sat back in his seat in the stands.<br>\r\n\"That's a fairly good bet you have there\" He said.<br>\r\n\"Good bet indeed\"<br>\r\n\"Alright. I'll take it\"<br>\r\n\"Done\" You said happily, shaking his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rules of this tennis match had been drastically altered. Rather than a pre-determined set of faceoffs against people, it was now more gladiatorial. Every time someone lost, the winner could choose to either absorb them or send them back to the bench to be done for the day. However it was considerably bias as the winner had generally absorbed the loser. In this case, the girl who had won the first time played ten more matches and won every single time. She chose to absorb six more girls. One of the girls was taller, which when combined with her now made her six feet in height and another girl had nicer tanned skin which she took with glee. The rest were just cannon fodder for her muscles. One thing that you liked in your changes was that the absorption didn't fully add the losers capabilities to the winners. It was only ever a small increase. But ten girls later it was a noticeable difference. Each time she grew slightly taller and each time her muscle strength was increased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seventh girl held out the longest, she was quite limber and quick on her feet. Ultimately, the match timer was called and the match went into super-overdrive-mega-knockout mode... Which basically reduces the number of rules on the court. You had gone to no expense as you lavishly remade the rules of this game. The seventh girl was taken out by a direct hit from the first girls head barrelling into her chest, knocking her clean off the court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Nguyen's turn came and she nervously got up onto the court and took her position, pulling her head off and preparing to serve herself.<br>\r\n\"Eh. I have already have a guess as to how this is going to turn out. I'm going to get something to eat. You want anything?\" You asked Roger.<br>\r\n\"Aye, what? You don't want to watch Nguyen lose?\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, you want food?\"<br>\r\n\"Yea, just a hotdog if that's okay\"<br>\r\n\"Done deal\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNguyen served herself right over the net with a beautiful beginning, she quickly dived to hit the other girls head back over the court. The match was seriously intense with the stronger girls improved muscle allowing her to do some serious hits, but Nguyen had a serious speed boost, largely thanks to her toned muscles and small size. The stronger girl had also begun to get cocky thanks to her previous victories, opting to show off rather than beat Nguyen quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNguyen was beginning to sweat quickly. The match timer was called and the super-overdrive-mega-knockout mode began. The stronger girl quickly stepped up a notch, now seeing a true challenge in Nguyen's abilities. She started to hit harder and faster, trying to gain an edge over Nguyen, but it almost appeared too late. Nguyen had managed to survive through the stronger girls cocky moves and appeared to have gotten the best of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were walking back up to your seat, your back to the center of the stadium where Nguyen was playing. You heard the whistle blow, indicating that someone had been defeated. The crowd went wild. Just as you sat down, you saw the look on Roger's face - a look of absolute surprise.</span></div></div>",

Nguyen had made a daring move and won by a hairline chance. The stronger girl had been knocked clean out of the lines and that was considered a loss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd was still going wild. In their minds at least, something like this never happened, a basic girl beating someone who had upgraded multiple times in a match? It was a deal breaker, the sort of thing that causes bets to turn full circle on themselves. And Nguyen had won. Well, with a tiny bit of your help but that wasn't going to be public knowledge any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait\" Roger started.<br>\r\n\"Uh uh. Bet's a bet, a deals a deal. And you lost mate\" You said, smirking.<br>\r\n\"Oh damn\" Roger said, putting his face in his hands.<br>\r\n\"That means you gotta play! Relax, you'll have fun\"<br>\r\n\"I have to bat with my own head!\" He yelled. Which meant nothing over the cacophony of the audience whooping and cheering.<br>\r\n\"It's easier than you think. Walk onto the pitch, pull your head off and hit it with the racket. I actually made it so that it won't hurt at all\"<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness. When do I go?\" He asked.<br>\r\n\"When they call you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth players meanwhile had walked up to the center of the court. The girl who lost was dumbstruck and Nguyen was beaming. She announced that she planned to absorb the losing girls body and fuse it with her own.<br>\r\n\"Hey, what happens to the loser - I mean, when they get absorbed?\" Roger asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, their physical matter is added to the winner and their mind ceases to exist. Which to everyone else in this stadium is a completely natural and normal thing in this game. Yea, I wouldn't say that they <i>die</i>, they just become part of the winner.\"<br>\r\n\"That's disturbing\"<br>\r\n\"That's the game!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNguyen had begun to absorb the girl she had defeated. Her muscles virtually quadrupled in strength but maintained their toned almost plain appearance. She began to rise in height, now standing just over five foot six in height. Her breasts increased in size as well to match her new height and her hips enlarged slightly. She did however maintain her Vietnamese appearance but claimed the crimson hair color which now measured down to the center of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNguyen was now a bombshell beauty and clearly had become extremely popular with the fans.<br>\r\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen! We now have a winner! Nguyen is your victor for this seasons round of tennis!\" The announcer called out. The crowd was still cheering.<br>\r\n\"Players, you may now return to the stands as we prepare for the bonus round for today\" He then said.<br>\r\n\"Bonus round?

The bonus round allowed anyone to settle their differences with other students in the exact same format as the tennis match. However in this particular round, genders were not segregated so it was entirely possible for a female to absorb a male, and vice versa.<br>\r\n\"Oh dammit\" Roger said. He and Ashley had always been coming to blows over things in the computer labs, particularly with how certain problems should be approached. It wasn't exactly an all out war but it would be problematic if they ever had to work in the same group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I challenge Roger from my computer lab group!\" Ashley yelled into the megaphone. \"I see you up in the stands!\" She pointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger sighed and stood up, walking down the steps and passing a worn out Nguyen on his way, giving her a nervous thumbs up. She smiled in response.<br>\r\n\"Good luck!\" She replied. She sat down in Rogers place and rested her head on your shoulders. Something that was a tad easier now given her increased height. You responded by putting your arm around her shoulder.<br>\r\n\"So how did you feel about your match?\"<br>\r\n\"Honestly? Crazy nervous. I thought it was the end for me. Never beaten someone that capable before\"<br>\r\n\"Seems her ego got the better of her\"<br>\r\n\"Luck was on my side as well\" Nguyen smiled.

He had no memory of this reality, being aware of the changes, so he had to be coached in the rules for a moment before the game started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everything was settled, it was decided that Roger would get first serve, as the one being challenged.  He winced and slowly pulled his head off his shoulders as he was instructed to do.  He expected some sort of intense pain and discomfort, but opened his eyes when he realized his head felt nothing at all.  He served it up in the air and simply gave it a strong whack with his racquet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd missed the other side of the court completely.  His head wiffed straight to the left, nearly flying into the stands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was busy laughing her ass off, barely able to contain herself.  \"Oh god, this is funnier than I ever imagined it would be!  You're going down so hard Roger!  Soon you'll be finished!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience didn't seem to mind the trash talking, even cheering Ashley on, despite the fact that she hadn't even done anything yet.  Some in the audience were rooting for Roger, but people clearly had no hope for him now.  He was given back his head, and once it reattached to his neck, he felt much more comfortable.  But this time it was Ashley's turn to serve.  She removed her own head, with her long brunette hair flying in the wind as she whacked it cleanly towards Roger's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good serve, but now Roger had proper perspective and was easily able to return the serve back to Ashley.  She was clearly disoriented from her vision flying all over the court, and her next hit was stopped short by the net.  Once again it was Roger's serve.  This time he was a little more prepared when his head came off again, and he managed to make it over the net, and the two hit it back and forth once or twice before Ashley finally scored on him.  The two took turns serving their own heads for quite a while, and the game ended up being closer than anyone expected.  Neither seemed terribly competent at tennis, and the points quickly racked up, but neither seemed to be able to push out a win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had tried paying attention to the game but Nguyen was far too alluring to ignore.  You had your hands all over her, hugging her close and sneaking quick kisses now and then.  You were so relieved that she was still alive, and even better looking than before nonetheless, that you stopped worrying about Roger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the whistle was blown as Roger finally edged out a victory, spiking his own head down over the net so hard that Ashley had no chance of returning it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Roger wins!  Congratulations on defeating your challenger!\"  The announcer yelled into the megaphone for the crowd to hear.  \"Now take your prize!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger had no interest in killing Ashley and taking anything from her, but he was so hopped up on adrenaline from the game, that he wasn't thinking clearly...</span></div></div>",

However he quickly felt a strange tingling in his palm, which spread throughout his entire body within seconds.  He looked down and noticed Ashley's arm was halfway absorbed into his hand, and a few seconds later, her shoulder was next.  He tried to step back in surprise, but his body felt unresponsive and numbed.  He could only watch as the girl's entire body, clothes and all, were absorbed through his hand.  In a matter of fifteen seconds, Ashley was no more, just a memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the crowd went wild!  Everyone was on the edge of their seats to see how Roger would change!

It still sounded like his original voice, but less masculine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheered even harder once they saw what looked like a cute brunette girl left standing on the tennis court, staring into 'her' cleavage.  Roger quickly realized he was wearing a tennis skirt and high socks and tennis shoes on a pair of shaved legs, and his whole body overall felt thinner and more athletic.  In a panic, he reached down to pat the front of his pleated white skirt, and breathed a sigh of relief as he felt a familiar bulge where he expected it would be.  At the slightest touch however, he felt a tingling below his male member, between his thighs, but chose to ignore it for now.  He locked his legs together and suddenly realized where he was again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe announcer placed a hand gently on his shoulder before announcing into the microphone, \"Wow!  Looks like our winner really took everything from his challenger!  Congratulations to you sir, or ma'am, whichever you prefer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held Roger's hand up in a victory pose, but Roger certainly didn't feel like a winner anymore.  His face was red, and the instant the man let go of his arm, he rushed off the court, back towards your seat in the stands.  You and Nguyen were both cheering him on as he ran up the stairs, attracting looks from everyone he passed by on the way.  When he finally reached your seat, he was not even out of breath, but was red from embarrassment instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell happened Robert?!\" he yelled as soon as he was close enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could respond, Nguyen cheered on, \"You kicked ass, that's what happened!  I was worried at first, but just look at you!  You took all of Ashley's best assets, I'm so proud!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her best assets?  I didn't want tits or a skirt or long hair or any of this!\"  Roger hissed, quieter now that only you and Nguyen could hear.  \"I didn't mean to absorb her, I thought she was just shaking my hand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, getting a real kick out of how this was going, \"Well you look great, better than the original Ashley, that's for sure.  This day just keeps getting better and better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up Robert!  We need to... we need to fix this somehow.\"  Roger mumbled as he cupped a breast briefly, with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour girlfriend looked at Roger, confused, \"What do you mean fix?  Everyone knows you can't just reverse this, that's just how it's always been.  You could try to beat a male player and it might help a little, but I don't see why you'd want to?  Unless you're pursuing a real tennis career, you hit the jackpot with that body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger was clearly fed up with the whole situation, ignoring her advice, \"Robert, how much longer on the thing?\"  He asked, implying the amount of time left on the watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirked, \"What thing?  What are you talking about?  Why don't we stop worrying and just celebrate both of your victories!\"</span></div></div>",

You pulled back on it, annoyed that he would try to steal it from you, but he had a tight grip on it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  What gives?  Let go, man!\"  You growled at him.  This was a priceless device given to you by your dad, and you weren't about to give it up so easily, even to your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, just give it up!  I really need to fix this shit!\"  Roger growled back in his feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly your grip slipped, and the watch slid right out of your hands, flying away from you, and Roger along with it.  He flew backwards, landing on the concrete floor on his newly padded rear end.  However in the process of landing, he gripped the watch a bit too tightly, and accidentally pressed down a button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a brief distortion which vanished in an instant, but you knew he'd done something.  You regretted not touching the watch when he had pressed the button, and worried that something might have happened outside of your knowledge.  You looked around, and everything still seemed the same.  The fans in the bleachers were already mostly filed out after the event, leaving just you and your beautiful girlfriend, and your friend Roger alone.  Nguyen still had the stunning new upgrades from her recent victory, looking more mature and fit than before.  And Roger still had all of his new assets as well, looking very much like Ashley now.  You remembered he was really angry... about something.  But you couldn't seem to put your finger on it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down at yourself, taking stock, and sure enough, you could still see down your own impressive cleavage, thanks to the low cut blouse Nguyen had picked out for you the other day.  Everything was as it always had been...  You wondered why you hadn't even tried using the watch to make a wish since you'd found it.  Surely you had... hadn't you?  But what was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stood there confused, you noticed Roger was beginning to panic.  \"Oh no, no no no...  What did I press, what was that button?\"  He said, fumbling around the watch with his slender fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it the indented button on the bottom, the one that's supposed to be hard to press?\"  You asked, squatting down to get a look at him and the watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah... what is that?\"  Roger asked, suddenly sounding like a scared teenage girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... the permanent button.\"  You whispered, so Nguyen couldn't hear.</span></div></div>",

Nguyen shrugged.<br>\r\n\"Well, you can explain it whenever your ready\" She smiled. \"I'm hungry.

Man\" He said flatly.<br>\r\n\"Not anymore your not\" You laughed. \"Alright, let's fix this for you then. What did I change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger proceeded to explain to you the rules of tennis, the original rules at least as far as he understood it. Meanwhile you stared at him blankly until he finished.<br>\r\n\"That sounds boring as hell\" You said.<br>\r\n\"Those were the rules!\"<br>\r\n\"Hitting a tennis ball rather than a living human head and then the winner is just declared without any sort of reward? Seems kinda boring to me\" You said.<br>\r\n\"It was plenty interesting until you changed it!\" Roger retorted. You just sighed in response and shook your head.<br>\r\n\"Perhaps it was. But in this new world, that's not the case anymore\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger groaned. \"Can you at least change me back to how I looked before?\"<br>\r\nYou pondered the question. Sure, theoretically there was nothing preventing you from changing him back, but the question was, did you want to do it? His personality was still pretty sour but at least he looked more attractive this way...</span></div></div>",

With a bit of effort, he found that he could control them as well, almost like moving around again on two legs.... except this time he had six.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNguyen returned from the room and smiled. \"Oh, you look so cute!\" She squealed with delight.<br>\r\nRoger grimaced at the sight. \"So whats the deal?\" He asked. Robert was equally confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNguyen smiled as she split herself off once again to create a new clone.<br>\r\n\"You like what you see right?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"Well... obviously. But what are you getting at?\" Robert asked.<br>\r\n\"Jump and aim for the head\" The second Nguyen said, pointing to her neck. Robert looked briefly at Roger who shrugged again. He launched himself off the table with surprising effort and his new tentacles quickly wrapped themselves around Nguyen's head, completely engulfing it. Not a moment too soon, Nguyen's head started shrinking down into her body with Roberts head quickly replacing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taa daa!\" Nguyen clapped with joy. Robert had basically acquired Nguyen's clone's body temporarily, with full control and everything.<br>\r\n\"You just can't clone yourself. Had to make sure of that. But I figured that since you like me so much, why not try it out? And you can do it with whatever body you want, when you want!\" Nguyen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert had begun to feel himself over, becoming accustomed to his new center of mass and changes in form. But he smiled at Nguyen. This was a kinky thing he could get used to.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The original Nguyen still held the watch and smiled at her boyfriend Robert who currently had a clone of her body below his head.  She turned to Roger and asked, \"So Roger, feeling curious?  I could make a change for you too if you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger was worried by how she smirked at him but still went along with it.  \"Well I gotta admit, I'm intrigued, but I don't want what Robert's got... That's not really my thing.  And I don't want one of your clones below my head either, being fused with Ashley for a few minutes was quite enough for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNguyen thought for a moment and then nodded.  \"Alright alright, my clones are all Robert's, I won't involve you in that.  Give me a minute I have something else in mind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly went around the corner and began making her wish to the watch out of earshot.  Roger looked around unsure of when something might happen to him.  He saw Robert was still fascinated with his new Nguyen body under his head, occasionally feeling himself up while they waited.  Roger just rolled his eyes at that, realizing what kind of fetish she had been hinting at.  Clearly, Robert had some weird fetishes, and even as his friend he had no idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Roger felt it, a sudden tingling through his body.  He felt like he was being split down the middle, as he noticed he was being pulled left, while the rest of him was yanked to the right.  Before he knew it, a second person had been pulled out of his body and was standing right next to him.  He thought at first Nguyen had cloned him like she had cloned herself, but when he got a good look, he realized it was not a clone of himself standing there.  It was a girl, but not Nguyen, or anyone he recognized.  She stood there uncomfortably looking at him, then began to look down at herself and nearly screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit?!  You made me a girl?!\"  This girl cried as Roger tried to figure out who she was.  The only clue was that she seemed to be wearing a familiar tennis outfit with a white pleated skirt, similar to when he had fused with Ashley...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger's eyes went wide, \"Wait, who are you?  Why are you dressed in a tennis outfit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert meanwhile began to burst into laughter as he saw what had happened.  Clearly, he recognized this girl as what had previously been the fused form of Ashley and Roger, who resembled a female version of Roger, only with Ashley's good looks and outfit.  Roger had never seen what his face had looked like when he was fused, so he hadn't yet figured it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female Roger spun her head to look at male Roger, \"What do you mean?  I'm you, you idiot!  Clearly, Nguyen must have made me into a girl and created a clone of my old body to taunt me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger frowned, \"Hey, what?  You know I'm the original Roger, right?  I wasn't even changed. She just made a female me appear apparently!  Hey, Nguyen what gives?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNguyen was still not in the room, and the female Roger was beginning to get restless.  \"No fucking way, I'm the original Roger, I have a memory of being-\"  She stopped mid-sentence, her eyes briefly glazing over.  \"Oh... Yeah, you're right.  You're the original, I'm just girl you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger blinked, \"You... you're ok with that now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFemale Roger shrugged, \"Eh, sure why not?  I'm probably going to die in two hours when this wears off anyways, so I might as well make the best of it.  To be honest, I feel perfectly normal in this body now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Nguyen finally re-entered the room, with an excited grin on her face.  \"See isn't this cool?!  Roger didn't want to be changed, so I made a copy of him that was ok with being changed.  She's basically you, but not such a stick in the mud about being someone else.  In fact, we can't go around calling you female Roger, so you should come up with a new name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger's female counterpart nodded and seemed perfectly fine with this development.  \"Sure thing, I'll think it over for a minute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real Roger was still trying to process it all, \"So wait, you made... 'her' be completely open to anything?  You forced her to think a certain way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of, I just made her feel like this is her natural body, so she doesn't complain like you would if you were her.  And I might've given her a bit of a crush on you if that's what you're into.\"  Nguyen smirked, and finally handed the watch back to Robert, who'd been suspiciously silent this whole time, despite finding the whole scene hilarious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, female Roger couldn't keep her eyes off male Roger, trying to hide the fact that she was blushing whenever he made eye contact with her.</span></div></div>",

It's Asher now. You know how it works with that crazy game - our names: Ashley and Roger combined as well\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis surprised Robert substantially.

He sat down on the couch and began to examine the watch all over.<br>\r\n\"So what do you think this things limits are?\" Robert asked.

It's powerful beams moved from the top of the room down to touch Roberts face directly. He shuffled under the brightness and slowly woke up. He shielded his eyes from the sun with his left hand, his right still wrapped around Nguyen. It was then that he noticed that his hand was male again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up quickly, Nguyen crashed to the couch but since she was an extremely heavy sleeper, it didn't even register with her.<br>\r\n\"Dammit, the timer reset\" Robert murmured. That meant that Nguyen's clone bodies disappeared, Roger turned back into a male again, and Robert had his old body back as if nothing had happened yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a weekend day, which meant studying for the never-ending exams. Robert found some fresh bacon in the freezer and retrieved two eggs from the fridge and began to cook them up.

No no no! I just... well... you know, well, we had that conversation a few months back? About how you look at yourself in the mirror?\" Robert asked defensively. Both he and Nguyen had already had a deep conversation about how Nguyen felt small and inferior in her body, typically trying to make up with it by having a spunky attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNguyen pouted.

Robert shook his head.<br>\r\n\"I don't think so\" He said. \"I'll try something simpler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert 'checked the time' again and looked at a tree in front of him. \"I wish the tree in front would turn its leaves a scarlet red\"<br>\r\nThe watch beeped and sure enough, the trees leaves turned a scarlet red. However, as Nguyen noticed, the men suddenly picked up the pace and started a light jog.<br>\r\n\"They know its us\" Nguyen said. \"And I think their immune to it somehow!\"<br>\r\n\"Well if we can't change them, maybe we can change ourselves?\" Robert said, starting his own running beside Nguyen.<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, anything!\" Nguyen said, beginning to pant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish Nguyen and I had unlimited stamina, so we could keep running as long as we needed without tiring\" Robert commanded.

Nguyen had gone and done a complete copy of her new body and skills and placed it onto Robert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down, aware that he was now clad in rather revealing black leather and his breasts were pushing out from his chest.<br>\r\n\"This is weird\" Robert said, now aware that he had the accent as well.<br>\r\n\"It was easier than coming up with something original. Lets go\" Nguyen said, taking her by the hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enhanced abilities that the two had were outside the laws of physics, but pretty typical for a video game. Roberts character was out of a new video game that had recently been released, with the combat mechanics of a first person shooter but the leveling of an RPG, with the higher levels allowing characters to do some physics bending things, such as leaping massive distances or having extreme strength for their size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magic had also given them an invisible, weightless inventory, but that would be something they discovered and used later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNguyen and Robert had reached the top of the factory, kicking the door down and sending it flying fifty odd meters across the roof and crashing down to the ground on the other side. They ran out and looked up. The helicopter had already sighted them and Nguyens increased vision made her aware that the pilot had just contacted his team as to their whereabouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an MH-60 Blackhawk\" Nguyen exclaimed. \"Wait, how did I know that?\"<br>\r\n\"Because Elissa knows that\" Robert replied over the noise.<br>\r\n\"Elissa?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"My characters name in the game. Our team needed a decent pilot and marksmen to complement the rest of our abilities so I just went for that\"<br>\r\n\"Figures as much\" Nguyen said. The helicopter had moved near the building now, about fifty meters from the edge. It turned to the left. A machine-gunner was sitting in the side and he prepared his weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think we can make that?\" Nguyen asked.<br>\r\n\"We can make double that?\" Robert said confidently. Nguyen shrugged and started running. She leaped off the building with a ginormous bound and tackled the machine-gunner, to his immediate surprise. Grabbing his collar, she threw him off the helicopter. Robert was only a few seconds behind, he dashed into the cockpit and pulled both pilots from their seats, sending them overboard in the same way the gunner did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the girls quickly sat down in the pilot and co-pilot seats, wrestled the controls away from a sudden crash and Nguyen piloted them away from the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert breathed a sigh of relief. \"Well, that was an adventure\"<br>\r\n\"Where too now? They'll be looking for us everywhere\" Nguyen asked.</span></div></div>",

This thing is loud as hell\" She said.<br>\r\n\"That would be ideal. I'll get us some alternative transport so we can get back\" Robert said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNguyen found a large park to land the helicopter in, sending a dog running away to cower in fear of the sound. Both she and Robert got out of the chopper and Robert proceeded to talk into the watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish for a S-36 VTOL\"<br>\r\n\"The hell is one of those?\" Nguyen asked. But the watch knew what Robert wanted. Robert expertly pushed on the empty air and heard a familiar beep. The S-36 VTOL was his favorite vehicle from the video game they had been playing. It was a super silenced VTOL about the size of a large transport helicopter, but the biggest advantage was it's jet like speed and it's cloaking technology. Humanity in the game was more ingenious - and lucky - with it's research than in the real world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert allowed the invisible door to open, revealing an opaque interior.<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my beauty\"<br>\r\n\"I thought I was your beauty?\" Nguyen asked, laughing. \"This looks like a bit more fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert sat in the pilots seat and turned the craft on. They sailed invisibly away from the park. Looking back downwards, Nguyen could see a few black vehicles rushing up the helicopter. It seems that they had been tracking it the whole time.<br>\r\n\"And not a moment too soon\" She said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now it was roughly midday, and the flight back to the block of housing only took a few minutes.</span></div></div>",

They looked innocent to any given bystander, but the events of the morning had taught Robert and Nguyen otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll park on the roof. It might be a bit of a fight to get downstairs\" Robert said, bringing the VTOL down. Leaving the invisibility active, they left the craft and headed down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, there were two agents standing outside Rogers dorm. Both of the girls could here someone getting beat up inside. The agents turned to see both of the girls coming straight for them. Before they could react, Robert had slammed into both of them, sending them flying down the hallway and slumped up against the far wall, knocked out cold.<br>\r\n\"And here you are mi'lady\" Robert said, gesturing her inside. Nguyen took the response with grace and opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogers place had been completely trashed. Roger himself was on one of his dining chairs, an ugly bruise on his chin and right eye. The agent, facing away from them, punched him again.<br>\r\n\"Where are they!\" He yelled.<br>\r\n\"Right behind you!\" Robert yelled back. The agent looked up at them in surprise. Nguyen kicked him in the chest, sending him flying and crashing through the window and down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell are you?\" Roger asked. \"I already told him, I don't know where Robert and Nguyen are\"<br>\r\nRoger spat some blood on the ground.<br>\r\n\"Well, you do know now\" Nguyen smiled.<br>\r\n\"Oh my goodness... Well, this is different\" Roger half smiled through his mangled face. \"What's with the cloning thing you've got going on here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story...\" Nguyen said, checking him over.<br>\r\n\"And why do you look familiar?\" Roger asked, looking directly at Robert.<br>\r\n\"You know that new game we both got? Well, long story short, those agent people started chasing us this morning, I transformed Nguyen to help us get out and didn't realize that I just carbon copied Elissa's body onto her. Then Nguyen did the same to me\"<br>\r\n\"The watch can copy straight out of a video game?\"<br>\r\n\"It's a reality warping watch. The only thing it can't seem to do is affect those agents\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNguyen began to tidy up Rogers face, nursing the bruises with a cold beer from the freezer.<br>\r\n\"Yea, I was listening to two of them talking to each other. They've got electronic wristbands. Every time you use the watch, their immune to it's powers. And to top it off, apparently whenever you make a change to reality to aid you, they can make a minor change to aid them\"<br>\r\n\"What?\" Nguyen asked in surprise.<br>\r\n\"Yea... They seemed really pleased about the entire fiasco. Every time you buff yourselves up, their able to match themselves in power to you... So you two have just become physics breaking hot girls, they've probably got something equally badass out there coming for us. Thought one of them was annoyed that apparently they can't ever get one up on the changes, just match yours\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robert, that VTOL of yours...\" Nguyen said quietly.<br>\r\n\"Yea... they'll have something to match it. It explains why they suddenly kept getting more and more powerful every time we used the watch\" Robert said.<br>\r\n\"Yea, but they said they can only ever match you, so it's an eternal battle of wits and out-thinking. If you revert everyone back to the stone age, their stuck like that too. But if you take the battle to space... well they won't be far behind\" Roger said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's amazing, your finally thinking for yourself beyond the scope of attractive woman\" Nguyen said, stifling a laugh.<br>\r\n\"Yea, and I think we need to leave, now\" Robert said.<br>\r\n\"Don't suppose you could give me a few buffs?\" Roger asked.</span></div></div>",

Roger took the watch gleefully and studying it's intricate pattern before talking to the watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNguyen and Robert watched as Roger transformed his whole body into a similar form as Robert and Nguyen. Roger now stood taller than his original body but slightly shorter than Robert. His hair became slightly messy, turned the color of auburn and lengthened down to his shoulders, with the majority of it tied back behind him. His face bore resemblance to Roberts, only it was slightly curvier and shorter. Rogers eyes now flashed a brilliant white. His clothes morphed into the same black leather that the girls had, complete with the regulation bullet proof underclothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now, this should be fun\" Roger said. His voice had changed to sounding Spanish.<br>\r\n\"You sound Spanish but you don't look it\" Nguyen said.<br>\r\n\"What was your characters name again?\" Robert asked.<br>\r\n\"Anya\"<br>\r\n\"That's a Russian name!\" Nguyen pouted.<br>\r\n\"Magic says otherwise\" Robert said, smiling. \"Anyway, lets get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three girls quickly moved out of the trashed apartment and headed upstairs.

I didn't know they'd be able to match it!\" Robert yelled back.<br>\r\n\"Wait, so what would they get to match it?\" Nguyen asked, as they ran up the stairs.<br>\r\n\"Something pretty powerful\" Robert said. \"There's a few nasty counters to it\"<br>\r\n\"Like?\"<br>\r\n\"Like having counter-cloaking missiles\"<br>\r\n\"Robert!\" Nguyen squealed.<br>\r\n\"I just said I had no idea they could do that!\" Robert yelled. They made it to the roof and Robert unlocked the door. Heading inside, Nguyen and Robert took the controls again and took off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where do we head now?\" Nguyen asked.

We get a bountiful dinner and so do <i>they</i>\" Nguyen said flatly.<br>\r\n\"I bet that'd make their heads scratch... 'Aye boss, whats with all this food we got?'\" Roger laughed, imitating a deep voiced man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert continued piloting the ship into the mountains, the city was now quite far out of sight. She found the cabin that she had walked past on treks so long ago. It had been abandoned since the cold war and it wasn't much to look at aside from four walls, a roof and a little shack for firewood. Robert set down in a small clearing near the cabin and they all disembarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just occurred to me, you should delete the ship\" Nguyen said. \"It'd slow them down due to that whole equalization thing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert nodded and spoke into the watch. Within a few short seconds, the entire ship disappeared into the fabric of space, never to be seen again.<br>\r\nRoger had already headed into the cabin. \"This place sucks!\" She exclaimed. \"Can we watchify it?\"<br>\r\n\"Watchify?\" Robert asked him.<br>\r\n\"Yea, spruce this place up! Make it not cold and damp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNguyen looked briefly at Robert. Robert shrugged and then used the watch to spruce up the cabin. In place of two badly broken bunk beds was a nice ornate metal framed bunk beds, the wood was scrubbed clean and the kitchen was restocked with fresh food and water.<br>\r\n\"Happy now?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"So much better!\" Roger said gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what now?\" Nguyen asked, sitting down at the round table. Roger and Robert joined her.<br>\r\n\"I think... we should find my dad\" Robert said.<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me\" Roger said. \"Got a phone number?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert pulled her phone out from her pocket and began dialing. Unsurprisingly, the line was dead. \"I've got reception but it won't connect.\" She said.<br>\r\n\"Watchify it! Sheesh, shouldn't it be obvious by now?\" Roger exclaimed.<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to avoid using the watch so as to prevent those agents from <i>finding</i> us Roger\" Robert retorted.<br>\r\n\"I think it's worth the risk\" Nguyen said. \"Their not very hard to knock down when you kick them good\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert sighed and used the watch again. A small device appeared on the table with two buttons on it, a green call button and a red hangup. It had a small display attached to it with a tiny camera.<br>\r\n\"That's our ticket!\" Roger said happily. Robert picked up the device and pushed the green call button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe device booted up instantly and the typical ringing sound played through the speakers. The display showed a \"call waiting\" text. It was a good two minutes before the other end finally answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" The voice asked. The camera was working but the person on the other end was staying away from it. The voice was incredibly familiar to Robert.<br>\r\n\"Dad?\" Robert asked.<br>\r\n\"Who's this? Robert?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's me\"<br>\r\n\"Why do you sound like a girl\"<br>\r\n\"Why do you think\"<br>\r\n\"You turned yourself into a girl? That's... actually totally expected coming from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert pouted and Roger stifled a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you contact me?\" The device rang out.<br>\r\n\"Device created by the watch\" Robert replied. \"I had some questions\"<br>\r\n\"I've got a few minutes\"<br>\r\n\"Alright. So what the hell is this, where the hell are you, and who the hell is chasing us?\" Robert blurted out, barely containing himself.<br>\r\n\"Sorry son... or... daughter... or I don't know. But I can't tell you where I am, in case their listening\"<br>\r\n\"And the other two questions?\"<br>\r\n\"Well... The latter is answered by the first. The first, I'll give you a brief overview. There's been a secret society within humankind right since the foundation of the first Egyptian kingdoms that has held fascination with the fabric of space and time, specifically delving into how... well, malleable, it is when you know how to fold it. They've been existing right through human history but it's always been a highly selective few who held the abilities to manipulate things around them. However, their powers have always been massively limited. The watch is like a god-device in comparison to them. I stole a few of their ancient scrolls, worked out how it all worked and built the first device\"<br>\r\n\"First device?\" Robert asked.<br>\r\n\"Yea. It was a pretty big computer and the input was entirely text based. But once I had that, I managed to use THAT machine to create the small watch you wear now. Pretty funky stuff if I do say so myself... Anyway, they found out what I had done and I was forced to destroy the large machine, bolts and all. Unfortunately, they managed to salvage a bit of it. I presume your familiar with the wristbands they have?\"<br>\r\n\"Hell yes, their super annoying\" Nguyen said.<br>\r\n\"Well, that's just it. The bands don't let me manipulate things per say, but it does let them match transformations to things equal to whatever you do, just no greater\" The voice continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if I happened to renovate a log cabin...\"<br>\r\n\"Then they'd have something of an equivalent log cabin wherever they wanted. Big woohoo. And I thought I said in the note to use it SPARINGLY?\"<br>\r\n\"Yea... we didn't\" Roger cooed. Roberts father sighed.<br>\r\n\"Look, I really can't help you, I'm sorry. If you want to fight this, it's all up to you\" He said. \"I've... I've gotta go now. Can't let them find me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe line went dead. Roger shook her head. Nguyen sighed and lent her head on Roberts shoulder.<br>\r\n\"At least we got some answers\" She said mournfully.</span></div></div>",

In fact...\" Robert said as she used the watch to remove the communicator from existence. \"Just in case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Roger made herself comfortable, plopping down on a sofa and crossing her legs like her character Anya would do. \"So do you think three of those agents out there spontaneously turned into super agent women, two of which look and sound basically identical?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes most likely. Well, who knows if they look like us, but they definitely have our super-human abilities.\" Nguyen explained in an effortless British accent. \"If they did suddenly turn into girls, at the very least it might confuse them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger smiled, \"It doesn't look like it confused Robert all that much, or should I say 'Elissa'. <i>She</i> looks like she's fitting in perfectly in her new role.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you're one to talk <i>Anya</i>. You normally cross your legs like that?\" Robert countered in an equally British accent as Nguyen, while inspecting the watch further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Roger looked down at herself, \"Good point, I guess the watch made me not even think twice about this new body. I almost forgot I was Anya for a second...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNguyen just rolled her eyes, \"Yes yes, we're all just so in character, isn't that nice? Did you figure out a way to hide us yet Robert?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I have an idea. It's risky but it'll buy us some time to think of a plan of attack. I should be able to use the watch to create a cloaking field around the cabin, which turns this whole area invisible. It'll make their cabin invisible too, but who cares, they're probably not using it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that risky, it sounds pretty solid to me.\" Roger said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because there's no way to be sure it really works. What if their immunity to wishes makes them immune to the cloaking field and see right through it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNguyen smirked, \"They weren't immune to my boot when I kicked one of them through the wall. These boots were made by the watch, not to mention my inhuman strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point,\" Robert nodded, \"It just might be what we need. Which is good, cause I don't know how else to protect us that also doesn't give them knowledge of how to find us.\"</span></div></div>",

On their morning run the next day, Robert and Nguyen were attacked by secret agents who were hell bent on getting the RSW. Robert used it on Nguyen to give her the physical appearance and capabilities of a character called Elissa that Robert created in a video game alongside Roger. She has a soft, perfectly curved face with thin lips and crystal blue eyes as well as a decently shaped figure and a British accent just to boot. In retaliation, Nguyen transformed Robert so now they are both completely identical in all but their minds.<br>\r\nAfter saving Roger from the agents, he transformed himself into his own video game character, a female Spaniard called Anya who has a near identical body to the girls but is slightly shorter, has auburn hair in a pony tail that goes to her shoulders. Her face is similar to the girls but is curvier and slightly shorter, marking a noticeable difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three girls are now clad in black leather suits with the typical bullet proof undermesh. But since they're based on a video game that doesn't follow perfect physics, they have abnormally large strength and can heal from wounds in a matter of minutes or seconds. They also have inventories, which they are yet to discover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter escaping from the agents yet again, they've hunkered down in a magically cloaked cabin in the mountains. Their latest discovery is that the agents after them have RSW immune wristbands, which has the effect of modifying their own reality to aid them in their search, but they are limited to changes equal to or less than the changes caused by the RSW<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNguyen sniffed the soup she was in the process of cooking. She stirred it a few more times and then let it continue to simmer on the stove. It was almost done.<br>\r\nThe gang had slept through the night silently, disturbed only by whatever dreams haunted them. Nguyen had woken first, now aware that the person sleeping beside her, while still Robert in mind, was actually a female identical to herself. Perhaps if unusual though, she had quickly become accustomed to this new body she was inhabiting. While she may have once been a petite Vietnamese girl, she was feeling more confident in her taller physique. Nguyen considered the concept of staying in this body forever as she watched the soup simmer. There weren't really any downsides to it, aside from the fact that nobody outside of their little all girls gang would no longer recognize her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, there were more pressing matters on her mind. They had been given the power to bend reality itself with but a simple wish - though fate had thrown them a cruel hand of cards in dealing out an equally powerful opponent. It seemed almost ironic that the fighting, regardless of where or when, would always come down to a matter of out thinking their opponent rather than by winning with brute force or using a magical wish granted by the RSW.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert shuddered and then sat up, now awake.<br>\r\n\"Morning sunshine\" Nguyen said cheerfully, pouring some of the soup into a bowl. The cabin was conveniently well stocked. They could thank the watch for that.<br>\r\n\"We slept through the whole night?\" Robert asked, rubbing her eyes briefly and gracefully accepting the bowl.<br>\r\n\"All three of us... yeaup\" Nguyen replied. Roger had stirred as well. She looked at the two bleary eyed from her bed.<br>\r\n\"We both get brand new bodies and I'm still up before you\" Robert smirked, looking at Roger. Roger groaned and sat up. Nguyen handed her another bowl and finished off the pot by filling her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, any ideas on what to do now?\" Roger asked.<br>\r\n\"I've been thinking about that. And if I am right, them finding us would be a matter of luck really\" Robert said.<br>\r\n\"Oh? Do tell?\" Nguyen asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, the cloaking field around this cabin is small. Pure theory here but if they have the ability to see through cloaks, then whatever tech they have probably only works in a small area - balancing and all that\"<br>\r\n\"So since we ran out of town, it'd be like looking for a needle in a haystack?\" Roger asked.<br>\r\n\"Sure. Since we had that VTOL, we could have ended up anywhere in the world due to it's mach like speeds. So in reference to your needle in a haystack, the cabin is the needle and the haystack is the planet\" Robert explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which makes us perfectly safe until luck says otherwise\" Nguyen said happily.<br>\r\n\"Basically... But luck can be fickle. I think we should really consider a game plan for responding to these people\"<br>\r\n\"We could create a map that tells us where they all are at once\" Roger piped up.<br>\r\n\"That would give them a map of where WE are...\" Nguyen said flatly. Roger leaned back in her chair in defeat.<br>\r\n\"Logic says they now have three overpowered people, similar to us\" Robert reminded her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, logically, we have to find a way to beat these three. That would completely unbalance their system by giving us an advantage\" Roger said.<br>\r\n\"Divide and conquer?\" Nguyen asked. \"If it's three of us against one of them, we could win easily. It'd just mean three fights in our favor\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert leaned back in her chair, considering all possibilities and potential outcomes. Ironically, this would be a fight in which they'd have to use the watch as little as possible. Any unexpected advantage on the agents side right now could destroy them utterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNguyen leaned on the table with her left elbow, resting her head on her hand. She drummed on it nonchalantly with her right hand.</span></div></div>",

Robert was scraping the bottom of her bowl now, still thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, Nguyen lept back in a mixture of surprise and horror.<br>\r\n\"Nguyen! What happened?\" Robert asked, rushing to her aid, knocking her chair over in the process. Roger eyed Nguyen carefully.<br>\r\n\"You don't see that?\" Nguyen asked, calming down and pointing into midair.<br>\r\n\"See what?\" Robert asked, looking at where she was pointing. He could see nothing out of the ordinary.<br>\r\n\"You don't see that screen?\" Nguyen asked again, accepting Roberts aid in standing up. Robert and Roger both shook their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo both Roger and Robert, it appeared as if Nguyen was randomly tapping on thin air.<br>\r\n\"Whats the button for the inventory screen in that game of yours?\" She asked, finally looking at the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The 'I' key\" Robert answered.<br>\r\n\"Imagine a keyboard in front of you, and push the I key\" Nguyen said helpfully. Both of the girls tried it and to their surprise, a large screen appeared in front of them, though invisible to anyone else. It looked exactly like the inventory and character screen from the game, with a brief list of their character statistics and their current inventory. As best as Robert could make out from the equip tab, she only had clothing on her. However, her inventory listed two 'Tec-2' pistols... Her favourite weapons from the game which despite lower than average damage, had unlimited ammunition thanks to being laser based.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dragged the items to her equipment tab and watched as two pistols formed out of thin air, holstered to her belt.<br>\r\n\"Well, that's new\" Robert said gleefully.<br>\r\n\"It'd be the advantage we probably need\" Roger said, inspecting her own assault rifle.<br>\r\n\"Never could turn down a gun like that could you?\" Robert asked, looking briefly at the clearly powerful rifle in Rogers hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNguyen's inventory was identical to Roberts, though rather than pulling out the dual pistols, she attempted to equip the marksman's sniper rifle. It appeared holstered over her back.<br>\r\n\"I've never used a gun before\" Nguyen said, looking blankly at Robert.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>*pewpewpewpewpew* In a matter of seconds, the paper target was a charred mess full of holes. Robert holstered her two laser pistols looking like a complete badass. She turned around and smiled at Nguyen, who was quite impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I had no idea you were such a good shot!\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert shrugged, \"I'm not really, but Elissa is, so that means we are too. You should give that sniper rifle a try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNguyen looked back at the large rifle on her back, unsure. However before she could act, Roger butt in with her assault rifle. \"Oh, can I try first? I really wanna get a feel for this thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I guess so. Here..\" Robert used the watch to spawn in a bunch of temporary magazines for Roger's gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger loaded one and pulled the chamber back, enjoying the heft of the powerful weapon in her hands. She seemed surprised that she had the strength to pull it back so easily but then remembered that Anya was very strong and used to handling weapons like this.  \"Hey, move the targets a bit further back, this time, I want to see what this thing can do!\" She said with a Spanish lilt to her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe targets on the range all began to slide farther away, as they were on rails. Robert had created this room using the watch, which existed inside of their cabin. Despite the cabin being quite small, the room itself seemed to defy all physics as it was hundreds of meters long, but didn't show up on the outside of the building. Similar to their magical inventory space, Robert realized she could create a room that was much bigger on the inside than the out. All it took was a simple wish and the watch took care of the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect...\" Roger said as she looked down the sights and took aim at the more distant targets now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith several controlled bursts, Roger was able to hit the majority of the targets first try, even up to two hundred meters. When the targets were moved up closer, she went full auto and mowed down a dozen targets in a short amount of time. \"Oh yeah... that's what I'm talking about. This is just how I designed Anya to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive, I think I want to try now though.\" Nguyen said, inspecting the large sniper rifle while 'Anya' was busy murdering targets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey moved the targets out to a hundred meters for her first attempt, but to everyone's great surprise, she barely even had to look down the scope to land a bullseye. \"Holy shit, did I just do that? I wasn't even thinking about pulling the trigger yet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have Elissa's instincts. She's a pilot AND a marksman, remember?\" Robert bragged, clearly proud of her character being so skilled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well ok... can this thing shoot farther?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, it's the longest range gun in the game, why do you think I made this range so damn big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe targets flew out to two hundred meters this time, and Nguyen still had no trouble. Three hundred, still easy. Five hundred, and she finally had to take a moment to control her breath and steady the weapon on her knee while crouched. The powerful rifle would have knocked her over from the recoil, if Elissa's instincts hadn't had her positioned properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... this feels amazing to be able to hit something so far... is there anything else I can do?\" Nguyen marvelled at her sudden newfound skill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Finally Robert decided it was time to modify the range, and extended it out to over a kilometer in length. They needed binoculars just to see the targets, something that Robert was able to provide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNguyen got down prone on her stomach, and let her instincts take over adjusting the scope for the distance. She loaded a new magazine and pulled a round up into the chamber. After patiently timing her breaths, she finally let the bullet loose. It echoed down the incredibly long room, and they were all glad to be wearing ear protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert and Roger were both trying to see if she hit with their binoculars, and sure enough, a shot was landed right in the target's chest.  \"Oh my god you did it. Can you do it again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNguyen obliged, but this time the bullet flew just shy of the head. She cursed herself for missing, but gave it a third attempt.  This one landed square between the target's eyes. Robert and Roger cheered, completely floored by what she'd done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good lord that was incredible!\" Robert cheered, running up and giving her doppelganger a hug when she stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNguyen blushed as their identical breasts squished together, \"Was it really that good? I mean I missed that one time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding? I put the target a little outside the range that gun's supposed to hit at. In the game that shot would have been impossible! But real life physics meant that you still had a chance, and you made two out of three which is crazy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger put her arms around her friend's shoulders, \"You know this calls for a celebration right? How well can that watch make alcohol?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno, only one way to find out. First let's clean up this range so the people following us don't get any funny ideas.\" Robert said as the gun range vanished before their eyes, leaving behind only a plain cabin wall where it once was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNguyen placed the rifle back in her magical inventory, and looked at the other two girls skeptically. \"Are you sure we need to be carelessly using the watch on getting <i>drunk?</i> We need to be prepared, we can't just be wasting it on silly things like a party...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, love,\" Robert said in Elissa's English accent, \"What are they going to do, get drunk off the beer we make for them? It'll be fine, and we can't stay paranoid forever!\"</span></div></div>",

Rogers accent was becoming more pronounced by the hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but if we are going to do this, we need a plan. A good plan - something preferably infallible.\" Robert said, sitting down in a chair.<br>\r\n\"Doesn't help that we don't know where they are\" Roger said. \"Or what they look like now. I mean, since we changed they've probably changed attire as well\"<br>\r\nNguyen pondered the statement. \"That's rather a good point.

Long storyline made short, the politicians of the world met in a singular building to try and ratify some sort of world peace. Terrorists blew the place up which effectively destroyed the worlds leadership. The countries of Europe fell into pitiful squabbling until the UK and Spain sorted them out, forming the European Alliance forces. Most of Russia, Asia and the middle east reformed into the Dominion... though from what I understand it's really the Russians and the Chinese telling everyone else what do to\"<br>\r\n\"You haven't mentioned America yet\" Nyugen asked.<br>\r\n\"America - or more specifically the old United States of America completely fell apart. The united bit was destroyed and now the various states are fighting each other for leadership. Canada and Mexico are out of the picture trying to prevent anyone from crossing their borders.\" Roger said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that makes us the Alliance?\" Nguyen asked.<br>\r\n\"Bingo. Major enemies include the Dominion and various minority American warlords\" Robert continued. \"And it's more than likely that the agents now have dominion tech\"<br>\r\n\"Not american?\"<br>\r\n\"Hell no\" Roger said. \"The Americans have big guns but pitiful numbers. They don't stand on nearly the same level as the other two\"<br>\r\n\"It'd be hilarious if they DID turn out to be a warlords sect though\" Robert laughed. \"It'd make this fight so much easier\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's go find out!\" Nguyen said eagerly, holstering her rifle.<br>\r\n\"Sure. If we head back to town we should find them easily\" Robert said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio of ladies left the cabin and Robert used the watch to return it to it's rundown state. She was adamant in making sure that they couldn't be tracked.<br>\r\nRobert then wished back up the VTOL they had flown before. Jumping into the pilot seat, they headed back towards town at a high speed.<br>\r\nThe skyscrapers in the center of the city were the first to peak over the horizon and rows of houses soon began to line the ground beneath them. Heading to the city center, Robert landed on an unobtrusive skyscraper and they departed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We shouldn't use a VTOL here... it'd attract too much attention. I think we should stick to our grappling hooks and nimble movement\" Robert announced as the VTOL disappeared from existence.<br>\r\n\"I scanned through my inventory screen... thingy...\" Nguyen said. \"While we were flying. There's some sort of radar in it. Are we able to use that at all?\"<br>\r\n\"Yup. It'll track them up to a significant distance\" Roger said, perching on the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you see?\" Robert asked her.<br>\r\n\"There's quite a few of them down there. All dressed in civvie clothing... but it's them alright\"<br>\r\n\"Are they on a team?\" Robert asked.<br>\r\n\"Oh yes\" She responded.</span></div></div>",

He had no memory of this reality, being aware of the changes, so he had to be coached in the rules for a moment before the game started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everything was settled, it was decided that Roger would get first serve, as the one being challenged. He winced and slowly pulled his head off his shoulders as he was instructed to do. He expected some sort of intense pain and discomfort, but opened his eyes when he realized his head felt nothing at all. He served it up in the air and simply gave it a strong whack with his racquet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd missed the other side of the court completely. His head wiffed straight to the left, nearly flying into the stands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was busy laughing her ass off, barely able to contain herself. \"Oh god, this is funnier than I ever imagined it would be! You're going down so hard Roger! Soon you'll be finished!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience didn't seem to mind the trash talking, even cheering Ashley on, despite the fact that she hadn't even done anything yet. Some in the audience were rooting for Roger, but people clearly had no hope for him now. He was given back his head, and once it reattached to his neck, he felt much more comfortable. But this time it was Ashley's turn to serve. She removed her own head, with her long brunette hair flying in the wind as she whacked it cleanly towards Roger's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good serve, but now Roger had proper perspective and was easily able to return the serve back to Ashley. She was clearly disoriented from her vision flying all over the court, and her next hit was stopped short by the net. Once again it was Roger's serve. This time he was a little more prepared when his head came off again, and he managed to make it over the net, and the two hit it back and forth once or twice before Ashley finally scored on him. The two took turns serving their own heads for quite a while, and the game ended up being closer than anyone expected. Neither seemed terribly competent at tennis, and the points quickly racked up, but neither seemed to be able to push out a win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had tried paying attention to the game but Nguyen was far too alluring to ignore. You had your hands all over her, hugging her close and sneaking quick kisses now and then. You were so relieved that she was still alive, and even better looking than before nonetheless, that you stopped worrying about Roger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the whistle was blown as Roger was finally defeated by Ashley, who spiked her own head down over the net so hard that Roger had no chance of returning it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Ashley wins! Congratulations on defeating your classmate!\" The announcer yelled into the megaphone for the crowd to hear. \"Now take your prize!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley looked at Roger with a strange lust, and licked her lips, considering how she would handle this situation.</span></div></div>",

See if you can't make her bigger!\" He's greedily staring at the watch, and you can pretty much see all the things running through his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" you ask, the idea of your girlfriend being extremely muscle bound running through your head and giving you shivers.  \"I don't want her to be stronger than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNguyen thwacks another ball into the corner of the court.  You look over and see a linesman is down, clutching his head.  Her hits are so hard they actually gave grown men concussions!  Roger turns to you, grinning, \"Dude, I think we're way past that point by now.  Might as well go for the full monty!  Besides, what do you have to lose?  Personally, I think it'll be funny playing third wheel to Schwarzenneger and his gal pal.\"  He snickered and nudged you in the side.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fact that you had reservations about turning Nguyen into a muscle freak, and that you weren't necessarily turned on by things like that, the RSW was a gift and you might as well use it on someone you'll probably be hanging out with a lot later.  \"Okay, but I'm only doing this because of you.  Anything bad that happens is your fault.\"  You set the watch to local, and change Nguyen so that her muscles are bigger.  You decide to go for full-blown bodybuilder, testing the limits of the watch and your tolerance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Nguyen's body-shape morphed.  Her biceps got bigger, to the point where even when she was relaxed they were the size of baseballs, and her thighs ballooned the tennis skirt to their stretching point.  Her chest became a chiseled slab, her breasts held up prominently by her new pectoral muscles.  And her form-hugging tank top showed off the incredible abdominal growth that made her stomach look like a cobblestoned street.  \"Wow that is really hot and really weird, all at the same time,\" Roger gasps.  \"Sex with her is going to break you in half,\" he giggles.  The device had also made her taller, fitting her muscle onto a more manageable body frame.  Except, this was not something Robert wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, she's like huge now,\" Robert moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, who's fault is that?  You're the one that gave her man biceps,\" Roger retorted, focusing his attention on every flex of Nguyens' incredible body.  She was now wiping the floor with the other girl, absolutely crushing her opponent.  The match was over quickly, and Nguyen went back to her bench to watch the rest of her teammates play.  Safe to say, she dwarfed all of them.  But none of the other girls seemed to think her size or strength were weird in any way.  In fact, some of them fawned over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mean the muscles!  The watch, it made her taller.\" Robert stared down at the thing wrapped around his wrist, \"This is bullshit, I'm changing what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert sets the watch to local, points at Nguyen and...</span></div></div>",

Terrified, you turn around and see a man in a long, dark trenchcoat glaring at you.  He wasn't one of the men you saw at your dorm building.  In fact, he looked scarier.  He had greying hair, wrinkles all over his face and was wearing a bowler hat.  He grabbed you with his black-gloved hands and pushed you up from your seat, \"Time to come with me.  You too,\" he growled, grabbing Roger and dragging him with you.  Inconspicuous, he pushed both of you out of the tennis stadium and near a few trees that lined the giant concrete walkway that led into campus.  Behind one of the trees, he sat both of you down and then took out a cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen,\" he began as he lit the cigarette, \"I'm not here to kill you, beat you up, or anything like that.  I'm just here to get back what is mine, and help you two forget anything ever happened, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell are you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what's a better question?\" the man took of his bowler hat, revealing a sizable bald spot atop the crown of his head.  \"How much trouble will I be in if I don't cooperate?  And the answer to that is,\" he drew a puff from his cigarette and blew it towards the boys, \"way too much for your puny brains to comprehend.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger tried getting up and simply walking away, but the man pushed him back down with a peculiar amount of strength.  Despite his mediocre size, he had quite a grip on him.  \"The RSW,\" he said, turning back to Robert, \"I want it and you're going to give it to me.  Your father was a good man-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was?\" you shout.  Did this man kill your dad?  What did he know?  \"What did you do to my dad?!\" you scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up or I'll rip your mouth off your face!\" the old man's eyes were crazed, and his hands jutted out towards you.  \"Now give me the watch, and we'll get to the 'forgetting' part of your day.\"  The old man grabbed your wrist, and began yanking at the watch but the watch made several loud, piercing beeping noises.  Then an electric shock burst from its face, and blew the man backwards.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slammed into another tree and slumped down to the ground unconscious, limp like a wet noodle.  \"What the hell just happened?\" Roger blurted out.  You were just as confused, but extremely grateful all the same.  You look down at the watch and saw its face go from Red back to Blue, with the words \"Theft Prevention\" fading away.  \"Nice,\" you said to yourself, then explained what happened to Roger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you two gathered yourselves, you decided to...</span></div></div>",

You held the RSW up to your mouth, \"Let's see if we can't make this guy a little less intimidating,\" you snicker.  As you set the changes you wanted, Roger suddenly grabs your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wait!\" he shouts, but it was too late.  You had fired the watch.  But instead of hitting the old man, Roger began to change.  You tap the watch, frantically trying to reverse the changes but it's gone from green to blue already.  There was nothing you could do about it.  \"Holy crap, I'm so sorry dude,\" you say as you stare at your new friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger had turned from the red-haired, gangly best friend you had know for several years into a tall, gorgeous but weak blonde girl.  His hair went down to just below his shoulders, his body was curvaceous and his face could turn any man's knees into jelly.  \"What in God's name were you trying to do to that guy?\" Roger screamed, holding up his new breasts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you make me stop?\" you shout, just as shocked by the turn of events.  \"I wanted to make him weak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger walked up to you, his t-shirt and jeans having been replaced by shorts and a white t-shirt.  \"Idiot, before you change him we need to loot him and figure out what he's got!  Maybe we can figure out who he is!\"  Roger grabs your hand, and drags you over to the man.  \"Ugh, thank god this is only going to last for two hours.  Come on, let's get to digging around.\"  You glance at your watch, and see that there are three countdowns now.  You've still got 100 minutes, but Nguyen had 110 and Roger now had 120 left to go in his transformation.  \"Argh, there's hair everywhere!\" he yells in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed a little, seeing Roger struggle with his hair and the new dimensions of his body.  It wasn't on purpose that he had become a bombshell.  Roger's current body was just the only female body that came to mind when you wanted to change the old man.  \"Hey!\" you exclaim, reaching deep into the old man's pocket and pulling out a wallet.  \"Look at this, he's got an ID!\"  You pull it out and it has...</span></div></div>",

He had a bit of stubble on his face, and looked more like a model than a government agent.  \"His name is Ricky Castalleno, I think.\"  You put the ID picture up to his face, and try to see the resemblance.  It's barely there.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe that's a really old picture of him,\" Roger points out, also confused by the young man in the picture.  He rummaged some more through the man's jacket and pockets, eventually coming upon something he didn't expect.  \"Whoa, dude, look!\" He pulls out a revolver, its barrel shining brightly in the sun.  It had a white handle that look glazed, and a tiny insignia chiseled into its base.  \"It's so fancy!\" he exclaimed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Roger holding the gun, you notice that you're suddenly very, very turned on.  \"Okay, stop it man.  Just put that thing away,\" you say, trying to refocus on the ID.  You see a date near the bottom.  \"Oh my god!  This was issued just last month!\"  You look at the old man and back at the ID, \"How did this guy age so fast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't think they have one of those watches too, do you?\"  Roger looks at you, putting the gun in the back of his shorts.  A bit of his new midriff showed, and your hormones went wild.  \"I love Nguyen, I love Nguyen, I love Nguyen,\" you kept repeating to yourself in your head.  It was barely working.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger got up and looked around, \"Looks like no one saw this whole thing.  Good thing your girlfriend is distracting everyone with the tennis game.\"  Then, his jaw dropped.  \"Oh shit, look!\"  He pointed in the direction just behind you.  You turn around, and see several men in trenchcoats heading towards your position.  \"Quick!\" Roger had taken out the gun, \"Make me a really good shot!  Hurry up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrantically, your mind still on how attracted you were to your best friend's new feminine body, you point the watch at him and set it to local.

He squatted down, his eyes trained on the oncoming agents, and his breasts squished against his knees.  You nearly lost your mind, but quickly regained it when another shot was fired and hit you in the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, holy shit!\" you scream, clutching your shoulder and getting behind a tree.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger called out to you, \"You alright?

You yell out yes, and then hear three quick shots and three bodies falling to the ground.  \"Holy good lord almighty that was amazing!\" he shouts out loud.  He jumps up and down in the air, his heaving breasts nearly smacking him in the face.  \"Okay, wow, these are way bigger than they should be,\" he said, trying to squish them down.  He quickly stopped, hearing that you were in pain.  \"What happened?  What can I do?\" he asked, coming up to where you lay injured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The watch,\" you groan, unable to lift the arm with the watch on it.  \"Bring it closer to my face,\" you said.

Your father has either been killed or kidnapped by the government, which happened to have the ability to switch around reality just like you did.  Your girlfriend was a tall, muscley Amazon, and your best friend was so gorgeous it was actually screwing with your brain.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger opened the door to his dorm, stepped in, then shrieked and flew right back out.  \"What's wrong?\" you ask, holding him and trying to get him to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My entire room has been girlified by your dumb watch!\" he screamed, shoving you away from him.  \"And you have a girlfriend damn it!  Stop looking at me like that!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug him off and ignore his comments, pushing his door open.  \"It can't be that...\" your voice trails off as you see what exactly happened to his room.  There were bras, giant ones, everywhere.  His panties were bunched up and tucked away just underneath his bed, and skirts were strewn across the floor.  It was just as messy as Roger's room would be normally, except instead of boxers there were panties laying around the room everywhere.  It was a blessing that he lived in a single room by himself.  Roger stepped in and immediately went to the bathroom he shared with four other boys.  Inside, he turned on the lights and found the normal deoderants, shaving cream, etc.  But off to one side were feminine hygiene products, a make-up bag, and a box of tampons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God!\" Roger screamed from within the bathroom, running out and tackling you.  \"Change me back, now!\" he screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then get off of me!\" you yell, pushing him off.  But as you pushed him off, your hands touch his breasts.  The sensation was something you had never felt before, and it was incredible.  You squeezed and as he fell over to his side, you hoisted yourself up on top of him and almost kissed him.  Out of nowhere, his right hand came and slapped you hard across the face.  You fell over, hands flailing, and your arm hit the bed.  Unfortunately, the part of your arm that made contact with the bed was the part of your arm that was also wearing the watch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\" you grabbed your hand, holding it.  A muffled sound came from underneath it, a beeping noise.  You looked at the watch and saw it was flashing red.  On its face, it read...</span></div></div>",

And when Nguyen finds out about this-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the watch!\" you point at it, \"It's broken or something!  It keeps saying that permanent changes are in effect.\"  You tap it a little and that only made the beeping worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Roger could hear it and covered his ears, \"What does that mean?  And turn it off!\"  You slip the watch off of your wrist, and try to press some of the buttons on top of it.  The beeping only gets faster.  It begins to shake now too, and you toss it into the middle of the room.  \"Is it going to blow up?\" Roger asks.  You shake your head, not knowing the answer and not wanting too.  You crawl over to where he is, and try to spread yourself as thin as possible against the bedroom drawer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven that began to shake now, and the beeping got louder and louder.  Suddenly the very room itself began to creak and moan, shaking and rattling.  Books fell off shelves, a laptop careened over the edge of a desk and cracked in half.  Out of the bedroom drawer rattled out a long, oblong object that began to vibrate when it hit the ground.  \"Good lord am I actually a girl?\" Roger exclaimed, taking the object and tossing it from them.  Finally, the shaking stopped and a blue light erupted from the watch engulfing them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrozen stiff, you and Roger let the blue light wash over you.  When it finally passes, you look around for any changes.  Roger was still a woman, you were still a normal man, and the watch was no longer beeping.  In fact, it sounded like it was humming.  Crawling over to where it lay, you pick it up and it is scaldingly hot.  Dropping it, you see on its face the words \"Recharging\".  \"It must have used up a lot of energy to make that blast,\" you say, turning around to Roger.

He pulls out a box of birth control pills and throws them into the center of the room.  Without looking, he reaches into another drawer on the nightstand and pulls out from underneath a pile of clothes a yearbook.  He flips automatically to a page with high school football players.  He points at a picture and you go over to look.  \"Whoa,\" you whisper.  There was an article featuring Roger, in his girl form, as the star quarterback of his high school's football team.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got memories,\" he says quietly, \"Memories of this room, where I put things, of high school and what I did, even of going to the shooting range when I was a kid.  And they're all with me being this girl, Robert.  I have her hair, her body, her face, her everything.  I didn't have any of that before the watch blew up on us.\"  He closes the book and gets up, \"I think I know what the watch meant when it said permanent changes.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he rose, so did you.  You nodded in agreement.  The same thing was dawning on you.  \"Let's see if we're right, before we fly off the handle and just assume,\" you say, holding up the watch and getting ready to make changes.  But when you move to press the \"Local\" button on the watch, you see that it's still recharging.  \"God, how long does this take?\" you ask.  Tapping it, a new screen came up that showed a flickering battery.  It was barely a quarter full.  Groaning, you fall on top of Roger's bed and put your hands to your head.  \"I'm so sorry I got you into this mess,\" you open your eyes and see Roger standing near the doorway sulking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to him, reaching out to comfort your distressed friend.  He pulls away, eyes glaring at you.  \"Sorry, sorry, not appropriate.  Listen, I didn't mean to do what I did.  I let things take control of me, I let this situation get to me and I'm sorry about that.  Alright?  Can we be friends again?\"  You reach out your hand and smile.  Hesitantly, Roger takes it and moves back to the center of the room with you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" you say, plopping yourself down on his bed and looking at the watch.  Still no change.  \"What exactly is your new life like now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird,\" Roger says bluntly.  \"I was born with the body of a girl, but I've got all the speech and mannerisms and personality of a normal boy.  And it's not because I'm transgender or anything either.  Apparently my dad had me tested,\" he tapped the side of his head, \"I'm just a boy with a girl's body.  And no one thinks of me any differently.  I actually have a disease named after me: Platt's Disease.\"  He smiled sheepishly, \"My dad tried to make me feel like a boy as much as he could.  That's why I'm good at football and shooting.\"  Roger pointed at the gun.  Looking at the watch, he shook his head, \"It's incredible how such a little thing can change so much.  Your dad really invented that huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the story.  I don't know how we're going to fix this though.  Because if these changes are permanent-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say that!\" Roger's voice cracked.  \"I mean, please don't say that.  At least not around me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man, I've got a bone in this too.  If Nguyen stays like that, I don't know what I'm going to do.  Imagine what'll happen to me when we get into an argument?\" you both laugh at this, the weirdness of your situation dawning upon both of you.  \"Listen, if we're going to get out of this, I think the first thing we need to do is find my dad.  Or at least, find out how he made this stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger nodded in agreement.  \"Where should we start?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged, \"Maybe my house?

Standing almost level with the peephole, a feat she was never capable of beforehand, was Nguyen sweating and panting.  \"Hurry and open it up!\" she yelled, pounding on the door.  The hinges creaked, and somewhere in the door a piece of wood cracked and bent.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow she's strong,\" Roger mouths at you, backing away from the door letting you handle your Hulk-girlfriend.  As you open the door, you smile sweetly, \"Hey honey!\" you say as innocuously as possible.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey yourself,\" she says, pushing you away.  She's an inch taller than you, and her muscles make it look like even more.  Sitting down on Roger's bed, you could hear it creaking under her weight.  \"You don't mind do you?\" she said, looking at Roger.  You continued to be amazed by the powers of the device.  Nguyen hadn't even blinked at the fact that Roger was now a girl.  She was still dressed in her tight tank top, her tennis skirt barely containing her massive and powerful thighs.  Roger quickly shakes his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you know we were here?\" you ask grabbing her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNguyen shrugged her enormous shoulders, \"I figured you wouldn't be in your room considering it's a crime scene now.  And by the way, it's only a matter of time before they come here.\"  She jerks her hand to Roger's room with a knowing face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  Who's they?\" Roger asks frantically.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All those creepy guys in trenchcoats.  It was really scary actually,\" Nguyen said, crossing her arms.  Normally, Nguyen was a bit of a wuss.  She couldn't even stand to hear a scary movie trailer, let alone watch a horror movie with others.  So when she crossed her bulging arms, her biceps squishing her breasts together so she looked like a block of Vietnamese muscle, the scared tone of her voice was jarring.  \"What are you looking at?\" she asked, confused by your slack-jawed stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, nothing,\" you say quietly, shaking yourself back to reality.  Or whatever messed up parallel dimension you found yourself in now.  \"It's just, I think I know why those men in trenchcoats are after us.  But I can't explain things now.  We need to figure out a way to get back to my house without getting caught by those guys.\"  Nguyen stares at you like you're a mad man, and you quickly glance at your watch.  It was still only a quarter done charging.  \"Listen, we need to borrow your car.  Can we please use it to get back to my house?\"  Nguyen looks at you unsure...</span></div></div>",

See if there's any money in it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask, shocked.  \"I don't want to steal from him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger scoffed.  \"Well, if you don't want him to be able to do anything you might as well steal money from him.

It's like this is normal for me now.\"  He sets the gun down and continues to rummage through Sally's clothes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you hear some people shout.  You look up, and see a few more men in trenchcoats with guns held up yelling at you.  You freakout, diving behind the tree.

He swung his head around to face you, his long blonde hair swinging over his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was me making you the best shot in the school!

When he pointed it at the men in trenchcoats, he quickly aimed and fired three times.  All three men went down, holes in their chests.  \"Oh my god,\" Roger put a hand to his mouth, an almost feminine gesture.

You shouldn't have been staring, but you couldn't help it.  In fact, you were even comparing your chest with his a little.  You were still bigger.  \"It's like whenever I need to, I can access these new memories!  Holy cow!  My new life is crazy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tug him along, \"That's awesome, but let's catch up on it while we're safe in my room.

You still had 80 minutes in your transformation, Nguyen 90, and Roger 110.  \"Come on, let's go,\" you motion to Roger.  The two of you trudge your way up the hill that lead to your dormitory and entered into your building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you got onto your floor, you ran into Pamela again.  You felt incredibly awkward and self-conscious, instinctively crossing your arms over what were copies of her breasts.  But Pamela didn't seem to notice.  \"Hey Rob, can I get my tank top back from you?  I've been meaning to ask and keep forgetting.\"  You're dumbfounded for a few moments, before she prods you back into reality.  \"Remember?  You asked if you could borrow my red tank top?  Because we're pretty much built the same?\" She pointed at your chest and hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod dumbly for a minute, \"Right, right..\" You walk back to your room, still marveling at how much of reality the watch could change.  For two hours at least, you were practically a god.  You give Pamela her top back, rummaging around your closet past your new blouses and shirts.  Meanwhile, Roger watching intently.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Pamela finally leaves, he turns to you with a shit-eating grin...</span></div></div>",

What was even stranger was that her boobs had grown considerably too, and sitting on her pectoral shelf were super perky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I don't know,\" you decide against telling her about the watch for now.  Maybe it'll come up later, but for now the most important thing was waking up Roger and getting the heck out of dodge.  If those trenchcoat men were anything like Sally, you didn't want to stick around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you could make a move for the bed, Nguyen gets up and hugs you in one swift motion. Being only 5'9\", her 6'2\" frame completely engulfed you in a bear hug.  \"I was so scared!\" she said, doing that little girl voice she always does when she's frightened.  The irony was not lost on you.  Here was your she-hulk girlfriend, telling you she was scared of a flash of light. You did your best not to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pat her on the back, which was a new experience seeing as how it was rock hard.  \"There, there.  I'm here to protect you,\" you say, smirking a little.  She pulls away and looks at you earnestly, then goes in for a kiss.  This was different.  It had always been you bending down to her 5'0\" frame, wrapping her in your arms and kissing her.  Now she was bending down five inches towards you, pressing you against her ripped body.  It was both scintillating and totally, utterly weird.  Not knowing how to feel, you immediately push off of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she asked, shocked that you didn't want to reciprocate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" you say sheepishly, \"I just, I don't know, I think we need to wake up Roger first.  Isn't it a bit weird making out with him here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled down at you, \"Who said I wanted to make out?  I just wanted a peck from my favorite boyfriend,\" she then did the oddest thing yet.  She reached down and squeezed your boobs.  You didn't even have time to react.  Even if you did, you were more focused on controlling your raging hard-on.  She had inadvertently squeezed your boob right where the nipple was, and the urges were almost uncontrollable.  Both your nipples immediately became hard, and pressed deep against your bra.  Your penis got even more erect than it originally was, as if that was even possible, and you quickly squeezed your legs together to hide your boner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, come on,\" she said, squeezing your boobs again.  \"Don't be shy!  It's not like I haven't seen the whole package before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely able to utter words, you say, \"Maybe we should just wake up Roger.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolls her eyes, \"Of all the times for your to play hard to get.\"  Then she lifts Roger's body up into her arms, \"He'll wake up on the way.  Where should we go next?\"</span></div></div>",

Nothing was happening, and you weren't sure if you wanted to use it again unless it was a dire situation.  Maybe you should find your dad and ask about what exactly is going on?  Or is that the most obvious place to go?  Maybe the trenchcoat men want you to go there, and are just waiting with a trap?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You live close by, I think we should hole up at your place first.\"  You begin gathering a few things, noting to grab a few extra blouses and jackets for Roger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNguyen, still holding Roger in her hands like he was a wet blanket, protested.  \"I just convinced my mom and dad that you weren't some white guy trying to take advantage of their nice, Catholic Viet daughter.  How the heck do you think they're going to accept you staying over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow was the moment of truth.  The situation could easily be solved with the RSW.  Just change her parents' minds every two hours.  No biggie.  But did you want to tell Nguyen about the watch?  As you mulled this over in your mind, you found the gun Roger had taken from Sally.  You wanted to open it, but didn't know how.  Suddenly, the memories filled your brain.  Your bust had given you great accuracy.  Not as good as women who were even half your breast size, but still decent for a guy.  As such, you had a fairly good working knowledge of guns.  \"This is great,\" you say to yourself, nearly forgetting that Nguyen was there.  You pull out the gun's magazine, and see that there were six shots left.  \"Well, whenever Rog wakes up he's gotta make the best of 'em,\" you again mutter to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" your girlfriend asks impatiently.  You wince, having forgotten that you were now at a very important crossroads.  If you told Nguyen about the watch, maybe you'd have to tell her about the changes you made to her.  Of course, you could always cover things up and say that you were very persuasive.  After all, she wouldn't be any wiser anyways.  But you were involving her and her entire family in this mess.  At the very least, didn't she deserve to know what was turning her life upside down?  </span></div></div>",

Hunching over, your breasts smush together.  You catch Nguyen staring at them greedily.  \"Hey!\" you snap your fingers, \"Up here!\"  You never, ever thought you would have to say those words to your girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" she said meekly.  It was like scolding a five year old.  \"What do you need to, um, get off your chest?\" She giggled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling your eyes, you put your hand in her huge one.  \"Listen, those trenchcoat men were kind of right.\"  She squeezed your hand at these words, making you wince.  \"Somehow, I got this,\" you lift up your wrist with the RSW on it, \"in the mail from my dad.  And for some reason, those trenchcoat guys are after it.  They want it real bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it do?\" she asks, taking your wrist in her hands and examining the watch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It changes reality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks up at you in surprise, then starts laughing.  \"Okay, okay, hardy har har, everyone laugh at Nguyen.\" She raised her hands up, \"I know I'm gullible, but come on Rob.

But Nguyen was frantically clutching at her hair as it steadily grew longer and longer.  \"What is going on?  What'd you do to me?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the watch,\" you pull her by the arm, which was too big for your hand to fit around, and point her to the watch.  \"See?

That and Roger might blab it and Nguyen would be even angrier with you.  Even when she was five feet tall she was frightening when she was angry.  What would she do now that she was built like Schwarzenegger and over six feet tall?  \"Nguyen, I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, you have!\" She shrieked.  This still didn't wake up Roger.  You thought this was peculiar.  But your thoughts were snapped back to the irate Nguyen as she grabbed you in her vice like grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring into your eyes, her voice almost like a growl, she said, \"What did you do to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I-um-\" you were struggling for words.  Impatient, Nguyen let you go and got off the bed.  Standing tall over you, she crossed her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vicky\" and \"Christina\" seemed to respond to Nguyen's anger.  They were veiny and bulging.  \"Rob, I swear if you don't tell me right now I'm leaving you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally gathering up the courage, you fix your blouse and readjust your bra.  As you sit up straight, you begin to speak.  \"Okay.  Your muscles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she asked, her head moving around making her hair whip behind her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your muscles and your height.  I gave those to you.\"  You felt like burying your head in your breasts. Considering how large you were, this was actually a feasible option.  As your head lowered in shame, your lips barely came to the crest of your sweater meat.  This is so weird, you think to yourself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you had bigger problems than the fact that your male body now sported giant breasts.  Your 6'2\", bodybuilder girlfriend was now pissed beyond reason at you.  Huffing and puffing, she just stood there trying to process what you had just said.  \"So you're saying that all that work I put into my body, all those days in the gym, that's not real?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, technically, it is real,\" you said flippantly.  This was a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh stop being condescending to me!\" Nguyen raged.  \"I'm getting my life turned upside down right now and you're making jokes?  Do you know how hard I worked for this body?  I've been working out in the gym since I was thirteen Rob!  This took me five years!  Five years of lifting weights, heavy weights!, every day with discipline and eating like a machine!\"  She grabbed her hair in her hands, looking like a crazy person.  Eyes bugging out, she began to pace about the room, muttering angry epithets.  Finally she stopped, and looked at Rob.</span></div></div>",

I don't know if I'm going to be able to hear from my dad again.\"  Before she can say no, you rush out of the room with your phone and into the hallway.  Walking as fast as you can, your breasts bouncing up and down in your bra, you make it to the end of the hall and exit out onto the stairwell.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad?\" you're out of breath as you answer the phone.  \"Where are you?  What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only have a minute before the secure line fails, son.\"  You do a double-take on the phone.  Why did your Dad have a woman's voice?  It sounded...like your mom's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop asking questions and listen.  I need you to come to Joshua Tree.

Just tell me what's happening!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time.  Bring the friends that you've changed with the Permanent shift.  We'll be waiting.\"  Your father hung up.  You let the dial tone stay, your mind racing as to what could possibly be happening.  This was all so confusing.  And to add to your troubles, your girlfriend was pissed off at you.  Your best friend was lying unconscious.  And you were starting to feel the heaviness of your chest.  How big are they? you wonder.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, the information hit you like a hammer.  Your breasts were 34J.  You didn't even know breasts could be that large.  \"Wow,\" you say aloud.  You cup your breasts and squeeze, enjoying the surge of pleasure.  But before you get too into it, you remember that you have a mission now.  You leave the stairwell and head back to your room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nguyen handles Roger's weight like it's nothing, continuing to surprise you at just how strong she really is.  You follow her just a few doors down, and she quickly enters the passcode to enter her room.  Thankfully, none of her roommates were there.  As you enter, you can see how much reality has changed again for Nguyen.  Her side of the room was plastered with posters of muscular women, even some male bodybuilders.  They were all striking poses, with their enormous muscles and rock-hard abs proudly displayed.  One of the posters was signed, but a red-headed female bodybuilder who looked like a tank.  \"Harrier Gallagher\" her name read, and you remembered suddenly the day that Nguyen had dragged you to a bodybuilding convention in order to get her autograph.  In your memories even, you had your giant breasts and you also remember the amazing sex that you and Nguyen had that night.  You smile, letting the good feelings from that day rush all over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then you snap back to reality.  That wasn't real.  Or at least, it wasn't from you original timeline.  None of it was.  You look at the RSW and gawk at its raw power.  This thing could be dangerous in the wrong hands.  Your attention is brought back to Nguyen, who is sifting through the bottles and jars of protein supplements littering her desk looking for something.  She finds her diary, a small notebook dressed in hot-pink leather, and dumps it into a backpack.  She grabs a couple of shirts, shirts that you had on more than one occasion worn as pajamas because they were so large on you, and some more pants and short shorts.  It seems her love of showing off her legs transferred over to this reality too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continues to sort through her massive collection of tank tops, you move towards her desk.  On the topmost shelf of the desk are a row of photos, each one depicting a different aspect of Nguyen's life.  The first, on the far left, was her with her family.  You couldn't have pictured a more surreal sight.  Her father, who only stood up to your chin, was dwarfed by his daughter.  Her mother barely came up to Nguyen's hip.  Their daughter's rippled, muscular torso was wider than both of their bodies, and was covered by next to nothing as she was wearing her glittery, turquoise competition bikini.  Her veiny biceps, at the time only 19\", complemented her perfectly rounded shoulders and massive traps.  Her lats looked like wings that ran down her body and lead to quads so wide Nguyen often complained of chafing.  In the back of your mind, you thought, \"And now they're only bigger\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo boot, Nguyen had four older brothers all of whom stood around the family with a thumbs up sign.  Nguyen had just won a bodybuilding competition and her smile was from ear to ear, her pearly whites blazing past the tanned skin.  Each of her brothers were around your height or just a little bit taller than you.  None of them were as tall as Nguyen.  Nor were they anywhere near as muscular.  As you tried to access your memories about Nguyen's family, you found that one of her brothers was indeed a professional bodybuilder.  But it was actually Nguyen who got him into it.  Her efforts in the gym inspired him, and while he wasn't as big as his little sister, that didn't mean he was a pipsqueak.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of pipsqueak, just to the right of the picture of her family was a picture of Nguyen when she was just a child.  Even then she was tall for her age, but skinny as a stick.  The muscular behemoth that she would become didn't start until the beginning of high school when she first fell in love with football.  It was there that she began weight training, and realizing how quickly she could put on muscle.  These memories flooded your mind, including how she had first met Roger, your best friend.  In fact, she had been the backup tackle their freshman year and convinced him that despite his feminine figure he could play football too.  Roger showed a real talent for football, eventually becoming an All-American quarterback and had lots of college prospects before his back failed him.  It was through their mutual love of football that Nguyen and Roger had initially bonded, and it was through Roger that Robert had met Nguyen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of these memories were colliding together, and taking you for a wild trip down memory lane.  You tried to focus, regaining your foothold on what was going on in the present.  But then your eyes moved further to the right and you saw a picture of Nguyen and you at a carnival.  It was your first anniversary together as a couple, during your junior year in high school.  She was packing on muscle extremely fast that year, and was still shy about it.  She was only a little taller than you, not the towering figure she was now, and wearing a thick sweater over her magnificent muscles.  You on the other hand had blossomed quite a bit your junior year.  Your breasts were enormous, only a cup size or two smaller than what they were now.  And unlike Nguyen, you were extremely proud of them.  You had been teased, sure, but eventually your smarts won out over your bullies and everyone accepted you for who you were.  This acceptance gave you the confidence to expose the girls and in the picture you were wearing a deep v-neck t-shirt that was a bright red and a jacket that when zipped up only pushed your breasts together even more.  That was also the year you were trying to grow a beard, and you've regretted that decision every day of your life.  Nguyen was holding a small stuff animal you had won for her at a ring-tossing game, and you were holding a giant stuffed animal she had won at the high striker game.  She had even broken the mallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the last picture was one of Nguyen with her girlfriends.  There were three main girls that she spent most of her time with.  Tiffany, whose long, blonde hair and perky butt you had always admired.  Rose, who had raven hair and was extremely tall, almost as tall as Nguyen, and was someone you thought might not like you.  And finally Amber, who was a feisty Latina brunette that trained with Nguyen.  She had muscles, and on her 5'5\" frame, they looked just as bulging as Nguyen's.  All three girls were dressed to go out, and Nguyen's abs were peeking through her one-shoulder, hip-length bright blue dress.  Tiffany's butt looked like a shelf in her little black dress, while Rose towered over even Nguyen in her favorite stiletto heels.  You stared at all of them, your mind's eye resting on Nguyen.  That night was the first night she had gotten drunk in college.  Her massive physique required her to take 27 shots of liquor, three pints of beer, and a half bottle of vodka before she finally blacked out.  It was left up to you that night to take care of her, and you barely made it up to your dorm with her heavy body leaning to and fro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm ready,\" Nguyen called out, her voice bringing you back to reality.  The memories from all of those pictures flitted to the dark corners of your mind, but now that they were there, they were permanent.  They hadn't replaced your old memories of what had gone on before the Watch.  But they certainly complicated things.  Slinging the backpack over her massive shoulders, Nguyen then took the still limp Roger in her arms again and led the way out of the room.</span></div></div>",

Then you see Nguyen's car and your so shocked you laugh a little.  It was a bright pink truck, with wheels almost half of your height and a menacing grill.  \"Um,\" you say before shutting your mouth at Nguyen's glare.  She was seriously pissed at you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb into the front seat and see the odd mix of girly and masculine your girlfriend had become.  Hanging from the rearview mirror was a cute little figurine of an anime kitty, it's blue skin shining in the fluorescent light of the parking garage.  Also hanging from the mirror was a gold chain at the end of which was a flexing, hypermuscular woman.  Digging deep into your memory banks, you remembered that this was from the last time she competed, a pendant recognizing her achievements.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNguyen opened the back of the car and dumped Roger's limp body in the back, next to the half-opened duffel bag filled with her gym clothes.  You tossed your own duffel bag in the back, and she placed hers next to yours.  Opening the driver's side door, she stepped onto the car's foot platform which caused the car to shift significantly towards her side.  You had no idea how much she weighed, but 200 pounds was probably lowballing it.  And asking her would probably mean you'd have no balls by the end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" she said when she closed the door and readjusted the seat.  Even sitting down she towered over you.  \"How are we getting to Joshua Tree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got it,\" you say, pointing to your phone.  You buckle up, letting the seatbelt strap nestle itself between the mounds of flesh protruding from your chest.  You started to get an erection, staring at the clear demarcation between your breasts and the emphasis it made on your cleavage.  You focus on getting directions to Joshua Tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nguyen backs out of the parking space, you both hear screeching tires and yelling.  It was...</span></div></div>",

Two black cars barreled down on you, and Nguyen freaks out.  \"What do I do?\" she screams, turning to you.  Her frame is so massive she's blocking the driver's side window, where you would have had the best view of the oncoming cars.  But you don't panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just drive!\" you command her, and she does so.  Jamming the car into \"Drive\", she drives away from the oncoming cars and further into the parking garage.  \"Shit, I didn't mean deeper underground!\" you yell, grabbing at the door handle for support.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what did you expect?!  They came from the exit!\" Nguyen shouted.  The veins in her arms were bulging, each defined muscle working extra hard against her taut skin.  It was magical, exhilarating, a powerful aphrodisiac.  You really wanted to have sex with her then.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead you were brought back out of your reverie by her pleas for help.  Immediately,you turn to the watch, speak into it and wait for the tell-tale beep.  You had just...</span></div></div>",

You grab onto the doorhandle and close your eyes, trying not to scream out loud in fright.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreeching tires.  Shouting.  Nguyen cursing like a sailor.  You open your eyes and see that somehow, magically almost, you had made it out of the garage.  \"We did it!\" you shout.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet!\" Nguyen screamed back.  The two SUVs came bursting out the garage, like panthers on the hunt.  One went north, the other south and right on Nguyen's tail.  \"They're going to box us in,\" Nguyen said aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just do!  Can't you get us to Joshua Tree another way?\" she shouts, looking at you.  Her eyes are drawn to your chest, and suddenly you feel self-conscious.  But her anger came back, full force.  \"Use that stupid watch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about teleporting to Joshua Tree.  But when you do, two hours later you'll probably be teleported right back to where you are.  And if you do teleport to Joshua Tree, you don't want to use the permanent swap on that kind of situation because what if you could never leave Joshua Tree?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a bright idea hits you on the head.  You slam the watch to your mouth, and shout, \"I wish Nguyen's car could fly!\"  Suddenly, Nguyen is launched back into her seat and so are you.  The heavy mounds of flesh on your chest press against you, and it's both pleasurable and a little painful.  Nguyen reaches over to grab your hand, and you can feel the calluses from years of working out in the gym.  Her hand dwarfed yours, and you felt secure, comfortable, at peace in that moment.  \"Holy crap,\" you thought, amazed that this situation, ludicrous as it was, somehow made your relationship stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the car petered out of its launch and became level again.  \"Cool, I have a flying car now,\" Nguyen said.  You look around and see that the car's interior had changed.  There were funny knobs everywhere, and loads of meters that tracked things like altitude and fuel level.  You access your new memories and find out that Nguyen's dad was an engineer extraordinaire - a far cry from his original reality of being a stay at home dad.  He had worked on creating a new type of flight engine that could be modified to fit consumer vehicles.  Nguyen's pink truck was a prototype that was soon going to market.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nguyen,\" you start, but are cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I just did the whole memory thing too.  Thanks for the temporary boost in my dad's career.\"  She didn't seem sarcastic about that at all.  In fact, she seemed to be warming up to you.  You took it as a good sign, and thought you should maybe press your advantage.  After all, you were still kind of aroused from watching Nguyen drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, you can put this thing in auto-pilot?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Nguyen flipped a few knobs, entered the name Joshua Tree in the new computer system installed on the truck, and then turned to you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Staring at you for a while, as if she was mulling over her next steps, you feel incredibly naked.  Here was someone you genuinely loved, who had made you so happy, and now you're changing her entire life.  Everything that she had done for the past five years was being trashed, and it was all your fault.  \"Nguyen?\" you ask tepidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I use to look like?\" she asks, teeth clenched.  She was doing a really good job of controlling her temper.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned by her question, you do the only thing you can think of.  You pull the watch up to your mouth instinctively, hit the local button and say, \"Nguyen looks like her old self.\"  For some reason, the watch beeps three times and turns green.  What? you wonder.  Why didn't this work for Roger? you ask.  The watch either had a mind of it own, deciding what you could and couldn't do...or there were more rules than just the ones your dad told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was the least of your worries.  Nguyen was shrinking right before your eyes, and her muscles were very rapidly deflating.  \"What the fuck!\" she yelled.  Finally stopping at five feet, a full fourteen inches shorter than what she used to be, she looked up at you.  Then she felt her arms, which were basically sticks now, and her breasts which had also deflated.  \"This is what I used to look like?\" she asked, exasperated.  She couldn't believe it.  Neither could you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly looked at the watch.  Nguyen had two hours like this before she could change back.  \"Kinda strange, huh?\" you try to say, shrugging your shoulders.  You hop off the bed and walk up to her.  She was now shorter than you again, which was comforting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange?  I've never had to look up to you in my life.  I can barely see your face past your enormous boobs.\" Nguyen pushed your boobs away, squishing them a little so she could see your face.  The tingling that went up your spine was wonderful.  You barely contained your moan, and your knees quickly became weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not touch them like that,\" you said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not trying to turn you on, Rog.\"  Nguyen then slapped you.  Hard.  Thank God she waited till she was a little smaller, you think to yourself.  But it still hurt.  \"That's for changing my life.  And this,\" she slapped you again, \"Is for doing it without my permission.  You bastard.\"  Then she turned around, crossing her arms.  She felt them again, and tried to flex.  Nothing went up, not even a tiny mole-sized hill of a bicep.  She lifted up her shirt to try and find abs, but only found the soft little pudge she had always carried.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting her shirt back down, she turned around to you.  Tears were in her eyes, but she quickly wiped them away.  \"I hate you so much right now, but-\" and at that but, hope filled you up like a flood.  Maybe she would forgive you?  \"But I'm so happy you changed me.\"  She walks up to you, and buries her head in your breasts as she hugs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was probably the best hug you had ever received ever.  Nguyen's head buried in your breasts, wrapping her arms around you, somewhat forgiving you.  You couldn't have asked for a better ending.  \"So,\" she said, pulling away from you, \"Will I go back to being muscular and tall after two hours?  Or, because you changed me back to my original body am I stuck like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, actually,\" you smile sheepishly, \"There's a button on the watch.  It's called the permanent button-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's ominous,\" she quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, and with the watch under these sandbags,\" you lifted them up and let them fall again.  You giggled a little internally as Nguyen's eyes watched them bounce, \"They accidentally pressed the permanent button.  While you were in your super tall, muscular state.  So after two hours, you'll be big and muscular and it'll be a permanent reality change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge smile rent its way across Nguyen's face.  It looked like it would crack her face in half.  \"Oh thank god!  I can't imagine being smaller than you!\" she got up on her tiptoes and tried to kiss you, but still couldn't reach.  You bent down and let her kiss your cheek, but then she whispered, \"You're still going to have to pay later.\"  You shudder at the thought.</span></div></div>",

We don't know when we're coming back right?  I mean, after all, it's the government you're running away from.\"  Nguyen sat down and crossed her legs, still in shock at the lack of size of everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPondering your situation for a moment, you get a brilliant idea.  \"I'll give myself muscles so we can carry Rog to his room and get out of here!  And I'll make it so that my card works on his door.  Bingo!\"  You press the watch against your lips, hit the local button and say the words.  It beeps six times, for the two wishes, and suddenly your biceps bulge forth almost as big as Nguyen's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're almost as big as me,\" she said, repeating the words inside your head.  You grin, and flex a little.  Then you use your new pecs to flex your boobs up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like the show?\" you ask, laughing to yourself at Nguyen's mesmerized stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You betchya,\" she said absent-mindedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, your phone rings.  You pick it up, and it's your dad.  \"Oh my god!  It's my dad!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, answer it!\" Nguyen said, standing up and rushing over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad?\" you ask tepidly.  \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have one minute before the line isn't secure.  Are you safe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then come to Joshua Tree.  I'll send you something to put in your phone.  Head over immediately.  And bring whoever it is you affected with your permanent reality shift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, how do you know-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son, just do it.  Now.\"  Your dad hung up, and now you were more confused than ever.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNguyen put her hand on your chest, gently comforting you. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug, \"He wants us to meet him at Joshua Tree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes bulged wide, \"But that's like an hour and a half away.  My house is 45 minutes from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew all of this, and couldn't quite figure out what to do.  Why did your father want you to go to Joshua Tree?  What was the point of that? \"Oh my god,\" Nguyen burst out.  She looked up at you, \"What if that wasn't your dad?\"  The idea hits you too, like a truck, and you sit down to contemplate your next move.</span></div></div>",

If it was a trap, you'd be captured and probably sent to some underground facility where you'll never be able to leave.  And then Roger would probably be imprisoned, because he injured those three agents.  And Nguyen!  Nguyen would have her entire life ruined because of a few dumb mistakes you made.  \"Damn!\" you put your head in your hands, ruffling up your hair in distress.  You caught sight of your new biceps and grinned sheepishly for a moment.  You could get used to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back to reality Rob!\" Nguyen shouted at you, snapping her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" you say, getting up more determined than ever.  \"Joshua Tree could be a trap.  Actually, it probably is a trap.  So let's go to your house, stay there, lay low, and then try and make our way to my house when things have died down.  How's that sound?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sound good to me.\"  Nguyen walked up to you and stood on her tiptoes, pecking your lips with an affectionate kiss.  \"Wow, I'm going to have to get used to that,\" she said, not without a hint of amusement.  But before she left, you grabbed her with your now much stronger arms and clutched her close to your body.  Squeezing her as gently as possible, you pressed your lips against hers and made sure she felt how grateful you were.  Here she was, her entire life having been turned upside down twice by your watch, and she still loved and supported you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments of making out quickly led, however, to Nguyen's wandering hands groping your breasts.  Despite how feminine you felt with the two giant globes of flesh dangling from your chest, supported by a frilly bra, you couldn't deny the waves of pleasure coursing through your body at that moment.  You could definitely get used to it.  As she continued to grope your breasts expertly, your nipples hardened.  Noticing this, Nguyen soon pinched them lightly with her fingers, twisting them and sending news sensations down your body to your knees.  You had no idea what to do.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a gasp echoed in the room.  But it wasn't you and it wasn't Nguyen either.  \"What the?\" you ask, quickly letting go of Nguyen and turning around.  Roger had finally come to, and was gasping for breath as if he had been underwater the entire time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNguyen immediately rushed over to him, trying to calm him down and relax him.  \"Are you okay?  Roger, Roger what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rush over too, and Roger, already freaking out from whatever it was that just happened to him, started to hyperventilate more after seeing you.  \"Oh, he's having a panic attack.  Here,\" you rummage through a few drawers next to your desk and find a paper bag.  You give it to him and he immediately begins breathing into it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's he freaking out about?\" Nguyen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably that I've changed again.\" You say nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again?\" Nguyen asks, astonished.  And that's when you realized you had made a huge mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, well, it's not important right now,\" you try and brush it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Nguyen wasn't about to let it go.  \"What do you mean, changed again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger interrupted her, \"He gave himself boobs,\" before returning to the paper bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWincing, you take a peek at Nguyen, who seems to be laughing.  Uproariously.  \"What?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those weren't there before?\" she asked, stifling her laughter.  \"Why did you do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just curious!  Now come on, let's focus.  Roger, what happened?  You were out for a long time man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know!\" he said, having finally calmed down.  \"I was reliving my life!  I know everything now!  Everything about what happened to me.  It's like,\" he made an explosion gesture around his head, like his brain was exploding, \"two parallel worlds are inside my head man!  I know everything from one life and everything from another!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" Nguyen as confused.  She hadn't known Roger before he looked like a blonde bombshell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, does she know?  Wait!  You're normal!\"  Roger looked her up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNguyen shook her head, \"No, I'm not normal.  I'm what was normal to you guys.  And yeah, I do know what this jerk did to me. But,\" and she turned to you and winked, \"I'm grateful.  Because this body,\" she pinched the flab around her abdomen, \"Kind of sucks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got lucky,\" Roger mouthed to you.  You waved him off, not bothering with replying.  \"Listen, we can catch up on all of this later.  Let's get downstairs and start heading towards Nguyen's house.  We've already spent too much time here.  If the government is any good, they're probably waiting just outside the door.\"  Nguyen nods, and so does Roger.  All three of you get up, and before you head out the door, you give Roger back his gun. \"Just in case,\" you say, eyeing him warily.</span></div></div>",

Inhaling sharply you pull your sleeve down to cover the watch before attempting to project an air of casualness as you glance toward Roger and say \u201cSo where did you guys wanna get food at?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger was currently staring at the men as one looked directly at the three of you your question finally got his attention as Nguyen gave a slight shove to Roger\u2019s arm and he looked away from the man then began stuttering in response. Nguyen sensing a problem looked around noticing the man that was now staring at the three of you suspiciously; an idea quickly formed and she said \u201cOh my god, were you checking him out?\u201d in a loud whisper. This caught both Roger and I off guard as I stifled a snicker and he was trying to figure out how to say no so that Nguyen would believe him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain the stuttering ensued but now there was a deep crimson blush on Roger\u2019s cheeks. It was too hard to bare, I began laughing as we walked and Nugyen was smile proud of her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, the man smiled at Roger causing him to shut up and look down as we passed by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we got out of the door we began to make our way to the parking lot where Nguyen left her car. As we walked down the sidewalk I said, \u201cwe need to be more careful, next time they will probably recognize us. This was just a fluke that it happened once.\u201d They mumbled in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally nearing the parking lot Nugyen pulled out her keys and began looking for her car, she began searching for her car in all her parking spots. A confused look crossed her face as she pressed the unlock button on her key. Nearby a small black car beeped in response. Again she pressed the unlock button looking dumfounded at compact car; and once again it beeped happily at her. As Robert and Roger moved towards the car Robert noticed Nugyen still standing staring at the car in disbelief. Robert walked up to her and said, \u201cWe found your car what\u2019s the problem?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Robert then said in a sad tone \u201cwhere is my truck?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d was his response with a hint of bemusement in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said \u201cI had a nice big black truck, it was a requirement for my\u2026size. But now I have this compact clown car. Why did this have to change?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger peaked out of the back of the car and said \u201cenough stalling lets get out while we still can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deep sigh Nugyen and I got into the car and began driving off towards her house.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you make your way through the stadium, you notice a few shady characters mulling about. You wonder what they want, and why they're all wearing the same trenchcoat. But once you enter the underground area of the stadium where the locker rooms are, you put them to the back of your mind. The only thing you were thinking about now was how Nguyen would react to your new, heaving breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally reached the girl's locker room, and patiently waited outside for Nguyen to come out. You could hear the cries of celebration inside, and smiled gratefully that at least she'll be in a good mood. One by one the girls came out of the locker room, dressed in their professional, non-playing uniforms. Blue polos with the school's crest, and tight khaki short shorts that hugged each girl's beautiful bubble butt. Just looking at these girls didn't give you a boner, you weren't that horny, but you did feel something strange from your chest. You looked down and saw a tiny bulge where your nipples should be. \"Omg!\" you thought to yourself, \"My nipples are getting hard because of these girls!\" You were surprised, and a little curious, as to how big your nipples actually were that they were poking through your bra and t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what surprised you even more were the tennis players' reactions to your new body. Where before you had just been one of those, \"Oh hey, he's not ugly at least\" kind of guys, with your new assets you were getting stares directly at your chest. You knew you having giant breasts as a guy was normal. That was the whole point of the watch. But you didn't expect that these girls would actually think you were attractive because of them. At one point, you actually had to shout at a girl for staring at your chest for too long. It was both really weird and really exciting to be objectified like this. You kinda liked it.</span></div></div>",

She was at least 6'3\", maybe 6'4\". She had long, luxurious black hair that floated on down to her broad back. Two of you, standing next to each other, would cover her back. And as she turned to say goodbye to some of her friends, you could see her giant butt stretching the fabric of her khaki shorts to their absolute breaking point. Her butt extended at least five inches past her lower back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she turned around, you couldn't help but gawk. Her breasts were big. Not as big as yours, not by a longshot. But the shelf of pectoral muscles that now existed on her frame made them a lot perkier. But those were nothing compared to her mammoth biceps. You had only seen biceps like that on bodybuilders...male ones. \"Hey honey!\" Nguyen said, walking over to you and grasping you in a bear hug. Her forearms were the size of your legs, and pulled you in tight. She wrapped her beefy hands around you, bringing you into a comforting embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour breasts squished against her rockhard abs, giving you a wonderfully filling sensation. You never wanted the hug to end. And the best part was that your face was buried in her breasts. You were once much taller than her. Now you are the perfect height to nuzzle yourself into her perky chest. \"Hey baby,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles down at you, and then her eyes immediately snap towards your chest. \"So how are Larry and Jerry today?\" she asks, poking at them a little. You couldn't believe it. She had named your breasts. And unlike most breasts, because you were male they had male names. You look down at \"Larry\" and \"Jerry\" and then smile back up at Nguyen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're doing amazing.\"</span></div></div>",

You follow silently, looking behind you to make sure that no one was there to follow you two inside. Once past the door, you are immediately grabbed by Nguyen and locked into a passionate kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was surreal, being kissed by your girlfriend who only a half hour ago was half a foot shorter than you. Now she was half a foot taller, with muscles large enough to give her immense strength. She was using that now to hold you up, your feet off the ground and face level with hers as you two made out in the middle of the girl's locker room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou passionately returned the kiss, making sure to wrap your arms around her neck. Once you had grabbed on, you also wrapped your legs around her waist. This let her carry you through the locker room, towards a more private area away from any lingering players or her coach. As she pushed you up against a wall, her hands began creeping up your blouse, making their way towards your bra. Just the hint of her hands, now much larger than your own, near your breasts made you hard. It was exhilarating, being stimulated from so many angles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon your clothes were off, and things were heating up.</span></div></div>",

You noticed that not all of the girls in the crowd had longer hair, and you realised with the wording of your wish, the women could probably control the length of their hair with their minds as well. The tennis match was moving at a much faster pace, the hair moving so fast, it was a blur, blocking and smashing the ball. Nguyen was still a very good tennis player, even with this new adjustment to reality, and managed to gain a comfortable lead, and finally win the game. Waiting outside her changing room after the match, she came out, her hair whipped out, and pulled you into a kiss, as she wrapped both her arms and her hair around you.

Ready to be our first naked pregnant model?\" Mrs Tarken said joyfully, her yellowing teeth glistening. \" Um sure, remind me, will you be in there?\" Rachel awkwardly asked the feeble old woman.<br>\r\n\"Why yes! I have done this for thirty years\" she said holding up a piece of work of her from the 80s. \" as you can see I was a very curvaceous woman back then, even with my short 4'9 stature!\" This was Rachel's chance! She wouldn't have to puke at the sight of, well, not even he writer can mention it on a website like this. With a quick wish Mrs Tarken was now transformes into Miss boodi'er. The now 26 year old woman sat in a bathrobe ready to show some elegant and lustisous curves. \"You ready?\" The young woman asked.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Your name is Robert Dansbury.  You're 18 and you've just started college.  A few weeks after your parents dropped you off at school, you find a mysterious package in your mailbox.  It's from your father and includes a note telling you that he's disappeared, and to keep the Reality Shift Watch (RSW) a secret.  Apparently a government organization is pursuing him, and he leaves the watch in your care to keep it safe.  In the note is also an explanation of its powers:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Allows you to change the way everyone sees reality on a global or local scale.  For example: you decide to give yourself breasts.  If you change reality on a global scale, all men in the world grow breasts and that's the way it has always been.  If you change reality on a local scale, only you grow breasts but no one thinks it is abnormal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. The watch can create whole new stories and events in reality to account for the changes you make.  For example: you decide to make a woman hyper-intelligent on a global scale.  This makes all women in the world hyper-intelligent, thus forcing the watch to make them the dominant gender, ie all Presidents are women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. The watch's powers last only for two hours, unless you hit the Permanent button.  If you do, all of the changes you have made are then the default settings of reality.  If you make new changes, they'll only last for two hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. If you tell someone about the watch's power, they become immune to its effects and will know how reality shifts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Robert Dansbury: 5'9\" average guy, with slightly muscular build and good looks.  Brown hair, green eyes, he's in college with a major in biochemistry.  He loves adventure, and has always harbored a secret love for gender bending fantasies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Mark Dansbury: Robert's father, 6'3\", very muscular man, 51 years old and with a full head of brown hair.  Blue eyes and devilish good looks, Mark is a research scientists who develops the RSW.  He disappears at the beginning of the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Nguyen Minh-Ho: Robert's girlfriend, 5'0\", petite Vietnamese girl with a spunky attitude.  18 years old, same as Robert, she is also attending the same university as he is.  She is one of the first to be affected by the RSW.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Roger Platts: Robert's best friend, 6'0\", red hair and freckles with a gangly build.  He lives in the same building as Robert does and is always helping him out in his adventures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease remember to keep it:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-PG-13.  Sex is allowed, but nothing explicit and don't go into the nitty gritty details.<br>\r\n-Please advance the story!  It's okay to have it come to an end, but make sure there are plenty of transformations in the meantime.<br>\r\n-Don't let Robert die.  Others can die, but he should stay alive.<br>\r\n-Have fun!  Go wild with the swaps and reality changes, think of anything you want!</td>",
