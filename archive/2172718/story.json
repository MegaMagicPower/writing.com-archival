Considering Millie was an incredibly muscular futa, that put horses to shame. Which came with it's own problems, Millie came over to me with her normal shy smile \"Having trouble, Aaron?\" she asked gently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This prestige ten asshole just destroyed me!\" I complained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, I might know something about that.\" Millie waved her muscle packed arm, showing a game controller in her hand<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was you!?\" I complained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... the company sponsored a weekly livestream.\" Millie sheepishly admitted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figures.\" I slumped in my dirty bed, Millie came over, her absurdly endowed package hanging between her knees already letting me know she was entering my line of sight<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... it's been a couple months. I was wondering if I could... help you find a girlfriend?\" Millie smiled nervously<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen entered my main contention with, Millie oh sure Millie herself was as sweet a can be, she never raised an oddly dainty hand surrounded by muscle against me, she'd been caring of not doting on me my whole life. With only one problem<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD IT'S MILLIE!!!\" Soon enough all the women on the street ran from whatever they were doing right to Millie begging for her attention, it was no secret she had the stamina of a freight train, if anybody had a chance to get with Millie they'd go across the world for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-that's very sweet of all of you... but have you met my cool brother, Aaron?\" Millie sheepishly gestured to me<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd of women looked at me in mild confuse before turning right back to Millie, on her own Millie kept a persona of charisma, but for years she was well aware that she'd been indirectly cucking me, and the few times I could get a girlfriend they'd either drop me as soon as they heard about Millie, or worse they would only date me to get close to Millie. feeling sorry for it she'd tried time and time again to set me up. Until it came to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Millie can we please go?\" I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody's making you stay here, bitch!\" Someone yelled at me from the crowd<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey now everybody. Just give Aaron a chance huh? He's a nice guy I mean it!\" Millie said nervously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone kill me...\" I groaned</span></div></div>",

Andy staring forward as Scott glared at him, too enraged to think about the icepack he held to his jaw. The two were chewed out for what happened and they went off home. Andy to do whatever he was to do but Scott was too enraptured with vengeance to rest. Making his way to his attic he found a chest of old family belongings from generations ago, the one that caught his eye was a spell book. Looking through it he found one that interested him \u201cBody swap. The caster can trade consciousness with the victim of the spell.\u201d the description read. \u201cYeah there\u2019s something I can do with this.\u201d Scott\u2019s scheme had struck inspiration, he didn\u2019t know yet but his malice was overwhelmed by his creativity in that moment <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wicked smile crossed his face \u201cI can turn into a cheerleader and tell everybody he\u2019s got mono!\u201d Scott put himself on the back but it felt hollow \u201cNo-no no. I can turn into Crabtree the science teacher and throw out his midterm and give him an F!\u201d Scott\u2019s guile waned, not being a science buff himself, he doubted he could pull that off \u201cGotta be someone that can hurt him... someone he can\u2019t escape...\u201d Scott\u2019s dark heart beat new blood of evil \u201cI\u2019ll be his mom...\u201d No question about it, after Andy\u2019s explosion today Scott could think of no one better to twist the knife in Andy\u2019s heart than his own mother. Scott had his goal set. it wasn\u2019t too hard to assemble the components of the spell. Scott had finished with just enough time to not finish his homework. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe locked the book back in the chest and went to bed. His mind filled with wicked glee. When he woke up he was in a strange bed. Looking himself over he picked the perfect target, he\u2019d never seen Andy\u2019s mom before but seeing her tanned skin covering her admirable muscles, she looked like she was keeping fit, her deltoids standing out from the biceps, and she was actually taller than Scott at an amazing six foot five. Scott got dressed and went to the kitchen finding Andy eating a bowl of cereal. \u201cSup, Shit?\u201d Scott remarked knocking Andy\u2019s bowl away <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy didn\u2019t respond. Scott was surprised by his inaction. Scott put his arms down on the table \u201cAnything happened at school yesterday?\u201d She asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly Andy put his hand on his cheek and elbow on the table \u201cNope.\u201d Andy replied <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott was getting mad \u201cYeah? Didn\u2019t get into a fight or anything?\u201d Scott asked arching over Andy with a smug smirk <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d Andy asked disinterested, Scott slapped him <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott stood back and pointed at Andy accusingly with an indignant look on his face \u201cThat\u2019s some way to talk to your mother, you little bastard!\u201d Scott\u2019s confidence returned seeing Andy\u2019s shocked expression <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott put his hand on the wide almost muscular hips of his new body with a grin \u201cYeah your mom\u2019s not so slow is she? I heard all about you getting in a fight with Scott! Now I\u2019m gonna punish you!\u201d Scott said wickedly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not my mom.\u201d Andy replied <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott feign outrage \u201cHow dare you! To say such an awful thing to my face! You ungrateful-\u201d Before Scott to go on Andy grabbed him by the stomach, Scott was too shocked by this to react, Andy using the surprise and moment he slammed Scott into the wall by a wall of drawers  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy had an animalistic look in his eyes \u201cMy mom is too vile to even speak to me like that, and I know damn well she doesn\u2019t know shit about my school life. She also doesn\u2019t waste time slapping me. When she\u2019s mad she uses what she keep\u2019s in this drawer.\u201d Andy said putting one hand over a drawer with a heartless eye trained on Scott \u201cMy real mom know\u2019s what\u2019s in it to.\u201d Andy started panting <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott was overwhelmed, he never saw this intensity from Andy. He managed to break away from Andy\u2019s hold and get a few steps away before pointing at him \u201cJ-just a minute here! You can\u2019t talk to me like that!\u201d Scott said desperately but Andy just laughed a bitter laugh <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTalk? My mother doesn\u2019t TALK!\u201d Andy threw open the draw, still starring at Scott, even with his back turned to it, Andy could still expertly pull out a file \u201cShe just rake\u2019s this god damn WOOD FILE ACROSS MY FUCKING BACK!!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe FUCK!? FUCK! Andy that is FUCKED!\u201d Scott said backing away <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYES IT IS!!! AND MY FUCKING MOTHER WOULDN\u2019T BE SO FUCKING SCARED!!! NOW YOU\u2019RE GONNA TELL ME WHO THE FUCK YOU REALLY ARE BEFORE I TAKE SOME MUCH-NEEDED REVENGE ON THE CUNT YOUR INSIDE!!!\u201d Andy\u2019s teeth grinded with fury holding the wood file in his hand <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScott! Scott! it\u2019s me Scott! Scott from school! Christ! What kind of horror show is this shit!?\u201d Scott asked backing into a chair, his legs shaking, as he watched the animal Andy had become gradually settle <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Andy asked only slightly aggravated <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCause-cause I was trying to get back at you for yesterday, seeing you get so upset when I talked shit about your mom I\u2019d think I coulda done something to you but... shit... this is just fucked...\u201d Scott exhaled looking around the house, looking at Andy to make sure he didn\u2019t try anything. But before anything else Andy just took the bowl from Scott\u2019s side of the table and dragged it back to his and resumed eating <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott was shocked by this \u201cYou don\u2019t... have ANY questions? Now how I become your mom? If this is permanent? If I plan to send you to military school? Nothing?\u201d Scott asked unable to process what was happening in front of him <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t care less.\u201d Andy said between bites  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Scott was feeling rather naked, like a burglar who arrived at as house with even the foundation had been stolen \u201cIs-is the computer password protected?\u201d Scott asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Andy replied <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t a comfort to see or even now be in the body of the true source of Andy\u2019s dour mannerisms. Scott went to the computer, did a quick search and wrote down a number and went to the phone \u201cI\u2019m calling the school, you should stay home today.\u201d Scott said cautiously, looking at Andy scanning him for any kind of reaction <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Scott managed to force Andy \u201cWhat for?\u201d he asked, he seemed annoyed, Scott couldn\u2019t tell if Andy really did want to go to school or he was just world weary, nevertheless Scott proceeded <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I mean I can\u2019t send you off with all this stuff needs doing.\u201d Scott explained confidently <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a dull sigh Andy turned to Scott and asked \u201cLike what?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott simply gestured to either side of him \u201cAll of this, first of all I\u2019m throwing out all the stuff your mom used to abuse you, and I-I don\u2019t know. Take you to a movie? Does your dad live with you?\u201d Scott asked still feeling overwhelmed by all the baggage that went with this stranger\u2019s shoes <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy just looked back at his cereal \u201cI think I\u2019d rather you go back to trying to ruin my life. It was less annoying.\u201d Andy remarked <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott went over to Andy putting one arm on the table and raising the other as if he was giving a pitch to a customer \u201cC-come on! You\u2019ve got to want more than this!\u201d Scott argued only a little offended that Andy turned his nose up to Scott\u2019s goodwill <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to school.\u201d Andy said getting up from the table, Scott lunged, grabbing Andy from behind, holding him to Scott\u2019s body <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! I\u2019m serious! You\u2019ve got issues and I\u2019m trying to help you!\u201d Scott said, hoping to get through to Andy <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJUST SNAP MY FUCKING NECK THEN!!!\u201d Andy didn\u2019t look up at Scott, Scott could feel Andy\u2019s body jump ten degrees in heat as he started breathing hard again, Scott could feel it against his arm \u201cI\u2019m not some piss baby sad sack looking for somebody to save me from my wicked Mommy! I\u2019m tired of this shit and I just want to get it over with! I don\u2019t care.\u201d Andy explained, his breathing returning to normal <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you need a therapist.\u201d Scott meekly tried to joke <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t be any different from three I had after my \u201caccidents\u201d where I mysteriously broke my arms on some playground that didn\u2019t fucking exist.\u201d Andy said coldly <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott gulped, feeling bad for mocking Andy, he couldn\u2019t have imagined it was his mother breaking his arm, breaking the left one twice no less. \u201cLook... I don\u2019t know how to reverse this... not right now. So... why don\u2019t we make the most out of this? I-I don\u2019t want to hurt you anymore. You don\u2019t deserve that. Why not just try it? You might like it?\u201d Scott asked letting go of Andy and keeping the same nervous smile <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy looked back at Scott he groaned \u201cFuck it, do whatever you want.\u201d Andy said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Scott jumped pumping a fist in the air, he landed and his boobs jiggled, he gave Andy an embarrassed smile and coughed \u201cYeah um... you know where your mom keeps her bras?\u201d Scott asked red faced rubbing the back of his head </span></div></div>",
