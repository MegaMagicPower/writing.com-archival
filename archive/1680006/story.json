            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One Friday afternoon, Sonic had been strolling down the streets of Station Square and came across a shop called Merlin's Magical Merchandise. Out of curiosity, he decided to go in. It looked like your typical magician shop filled with magic kits for your standard magic tricks run by an old man with a long white beard. Though there were some things that seemed pretty weird like actual spell books that claim to be legit, and odd medallions and vials of liquid, which probably have magical properties. However, there was one item that caught his attention the most, a board game. A board game simply called Modification. Sonic had this weird feeling and urge to buy it like the game was wanting him to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic then grabbed the game, and went to the counter to purchase it. \"I like to buy this, pls.\" Sonic said as he gave money to the old man. \"Ah, a really good game choice. You won't be disappointed.\" the owner said while handing him the game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Sonic headed back home and decided to some phone calls to invite friends over to play his new game. He called over Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Cream, and Rouge, and fortunately, they had nothing better to do so they accepted invitation. The guests had around 3PM, and Sonic had set up the board game in his living room for them to see. They made themselves at home and ate snacks and drank some juice. After some time, they started to play and they all formed a circle around the board. Everyone then questioned about the game. \"So what kind of game is it?\" asked Tails. \"Well, I don't know, but I thought we could try it out together just for fun.\" Sonic replied. \"Well, just as long it isn't boring or else I could just go and watch TV.\" Knuckles groaned. \"Come one, Knux, a single board game isn't going to kill you.\" retorted Rouge as Knuckles just grumbled. \"So can we play now?\" Amy asked. Then, they all choose their pieces and set them on the START space. Then, all of a sudden a voice came from the game itself. \"Who will start?\" Everyone was in awe about the voice from the game, but they complied to start the game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo who goes first?</span></div></div>",

'Not a bad roll I guess.' he thought to himself. Though he was about to move his game piece, but another amazing thing happened. The game piece started to move all by itself! The game piece then went ahead 6 spaces, just as the number he had rolled. The voice from the board game then spoke up, \"Draw a card.\" Then, Sonic complied by taking a card from the huge stack of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of card  or card category was it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sonic then read aloud what the card he picked said: \"Get in touch with your feminine side. What's does that suppose to mean?\" His answer was about to come soon enough. Sonic then felt a warm sensation spread throughout his entire body. Then changes were happening to him. His arms and legs becoming more slender and took a womanly form. He felt changes in his hands and feet so he took his gloves and shoes off. He was shock to see his hands and feet were becoming smaller with dainty and tiny fingers and toes. His hips widen and waist shrunk, giving him an hourglass figure. His bum inflated as well. He felt his chest inflated as he developed DD cup breasts. He felt a tingling in his crotch as his penis and sack was now replaced with a pair of moist lips. The fur around his crotch and upper inner thighs became peach colored. His face became rounder and smaller, his eye lashes fuller, his nose shrunk to a small black bump, and his green eyes turned into a lighter color. His quills grew longer and flowed downward becoming more hairlike. He developed some small bangs on his forehead that flowed down between his eyes. Finally, his fur immediately turned into a lighter shade of blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic was wide-eyed with terror. He was now a she. \"What-\" she said while stopping in mid sentence to discover that her voice was now higher pitched. Everyone around her were just as terrified and in complete shock as she was. Entirely everyone was speechless. Tails and Knuckles weren't only just shocked, but they also blushed at the sight of the male-turned-female hedgehog in the nude, trying hard to hide their protruding privates coming out of their sacks. Amy felt dizzy and almost fainted that her hero was now a heroine, but Rouge helped her get a hold of herself. Cream was just frightened, and confused about the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic then started to examine herself. Groping her breasts, and fingering her vagina to see how sensitive they were, only erotically moaning as a reflex to it. She then realized that she did it in front of everyone, and blushed in embarrassment. \"Mr., I mean, Ms. Sonic are you okay?\" Cream said. \"I'm fine I guess.\" she replied. \"Wow, Sonic. You're hot!\" Knuckles spoke up. Sonic then turned her eye to Knuckles about to respond to him, but stopped to think. 'Knuckles looks so totally hot and handsome! Wait! What did I just do?' Sonic thought, realizing that her feminine mind was starting take over. Sonic just shook her head at the thought, and decided enough was enough. \"Okay, I like to become normal now.\" The board game then spoke up. \"Transformations can not be reversed until the game is finished.\" Sonic just pouted and started to threaten the game. \"Change me back now or I'm quitting!\" \"If you quit, there will be severe consequences. Even to those who haven't been changed yet. However, you can have 10 to 30 minute breaks during the game, but take any longer i would declare you as a quitter.\" the game replied with a stern voice. Sonic just hung her head low in defeat. \"Fine, I'll stay in the game.\" Everyone was equally upset since they can not back down from the game now. \"Sonic, can you cover yourself up first before we can continue the game?\" Rouge said. Sonic agreed and headed to the bathroom and came back with a towel wrapped around her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic: \"Okay, who goes next?\"</span></div></div>",

He then took the dice and rolled them, ending up with a 4. 'Great, just my luck.' Knuckles thought with annoyance. His game piece started to move 4 spaces. \"Draw a card.\" the voice from the game boomed. Knuckles complied, and read his card aloud. \"Have you been working out? What the heck does that supposed to mean?\" Knuckles said with confusion and a slight bit of anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then felt a strange warm sensation throughout his body. His arms then started to bulge with muscle as his biceps started grow and form. His hands started to burst out of his gloves. His legs then became more muscular as his calves were well defined, developed bigger thighs, and his feet burst out of his shoes as they grew a shoe-size or two. Then his chest started to develop pecs, and his abdomen had a well formed 6-pack. His shoulders became broader and more spaced apart, and his back had gotten more muscular too. Lastly, his crotch was about to get an improvement. His penis began to unsheathe as it lengthen to about a full 8 inches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was in awe at the upgrade Knuckles had received. Knuckles was speechless, but kinda liked it actually. He then flexed his new bigger muscles, and said \"I could get used to this.\" Rouge and Sonic were starting to get wet in the crotch area, now at the sight of Knuckles improved hot bod, but at his erected shaft. Rouge then went closer to the echidna, and leaned on his muscular should while hugging his arm. \"Boy, you've gotten quite an improvement. Can you keep it esp. you're 'little friend' there?\" the bat said flirty while feeling the tip of his dick. Sonic, her male mind starting lose to her feminine mind and giving in to lustful cravings, started to get close to him as well as she started to feel his muscles. \"Yeah, you should definitely keep it.\" she said with giggle while circling her finger on his chest. He was getting aroused too with the two women by his side, and placed his arms around both of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the group tried to break it up so they could get going with the game. However, Knux and the two girls did discuss about taking a break so the three could get some alone time together in Sonic's or the guests room. Amy then said, \"Okay, who's going next?\"</span></div></div>",

She didn't want to turn into something else, but she really had no choice at the moment. She been handed the dice, and rolled them, getting a 12 on her first turn. A very great way to start off. The game piece then moved up 12 spaces only to land on a space marked with Double Draw. The voice from the game then boomed in, \"Draw two cards from the deck.\" Looks like Cream is headed for a double transformation whammy. Cream then took two cards form the stack.

Her limbs began lengthen as she started to grow taller. Her feet grew some shoe sizes, and then, burst out of her shoes. Her tail became fluffier, and her ears became longer as well. Then, her chest developed as they ballooned into DD cups which also in turn ripped her dress. Her waistline thinned and her hips widen, causing her panties to tore off and  completely leaving her in the buff. Her face became matured and had a tuft of hair growing on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the transformation, everyone was in awe of the young rabbit turned adult. \"Whoa...\" she spoke but covered her mouth after hearing how low it had gotten. She looked at Knuckles and blushed as his wang stiffened. He now looked very hot and sexy in her eyes as an adult, but she still thought Tails was cute as well. 'What will he look like when he is older?' she thought for a moment. She then chirped up, \"So how do I look?\" \"Hot...and sexy...\" was all Tails had said. \"Y-yeah you look very nice.\" Knuckles said while flushing. The rest of the girls agreed that age did good for the rabbit. \"So what does the other card say?\" Sonic said making sure that the game progresses.

She was as shocked as everyone that she became a mommy in a matter of seconds. The board game voice started to speak again, \"You're to give birth to your babies after three turns.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe became a bit frightened that she'll be going into labor soon, and didn't look forward to it.

Tails was in shocked about this as much as everyone else. He stood up and felt the other tails. They felt real and were his alright. He then wagged and moved his tails in random motions.

She then immediately sat down. The boys sat there blushed at the events that unfolded with Amy's now huge backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game continued with Rouge being the last player. She wasn't too thrilled about all this esp. with the chances of turning into something horrible and losing her gorgeous looks. She took the dice and rolled them. She got a 5, the game piece moved, and she was asked to draw a card. She drew a card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of card was it?</span></div></div>",

She blinked. \"What the heck does that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She got her answer soon enough. The warm feeling from her gender change returned, this time centered on her chest. As she breathed, she noticed the towel getting progressively tighter. Realizing what was happening, she dashed to the bathroom, loosening the towel to give her breasts room to expand. They swelled, and swelled, and swelled. When they finally stopped, Sonic, who was no expert at bust sizes (having been a guy earlier that day) nonetheless calculated that she was now at least an H cup. That put her at bigger than Rouge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Going to wrap the towel around her, Sonic ran into a problem. The towel, which had preserved her modesty before, now functioned as more of a tube top than anything. Her lower half was completely exposed. Doing some anatomical math in her head, she sighed. Poking her head out of the bathroom, she called, \"Rouge? Can you come here for a second?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rouge, puzzled at the request, nonetheless got up and went to investigate. When she saw Sonic's new form, she had a moment of bust envy, before speaking. \"What's up, SoniA?\" She had come up with the name to distinguish between female Sonic and male Sonic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sonic barely flinched, which was (to Rouge) an indication that being female was adversely affecting Sonic's mentality. \"The towel won't cover me entirely anymore. And you're the only person that would have a lower half of clothes that would fit. Can you run home and get a pair of panties and slacks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Arching her eyebrow at the unusual, though sensible request, Rouge nodded while looking at Sonic's hips and rear. \"Panties, yes, but you'll have to do with a skirt. I don't do slacks, unless it's a full-body suit.\" As she spoke, she still winced a little at Amy's voice saying this in her normal tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Running back out, she spoke to the game. \"Fifteen minute break while I run home to grab some things to get Sonic situated?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was a pause, before the voice of the game spoke. \"Very well. 15 minutes, and counting.\" A timer appeared, and Rouge bolted out, unfurling her wings before she was out the door. The minutes crawled by, Amy having joined Sonic in the bathroom to help her cope (while also having some bust envy, although more protracted than Rouge's). With two minutes to spare, Rouge flew back in, not even touching down until she was in the bathroom. She had picked out a pair of plain white panties (\"They're from my pre-thief days,\" she explained) and a knee-length pink skirt. Amy and Rouge helped Sonic with getting them on, as her new bust made certain things awkward. They eventually returned to the game, Sonic's modesty preserved by the towel for her top, and Rouge's borrowed clothes for the bottom. Rouge and Sonic immediately reclaimed their places by Knuckles, still very much attracted by the buff echidna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before Knuckles could enjoy Sonic's new assets, Tails spoke up. \"I think it's your turn, Knuckles.\" Sighing, Knuckles carefully picked up the dice (carefully, as his fingers were now so thick as to be awkward when handling small things) and rolled. Receiving a 5 for his efforts, he watched the game move the piece. \"Draw a card,\" the game said. Knuckles drew the card, looking at what it said.</span></div></div>",

His balls also had inflated a bit as the size of softballs. After the male enhancement, both Sonic and Rouge stared at the long shaft hungrily. Soon, both girls started to lick the big cock, even taking turns to deep throat it as cum erupted from it.

Not quite as big as the enhanced Sonia, but still more than big enough to attract attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, can someone get me some clothes?\" she asked, in a low, husky tone that would have been appropriate at a brothel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge smirked, and pulled out a small capsule-like device. \"I thought something like this might happen, so I decided to get one of Tails's old inventions for me while I was doing Sonia's clothing run. A portable wardrobe.\" With that, she opened the capsule, and a full-size wardrobe appeared next to her. \"Push the amethyst, girl clothes. Push the sapphire, boy clothes. Simple, right?\" A blushing female Tails nodded, and picked out a few things from the girl side before retreating to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on, Rouge,\" Sonia said. \"Why didn't you offer this to me when I changed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge's look was deadpan. \"Because nothing inside would fit around your top, Sonia. Until you drew that bust-enhancing card, I was the biggest girl around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female Tails came back at that point, wearing a white pair of Daisy Duke shorts, and a white t-shirt with the words 'Objects Under Here Are Larger Than They Appear'. Her male counterpart choked on seeing that. She herself blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, to prevent confusion...you can call me Kimi,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kimi?\" a few people blinked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. As in Kimitres Prower. I thought it would fit with the theme Miles had.\" Everyone nodded at the logic. Though she was female, she was still Tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was next, blushing as she needed to stand up to reach for the dice. This gave everyone a nice view of her ass as she rolled a 5, and drew a card.</span></div></div>",

This of course rendered the male enhancement card relatively pointless and it was shuffled back into the deck, seemingly floating in the wind.

Yeah right as if that could happ-  ARARGG!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails what's wrong! shouted Sonic as Tails fell on his hands and knees.  I don't know, I'm in alot of pain right now.  ARRGGG!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's, What's happening to me!  Tails shouted as his body felt like it was stretching and being pulled on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails's body began to change.  His feet came first, they swelled up from inside his shoes and burst right out!  They were about a 6 foot 7 now!  What!  What's happening to you Mr. Tails! Cream began screaming hysterically terror obvious in her young eyes.  Chao Chao!  Cheese screamed from behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy!  Go get help now!  Shouted Knuckles.  Alright I'll be right back!  Ow!  What happened said Sonic.  I can't go through the doorway!  What!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh.  Huff, pant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails's legs then started growing and became more muscular as they reached up to about Sonic's height now.<br>\r\nHis Twin tails grew as well and were much more furry.<br>\r\nNext his arms, shoulders, and backside grew and buffed out as well, his Chest started hardening and grew, bulking up and turning into solid pecs!  His stomech also hardened and became much more athletic looking.  They then became well defined and toned as they turned into hard 8 pack abs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's happening to--!!! What the!  Tails shouted as his voice no longer sounded like his!  It had deepened and made him sound like a mix between Sonic and Knuckles.<br>\r\nNext he felt a burning in his crotch as his testicles and the sack containing them got alot bigger and dropped much farther down his body.  They now were 3 inches lower then they were a little bit ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly his felt a very painful feeling that centered on his penis.  It was the most painful feeling Tails had ever felt and he almost passed out from the pain.  His Cock then started streching out and getting not only bigger but wider too.  The head of his penis getting about 3 inches wider while the shaft grew 4 inches wider and 6 inches longer stopping at an incredible whopping 9 inches!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails then passed out from the pain while his friends stared at his now buff 17 year old body.  Before the group had a chance to get out of thier shock the board game then spoke again.  He will be alright.  He'll come to in about 10 minutes but you'll want to make sure that he is willing to play the game once it's his turn again otherwise thier will be severe consqudncds for all participants.  Let him know that this change isn't permanent and he will revert back to the way he was once the game ends but he can make the change permanent if he so desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic and the others then helped Tails up and layed him down on Sonic's couch so that he'll be comfortable while he's out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic then looked to the others and siad, Guys I don't think that this game is going to be much fun seeing as how painful that was for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOH YOU THINK!  WHY DID YOU BUY THIS GAME!  Knuckles shouted at him blaming Sonic as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Add ons are appreciated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic feels the urge to buy a weird board game from Merlin's Magic Shop and invites Tails, Amy, Cream, Knuckles and Rouge over to play it. Though they will undoubtedly experience changes along the way since players will transform depending on the spaces or cards drawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere some rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Anything goes or any body modification/transformation is allowed except for vore (unbirthing is an exception), weight gain, scat and watersports.<br>\r\n2. Sex is allowed, but no gayism/lesbianism. <br>\r\n3. Once an order is established, the players must always continue in that order. However, you can add more players/chars into the mix, but their turn is after the person who last in the established order.<br>\r\n4. If anyone tries to quit, there will be severe consequences.<br>\r\n5. Transformations won't be reversed until the game is finished.</td>",
