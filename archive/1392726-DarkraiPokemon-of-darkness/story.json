He had to drop it to avoid burning his hands.<br>\r\n\"Hey! That thing's hot!\" Ash said. But nothing could prepare the trainer for what happened next. Suddenly the beam shot himself ! Even more surprising was the fact that Ash was now glowing red all over, like a Pokemon would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash! What's going on?\" Dawn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know! Someone help...\" Before Ash could finish, his body suddenly faded into the red light as it was drawn into the ball! Dawn gasped at what she had just seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! It just trapped him inside! That's impossible! Isn't the beam only supposed to affect Pokemon?\" Dawn said. Dawn decided to pick up the Pokeball, desperate to know if her friend was okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash, are you all right?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawn, is that you? Hurry up and get me out of this thing!\" Ash's voice said. She couldn't see him, but at least she knew he was okay.  She then threw the ball towards the ground. As it hit, the  pokeball opened. Dawn gasped once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain she couldn't believe what she had just seen. Ash was there, all right... but he had shrunk! Almost like a few years ago when Sabrina nearly trapped Ash and his friends inside her dollhouse, except not as small this time around. He looked about six inches tall.<br>\r\n\"Ash!?!?\" Dawn shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ash immediately could tell why she was so shocked. She were so big compared to his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... yeah. I think I already get the hint, Dawn.\" Ash said.<br>\r\n\"But how? How did this happen?\" Dawn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't know. This is something I've never dealt with before. At least... not in this case.\" Ash said. \"Can't we think of a way we can possibly reverse this effect? I can't stand being smaller than a Diglett! Or Pikachu for that matter.\" Ash said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn walked up to the shrunken Ash. For Ash, it was obviously an overwhelming feeling to be seeing someone as pretty as Dawn tower over him. Dawn had become a good friend of Ash in the short time they've been together. He watched as Dawn kneeled down to pick him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Ash...I like this size.\" Dawn said with an evil smirk.</span></div></div>",
