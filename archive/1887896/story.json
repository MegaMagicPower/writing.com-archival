The death of his father before his coming of age resulted in his ambitious and charismatic sister acceding the throne instead. James is the arguably the most attractive boy in all of Merica, and the most fashionable male at court, though not in the least vain. He is unambitious, peaceable, and caring \u2013 especially to his younger brother George.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Name and title:</b>\tGeorge, Prince of Mercia<br>\r\n<b>Age:</b>\t14<br>\r\n<b>Complexion:</b> Pale<br>\r\n<b>Hair:</b>\tDirty blonde<br>\r\n<b>Height:</b> 5\u20195\u201d\t<br>\r\n<b>Weight:</b> 10.2 stone ---- 142 lbs\t<br>\r\n<b>Body type:</b> Average to chubby<br>\r\n<b>Description:</b> George is the youngest child of the former King of Mercia, and the younger brother of current Queen. George was his father\u2019s favourite, and regularly received gifts and treats whilst his siblings did not. George\u2019s childhood years were mostly filled with eating the delicious foods of the royal court and have resulted in him becoming rather fat, though he has easily kept his attractive looks. George\u2019s stomach is round and soft, and is frequently bloated as George add\u2019s to his belly at banquets, sparingly the rest of his body show little sings of being fat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Name and title:</b>\tLaurence, King of Aquitaine <br>\r\n<b>Age:</b>\t21<br>\r\n<b>Complexion:</b> Pale<br>\r\n<b>Hair:</b>\tDark brown<br>\r\n<b>Height:</b> 5\u201911\u201d\t<br>\r\n<b>Weight:</b> 8.13stone ---- 135 lbs\t<br>\r\n<b>Body type:</b> Skinny<br>\r\n<b>Description:</b> Laurence is the young King of Castile, his father having died when he was less than 2 years of age meant that for most of his live Aquitaine has been ruled by Regents. Even dressed in the finest robes of a King, Laurence still struggles to feel and look the part. He is skinny, and childlike in appearance, and shy around most apart from his family. His attractive baby face, gains the eye of many courtiers, as does his \u2018power\u2019, but thus far Laurence has shown little interest in the opposite sex. As he struggles to rule in the face of his privy council, war with neighbouring Merica, and it\u2019s strong Queen seems inevitable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Name and title:</b>\tFerdinand, Prince of Castile<br>\r\n<b>Age:</b>\t16<br>\r\n<b>Complexion:</b> Olive tan<br>\r\n<b>Hair:</b>\tCurly dark brown<br>\r\n<b>Height:</b> 5\u201910\u201d\t<br>\r\n<b>Weight:</b> 10.5 stone ---- 145 lbs\t<br>\r\n<b>Body type:</b>Average <br>\r\n<b>Description:</b> Ferdinand of Castile is the son of the heir to the Castile throne, but as his grandfather the king grows frailer by the day, the line of succession is frequently discussed, with the king\u2019s second son, Ferdinand\u2019s uncle seeming a likely candidate to challenge his own claim. At 16 little of this bothers Prince Ferdinand, as a premier royal in Castile he flamboyantly enjoys a life of luxury, controversially playing around with men and women alike and frequently appearing in public with little more than underwear. With luxury comes eating, the thin and lanky boy he was in his youth has gone, with his intense gorging on delicacies his stomach has slowly become soft and podgy. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had swung out of bed and through off his night gown and was dressed only in his oddly elaborate underwear, by the look of the sky he had once again slept in far too long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames wearing only his underwear was a sight that most girls, and some guys, at court would pay to see. Despite his lack of masculine features, he was considered one of the most attractive boys in Mercia. His pale skin, and shaggy blonde hair became a look that many replicated, embarrassingly even some women did so too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh\" James replied to a slight knocking he could hear on his side door, the knocker didn't bother to wait for a real response. Prince George barged in as brazen and confidently as he did almost everything, he wasn't noted for his tact or sense of privacy. But then he was James' younger brother, it didn't matter at all in this case. Like James George was dressed only in his underwear, though it was longer and far less elaborate than James'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you only just got up\" George asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only?... Yes, but then clearly so have you\" James replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been up for ages\" George said, lounging onto a sofa near the fire.\"Your just lucky Mary hasn't called for you\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make yourself comfortable\" James said sitting in a chair placed opposite the sofa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man you've gotten lazy... it's nearly half eleven\" George teased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hardly\" was all he said in response, it was half eleven that was slightly lazy - even by George's standards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are too... that's not to mention how fat you've gotten\" George added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat!?\" James said in shock.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He suspected that George was only teasing him, though he was equally blunt with the truth as he was when mocking someone. James had recently taken a particular liking to sugary deserts, and had unsurprisingly actually gained a few of pounds; the lack of any exercising meant this weight was almost certainly all fat. Though it was by no means visible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge stood up and squeezed onto the chair next to James. \"Man, your easy to mock\" George chuckled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can never tell when your teasing or, or just being tactless\" James explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge laughed, \"I was partly being tactless\" He added \"you have started to get podgy\" with his right hand he pinched about an inch of James belly, illustrating that his stomach had now gotten a small amount of fat on it, despite his very slender body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames pushed Georges hand aside and placed his hand on his stomach, he was actually surprised by the amount of flab on his belly, he could feel that his stomach felt quite soft; at his age he should really be exercising and toning up his upper body. For that reason pointing out that his George was chubbier, was pointless. It didn't matter nearly as much at Georges age, even though when he was that age James had been very slender. \"I'm still slender\" was all James said, patting his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cousin John is well toned, and he's a few months younger than you\" George said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is?\" James asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... how do you not know? He's always spending leisure time shirtless\" George explained \"I guess he likes to show off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome to think of it he did know, despite rarely seeing cousin John exercise he could remember seeing just how well toned he was, John had a model physique and was likely far fitter than James.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't even as if he'd gained more than a couple of pounds. He certainly didn't want to spend an excessive amount of exercising just to get a toned physique, he was and always had been slender. He went into his dressing room where his footman was waiting to dress him, as usual James was going with an extravagant fashionable choice of clothing complete with a jewled tiara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe headed down to the main court rooms, it was lunch time but relatively quite, most couriers, including the Queen and Dowager Queen, were at the jousting tournament, but the rooms were still set for lunch. From the corner of his eye he spied his cousin John sitting down with a drink, he grabbed a plate and a slice of cake and sat down opposite him, as he sat down, John stood up and bowed respectively, John stood at an inch taller than James, his hair dark and skin pale with a tint of a tan, James had forgotten how good looking he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your royal highness\"  John said, his tone calm and smooth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames nodded his head, and John sat back down. \"I'm surprising your not at the jousting\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'I'm not very good at jousting\" John quickly admitted, \"how come your not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same... though I'm worse, than 'not very good'. I also have a slight aversion to blood\" James chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha... I can see why you don't joust in that case\" John said, \"I remember you use to be good at dueling when you were younger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I still duel from time to time. I also quite like wrestling. They're both 'clean' forms of combat\" he explained \"or cleanish atleast\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wresting huh?... I've always liked wrestling too\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Cool\" James said wiping his mouth as he finished his cake, within seconds a servant took his plate away and replaced it with a bowel of chocolate ice cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps, we should wrestle at sometime\" John suggested \"It would be a great honour\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, that sounds great. How long are you at court for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the foreseeable future... can't see my self leaving unless there's a war.\" John added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two chatted for another half an hour until James had finished his lunch, the two rose from their seats together and headed towards the the doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

John and James had seen each other on and off all week, but had agreed to meet up for that wrestling match before lunch eight days after they first discussed it. James rushed along to the gymnasium where he and John were meeting up, James had decided to wear far simpler clothes today, what he normally wore was by no means suitable for wrestling. Unsurprisingly John was already there.He gave a respectful bow as James gracefully entered the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your highness\" John was dressed very similarly to James, and looked like he had already started preparing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I'm running late\" James said immediately starting his own stretches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem\" John replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 5 minuets they spent preparing the two entered the ring, John removed his simple jerkin revealing his beautifully sculpted body, James had briefly forgotten they were doing it shirtless, but quickly and calmly he removed his own simple white jerkin and threw it to the ground behind him. The two sized each other up, James was certain that John would win, but John wasn't taking any chances - he wasn't in the slightest bit arrogant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two entered the ring, and circled each other before grabbing one another's shoulders and pushed, before long John gained the upper hand and flipped James over and jumped onto him, they tousled on the floor, several times James managed to come back and turn John to his side, their two bodies touched chest to chest, and James could feel just how toned John was. Before long John gained the advantage and got James into a position and held him there until they called time. John stood first, and raised his hand and helped James up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good match\" James said, panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your fast\" John pointed out, as he also panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, yeah that's the style I'm best at\" James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your also heavier than you look, I was thinking you'd be about nine stone\" John enquired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" James chuckled \"I don't know my exact weight, but I'd say I'm over 10 stone\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm about 11\" John replied, \"your are significantly lighter than me, but you took me by surprise were I first tossed you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I felt you tense slightly as you lifted me\" James commented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost fell backwards under your weight, that stone was quite a difference, especially when it comes as a surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames had said 10 stone, though thinking back at the last weeks events it could have been a little bit more. \"I'm not sure I could have lifted you easily, had I got the opertunity, sadly my extra weight isn't muscle like yours\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your chest felt a little soft as it pressed against mine\" John admitted \"but you can't be both slender and toned\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompared to how he was when George had mentioned his weight earlier last week, James' stomach was even softer and podgyer, he had eatern allot of cakes and other deserts over the week. Even when he lunched with John he noticed that while he had a couple of slices of cake and some ice cream and a drink, John had simple bread.</span></div></div>",

James slipped off his jerkin and underwear and slipped into the already prepared bath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt could have gone better, he was trounced. He was able to fight back at the odd brief moment, but John rarely let up, he rarely gave any opportunity for a counter move. As soon as he flipped James over that was it, he was sure that he would be unable to win. Not the best mindset to have of course, though his concentration was knocked off balance by seeing John's physique in the flesh. It was a far cry from his own skinny form which had always aloud him the advantage of speed and maneuverability. Of course, of late James had put on weight, and had gotten slightly podgy in the stomach. As far as he could tell this didn't effect the outcome of the match detrimentally, but it must have made him look like a softer target.. in more ways than one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames sighed... he would have to face John again, they'd already agreed to it now, and he couldn't see himself beating John next time either. Worse, as their bodies had touched James felt turned on. He couldn't believe himself for having such a thought, about another boy. James shock his head in the water as he tried to think about something else. It would be difficult, especially knowing he was going to see John's bare flesh again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about half an hour James rose from the bath, covered himself in towels and returned to his room, instead of getting dressed he retired straight to bed and got servants to bring him his dinner. </span></div></div>",

When stripping off his top half, James was in fact not, his chest appeared soft, his belly button fairly deep and his lower belly surprisingly chubby. John wasn't sure, but he was sure that James looked slightly fatter than the previous week, albeit the change different, but being blessed with a keen eye John rarely missed these things. Convinced he'd been looking for too long, he hastily pulled off his own jerkin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should weigh ourselves to make sure we are informed\" James suggested, eyeing up the scales behind John. Last time, the difference in their weight had been a disadvantage for him, \"it's important we go into a fair match knowing, rather than guessing\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wise idea\" John replied. He steped onto the scale first, after 30 seconds the weights took to align the needle stopped at 11.0 stone [154 lbs). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was more or less exactly as he said he was, now was James's turn, he confidently strode onto the scale.

James couldn't help feeling turned on when ever seeing him shirtless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge lounged a couple ore minuets before he briskly disappeared back in the direction in which he came. James used the opportunity to get up and dressed for the rest of the day, and after being dressed into one of his finest tunics, trousers, jerkin and of course hats he left his bedroom chamber to the maids who were beginning to tidy up. All the way down stairs cousin John was on his mind... <i>damn George for putting a sexualised John into his head. God forbid the day he has to take a women into his bed, he couldn't think about guys and only guys like this for the rest of his life. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe week was fairly mundane, there were court events, meetings with important nobles and foreign diplomats, nothing particularly exciting. James had spent them talking with courtiers, laughing and jokes both funny and unfunny and gossiping over drinks, and the finest foods in all the kingdom. In set was the time he spent young ladies of court, letting them fawn over him, and of course flirting with the odd handsome young lord, knight of squire. For much of the time he couldn't help thinking about John and his hot body, he'd only seen John once, in full suit of armour, and in their short conversation James was almost willing John to invite him into his bed. But alas nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames awoke late the next Saturday morning, he hadn't retired until gone midnight the previous night on account of a grand feast held in honour of the the Gonfaloniere of Si\u00e8cle's final day of his state visit. The meal had been 34 courses, by the time it was over James was stuffed. He should have known he'd eaten too much from each course, It was good that he'd not drunk too much otherwise the contents of his stomach would likely have been a problem for the poor maids to clean up the following morning. He lifted up the duvet and slid to the end of the bed and sat, while he pulled off his pyjama shirt and bottoms. James was no longer bloated as he had been the previous evening, there was however a small but distinct roll of flab protruding onto his underwear. </span></div></div>",

He'd spent much of the week at court functions, every time he usually a drink and a snack in each hand as he spent hours listening, and joking and boring himself with talking with courtiers. And the food that James picked was rarely the healthy option, if there was such a thing. His food of choice, depending on the time of day, was ether cakes and pastries, or the meats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stood up it was obvious that James was still slender, he had a thin waste line, and his stomach barely protrude at all. Looking at his midriff of course, it was evident to anyone who saw him half dressed regularly that he'd gained weight, especially at his deepening belly button, and as James walked across the room his belly jiggled ever so slightly. All in all he must have gained about half a stone, in the past month or so, including the pounds he added in this exercise free week.

As hoped he had beaten Mary and most members of the privy council. The Throne room had three thrones always in place, in the centre on the highest step was the Grand Throne it's self, sat on by the monarchs of Mercia. To the right and left a few steps lower were two smaller thrones, these were traditionally sat in by the royal consort, on the right, and the heir on the left. Since Queen Mary wasn't married, the Dowager Queen sat to her right, and until such time Mary has an heir the seat to the left was James'. For Court sessions like this the there were six extra seats placed lower down the dais for the members of the privy council. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames took his seat as more members of the court began to arrive, first the Dowager Duchess of Montrose, the Duke of Balfour, the Dowager Queen and various other courtiers who were to stand before the throne. With Prince James and the Dowager Queen already present the Royal Guard had taken up position in front of the throne, safeguarding the royal family and the members of the queen's government. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually as the Court started to get busy the Queen herself arrived forcing the room into intimidate silence. She was flanked by two ladies in waiting, and followed closely behind by the Queen's personal Royal Guards, who were armoured in magnificent red armour, the colour of the royal families armorial. James and all the other seated stood and bowed (and curtsied) as the Queen approached. They didn't rise again until the Queen had sat upon the throne and indicated that they may do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As many Lords and ladies of the court might already now\" Queen Mary's voice was cold and stoic, \"Aquitaine soldiers have crossed further into Mercia from the occupied region of Montrose. Not on the orders of weak King Laurence, but of his cousin the Duke de Lyon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe court issued it's unavoidable gasps of anger, horror, annoyance. As was tradition. James suspected most already knew, regardless this was news to get excited about, so he didn't blame their reaction, even if it was but to curry favour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"General Ser Menson, please read your report to the court\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At once Your Majesty\" he rose from his seat and stood before Mary and bowed once again and started speaking, his words spoke of how the Aqutiaine's had burned Montrosian villages near the border, how they had pillaged towns in the Mercian mainland. How they were planning to send forces to race to Rochester... here in the centre of Mercia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Royal Army has three legions dispatched to intercept the invading army at the souther border\" Ser Manson continued, \"a further two has been dispatched to relieve Monrose\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Mary looked as furious as James imagined she felt, \"We can assume with some degree of certainty that by the end of the week Laurence will no longer be King of Aqutiaine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that was a blow, Aqutiaine had been mailable, and even controllable while the pitiable Laurence had been on the throne. Should the Duke de Lyon be King, he will be able to present a far more powerful and united force against Mercia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prince James... step forward.\" Mary said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes your Majesty\" James walked down the dias onto the marble floor of the throne room and knelt before throne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear brother\" Mary said caringly, \"I am sending you to Saxony to meet your future bride, Archduchess Maria, who you shall marry upon your return to Rochester\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was suprised, he hadn't been expected this. It was an unexpected match to be sure, though in times of war the militaristic Archduchy of Saxony will be a vital ally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once you have met Archduchess Maria and signed the contract with his serene highness the Archduke, you and Maria will leave for Florentine where you will remain until it is safe to come home\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...\" James started to protest, this set of alarm bells in his head. That the situation here was to dangerous for the heir of the throne to remain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James you must\" Mary said, though stern she was clearly worried about him personally, \"the heir to the throne must be safe, beyond the Duke de Lyon's reach. Don't worry about too much, this is only a precaution. With luck you will be able to return to Mercia very shortly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When am I to leave\" James asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow morning\" Mary said, \"early\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes your Majesty\" James replied, bowing once more and retaking his seat.  </span></div></div>",

While this allowed for great haste while in Mercia, when they were across the border foreigners would take particular note of a highly guarded civilian convoy, and that could cause trouble. Especially in such strained times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the time being James felt safe enough, though sat across from him looking nervous where his two pages, the Lords Richard and Harry of Balfour. They were told even less than James, and their presence here was only at James behest, or rather Queen Mary's on James' behalf. They had been sitting in silence for over an hour, just staring out the window \"Are you two all right\" James inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Highness\" Harry quickly replied, \"no.. I mean yes your highness. Thank you for asking\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames looked at the two young boys, their cautious smiles said more about their nerves than words did, \"what were you told about this journey\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That we were going to Saxony... and that we were to continue serving you, your highness\" Richard replied this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we will your highness... loyally.\" Harry added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were not told that we are to be at war?\" James asked, this was his way of telling them. They would have to know at sometime, holding it from them wouldn't keep them any safer. Besides being told is far preferable to just overhearing, James guessed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"War\" Richard was visibly shocked, his older brother grabbed his hand and squeezed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are going to Saxony to finalise an agreement that will prove important on the field of battle\" James explained, \"I'm sure everything will be just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young lords didn't look convinced, but James' words had been beneficial. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for some breakfast, do you not think?\" James asked, changing the subject. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the two finally smiled genuinely, James pulled a hamper out form beneath his seat placing it between them and opening it. It was filled with bread, cheese and pastries for their breakfast. Nothing particularly exciting, but very welcome after the last night sleep he had, as well as the journey in front of him. \"Help yourself\" Harry once again replied for both of them, he was very appreciative. Once James had taken a couple of slices of bread and cheese, Harry reached into the hamper and took something out for Richard and himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three washed the breakfast down with a a cup of lemonade, and James pushed the hamper back under the seat. It was unsurprisingly far lighter now, James suspected that it was meant to do for more than one meal, but it was too late now. There were a few bits left, that would probably be eaten later, but the fresh bread and cheese was to nice to be left, thus they had eaten it all. James had eaten the most, Richard and Harry out of politeness for their better had shown a great degree of restraint in how much they eat, regardless of how hungry they were. James had encouraged them to eat more however, until they were full. As it was to be a long journey. Still, James had eaten a fair bit more than either of them. For Harry, the older of the two, this was unsurprisingly. He was very thin, thinner than James had ever been. Richard however was slightly pudgier than his older brother, and had almost certainly eaten more. </span></div></div>",

Alliances had to be made, and leaders couldn't make deals simply on 'trust'. Besides, should Mary die, god forbid, then James would be King, and Katherine Queen.

By now James' heart thrice a second, he had never felt so anxious. He reciprocated the kiss, and tried to picture Lord Arthur, who had snuck into his bed the previous night. The thought of Arthur's warm slender body helped James get into the kiss, and reciprocate in a way that was pleasurable for her.

And right now York needed an heir for the next generation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry that took so long my prince\" Lord Arthur apologised sweetly as he entered the changing room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem\" James smiled at Arthur, and then Joseph as he came in a few seconds later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoseph grabbed underwear from a rack and faced around James, carefully avoiding touching his cock, to James' simultaneous relief and disappointment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid we don't have much options with clothes, your highness\" Arthur began as he presented a simple black shirt \"all the rest of the luggage has been returned to the carriages\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem Arthur\" James said patting his page calmly on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur took the shirt's edges and lifted it over James's raised arm, and slid it down to his waist, becoming tight as it reached his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a tad tight\" James observed, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your right sir... I'm sorry sir\" Joseph apologised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Joe... It doesn't matter\" James said, the apology was unnecessary in James' view. They didn't have the time, or luggage space for his overly extravagant outfits... they had been left back in Rochester/ <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It may do sir.. it could ride up as the day goes on\" Arthur explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may have mine sir\" Joseph offered, he lifted off his shirt \"I' only dressed twenty minuets ago\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or mine if you'd prefer\" Arthur followed his junior colleague's lead and also removed his shirt and offered it to James. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames looked at his two page's physiques and pondered for a moment, although at 20 Arthur was older than 16 year old Joseph, the junior page was somewhat bigger built than the slender Arthur, so James opted for Joseph's long grey shirt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks guys... but you didn't have to undress.\" James chuckled, seeing the two of them without their shirts was certainly a pleasure, both were attractive boys. But it was slightly odd that they both removed their shirts to offer them, rather than asking first. James suspected that it was a genuine offer from Joseph, and Arthur was shamed into following suit. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And he didn't know how long it would be until they reached Florentine. The atmosphere had calmed since they passed out of Aquitaine territory.  Joseph and Arthur were sitting opposite him, and the three were chatting freely in a fairly relaxed manner. It may be an unkind thought, but James was pleased that he wasn't travelling with his wife, the company of his pages and long term companions was infinity preferable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoseph was wearing the dark shirt that had been tight on James, as Arthur had predicted it was riding up an inch or so and revealing Joe's belly button. It could potentially have been embarrassing had that happened to James himself, although the shirt looked slightly looser on Joe than it had been on James, James did feel slightly bad for taking his pages clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Joe... we can see your stomach\" Arthur pointed out when he noticed his exposed belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoseph quickly pulled the shirt down, James could see that he was blushing. What did he have to be embarrassed about? James couldn't help wondering if he was into guys... if he wasn't then some of these situations were understandably awkward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again Joe for letting me take your shirt... I'm sorry that you got stuck with the one that is tight\" James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My pleasure sir... James.\" he said remembering that he could be informal in private. \"hopefully we can find something better fitting when we arrive in Florentine\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed\" James agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It may be so warm there that it might not matter\" Arthur pointed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was another upside for seeing Florentine, the chance of seeing many attractive boys in their underwear. Not just the pale boys like those back in Mercia, but those with the gorgeous, exquisite tanned skin. Hopefully that would help him put up with the occasions he would have to 'sleep' with his new wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet they'll all be in better shape than us\" Joseph suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two defentily\" Arthur joked, \"I'm sure not eveyone can beat this bod\" he exposed his slender and slightly toned chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur was slender, and somewhat toned, but he wasn't the muscular person he joked about being. If he was, James might not be attracted to him so much. But it was true, both he and Joseph were not as slender as Arthur, James wondered if bothered Joseph at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps we should diet while where here\" Joseph added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames wasn't sure if Joe was serious or not, but it was perhaps a fair point. He himself had been eating more than he had previously, and far more often. The three of them had in fact not long finished lunch, and James in hindsight thought that two sandwitches, four chicken drumsticks and three slices of different cakes may have been a bit too much. Arthur had eaten one of each, and Joseph while having three cakes, had only had one sandwitch and two chicken drumsticks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps\" James smiled, patting his bloated stomach. </span></div></div>",

Following them came two servants with three baskets of food, and another with a tray of drinks. \"Just put them on the edge of the blanket thanks\" James said to one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes your highness\" she curtsied low, and then left the three boys too it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you it would be scorching hot\" Arthur said to James and Joseph. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't disagree\" James pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three were still dressed in the cool and light clothes that had been brought with them. Unsurprisingly they had not prepared bathing suits, or trunks for swimming. So that was the best they had, and still it was too hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur almost removed his shirt, but stopped suddenly before he did and looked at James. James knew that they were waiting for him to take the lead, so that they didn't dress for sunbathing and he did not. After a couple of seconds of pondering and trying to ignore his stare, James turned his back to Arthur to undo the lace cord running down the back his shirt. Arthur did as he was bid and pulled at the cord, when the shirt was split in two James pulled his arms out of the sockets and tossed it to one side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he had done that Arthur pulled his own shirt off and placed it on the ground besides James'. Only Joseph decided to keep his on. James sat down in the centre of the rug, and Arthur following and sitting to his left. Once James was sat he began loosening the button on his trousers, and once they were loose he pulled them down his legs and then kicked them off, revealing his short and clean white cloth underwear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know we were going down to our undeys\" Arthur asked in an amused manor, looking at James' underwear, and eventually removing his own trousers, though far quicker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am\" James said, \"you okay Joe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoseph was sat cross legged on James' right, still in his shirt and trousers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine sir... James\" Joseph answered, with a feigned smile on his face. He looked hotter than James felt, which was hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cant keep all that on, you'll bake\" Arthur pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames put his hands either side of Joseph's shirt and pulled it up slightly, and then tugged at his waist band until it loosened. \"There you go... my turn to help undress someone for once\" he joked. </span></div></div>",

The chocolate was James's favourite, and with him having three slices to himself, that had the least left.

Wasn't looking too likely now, the three of them had eaten loads. Almost none of it healthy. Out of the three of them Arthur's stomach appeared by far the most bloated, almost certainly because he was the skinniest of the three. James and Joseph were chunkier and both had a significant belt of flab around their midriff, unlike Joseph who could carry it off with his broad built, James was slightly built, and the flab was more noticeable on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that you need to diet\" Joseph said to Arthur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might if I keep eating like this\" Arthur replied, he rubbed his round bloated stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps we should Joe\" James summarised, \"So we look our best for the local boys.... or girls... or erm, my wife.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

James too had his own pair, and being in exile he was getting use to having to dress himself more, which wasn't that difficult given how little he had to wear here... dressing himself in the numerous pieces of clothing that made up his attire back home was nearly impossible.

Only three places had been laid at the table. \"Will my Lady Wife, and her ladies not be joining us Marm\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, your Royal Highness... my Lords\" she said, her Florentine accent was thick and yet almost musical. \"If you take a seat, I'll have a selection brought as soon as possible\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames, Arthur and Joseph took there seats, James sitting at the head of the table and Arthur and Joseph beside him on each end.

Of course there was no disguising the fact that they weren't locals, their pale skin and light hair spoke for it's self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another glorious day in Florentine, not a cloud in the sky with the sun beating down at a temperature unimaginable back home in Mercia. James was glad at moments like this that they'd managed to get hold of local attire, otherwise they'd not only be way overdressed, but boiling. Walking around in their underwear was one thing at the estate, quite another in the streets of the city. Like them, most young Florentine men were dressed in short-trousers and sandals, some worse shirts, but not many. Most younger women were likewise lightly dressed, though they had to clearly dress more modestly. Older men and women, were dressed more finely. More extravagantly, no doubt a status symbol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reached what James assumed was the cities central square, a large ornate fountain complete with statues dating back to the age of the Imperium. Behind was the Grand Palace of the Serene Florentine State, it was truly an exquisite piece of architecture. As James, Arthur and Joseph made their way to the fountain to call them self two four boys approached them. 'Trouble makers' was James' first thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lads aren't from around here\" one asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" James replied. The four of them were dressed in fine clothes, all were wearing short-trousers, as were most lads their age, one was wearing a bleach white open shirt, and the other three had no shirts. Three of them were fairly average in appearance, none of them bad looking, but not quite handsome, two were well toned, and the third more chubby. And then there was the forth... he was what James considered handsome, unlike his friends he wasn't particularly toned, his abs were not defined at least. James turned to the handsome one, \"how did you guess\" he said sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you never seen the sun before? Your all as pale as sheets\" the handsome local asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... we don't have a sun were we come from\" James said sarcastically, \"Who are you... anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prince Leonado of House Medici... At your service, My older brother, the Cosimo Crown Prince of Florentine\" Leonado pointed to the chubby boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Francis De Santis\" the darkest haired boy introduced himself, bowing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carlos De Santis... I'm Francis brother\" the youngest of the group said, following his brother with the slight bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And prey tell, who are you?\" Leonado asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James, Duke of Northminster\" James lied, keeping close to their true identity was best, and the ageing Duke of Northminster's heir... his grandson, was named James. \"And these are my attendants, Lords Arthur and Joseph\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mercians\" Leonado said. The lad may have decided to have a joke about the three of them being out of shape... if it weren't for the presence of their chubby prince. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got it\" James replied... \"De Santis... do you have a family at the Mercian court... I seem to remember bumping into a young man called Ezio when I last visted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our cousin, he's and his sisters are their with our uncle...  ambassador to Queen Mary's court\" Carlos replied speedily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would your erm.... grace is the style right?\" Leonado started, he looked over at James who nodded to his question, \"would your grace like to join us for lunch\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The size, scale and grandure of a real palace couldn't help but give James nostalgic feelings of home. The seven of them sat down at the balcony's grand table, James sat opposite Leonardo, with Arthur and Joseph eitherside, while Cosimo and Francis sat to Leonardo left, and, Carlos to his right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help yourself\" Leonardo said to all sitting at the table, one would be excused for thinking that he, not his chubby older brother, was the heir of Florentine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table was furnished with food, a massive selection that James had not seen since the banquets back in Rochester.

Fortunately Prince Cosimo ate significantly faster, so James eating speed was not cause for notice. In fact they all, apart from Leonardo, ate a fairly hearty pace... even the nicely toned De Santis brothers. When it came to it James refilled his plate as enthusiastically as the first time, with new and different foods that he'd never eaten before today... foods that he couldn't believe he'd never eaten before.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long until James polished off his second helpings, as he prepared to call it a day for lunch servants began clearing the table and placing deserts across the table. This was food James certainly couldn't pass on, Ice Cream and cakes... especially chocolate, were his very favorite. The variety of cakes here was incredible, not only was there a wide range of cakes... but there were a range of different types of chocolate cake. Once he'd seen the De Santis brothers help themselves to more than one slice, James felt justified in helping himself to 5 different slices of cake with three scoups of ice cream on top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half an hour later they'd all finished, James had had seconds of desert, as did Joseph and the De Santis brothers. Surprisingly Prince Cosmio had left the table as soon as it was clear that they were all finished, and like loyal companions the De Santis brothers had gone with him... leaving James, Joseph and Arthur alone with their nominal host. After this meal James was well and truly stuffed, he couldn't help putting his hand on his firm bloated stomach every now and then. Joseph, and to a lesser extent Arthur, looked bloated too. Leonardo did not... which was hardly surprising, he must have eaten less than half the amount James had eaten, maybe even a quarter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad that you enjoyed dinner\" Leonardo said courteously, \"I  apologise for my brother leaving so abruptly... it is his way\" </span></div></div>",

Though he was concerned about what Leonardo must want to have gone through this charade, James' was thrilled at being alone with such a handsome young man. \"So what is it you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A deal with you, and your kingdom. As you know it is my brother who is heir to my grandfather, not me. And for all the love I bare my brother, I can not allow him to become Prince of Florentine. He has made it clear that he intends to return Florentine to the glory days, to go to war and expand out territory to encompass the Antiqua peninsular...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He intends war with Si\u00e8cle then?\" James was surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He does. A war with Si\u00e8cle could devastate Florentine, it could be our ruin,... even if we gain land from such a war. Cosimo would probably think new territory at the expense of our wealth was a victory! If they persuaded Aquitaine to enter the war on their side, we would be truly fucked.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want me to do about it?\" James wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another war is in nobody interest, Cosiomo is both stupid and strong willed, if.. when he becomes Prince then he will ignore advice that disagrees with him. This is why 'I' must succeed my grandfather\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly do you imagine I can do about that? Do you intend to kill your brother?\" James made sure to whispered the word kill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... no, of course not. What you can do is, as either Prince or King, to see that a prestigious bride can be arrange for me... a princess of the House of York perhaps. Florentine heir must have a prestigious bride... the spare, will not.\" Leonardo waited a moment, but when James remained quite he continued. \"I will arrange for a series of disgraces to be made public...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your brother is married, doesn't he have heirs it would pass to before you?\" James asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only bastards... he must have more bastards than 'he' can count. That, I must say, is an advantage to our sexual persuasion\" Leonardo grinned at James, and placed his hand on James's bare arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how does this benefit me?\" James asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I am Prince of Florentine, I will bankroll your kingdoms war. My grandfathers health is failing... fast, so if my plan is successful then the money would be Mercias within weeks. And....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames nodded, \"and?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Other... tangible benefits.\" Leonardo lent into James and gently placed his hand on James' chest, and ran it smoothly it down to his rounded stomach. It did feel good, though James still felt stuffed from the massive meal they had recently eaten. His belly was still bloated, and stretching against his trousers, and as he subconsciously breathed out the button flew off hitting Leo right in his chest. \"What was that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My trouser button\" James expected to be going red and becoming really embarrassed but, for what ever reason, he was not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\" Leonardo smiled, \"they were looking rather tight on you.\" he added,  Leonardo lowered his hand beyond James' now open trousers, and placed his hand over James' underwear where his cock was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were\" James admitted, \"I might have eaten a little too much lunch!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kidding... you and your boys stuffed yourself like pigs, as we invited you to\" his words weren't particularly complementary, but James couldn't help finding the tone endearing. Leo moved himself from his chair and sat right on James's lap, almost cock to cock. \"I have to say, I had expected the famous Crown Prince of Mercia to be slimmer... more toned.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was... slimmer I mean, I've never been toned\" James admitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither\" Leonardo agreed, his hand was now back on James belly, after rubbing for a few moments he squeezed a sizeable roll of James' flab between two of his fingers and jiggled it slightly. \"can't say I've ever been this flabby though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" was all James said, the feeling of Leo caressing his belly fat did feel good, even if did draw attention to how fat he'd gotten.

Though the excessive eating, fattening diet and lack of exercise, had resulted in a fairly sizeable amount of belly flab gained around his middle, now bulging over his trouser waist, creating small yet noticeable number of flab rolls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Na, you're still skinny\" James disagreed, he turned to Joseph who nodded along with him. \"I can still see your abs\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can?\" Arthur replied, there was surprise clearly in his voice. Almost as a reflex he flexed which showed his abs, which were somewhat defined even if it was hidden by flab lower down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you don't need to worry\" Joseph agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you Joe? You must have gained somethin.... though I don't ever remember you being skinny... if you don't mind me saying.\" James asked, he knoew the answer to the first question, Joseph's weight gain was hardly something he hadn't noticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... I've never been skinny\" Joseph began, \"I was chubby as a kid, and then as I got older I got slimmer as I grew into my body. I was never as slim as either of you guys though.\" Joseph explained, as he continued to speak he started fiddling with his belly with his fingers, \"but yeah... I've defiantly gained weight, I'm surprised you even have to ask!  I'm getting to be almost as chubby as I was as a kid.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha\" Arthur chuckled, \"I don't know why James asked... It's hard to miss your enormous stomach\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur poked at Joseph's belly, by his tone it was obvious he was teasing Joseph not being cruel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I shouldn't have been so complementary to you\" Joseph chuckled in rely.</span></div></div>",

With in seconds of him doing so, both Joseph and Arthur began heading for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night sir... James. Sleep well\" Joseph said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to go, not yet...we can still chat if I'm lying in bed\" James argued. He patted the bed either side of him, \"you can sit next to me here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoseph and Arthur looked at each other, as they stood next to the door. \"Okay\" Arthur agreed, he took his hand off the door handle and walked toward the door. Both Arthur and Joseph got onto the bed and sat either side of James, and the three went on chatting. There conversation that seemed not to go anywhere, nor end went on for another hour as James noticed that Joseph and Arthur seemed to be gettting a bit twitchy, shuffling around where they were sitting. Were they tired? Or just uncomfortable?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys don't half labour the uncomfortable\" James chuckled. \"It hasn't effected me thank god.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you are lying down\" Joseph shot back a big smile on his face, \"I bet your more comfortable. I'm getting pins and needles\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get in then\" James replied, he pulled down the blanket until it was about level with his belly button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Arthur and Joseph looked at each other, Joseph seemed reluctant until Arthur readily jumped in beside James. Once Arthur was in, Joseph had no problem following his lead and climbed in the other side of James. \"There... more comfortable?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't complain\" Joseph replied, \"This is much more comfy\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three handsome guys in a bed together... I'm sure there's suppose to be something sinful about this\" Arthur joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What could be sinful\" James joined in. Just the thought had been enough to give James an erection, it wasn't long before the three of them got closer and it did become 'sinful'. To James' shock it was Joseph who made the first move when he rotated slightly to face James and placed his left hand on James' stomach, just above his underwear. It was quite possible, even likely that Joseph didn't mean anything by it. But James was quick to reciprocate, he placed his right hand on Joseph's soft round stomach and rubbed sensually. Not to be left out, the ever bold Arthur moved to his left and climbed on top of them both, lying mostly on James, with one hand he gently caressed James's flab, the other he placed on Joseph's belly, he took James's hand and moved both of into Joseph's underwear and the two began rubbing his cock, which to James' pleasure and relief was fully erect.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

From what James had heard, Queen Mary had fled the city just before it's fall, fortunately avoiding the fate of the remaining nobility who were systematically massacred by Aquitainei knights. King Laurence had appointed the invader Duke Charles of Lyon as Mercia's puppet King, an appointment that lasted less than a weak before Laurence himself abdicated, in favour if Charles who then appointed the unknown Baron Joseph de Ch\u00e2lon as puppet King of Mercia. It was sickening to think of a low-born Aquitainei like him sitting on the throne of the House of York, the throne of James' ancestors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were however some things to appreciate. Two months ago Katherine had given birth to the first Yorkist heir of the next generation, that James and Katherine had named Prince Felix. Prince Leonardo of House Medici had married James' first cousin Princess Isabella, as per their agreement, and had become Prince of Florentine some months back when his grandfather died. Which meant that the Mercian cause was well funded, and when the time came for Queen Mary and the Archduke of Saxonie to launch their invasion, that the soldiers on both sides would be well armed and well stocked, James himself was looking into the hiring of some of the best Mercenary bands on the Antiqua peninsular, who might have been fighting against Florentine, had it not been for James' alliance with Prince Leonardo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames sat at a desk the Florentine estate's great hall, signing off on documents that were coming into him from nobles who had fled south into exile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Royal Highness\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames looked up, it was Leonardo, the Prince of Florentine, \"Serene Highness\" James replied. \"What can I do for you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have brought telegrams that I have received from five mercenary bands bidding to offer you their service\" he said. He took a seat infront of the desk and placed the documents on the table infront of James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another six\" James said, his voice quivering excitedly, \"that's good news. How many solders?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm... The Sons of Aries offer you 9000 infantry, the Blood Knights 4500 infantry, the Desh Riders 1000 cavalry, the Swords of War 700 cavalry, and the Second Born 3000 including infantry, cavalry and artillery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" James said, trying and failing to remember all that he said. Still that was a lot of men for the cause. \"Can we afford them all?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Florentine can provide you with loans to cover it yes.\" Leonardo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much debt will this put my country in\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A substantial amount\" Leonardo answered candidly, \"but I wouldn't worry your highness. The accounts sent from Rochester before fall show that your Kingdom is actually surprisingly wealthy... your sister is a very shrewd women. Should the Aqutiainei not loot everything then you'll easily pay us back, and with the minimal interest we're charging it shouldn't substantially affect your nations finances\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't count on them not looting the city\" James replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you retake your kingdom Aqutiaine will owe you reparations, providing you deal them a significant defeat. If they loot Rochester, then they'd be obligated to pay even greater reparations, on top of returning what they stole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have great faith in Aquitainei honour\" James said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all\" Leonardo chuckled, \"in a weakened state they'll find it difficult to trade with other nations if they are shown to have stolen to much from such a wealthy city\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take your word for it\" James said, he placed his hand on his stomach as it began to rumble. \"So why did you come Serene Prince... you could have sent one of your ministers with this information\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been so long since I've seen you\" Leonardo said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've seen one another almost everyday this week\" James pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True... though sadly you had clothes on every time!\"  Leonardo grinned. </span></div></div>",

The eminent people gathered were sat at the long conference table where the Florentine government conversed with their Prince and one another. Prince Leonardo had left the seat at the head of the table for James, honourably not taking his usual seat on the throne behind up the dais, sitting to one side of James opposite Princess Isabella. Princess-Archduchess Katherine wasn't present, opting to remain at the estate with Prince Felix, as they prepared to move out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, my Lords and Ladies\" James said, \"the day it seems is here, colonels I gather my honourable friend the Duke of Ashbridge has agreed upon strategy with you\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colonels and captains all nodded, General of the Royal Army the Duke of Ashbridge was Mercia's second highest ranking member of the armed forces after the Lord Admiral. He stood up to speak, bowing his read respectfully to James \"yes your royal highness, captain Chevin and Hadrian will transport all 60,000 men, marine, cavalry and infantry to the Neck of Mercia, where they will land 20 miles north of the Aquitainei border, there we will take your ancestral home the fortress city of York, as we do so Queen Mary will move her army south and join up with the army of Saxonie as it crosses through Aqutaine. We will then make haste eastwards, as the Royal Navy launch seven simultaneous assaults at Aquitainei ports, including the capital Orl\u00e9ans, hopefully drawing enemy forces out of Rochester which we will then engage as Queen Mary leads her armies against Rochester, and it's remaining troops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A good strategy\" James agreed, it was definitely sound. The power of the navy was not something that Aquitaine could match, uterlising them in a battle over land isn't always easy, but as a diversionary tactic it would actually allow them to capture several tactically useful port cities, though obviously not the capital it's self. Though he couldn't help wishing he could see the First Fleet at Orl\u00e9ans, bombarding it from the safety of the water, while all the locals could do is watch in fear of Mercia's magnificent navel might. At the very least it would bring the war home to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're also working on a number of Marcher noblemen to side with you against the Aquitainei, by closing their cities to them. Cash bribes and promises of honours such as new Lordships and knighthoods for their sons.\" Prince Leonardo said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that would bring these marcher cities back under our Kingdom's jurisdiction\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right\" the Duke of Ashbridge said, \"for the first time since the Aquitainei took them from your grandfather.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe talk went on for another half-hour before they called the meeting to a close, the next time he saw many of these men would be on the beaches when they land in Mercia in a month or so's time. Until then, he was in for allot of travelling even before the fighting even started. </span></div></div>",

It was sad to see the city occupied by collaborator lords who had decided to side with the Aquitainei, and a proud Mercian fortress city besieged by the forces of the Mercian royal family. With luck the men inside would surrender before too long, preventing a long drawn out siege. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was at the front with his men, but wasn't required to fight due to the nature of the siege. He was in the royal tent receiving regular reports on the progress, which thankfully had resulted in few casualties thus far. The greatest moment thus far was when many of the local lords called their people up to join James' army bolstering it by almost 35,000. Once they had joined James' host, they were all sufficiently outfitted with uniform armour and weapons, thanks to the generous financing they'd received from Florentine, so gladly none would be sent into battle wearing rags, armed with little more than sticks like in the days best forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur and Joseph were with James in his tent, it was raining heavily outside and it was humid making for a uncomfortable siege. Though James couldn't complain, for unlike most of the soldiers he was warm and dry, and their was no dominant expectation for him to join the battle. It was worth considering that most of the soldiers were not Mercian, but hired and professional solders, so he supposedly these conditions of war was something they were use to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe locals had rallied to James, and their loyalty to him, Mary and the House of York was really heartening, but James truly wasn't a solider. He was good at charming and placating nobles, but fighting, killing and leading men into battle was certainly not something equip for. He'd never done it before, thanks to the past peace he'd never even been trained for it. What's more, he wasn't in the best physical condition to fight. He wasn't back when he was the skinny prince was forced to flee upon the impending invasion; and he certainly wasn't now given the amount of weight he'd gained while in exile. As for his companions, while Arthur did still 'look' to be fit, he too wasn't a fighter. And though still slender he had gained more than a few pounds of weight. Then of course was young Joseph. While his handsome face was still slender, the amount of fat the naturally stocky boy had gained in in his belly meant he too was totally unsuited for battle; though ironically his build would have made him the best fighter out of the three of them, if he was fitter that is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill the three of them were there, and would be armoured up if the situation called for it. </span></div></div>",

Since that triumph things went downhill fast. After leaving a garrison in York, James and his host raced eastwards to engage the Aquitainei forces once they were drawn out of the city. But the defeat of the Saxon army as they attempted to cross into Mercia was speedily followed up by the routing of Queen Mary's host, as the large Aquitainei army moved with haste engaging both armies separately to prevent them from combining their forces. As originally planned Royal Navy had successfully bombarded the seven Aquitainei ports before they were notified of the order to withdraw, fortunately allowing them time to regroup with minimal losses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result of the two devastating defeats, James' host was also told to call off their planned engagement outside Rochester for fear that it would annihilated by overwhelming numbers if the occupying force in Rochester was able to join with the main Aquitainei army. As instructed James returned his host to York, and established court there. Weeks became months, and months became years as James sat in York, constantly waiting for news and instructions on where to go from there. The news came for ever slowly, but it seemed that Queen Mary had escaped back into the north with her forces and was actively recruiting extra more men while fighting a guerilla war against Aquitainei incursions. But even after two years he'd heard nothing of note from Saxonie, all that was provided was rumour and speculation... which was precisely what he had to ignore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was one bright light, one light at the end of the tunnel, it was that James' forces at York were well supplied by the Navy. Nobody was starving, there was no decease. And even after almost two years the Aquitainei had not made any move to retake York. So James stayed positive, what else could he do? To admit defeat, to despair would break morale, and would play right into Aquitainei hands. They weren't out of the fight yet, Mary was still alive and he was still alive. Even if it took another ten years, he would not admit defeat. </span></div></div>",

The Admiral's men rounded up as many as they could, before the Aquitaine navy it's self moved in themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What good are men who are already Aquitainei prisoners to us?\" James wondered, he knew the question sounded naive and dismissive but honestly it wasn't what he meant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Bastille holds political prisoners, of high value to the Aquitainei government.

As Arthur had anticipated James didn't eat a smaller dinner as he intended, in fact regardless of the gargantuan mid-afternoon snack that he'd devoured, he'd overfilled his plate on every course of the banquet of a dinner - especially for desert where he'd returned for thirds. This wasn't unusual, James often ate such large portions though admittedly he didn't usually have such a big snack so close to dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three of them settled down to relax in his chambers, James noticed Arthur rubbing his stomach. He too had eaten a fairly hefty portion, though less than James Arthur had filled his plate at every dinner course before returning for seconds. Only Joseph had eaten moderately, which once upon a time would have surprised James. Joe had not once gone for seconds, and had had only a small desert. This had been a pattern since leaving Florentine where he'd become self-concious about his weight. And the results of his diet was clear, his change over two years was impressive. He'd dropped allot of weight especially in the stomach, which while still possessing a layer of fat was becoming toned, he admittedly looked quite fit and was undoubtedly more confident. Ironically Arthur had gone the other way, while naturally stocky Joe lost weight, naturally lean Arthur had piled it on. And while the gain was almost unnoticeable when he was dressed and fully covered up, exposing his round flabby stomach would told all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames perched on the edge of his armchair beside the fire and finally after hours of holding the fastening together he let go revealing his broken trousers, which now at least allowed him to feel less constrained by overly tight waistband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, how long have you been holding that for\" Joe asked as he took a seat on the sofa opposite James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since before desert\" James replied, a grin on his face. He stood up and shuffled letting the trousers fall to the floor, he picked them up and tossed them across the room missing the bed by a few feet, he then pulled off his Jerkin chucked it in the same direction and sat down before he saw where it landed. He now started slowly unbuttoning his shirt top, to bottom. \"You don't have to ask...\" James said a smiled on his face, at Arthur and Joseph who were looking at him, with his permission they too started taking off the uncomfortable clothing they'd warn for dinner, both were noticeably speedier at it than James.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool\", \"Right\" Arthur and Joe respectively finally replied almost in tandem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey'd both almost undressed by the time James removed his shirt and started untying his vest, Joseph in vest and underwear sat back into the chair as Arthur pulled off his vest falling into the sofa beside him. James lack of experience dressing meant that untying the overly complicated vest took him minuet or so before he got into the rhythm and swiftly unfastened it, within a split second his stomach bulged out over his waistband creating an inaudible bump as the flab bounced onto his lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than Arthur or Joseph, it was James who had changed. Like them he'd gained weight while in exile in Florentine, but had started losing in the final months as he grew nervous for the invasion of Mercia. In the time spent in residence in York he'd packed the weight back on, and more, as he took to eating large meals again. Meals larger than he'd eaten in Florentine. In addition he'd taken to regular snacking, which nearly always consisted of sweets, pastries and cakes. Unsurprisingly over those two years he'd grown really fat, and that was on top the pudge he already had, and while he was fortunate enough to have retained a slender face as well as relatively slender limbs, thus reaming still very handsome, his belly had grown really round and flabby. Just sat upright just on the sofa James enormous stomach had folded into half a dozen flab rolls protruding onto his lap by several inches. Small but noticeable moobs were now also visible where the fat had gathered on his upper chest, and behind and at his sides, his love handles bulged from his underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God that's more comfortable\" James stated, he rubbed his belly and lent back into the sofa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right!\" Arthur agreed, like James he'd also removed his shirt allowing his noticeably flabby stomach to be unconstrained by his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not surprised you guys were uncomfortable the amount you ate at dinner!\" Joe said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not you though\" Arthur chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha... can't lie, you two did make me feel hungry seeing what you ate\" as almost by a sign his stomach rumbled as he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you should have done\" James laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And get fat again!\" Joseph said beaming, \"like you two\" he cheekily prodded Arthur's belly jiggling the soft belly fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you have some fat under there!\" James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Arthur agreed, in response he pulled at the lace fastening of Joseph's vest speedily pulling it from him before he could do anything about it and rubbed his stomach jiggling Joe's remaining belly fat, \"See!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know why you hide body Joe\" James said looking at Joesph's much slimmer and toned torso, which while admittedly still having a sizeable amount of stomach fat, as Arthur illustrated, he now appeared quite fit and undeniably sexy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha... I'm use to being the fat one of the three of us. And to think you were the skinny one\" he said to Joseph prodding Arthur's belly again, \"And you James, to think how skinny you were!... Weighing nine stone or something!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rose from his chair and plonked down next to James and placed his hands on James' stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now look at you\" he added, James smiled sensually as Joseph rubbed his soft flabby belly causing it to jiggle far more than Arthur's. The sensation was gave James and Joseph both an erection. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was probably the case that most guys in James' position would spend alot of their time sparing, wrestling or weight-lifting... increasing their aptitude for battle one way another. But fighting was something that didn't interest him, and the thought of mutilating people in battle repulsed him. Thus sex was about all the exercise that James' got. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Prince\" the Duke of Ashbridge as he strode into James' chambers without an invite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was sat on his sofa besides the fire nibbling at a fresh pastry, late morning James' was still in his underwear, not having got dressed yet - it was only fortunate that the Duke didn't catch him while he was still in bed. \"Yes, your Grace\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As expected the cargo-ship arrived almost an hour ago\" he started, \"and well it turns out that prisoners are on board\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" James sat up startled, \"why do we only just no this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Admiral transported his prisoners via a cargo ship under light escort with no prior communication, rather than by convoy which would have aroused enemy suspicions.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\" James said, \"and what's happening with the prisoners?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're being brought across to the city in crates, they will be here within the hour.\" He stated, \"what are your orders once they're hear\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feed them, cloth them and then assemble them in the square. If our special prisoner is among them sort him out clothes that befit his rank, I should have something in my wardrobe, and lock him to south tower until I can deal with him\" James knew that the south tower was where high ranking nobles were locked up if placed under house arrest It was a place of reasonable luxury, as befits the rank, more akin to house-arrest than a cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes your highness\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And have someone fetch my pages\"</span></div></div>",

When it came to putting on his shirt and jerkin the job got more difficult. while both the shirt and the Jerkin fitted over his stomach, albeit tightly, they were a size or two too small for James, thus curved along with his stomach - making for an unflattering appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't it right sir\" Arthur said, he pulled at the edges of the shirt trying to tuck them into his trousers, but even without much help they rode up a inch or so exposing his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't?\" James said perplexed, \"it was fine only a month or so ago when I wore it\", he was sure it was.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've outgrown it sir\" Joseph said, \"by a fair bit\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps a corset.\" Arthur quickly suggested before James could question Arthur's comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... if you think it will help\" James agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Arthur went across the room to fetch the corset, Joseph removed James' jerkin and began unbuttoning the shirt. As he undid the final button James stomach fell with a slight bounce back to his waist where it protruded over his trouser waistband. The tightness of the trousers didn't help, they just pushed his stomach upward making him appear flabbier. Before Arthur even put the corset on James' knew it was going to be uncomfortable. It was okay at first as they just rested it around his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breath in\" Joseph said to James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames did as he was asked and breathed his stomach in as much as he could, allowing them to start beginning to tighten it around his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you hold it until it's tight\" Arthur asked as he noticed James starting to breath back out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breathing in wasn't quite enough so Joseph was forced to push James' soft belly fat under the corset as Arthur pulled it tight. Eventually it was done, and they told James he could breath out again. When he did so, the constraint of his body felt incredibly uncomfortable, the corset was squeezing his belly flab which would make him appear slimmer when other clothes, shirts jerkins etc, were dressed on top of it. Though his belly was now no longer protruding over his waist, not sticking out like a beer gut, the soft and loose flab around the bottom of the corset still bulged out. Fortunately when James was dressed back in the shirt and Jerkin it was unnoticeable, as was his gut as a whole. It actually made him appear fairly slender, thank god at least that was happening considering the amount his stomach was currently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a tight squeeze\" Joseph said, Arthur nodded with him,<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There few places in the world more impregnable than the Fortress City of York, and apart from the West Tower where the Royal Apartments were, the North Tower was the most defensible and fortified place in the entire city fortress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many more flights of stairs\" James asked the Sergeant of the Guard, they'd climbed 6 flights so far and he was quickly beginning to tire.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just this, and to further Your Royal Highness\" he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last three flights took longer than the previous flights, as James had become quite puffed out. The climb was significant for somebody who was physically fit, let alone for James who was out of shape. They reached the wide corridor at the end of the stair case, at the end guarded by four guardsmen was a thick metal door. That chamber was where the Prince was being kept, in safety. James had never seen the South Tower apartments, but he had heard they were appropriate for high ranking prisoners, he hoped that the conditions were not to rough on the former King, who for all his country had done could not really be blamed for Mercia's plight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open the door\" James said to the doorman, who immediately complied. \"Wait outside, and shut the door\" James said to his guards as he stept into the chamber.

The apartments were grand and well decorated, though unable to leave the occupant can't feel that much like a prisoner here. His every need was catered for, and he was afforded servants at the cost of the Mercian kingdom's exchequer. James made his way through toward the innermost chamber which he imagined was the bed room, as expected the former King was inside sat on a chair beside the window reading a book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prince Laurence?\" James asked, he didn't know why he phrased it as a question it was obvious who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" the boy rose from his chair and thrust himself onto his knees in front of James \"Your Royal Highness\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may rise, we are of equal rank after all\" James pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is appreciated\" Laurence said in his thick Aquitainei accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man that stood before James was not what he was expecting, he was child-like in appearance, James would have guessed he was 17 or 18 rather than 24.  He was a few inches taller than James and also very thin, almost gaunt, it was unsurprising that the clothes he wore hung on him. Despite this he appeared to be quite attractive, a trait that would likely be far more evident if he wasn't so thin. James couldn't help feeling sorry for the poor, weak and scared prince that stood before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are Prince James, am I right?\" Laurence asked timidly.\"Queen Mary's brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am indeed\" James answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am truly sorry for what has happened to you\" Laurence said, by his tone James knew that he was genuine, \"but you must know that I had nothing to do with it, my cousin attacked Mercia without my permission and used his success to oust me from the throne\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not before you appointed him King of Mercia\" James shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My cousin took a position I was unable to deny him\" Laurence explained, \"as soon as he had his soldiers came to Orl\u00e9ans, which was when my privy council forced me from the throne and declared him King.

I had no idea that Mercian food was so good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great\" James replied, \"with luck you will be return to a healthier weight very soon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for arranging it... and these apartments. Though the food is tasty, I am not use to eating that much so I apologise for sending so much back uneaten\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must stop apologising\" James insisted. \"Just make sure you eat.

But over the 12 course meal, no new facts were brought to light. Queen Mary still hadn't been heard of, and though the Archduke of Saxony professed that he was okay, and had one several minor battles against the Aquitainee the forces at York were still in no position to do anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs speculated, the Aquitaine had decided not to siege York, and though they were preventing access to most of the country plenty of supply lines were active with the sea meaning the city was still well supplied. Clearly the new King wasn't going to let his ego let him waste forces on trying to break an impenetrable city, he surely knew that locked up in the city along the western coast they could do no harm, thus could be dealt with later. James left the meeting feeling slightly dejected, thankfully nothing bad had taken place since last council was called, but he had hoped for some good news that might change everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left the dining hall and was fast joined by his Royal Guardsmen who took up position behind him, James could at least see how his favourite prisoner was doing. As he climbed the last flight of winding stairs in the North Tower his stomach began feeling tight with indigestion. As was often the case at such feasts, James had greedily eaten allot, and now he was being punished for it. The corset he wore was uncomfortable at the best of times, with such a bloated stomach the tightness was nearly unbearable.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the final floor where the apartments of Prince Laurence were, James was breathing heavily. With relief he brushed the beads of sweat from his brow and entered the anti chamber, as always leaving his guards to protect the only entrance and exit. Thankfully Laurence wasn't awaiting him in the antechamber, so he was able to wait and regain his breath for a few moments before going in and seeing the former Aquitainee King. </span></div></div>",

Princes, and of course kings, couldn't afford to get fat on their decadence, especially if they're prisoners, be it the literal kind of Laurence or James' illiteral kind. James knew of course that he wasn't the lithe boy he'd been when he was forced to flee court, he had admittedly put on a bit of weight... fat. Especially around his stomach.

News had poured in from the north and the east, and most fortunately most of it was good. Queen Mary and the Archduke of Saxony had both won major battles in the field, and drawn King Charles into joining the war personally. Which meant that soon the forces at York would be called to join with Mary's at the north, for a push to regain the capital. What's more, if the Archduke defeated King Charles in the field, then without heirs his regime would collapse, with luck the joint forces of Mercia and Saxony could take the Aquitainee capital, perhaps place Laurence back on the throne... and expand both of their realms at the expense of Aquitaine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe busyness of the month meant that James hadn't been able to visit Prince Laurence very often, though hopefully he wouldn't mind too much if it meant that he would soon be released from his gilded cell. Now that a course of action had been decided on, there was very little for James to do until the forces left York. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Duke of Ashbridge had taken charge of the forces, and was readying to them for battle, he'd actually recommended James himself get some training in, sparing, wrestling... anything to get in shape for the coming battles, given that he'd have some free time. James certainly wasn't keen, he didn't love physical training, and he certainly wasn't looking forward to the possibility of going into battle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames hadn't dismissed it out of hand, he kept telling his pages that they'd also go and get some sparing in, but like him they were more than happy to put it off. Instead James had decided to make a long awaited visit to Prince Laurence, who ironically last he'd heard was working out with the equipment James had had sent up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may be in a while, if i'm not out before lunch could you have it brought up along with the prisoner's\" James said to the gaoler standing next to the cell door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you command your highness\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames let himself into the antechamber, the large space had evidently been where Laurence had decided to put the gymnasium equipment. Not the best room perhaps, but it does the job. James made his way trough the room carefully avoiding tripping over a dumbbell that had been left close to the corridor. James guessed that Laurence was in his bed chamber, which he tended to use as a living space. Not surprising, it was certainly the nicest room in the tower. Placing his hand on the door handle, James couldn't help wondering how much working out Laurence had done.</span></div></div>",

I've always been really skinny, so I guess it's not a shock\" Laurence chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was pleased that Laurence wasn't too hung up on it, he sounded quite disappointed when he'd first broached the subject. It was a good point about always being skinny, even James had heard of the frailty of the Aquitainei king, though he'd always know it was an unfair exaggeration, there was no doubt that Laurence was naturally thin, thus probably found it difficult to build muscle mass. Not that he'd progressed far in the first place. \"So no change at all on last month?\" James asked, \"You did say you did a couple of days before you injured yourself\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No change\" Laurence said firmly, \"I've eaten properly of course, but really there's been no change to my body since last month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much do you imagine you weigh\" James asked, \"if you don't mind me asking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No not at all, somebody at the Bastile remarked that I barely weighed 8 stone... the first month or so here I think I must have reached my average weight once again, nine stone, nine and a half perhaps.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gaining over a stone in your first month in the North Tower and getting back to your average weight is good... I'm glad you were able to reach a healthy weight so fast\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate it\" Laurence said, thanking James yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you've not gained anything since?\" James wondered, looking at him it didn't look as if he had. \"One or two pounds perhaps, nothing noticeable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so no, a pound or two perhaps at the very most... if you don't mind?\" Laurence looked at James indicating that he lift his shirt and show James.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all\" James replied, Laurence clearly didn't know much about James if he asked if he minded seeing a handsome boy's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of lifting his shirt up, he pulled it off completely and placed it beside him. Although he'd said he thought his body hadn't changed at all in the past month, apart from a pound or two at the most, his body told a different story. Behind the cover of a shirt, he looked just as slender as the previous month. Without it, James could see that he'd gained far more than a few pounds over his second month. The small fold of flab James had spied previously was now far larger, in fact his entire stomach was soft and flabby, bulging slightly over his waist into his lap. And his belly button! James had observed when he'd first seen Laurence's bare body, that he had a fairly large and deep belly button, despite being so skinny. And again he'd seen the previous month, when Laurence had filled out a bit. With a good stone more weight (James guessed) the size of the belly button really made him look pudgy. </span></div></div>",

The reality was only evident when looking upon his naked upper body, for two months of little exercise and as much fattening food as he desires had given him a soft sizeable paunch upon his thin frame. It wasn't that surprising that he was seemingly oblivious to it, James too wasn't sure if he should contradict the prince, or lie and agree that he'd gained nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always hated being so skinny, I would have liked to have been able to tone my body\"  Laurence put one of his hands on his stomach, inadvertently making it jiggle ever so slightly. \"even If I did gain a pound or two then it's probably fat rather than muscle\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you did gain a pound or two it may have been a muscle, if it was only a day or so's work\" James fibbed, \"I know what you mean about hating being skinny.

It had taken enough persuasion to keep the Royal Guardsman out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames chucked Laurence a sword, which he caught awkwardly in both arms. \"Cheers\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking good\" James complemented Laurence's white outfit done up at the waste with a red belt, he'd kind of wished that Laurence would spar with him without his shirt on, not a sensible wish perhaps if they were duelling. But there was still time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames himself was wearing a considerably more extravagant outfit, though like Laurence's it was loosely fit. And though Arthur had instead that he should wear a corset again, it was on allot looser - which meant he felt allot more comfortable than usual. It was necessary for working out after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too\" Laurence returned the complement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they circled each other readying to start sparing against one another, James considered his strategy. They were about the same height, well Laurence may be a few inch or so taller, but James knew he was heavier, and probably stronger. And though he didn't think himself too fat, he knew he wasn't at all fit. He didn't bet that Laurence was either, he was stick thin and had a flabby belly. Still, he was probably marginally faster, that and he's smaller. \"Let's go\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But James was determined to win this match, and judging by their now slowing moves that would require one to tire before the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before a final move was struck, James had parried against a heavy strike from Laurence who was now breathing very heavily. \"I yield' he said, taking a long breath between both words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally!\" James said, he too was breathing heavily, \"I was on the verge of yielding myself\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't done quite so much exercice in years\" Laurence joked, \"even if we've barely done half an hour\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not been quite as long for me, but I know what you mean\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like a drink?\" Laurence asked, the servants brought some up to my bed chamber just last night.

The two walked through to Laurence bed chamber, and while Laurence fixed them both a drink James perched on the chaise longue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go\" Laurence said passing him a drink, \"It's just juice i'm afraid.

James shuffled closer and placed his hand flat on Laurence stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feel instantly gave Laurence an erection, \"it's not that firm as you can feel\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubbed it smoothly enjoying the feel of his soft jiggly flab, somehow a flabby bely always looked really sexy on a thin guy. \"If I'm honest I do think you may have gained a bit more weight this past month\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so?\" Laurence asked, his tone was more curious than surprised.

He'd be lying if he ever thought that he was gaining muscle tone, that would require hard work and exercise, but he had thought himself to be still very skinny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it\" James replied, as he continued to softly caressing Lawrence's stomach, \"It's far better than being stick thin... frail, as you were when you first arrived.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was true Laurence knew, while James probably didn't know that the former King had always been very skinny, the time he'd spent from court, and imprisoned in the Bastille Lawrence's weight had plummeted to new lows, as he was denied decent food and sustenance. The crap they fed him on was... crap. No use to dogs... let alone kings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pleasurable feeling of his belly being soothingly rubbed just intrigued Lawrence as to what Prince James' body was like, what lay under his exquisite clothing. The exiled-king had always heard how attractive the Mercian heartthrob was, as the tales didn't disappointed. Prince James was one of the handsomest boys Laurence had ever met, he'd thought so the very first time he met him. Whether it was love, or more likely a simple infatuation, Laurence had fallen for him at first sight. \"C..can, can I see your body?\" Laurence stuttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My body..\" James muttered under his breath, slightly startled. He truly hadn't expected the nervy boy to be so full on, so quick. Well, okay admittedly he had already initiated it. In the end he just smiled at the boy sitting beside him, \"I suppose so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwesome, Laurence wanted to say. Instead he said nothing, just from looking he could see that Prince James wasn't at skinny as he. Though he'd heard the prince to be quite slender, which was certainly true, his body did also seem slightly broad. He must be quite toned, Lawrence deduced nervously, as he watched with batted breath as James unbuttoned his shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShowing his body never phased James, never had. Although admittedly he wasn't as thin as he once was, and as the former-king had probably imagined him to be, he knew was still a slender boy. True, there was a few ounces of fat around his stomach, that he would have to work off, eventually, but who doesn't have that? His two pages certainly did, that's why they taunted James so. Hell, even the king Laurence does now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter unbuttoning his shirt, and his undershirt, James came to his corset, that his pages told him helped shape his body for clothes. It was so tight that it almost made him not want to eat... almost, but in recent weeks it had gotten looser, either weight had come off his girth, or it wasn't being tied so tight. When getting down to it, it occurred to James that he wouldn't be able to untie it by himself.  \"Could you?... untie it from the back i mean\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Laurence replied exited, James turned half away from him, giving the Aquitainee access to the thread holding the corset on at the back. Laurence was slightly surprised at first that the prince wore a corset, at least that explains why he looks to broad. He'd been offered one before, not that he'd needed it, but had always turned it down citing discomfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLace by lace the corset became looser, and James could finally begin to breathe easily.</span></div></div>",

His Gentlemen of the Bedchamber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first, and senior of the two, was a tall and slender young man; the Lord Arthur Rocheford, a reserved and rather quiet young man of twenty, hailed from one of the kingdom's most respected families, and was one of James oldest friends and companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second, despite a long familiarity, had only recently entered the prince's formal service. Joseph Waters was the eldest son of Merica's greatest general. An initially minor family, but a clever and ambitious one. The darker haired Joseph was quite his counterparts opposite, slightly shorter and thicker set, he was - unlike the bashful Arthur - a confident and extroverted lad who would go far at court. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStood before the two lads now, garbed in a simple white robe, James admired the clothing that had been selected for the forthcoming day. <i>Truly an outfit fit for a prince</i>, James mused as his blue eyes glowed with approval. The shirt, a clean white, sat upon it a jerkin of dark blue, made of the finest silks, and embodied in gold with the families heraldic symbol. Across his chest would lye a red sash, ornately decorated with honours and symbols of the Kingdom of Mercia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a smile and a nod of approval to both pages, Arthur leant forward and pulled the white robe from James' nude body, passing it swiftly to Joseph before it could touch the ground. James was never one to be embarrassed by his naked form - not with these two men, at least. It did occur to him a shame that while they got to see his nude body daily, that he seldom - okay, never in Arthur's case - got to see theirs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was in that respect to fortune he thanked that his pages were so quick and efficient, restoring his modesty swiftly with soft cotton underpants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the rest of his garments that would prove not to be so swift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark blue trousers had pulled up the prince's lithe legs with little problems, however if the slight love handles that pressed against his undergarments had not been warning enough, bucking the trousers on the prince's waist would be so.

Mind you, maybe it wasn't <i>that</i> surprising; Joseph Waters was a handsome and active young man, but never had Arthur met a glutton so unashamed. There was, of course, the eating of delicious treats, which to Arthur's envy, he ate in such quantities half of which would make the skinny youngster worry about his waist. But more so, was Joseph's physique. Arthur had, for a couple of years now, shared a quarters with his fellow. He could still remember the slender, if even slightly toned, young man who first arrived at court. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the Prince James. That was different. Yes, it hurt Joseph to admit to himself that he found Joseph attractive - but James. His Prince was truly dazzling. That was no more easy to acknowledge; Arthur and James had known one another since they were practically toddlers. And, despite a fluctuation in his early teens, the blonde haired prince had always maintained such a lithe physique. He wasn't, nor had ever been toned and athletic, neither - before now - had he really ever had more than a pound of fat around his middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, cakes, pastries, sweets, breads, cheeses, had numbered among the dishes that so often passed James' lips of late. By Arthur's reckoning, the lithe prince with barely a pound on him, had at least a stone of soft fat sitting on his belly - maybe more. Why... why hadn't he noticed before now. And why... god why, did he feel no less aroused by the prince's soft pudgy topless form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...?\" James added, it seemed like minuets but it had only been seconds, but still the two boys had been silent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur rose to his feet, glanced at Joseph briefly before speaking, \"honestly?\" Arthur asked, a small but intently comforting smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly? Yes\" James laughed with a slight hint of impatience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your trousers don't fit, your highness\" Arthur said tactfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The waist band won't tie around your waist\" Joseph added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No?\" James said, seemingly in denial or unawareness, \"did you take the wrong size?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They fitted when you wore them to the springtime banquet, a few months ago\" Arthur said, still tip towing around the subject, hinting at James to understand that he might have grown since then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to say Arthur, I thought I did\" he mulled, clueless, \"why don't they now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've put on a fair bit of weight since then\" Arthur resisted the urge to bite his tongue.</span></div></div>",

I'll work it off easy enough.\" He sighed gently, stepping across the narrow room and perching a nearby sofa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur could not remember it happening before; yes, he was sure Prince James probably had put on a pound or two at times, the winter season for example. Even Arthur did then. But never this much; a stone, at least, Arthur was sure, and it was because of the prince's careless scoffing of sugary and fattening foods, not simply a lack of exercise. Prince James had seldom done much exercise, anyhow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have eaten allot more of late, your- erm James\" he said, switching to the informal and more friendly address which had been indicated as permissible when the Prince had addressed him by his first name. \"And you have gotten quite fat... flabby around the stomach.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" James started, just as he spoke it suddenly felt harder to argue as he noticed the reflection of himself, of his belly, protruded in a a number or rolls an inch or so onto his lap. Was it really that bad? He could barely seat it when standing. His younger brother George had always been chubbier, more prone to gaining weight than his older brother. If it was true, maybe it was easier to him to put on weight than he had thought? When he thought of what he had stuffed in his mouth the past few months, it felt slightly less surprising. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.

It wasn't that bad. Easily hidden beneath loose clothing. His body had not yet begun to show the true signs of gluttony: overhanging bellies, flabby chests,  double chins. George stood up a bit straighter and sucked his stomach in. See, not that bad. Not that bad at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind him, the door creaked open. George jumped at the invasion of  his privacy.

Thank you!\" He waved Lucas out of the room and sat down to begin his meal. He tore away at his first burger and shoveled in most of his fries before Lucas returned with the second platter. Lucas set it down, and watched in awe as George devoured everything hungrily. In his haste, George ignored some of his royal etiquette, and made a bit of a mess. Sitting in only his undergarments, he had grease from his burgers dripping down his rounded, pudgy belly.

Taking the hint, Lucas began to remove the stained garment from George's bloated body, and put it in the clothes basket to be washed.

Richelieu sat in the centre of the semi-circle table facing the throne, Laurance was the third King he'd served, the respect he inspired at court had kept the council from pulling the country into civil war when Laurence was an infant. Now at aged 21 it was supposed to be Laurence's responsibility, though he still felt as uncomfortable and unready for the throne that had been his for nearly 20 years, his lanky body and boyish features made it appear as a child was still sitting on the throne, it didn't help that whenever Laurence felt doubt he unavoidably looked at his 18 year old cousin, Charles Duke d'Lyon. 'Charlie' was ruggedly handsome and athletic, he was also ambitious and charismatic, all the traits one would expect in a King, Laurence couldn't help but feel inadequate in comparison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've more than enough forces at the border to engage, with scouts reporting a two to one advantage in our favour it would be foolish to wait\" one voice argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly\" Charlie agreed slamming his fist down onto the table, \"we ought to take the offensive whilst we maintain the advantage. It's time we finally drove that shewolf from her throne!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be calm your grace\" Richelieu requested, in his firm but quietly spoken way. Charlie hated Queen Mary of Mercia like no other, to the extent he refused to even call her by name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't seriously support depriving Queen Mary of her throne Eminence\" Laurance spoke quietly, he shivered as the words left his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be foolish to propose a full scale invasion in such a short time frame\" Richelieu replied, skillfully avoiding the question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peace surely is the best option..\" Laurence demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than a few murmurs and grunts of discontent the council remained silent, that alone was indicative of their support of Laurence's demand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurence rose to his feet and turned to Richelieu, \"Eminence?\" he asked before turning again to face his cousin in in exasperation. \"Cousin...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peace isn't an option, let alone the best.\" Charlie declared venomously.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I recommend we let cooler heads prevail, once we understand Mercia's response to our actions\" Richelieu at last said his is ever calm voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurence wasn't happy, he slouched back into the throne in frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed?\" Richelieu turned his head around the room looking at the other members of the council, \"Then I suggest we adjourn todays meeting.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurence remained seated as the members filed out, it went badly, but not different to usual. They still behaved as if they were the regency council, rather than advisory council, and in a real sense they were. Laurence knew this couldn't continue, at some point another would likely try to take his throne and force him to abdicate - the most visible and obvious was his own cousin,  Charles Duke d'Lyon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of despondent sulking in the empty council chambers, he once again stood as he decided he would....</span></div></div>",

Their elder brother was the current Prince of Florentine, and the marriage had gained much wealth to fund Laurence's fathers war campaigns. \"Have you come straight from council?\" Cosimo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" Laurance said cheerlessly, \"they are almost in unanimous agreement that peace is not an option. Many, especially my cousin, want war at any cost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"War would be very dangerous, Aquitaine may possess more men, but they are well aware of the instability here... and if threatened would use it to their advantage. In a worse case scenario their agents could assassinate key peacemakers in your council and force the country into civil war.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some members.... don't need such foreign help to facilitate civil war\" Laurance agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The throne is yours dear Laurence\" he said caringly, patting Lawrence's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been mine for 20 years, the Lords of the Council can't get use to not having a regency council.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They must be forced to get use to it your Majesty... the Privy Council still acts as a regency council despite the fact it expired over 2 months ago. You must take strong action to retain your throne and to prevent civil war. You are King and the decisions rest with you as the council must respect.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how... how can I force them to listen\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're late father frequently removed members who disrespected his authority, I see that as your own solution.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless the council doesn't like my policy. I realise must listen to advice, but they advise the same whatever the situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would your policy be?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peace. Castile could fall into hell at any moment, we must not pull ourselves their two with a foolish war with Mercia - one I don't believe they want.\" Laurence looked at his uncle smile as he continued with great confidence , \"if we allied with Mercia we could bring peace to Castile and the entire continent. The momentum is with us, we must get in the driving seat\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a great and ambitious vision your majesty\" Cosimo knew is was ambitious, but Aquitaine was immensely powerful and he understood more than most that Mercia didn't necessarily want war. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it achievable?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are King, you have the ability to achieve more than you give yourself credit for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The council are pushing me to marry one of the Antiquan princesses, or someone from Castile. I was better thinking a Mercian Princess - or perhaps their Queen\" Laurence knew the latter was incredibly controversial, and he even had his own doubts about it's achievable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wish to marry Queen Mary.\" Cosimo said slightly startled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your cousin won't like that!

I think we'll be fine... for the time being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it you have to tell me\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have heard back from Merica, my agents have informed me that there is passage for your policy to commence. They say that Queen Mary is powerhungry, but that war would be her last choice. She favours diplomacy. We should not trust or underestimate this Queen, your Majesty, but it seems that she has her best interests at heart. They can not say how possible a Marriage alliance is to her, but one is almost certainly possible with a member of her family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do we proceed?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We must inform the Queen that we have plans for peace and an alliance, and we must do it though unusual channels, lest it be sabotaged by a naysayer. Should it get as far as negotiations, they would prosper best if you met face to face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will you inform her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suggest that you get the council to agree to send an emissary, with a message of their choosing, and an emissary of your choosing.

We will do as you say. I meet with the Privy Council tomorrow morning. The issue of was Mercia is sure to be raised. Will you inform mother?\" Laurence was barely containing his excitement, he didn't want the throne - but it was his by birthright, and he couldn't wait to get one up on the disrespectful Lords who were trying to take his power for their own gains. Cosimo once again bowed before he stepped quickly out of the throne room.

It didn't take long before they had stripped him right down to his underwear. Laurence always felt inhibited not being fully clothed in front of people, his two valets who had served him since they were boys, and his best friend Louis, were the only people he felt comfortable around. It was fortunate really, for when he was a child and teenager, he had no choice, tradition demanded a King be dressed and undressed by his servants, even beyond his underwear, it obviously served a practical purpose too, most of his clothes were to elaborate for one servant to put on, let alone himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurence dismissed his two valets promptly, it was a hot night, so Laurence had again opted to wear only his lower underwear, thus sleep shirtless.

His servants had bought him a substantial breakfast about twenty minutes back, and unlike normal he had eaten all of it, he had infect ordered them to bring some sugary things for afters. He was just so nervous that he needed something to keep his mind and hands occupied on. The potential scenarios of the council meeting were becoming limitless in his head,  what if they knew his real intent? Regardless of what the council thought and said, it is almost certain that his ambitious cousin would make trouble, for troubles sake if nothing more. Laurence sighed heavily, and leant back onto the headboard, as he did so he heard a gently knock on his door, before it swung open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn came two servants with an assortment of sweets, pastries and cakes. They did as he previously requested and placed them on the bed to his left side, before leaving with the tray and crockery from his breakfast. Laurence smiled at them as they bowed politely before once again leaving to carry out their other duties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all looked so tasty, Laurance couldn't believe he was going to eat more - especially after already finishing a hearty breakfast. Though the young King had always had a sweet tooth, so the ordering of sweets came as a surprise to no one. Determined to try everything, he started eating the various dishes sporadically. A couple of bites of one cake, more of another, a few of squares of chocolate, all washed down with a chocolate milkshake. After about fifteen minutes he was full and could eat no more, his belly was round and bloated, he leant back on his bed and rubbed his bare stomach soothingly. It felt good to be full for once, Laurence looked to his left at leftovers of his 'desert'; he had eaten more than he'd thought, from the various pieces he'd cumulatively eaten almost half a cake, a chocolate bar and a half, and two and a half pastries. Neither this, nor his breakfast were particularly healthy, both would infact be better described as fattening and unhealthy. Not that it mattered, Laurence was incredibly skinny, weighing less than 9 stone, sadly he was also completely untoned and not in the slightest bit muscular, always a mocking point when around his well toned, athletic cousin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Laurance would have to forget this and get dressed for his meeting, as he slid around the discomfort of such a full and bloated belly became apparent. He caught his reflection in the mirror opposite, the roundness of his bloated stomach stood out to much on his very thin frame, he couldn't help but be surprised that he had the room inside to fit the food! </span></div></div>",

First came the most inhibiting bit, the older of the two placed his hands on Laurence waste and unfastened his underwear, next the younger pulled them off from the front so that the young King was no wearing no clothes, he always felt uncomfortable when his valets took off his underwear, despite the fact they were two of the three he seldom felt inhibited around; fortunately after all their years of service they knew this, and quickly pulled on another pair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about ten minuets they had finished dressing Laurence's bottom half, the older valet lifted the waiting corset and placed it around Laurence's middle, personally Laurence had never seen why he need wear a corset, he was very thin anyway, the answer had always been 'it goes with the outfit', somehow it seemed pointless to argue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you breath in slightly, Your Majesty\" the older valet requested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurence complied, though it wasn't easy breathing in while so bloated, his corset, custom made for his small frame, was not shaped to go around his rounded stomach, if they put it on regardless it would become loose when later in the day he was less bloated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother 10 minuets and they'd finished his assemble, extravagant hat and all. </span></div></div>",

He had waited for ages to say what he wished to say, the corset had been incredibly tight and uncomfortable until his bloated stomach had gone down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you know my Lords, my mother, the Dowager Queen, is to travel to Mercia to visit her sister, nephew and nieces in the coming week\" It was a good enough rouse, the dowager Queen had frequently visited family since the death of her husband, her sister is married to the Florentine Ambassador to Mercia. \"I wish to send with her a royal writ, so that she may inform Mercia's Queen of our desire peace, I believe that a writ handed by the Dowager Queen of Aquitaine will create the necessary impression that we are serious about our intentions\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We desire peace?\" his cousin Charlie predictably protested. \"to send such a letter would show weakness\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be foolish to imply our intentions were one folded\" Richelieu started, \"an ultimatum would be wiser.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, why?\" Laurence said, trying to sound annoyed. It was intended that the council would not like his intended writ, he must be seen to climb down and accept the council's will, so that would not suspect the true motive of the event. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs predicted the arguments went on for over an hour, some wanted to say one thing, others another. Laurence was regularly interrupted, and his point lost throughout the somewhat aggressive debate. Sadly it was systematic of the current governance of Aquitaine. The council had become to powerful in his youth and were reluctant to give up any of it. Though the council had agreed to sent a letter with the Dowager Queen, their letter. Two pages, and only one inclusion of the word peace. Laurence put up token resistance but in the end conceded that so long as peace was mentioned there was hope. In fact the letter would never be seen by Queen Mary, The Dowager Queen was to relay a verbal message from the mouth of King Laurence and his uncle. No doubt the Aquitaine ambassador would seek to be present during the meeting, and it wasn't clear to Laurance whether he was in cahoots with council members or not. Regardless secrecy would have to prevail, and the next part was up to Laurence's mother. </span></div></div>",

Most contact would be public, what wasn't would be fleeting and unsuspicious. Everyone knew their parts. Laurence had gone to have lunch at his terrace balcony that overlooked the Great Palace Gardens, his Nicholas Henri, his closest friend, would hopeful be arriving any time soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough Nicholas arrived, he bowed formally as he entered King Laurence's presence, Nicholas Henri was Count of Blois, son of the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, his family, the 'house of Orl\u00e9ans', were second only in rank and stature to the Royal Family. At six foot, Nicholas Henri stood about an inch taller than Laurence, his hair was jet black and his skin almost the palest of whites, the most striking of combinations. He took a seat next to Laurence overlooking the gardens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd council this morning go?\" He asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As argumentative as usual\" Laurence grunted, \"you were at sparring practice at the time, am I right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, not quite as aggressive as your council I'll bet\" Nicholas joked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurence chuckled with him before turning to notice the servants bring in lunch. They place the assortments of savoury and sweets on the table in front of them, before bowing and curtsying respectively, and leaving.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I presume you haven't eaten lunch yet?\" Laurence asked picking up a chicken leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I haven't, I'm starved!\" Nicholas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two chatted allot over lunch as Laurence tried to put the council meeting and his plans to the back of his head for the time being. Laurence had eaten a fair amount of savery foods, meat, bread and the like, but his sweet tooth had compelled him mostly to fill up on the sweets, cakes and pastries. Laurence leant back into the cushioned sofa arm and pulled legs up and curled them slightly so he wouldn't accidently kick Nicholas. His corset had again become tight as his belly bloated and he couldn't help fiddle with the back strings to try and loosen it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alight Laurence?! I know you like your sugary things, but you don't normally eat quite so much for lunch!\" Nicholas asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hungry after that stressful council meeting\" Laurence said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, I can see that\" Nicholas replied, \"would you like me to loosen your corset, looks like your having trouble with it\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's fine\" Laurence lied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't look fine\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicholas stood up and went around the back of the sofa, he put his hand on Laurence's back and tilted him forward slightly before lifting up a two of his layers and pulled the string of the corset. Instantly it felt better, though it became a little tighter once again when Nicholas retied the string. \"Thanks Nich\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My pleasure\" Nicholas said as he sat to take his seat again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurence looked enviously at what Nicholas was wearing, though still Aquitainley extravagant, it wasn't tightly fitted with a corset like Laurence's own apparel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about time you ate something Laurie! Your almost all skin and bones!\" Nicholas said, jest was in his tone but it was still honesty. Though of a small slender build, Nicholas was quite toned and athletic due to the amount of time he spend Knight training, Laurence had seen him shirtless on many occasions and was always impressed, and sometimes even slightly enviously, at his body. Despite this almost perfect (in Laurence's eyes anyway) body, perhaps in testament to the occasion fatty meal Nicholas enjoyed, he still had a slightly flabby midsection around his belly button. Laurence wondered if that was why Nicholas didn't appear bloated now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What shall we do now?\" Nicholas asked as he leant back into his seat. </span></div></div>",

The younger valet then took over untying the corset, as the elder began undressing his bottom half. In less than a minute they had undressed him entirely, Laurence did his best to hide his embarrassment and cover his erection, after one had accidentally brushed against his penis, he suspected the two sensed this and they replaced his underwear faster than usual. They had opted for an ostentatious pair of bed shorts because of the the warmth of the night, though they had pulled them up faster than normal they seemed to be taking an unusual amount of time fastening them, he looked to his side as the younger valet but couldn't quite see what the problem was, though it was done before he had time to worry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" Laurence said shyly, still very embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our pleasure Your Majesty\" The elder one said, leading the bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurence dismissed them and headed into his bedchamber, he noticed a cup of tea and a slice of cake on the bedroom table, as he had requested, the servants must have dropped it off while he was getting changed. As he crossed the room he felt his bed shorts loosen slightly, the valet must not have fixed it as he thought he had - it didn't really matter though, he would be going to bed shortly.

He was right of course, though impossible to see when dressed, while only wearing underwear it was difficult to hide. As well as his ribs being far less viable, his stomach felt and looked far softer, and his belly button appeared somewhat deeper as the flab had grown around it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You needed to add something to the bone... shame its all meat and no muscle\" Nicholas reasoned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really have time to work out\" Laurence lied half heartedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should come martial arts training, or fencing\" Nicholas suggested, \"your eating when you feel stressed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so\" Laurence agreed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I know you well enough to guess cake and sweets are what you've mainly eaten\" Nicholas chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, not a surprise that I like cake?\" Laurence said sarcastically as he took the final bite of his slice of cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what's giving you your podgy belly!\" Nicholas jested, pointing towards the empty plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think I've gained much?\" Laurence asked seriously, he placed his hand on his stomach and rubbed at the soft flab self consciously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea, a only a couple of pounds perhaps... enough that it's viable when you dress like that\" </span></div></div>",

Though he was about only an inch or so taller than Laurence he was slender, slightly toned and quite athletic, though not to the point where he was overly muscled, in fact he himself had a quite flabby belly despite his frequent martial exercise - he guessed because Nicholas loved the odd sugary or fatty meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" Nicholas asked, Laurence didn't reply so he nudged him \"Laurie?..\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah yeah.\" Laurence said taking his mind of Nicholas' body.

It was much later than he intended to get up, judging by how bright it was out he guessed it must at least be midday, perhaps later. He slid up so's he was leaning against his cushioned headboard and stretched his arms, after a moment he looked at the figure sleeping beside him. Laurence had almost forgotten that Nicholas had shared his bed rather than return to his own, they had been up chatting and playing card games until the small hours. This wasn't the first time they'd shared a bed, and like every time before they hadn't done anything - apart from sleep. That wouldn't stop the rumours though, Laurence expected servants had come in and seen them lying together and drawn a very predictable conclusion, though it didn't matter promiscuity was rife in the Aquitaine court, and the rumours were worse, some had him sleeping with men and women he'd never even met. If anything such a rumour about him and Nicholas would dispel any real belief, as people wouldn't know which rumour to believe. Laurence understood that the truth would become clear the second he tried to hush it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurence slipped casually off the bed, and walked quietly around to the other side, he perched on the bed next to where Nicholas was still sleeping and gazed at his cute face, after about thirty seconds he placed his hand on Nicholas' bare shoulder and shook him slightly.  \"Nich... Nich\" he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short time trying to resist waking up, Nicholas opened his eyes and looked at his almost naked friend sitting in front of him, unlike Lorence he'd drunk quite a bit the previous night, for a time he wondered if the two had had sex, he cringed at the thought of having sex with his best friend while drunk and then forgetting about it. Then it became clear to him, he didn't remember doing anything - and besides Laurence hadn't drunk a drop of alcohol, he never did. Laurence was a virgin, the last thing Nicholas could imagine him doing is sleeping with a drunk 'guy' and then being totally comfortable with him the following day. \"Morning\" he at last said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you hungover?\" Laurence asked dotingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no. I'm fine\", he lied, though by the look of Laurence's face he was a convincing liar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay cool\" Laurence got up and peered into the dressing room so see if his valets were about, they weren't. He was reluctant to ask the doorman to request their presence, not when he was only wearing underwear and had another guy in his room, also only wearing underwear. He didn't mind the rumours so much, but he'd rather not feed them while simultaneously embarrassing himself. He headed back into his room where he could see Nicholas sat on the end of his bed drinking a glass of water. \"Hey, Nich, I can't find my servants. Would you help me dress\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sorry\" He answered before processing what Laurence was asking, \"oh, yeah okay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurence entered the dressing chamber and stood on the stall where he is usually dressed, \"cheers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicholas entered a couple of seconds later to see Laurence stood on his dressing stall, \"hmm by 'help you dress', do you actually mean 'dress you' Laurie?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no no. Force of habit. I'll help\" Laurence stepped of his stool, he didn't know the first thing about dressing himself less about choosing what to wear, he flicked through a line of shirts and jerkins passingly, \"any ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something simple... I'm no valet\" he managed a chuckle despite his headache. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about twenty minuets helping Laurence sift through clothes, choosing what to wear, having him change his mind, they finally agreed on a fairly simple ensemble, consisting of only stockings, a hose, a doublet and a jerkin. Laurence stood back on the stool and Nicholas set about dressing him, he pulled on the stocking's first and then followed it up the hose over the top, as they got near Laurence's waist they became significantly tighter, and though, with a bit of tugging, Nicholas managed to position the hose in the right place, he was struggling to buckle them up. \"When did you last wear these?\" he inquired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err, not sure. I don't expect it was any time recently\" Laurence answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you've outgrown them, your waist is to big\" Nicholas pointed out, once again trying, and failing, to buckle them up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh..\" Laurence said, in his dispondant tone, \"what if I breathed in\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicholas nodded and placed his hand flat just bellow Laurence's belly button, It was clear to Nicholas that this was due to Laurence's recent weight gain, especially feeling his soft belly. Nether the less Laurence breathed in and Nicolas managed to buckle the hose up, he stepped back to pick up the doublet and looked at how tight the hose was around Laurence's waist, the way it made his belly protrude slightly over the front, back and sides, made him look much fatter than he actually was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine thanks.\" Laurence said, stopping Nicholas from having to asking whether they were too tight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another ten minuets they were done, Nicholas was quietly pleased with his job of dressing Laurence - he didn't look at all scruffy. Though it certainly didn't want to make a habit of it. He'd dressed back in what he was wearing the previous night, with Laurence help (which wasn't that much use). </span></div></div>",

People voiced opposition to peace still, but without Richelieu or Cousin Charles there to lead opposition or to guide the undecided, councillors tended to speak their minds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Privy Council and the Mercia Privy Council had been exchanging messages for days discussing where and when the proposed negotiations were going to take place. Much to Laurence's surprise the Mercian suggestion of a temporary built palace on the border had gone down well with the council who had agreed with little argument. It had been decided that the Dowager Queen would rule as Regent for the duration of the summit, and most of the members of the Privy Council would remain to advise her. Laurence knew that leaving his mother with the reigns of power, and his best friend Nicolas Henri on the privy council meant any potential coup that he'd been warned about would be very difficult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time ever, Laurence felt content on the throne and optimistic for the future. There was every possibly the peace negotiations with Queen Mary could go badly, that disitents could attempt to disrupt them, but the fact that the summit was happening, between two monarchs was a historic achievement, it had been over half a millennia since an Aquitaine King had last met a Mercian King. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough even if what people said about Queen Mary were only the slightest bit true, this was going to be a tough negotiation. </span></div></div>",

Unfortunately the next part wasn't so quick, by the time they got to his upper half his legs were aching, his upper half was faster, to his great relief they didn't have a second episode of struggling to tie the corset up over his belly, mind you he was bloated then. To finish the ensemble they placed a exotic head piece on his head, it was supposed to be a hat - but in truth it scarcely fitted that description.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurence left the room, his neck felt a little strained, his to valets accompanied him to the door before he dismissed them.

He was to enter through this entrance, Queen Mary, by one on the opposite side before they headed through to the courtyard to 'discuss' the the treaty. Laurence took a deep breath and entered the room, the daunting feeling made carpet feel endless, the trumpets played as the two monarchs entered, a different tune for each one, and heralds called out their names and titles. Behind Laurence stood his 17 year old brother Prince Joseph, and his 20 year old sister Princess Katherine, should the treaty go according to plan they would likley be involved in the marriage deals. Regardless, like Mary he had to be flanked members of his family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the other side walked Queen Mary, he could see two figures behind her, but his eyes could barely get passed her. She was most certainly dressed to impress, she wore a golden, purple and scarlet dress, her hair was the most elaborate hairstyle he'd seen in years, on top and around it sat a exquisite jewel encrusted headdress.  She was beauty was surprising, and somewhat disconcerting. He couldn't help find himself becoming intimidated by her very presence. Behind her stood a guy and a women around his age, the guy was exquisitely dressed, fashionably so. Not so over the top as Queen Mary, or Laurence himself. The women, was dressed in a elegant scarlet dress, not dissimilar to Queen Mary's, though far simpler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the centre, Laurence bowed, a second later she followed suit and curtseyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Queen Mary\" Laurence spoke first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"King Laurence\" Queen Mary replied a second later. She was cleverly allowing him to make the first moves, by doing this he was bowing and addressing her first - thus inserting her above him. \"Allow me to introduce my brother...  Prince James, Crown Prince apparent.  He stepped forward and knelt in front of Laurence, as per protocol he held his hand out and the Prince kissed it. The Prince then rose, and when Laurence saw his gorgeous face, he couldn't help going weak in the knees. The Prince shot Laurence a warm look and a cheeky smile, something told Laurence that he'd noticed. The Prince then stepped backwards, retaking his place behind her. \"and my cousin, Princess Margaret\" the Princess step forward and bar the look, did the same as the Prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I introduce, my brother Prince Joseph\" Prince Joseph stepped forward and knelt before Queen Mary and kissed her hand when she placed it in front of him. \"And my sister, the Princess Katherine, Countess d'Bourbon\" likewise she did as her brother, and the Mercian princes did. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was more a formality to 'agree'.

After half an hours worth of discussion they finally got around to the marriage alliances. Informally they had decided who would be marrying who, but for formality and tradition's sake the monarch must offer the Princess for marriage, rather Prince.

The difference in dress between the two courts was stark, there were allot of similarities true, both were over the top and ostentatious, but the Mercian ones seemed somewhat more sensible and graceful than the Aquitaine ones.

Then the desert! The choices of ice cream, cakes, pastries were more expansive than he'd ever seen, ones from both sides of the border - some that he'd never tasted before. By the bite Laurence could feel his stomach get more bloated, and his corset more tight, but the food was so delicious that he couldn't stop. By the end of the meal Laurence was absolutely stuffed, he doubted he'd ever eaten so much in the whole of his life, not even in the last few stressful months, it wasn't one of those feasts that was likely to occur  again for a very long time, even at other banquets such as the various weddings. This was not only celebrating the future marriage of two monarchs, but peace, a treaty, 2 other royal marriages. Evens like this rarely happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately chat continued for a while after every one had finished, and it allowed the bloating to go down before he again had to move. </span></div></div>",

Similarly James had a slender body but a slightly pudgy stomach, however Laurence's body was far thinner, but his stomach felt softer, and appeared far flabbier than his own, he couldn't stop him self from rubbing and squeezing it sensually.  </span></div></div>",

It was almost as if he wasn't King.. and for how long could he truly continue king? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he had reached the privacy of his bedchamber, he pressed the door closed with a bang and let out another deep and irritated sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bastards\" he muttered to himself as he pulled off his jerkin and tossed it angrily to the floor. Turning on his heel, he paced from side to side. His irritability in private was, for now, all that w as keeping the King from losing his temper in front of his Ministers, at council. Embarrassing himself, not them, he knew. An childish outburst was all they needed to lever him out of decisions even further, it wasn't as if he was in position to resist them; for all he knew, there behavior was intentional. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn them\" he uttered, cursing again, this time under his breath.

Where, as a teenager, Laurence would have usually passed on desert, he was now having not just one slice of cake or pastry, but two, or occasionally three. Just the thought of the sugary, and creamy chocolate gateaux could whet his appetite; encouraging him to take a snack between meals, or, sometimes before bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike much of the political maneuverings, normal human interactions, for naive Laurence this increase in weight was something that had so far gone over his head. Not the tightness of trousers, or the slight jiggle of the belly, had caught his attention any more than his delight that he was looking less frail; and, catching a rejection of his smooth skin, and not so fragile body in the mirror, this was what he noticed now.

Long had he envied Charlie's chiseled abdomen; an impressively athletic physique he had retained since puberty. It was a body that Laurence could only dream of possessing; just feeling his smooth skinned abs stirred an arousal in the young man he was scared to admit to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould Charlie have allowed him to touch his bare flesh had he known what Laurence was thinking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Sorry\" Laurence uttered suddenly after his fingers swept the dip of his cousin's navel, only then realising that he had been caressing Charlie's stomach. \"I.. erm. Didn't...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, cousin\" he replied with a grin, \"you were gentle.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the moment, Charles had decided to play ignorant to Laurence's desires; despite him having initiated the physical contact, it seemed that the king had worried himself that it was inappropriate; not before a minuet or two of mild fondling. It actually felt nice; but that didn't matter, getting the king's trust was crucial. The King had a good relationship with his mother and siblings - for him to outmaneuver the Archbishop he would need the king's favour, and this was something more intimate that the king's brothers could not possibly offer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne step at a time, he reminded himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I didn't mean, to... you know\" he pushed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, you were very gentle, majesty\" Charlie repeated, again acting ignorant to what he suspected Laurence was truly asking. The brown haired Duke pondered for a moment before lifting his hands once more, and placing one on the curve of the king's much softer abdomen; the squishy flesh jiggled slightly as he moved his hand up and down. Charlie had seen it when he first set eyes on his cousin's nude upper body; the protruding belly over the over tightened waist band; the scrawny king had managed to put on a fair bit of weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you were gentle too\" Laurence managed to say when Charlie retracted his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you've managed to get yourself a bit of a belly\" Charlie said, both before and after he said it he wondered if the personal remark was worth it. Personal was certainly useful, and referencing that might in time to come make Laurence more susceptible to his flirting. It might also subtly encourage the king into a healthier diet. Something that his two pudgy younger brothers ought to also take on board. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To bad he was reading more in to it than his cousin intended. Plus, Charlie was his cousin - this was wrong in more than one way. It took a few moments for Charlie's comments to register in his very naive and oblivious mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" he said with a note of curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your stomach felt a little squishy\" he rephrased, still speaking honestly, though with less directness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so?\" Laurence asked, resisting the urge to put his own hand on his stomach to deny or confirm his cousins suggestion. Was Charlie suggesting that he was getting fat? When Charlie didn't respond immediately to that question, Laurence opened his mouth once again to speak, \"You think I'm getting fat?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! I don't think your fat\" Charlie denied carefully, \"just a little pudgy. It's nothing to worry about. It happens to us all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt does? Laurence wondered to himself, certainly his brothers weren't as skinny as they had once been - although they had never been quite so scrawny as Laurence. Somehow he doubted that it happened to Charlie; his body was so firm that Laurence could say with a certain confidence that he did not have a bit of a belly, nor had he ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess your right.\"</span></div></div>",

They were a slender family - especially he and Felipe, and - of the three - only the thicker set Joseph showed any sign of consciousness about his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, yet another taxing session of council, Laurence could barely wait for dinner to be over so that he could enjoy aid back and relaxed company of his brothers for the evening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His was a throne that owed its right to rule to God, and only God. The nobles of court could compete for places at court, but none in the royal House of Orleans owed it's place to their support, and even his father - no doubt a better ruler than he - did not scrape at their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, Laurence would have to see where that naive strategy took him.

As with most years the heat meant that nobles and commoners alike wore clothes far lighter. Castile's court had forwent the extravagance seen in Merica and Aquitaine, though this was never surprising, it was doubtful that to many Castilean nobles cared. It's Crown Prince certainly didn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrince Ferdinand sat upon a quiet balcony overlooking an expansive, but empty swimming pool. He was seated on a throne like chair,  his curly dark brown hair waved in the soft breeze, it framed his youthful handsome face with a note of extravagance, of a gold torque in crested with jewels that saw around his neck, he was wearing very little, his upper body was bare. He dressed only in a rich piece of linen fastened around his waist down to just above his knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Ferdinand's feet sat two attractive guys of similar age, dressed only in underpants. The one on the left, Jose had straight ear length dark hair that had clearly been groomed to perfection. The other, Carlos, had equally dark, but wavy hair that was styled in a ruffled untidy manner. Both boys had well toned four packs, and were each stroking one of Prince Ferdinand's legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike his Jose and Carlos, his companions, and favourites, Ferdinand's body was not well sculpted, he had been relatively skinny in his childhood, though now his thin and lanky body had started to become chubby, from the gorging and relaxing he spent everyday doing,  even now he snacked on decadent snacks. It was surprising that he wasn't fatter considering just how much he ate, and how little he exercised; his stomach wasn't yet bulging over the sides of his shorts, even when sitting, though this was certainly the direction it was going. Already when sat forward, a sizeable roll of flab did hang over the front of his waist, and his belly button had become quite deep. . Ferdinand was quite oblivious his weight gain, he looking at his slightly built body, he still could see himself as a toned and handsome young man. It was true that he was still handsome, but even when standing where his stomach fat was far less obvious, his abs were far from visible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was divine\" Ferdinand said as he licked his lips from finishing his snack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you enjoyed it, my prince\" Jose said, tubing his hand soothingly up and down Ferdinand's left leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wouldn't mind\" Ferdinand said to both Jose and Carlos, he didn't need to go any further, he often asked them, his two closest companions, after he had finished eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, my prince\" Carlos said sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be our pleasure\" Jose added; it had become routine and neither had any problem in doing it. They both stood up and gently lifted Ferdinand to the ground; he wasn't light, but they were both quite strong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlos sat up straight with his back against a cushioned block, Ferdinand then sat upright between his legs and leaned comfortably into his arms. Jose then sat cross legged next to Ferdinand and started rubbing his soft upper chest. He then moved down to Ferdinand's bliss spot: his stomach. He relaxed deeply into Jose's chest as Carlos rubbed, patted and massaged his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlos and Jose had done this for years now, since they were all in their early teens, when Ferdinand was slender, long before he'd put on any weight. He had enjoyed his more muscular, slimmer body to be massaged just as much. The three had first met at 11 years old, when Carlos and Jose's fathers had first brought them to court. Back then Ferdinand hadn't been lazy in the slightest, the three had usually spent there days engaging in various sports, they swam, sparred, jogged and wrestled. Unsurprisingly all three boys had been extremely fit, and had impressive abdominal muscles and biceps, for their age. </span></div></div>",

Still though, he did not relish the thought of having to walk near naked back to the palace on account of said friend's stupidity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" Jose said with a sigh, not wishing to labour the point further. \"But... seriously, you can't go in that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I know\" Ferdinand said, brushing his hand across Jose's shoulder, before turning back to Carlos. \"Let me borrow that outfit again. The one you gave me when...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I know which one\" he replied, retreating calmly into the closet to retrieve the rich, if plain and austere looking outfit he had dressed his hungover friend in on that previous occasion. It only took him a few minuets to retrieve the basic garments; returning to the main bed chamber to find Ferdinand stripped down to his underwear, and leaning on the edge of his bed. \"Here.\"</span></div></div>",

Tossing the fine white silk shirt on to the bed, he dropped the dark blue trousers to the floor, and slipped each foot and leg into them. That intimidate rub against his skin was... nice, gentle. Just serving to remind Ferdinand that some of the more elaborate clothing he was expected to wear at court were also blood uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat moment of ease and comfort ended swiftly, however, when he pulled the trousers onto his waist, and attempted to fasten them. Failing to do so on his first try, he breathed in as much as he could as he attempted a second, this time managing to touch each side together, but ultimately failing to fasten before he had to breath out. \"Carlos, are you sure these are the trousers you lent me before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certain yes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not Jose's\" he wondered, remembering that Jose had a slightly thinner waist than he and Carlos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they're not mine\" Jose interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They've always been a bit... snug\" Carlos admitted, \"but no more so than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod Ferdinand pulled the trousers up once more and breathed in deeply, rapidly pulling the waist band once again to fasten.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Today was the first day of summer, well officially according to the calender atleast; it had been scorching for weeks now. Right across the coast the commoners of Castile filled the beaches, here in Royal Palace at Jecca almost everything took place in the gardens of Royal Palace, court, parties, nobles pleasure time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerdinand couldn't help feeling slightly sorry for the women; they still wore their enormous and extravagant dresses, though summer-dress was made of lighter fabrics, there were no allowances made for their comfort. As in the other two great Kingdoms to the north, women had to dress respectfully. Men on the other hand were able to wear as little - with the exception of underpants - as they wanted, obviously their was a dress code at important court functions. Ferdinand had noticed that this dress-freedom, widely known as the summer liberty, was really only embraced by the young, presumably due to most nobleman wishing to always to dress to impress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe summer liberty meant the almost inclusive and carefully observed tradition of fasting was required, which young men and boys followed in the three months preceding the summer. This because of the widespread feasting that happened thorough out the winter season. For some this tradition of fasting was more difficult and strict than for others, it usually depended on just how much was eaten during the winter season. It was seen to be important that young men looked healthy and fit, especially if they dressed liberally in summer. This covered young boys as well, Ferdinand had followed this tradition for 4 years now, ever since he was 7, despite the fact that he hadn't really dressed that casually until he was 9. As with last year, he would wear only his underwear for most of the summer season. The fasting tradition was more important for him this year as he had eaten far more in the previous winter than the one last year, which had resulted in him gaining over 8 pounds, double last year's.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerdinand remembered how displeased his governess had been, at the time he hadn't cared. That winter had been fantastic, just relaxing and almost gorging himself on the massive variety of delicious foods. Though he had felt displeasure and slight embarrassed at the fact that Jose and Carlos had only gained only 5 pounds between them throughout feast season. </span></div></div>",

The three all were taking full example of the summer liberty, whilst Carlos and Jose both wore cream underwear that went as far as their knees, Ferdinand's went down only a few inches. \"Talk about liberal\" Carlos said, noting just how short his underwear was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your both looking good\" Jose said to Carlos and Ferdinand \"I take it the fast was a success\" he said asking them about their successes, whilst Ferdinand had gained eight pounds Carlos had only gained 3, and Jose only 2. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it was indeed.

They were being honest, because although Ferdinand was a good few pounds heavier than both of them he was still skinny, or slim at least. He did still have a small but noticeable layer of flab on his stomach, that neither of them had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't loose all your weight last for summer either.\" Jose teased. That was also true, before last winter he had weighed only 92 pounds and over the feasting season gained 4 pounds, and then lost only a pound for summer season. It was a thought, he'd never really lost that much of the extra weight he gained in winter, despite his 'best' efforts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Currently seven pounds of unlost feast weight\" Ferdinand acknowledged tapping his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you lost that 7 pounds you'd weigh the same as me again\" Carlos added, both he Ferdinand and Jose were all roughly the same height and had the same slight build, there was only a pounds difference in Carlos and Jose's weight, and with exception to the fat Ferdinand's stomach was carrying they all appeared to be about the same size. They weren't that surprised that Ferdinand didn't care, he was always extremely laid back, fortunately he wasn't lazy or the weight would do incredible damage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it's just fortunate that you can carry it off\" Carlos conceded, he put of of his arm around Ferdinand and used the other to tap his stomach. </span></div></div>",

They had spend most of the week relaxing in the heat, sleeping, tanning and perhaps a little too much time eating. Jose remembered on the first day of summer them having a chat about there bodies, Carlos had teased Ferdinand a little bit about being slightly chubby, and Ferdinand had teased Carlos and Jose for being so skinny. Since that day they had all shared enormous lunches together everyday, the portions were far to big for boys there age. Though most days they didn't have breakfast or dinner together, the massive lunch and the assortment of snacks throughout the day was enough. Jose had gained a pound, in a week. He wasn't sure about Carlos and Ferdinand, but they must have gained something too. Especially by his recollection he himself had eaten the least amount of food of the three. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJose could barely believe it, after all the hard work of the fasting season, plus he'd only gained 2 pounds in the whole of the feasting season. Obviously he didn't expect Ferdinand to care that much, but he was slightly surprised about Carlos. The three were again just in their short trousers lounging in front of the lake. Jose looked at Carlos and Ferdinand's bare stomach and wondered if they had gained any weight, like Jose, Carlos still looked very skinny, and perhaps even a bit toned. Ferdinand on the other hand, whilst looking slender had a definite layer of flab on his stomach. Though he had had that before, hadn't he? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 45 minuets later after another large lunch, as they sat leant against a tree as their bloated stomachs went down Jose wondered again if he should broach the subject with Carlos and Ferdinand. It had crossed his mind that it might only be him who was gaining the weight, after all he was the lightest and the thinnest. Did he really want to highlight his own gain if they hadn't gained anything. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was only a pound, and he really didn't want to highlight the fact that he had gained anything to them, if they hadn't. He could see Carlos leaning forward, unlike Ferdinand and Jose he had no flab hanging over to speak of, it was odd considering Jose weighed no more, in fact he most likely weighed less than Carlos, that when he leant forward he could feel a tiny amount of belly fat hang over his own waist. Perhaps Carlos and Ferdinand were exercising more than Jose was, that thought made him instantly feel bad, and in need of exercise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had eaten a fair bit last summer, and other than expected weight with growing up, Jose hadn't gained anything. It was far less humid last year though, and there was a nice cool breeze so the amount of exercise they had done was far more. Hopefully this would be the case going on in the summer, it couldn't stay this hot for that much longer. The boys of Castile could and must be better than the nancys of Aquitaine and apaths of Merica, eating to much wasn't the way. When they got older as the sons of Dukes, all would become knights, and would need to be at the peak of their physical fitness, after his father and grandfather Ferdinand would also be king. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough not much of a king if he keeps dallying with other guys like that, Jose thought as he spied the two of them cuddling one another again. It was cute, and Jose so much wanted to join them, but the thought of his fathers horror of his son engaging in any homosexual act put him off.</span></div></div>",

There had been no exercise, and as a result of the excessive lunches Jose had gained weight, far more than a pound. He could feel it on his stomach. It had become soft and flabby, his belly button had become far deeper. He had tried and almost successfully put the idea of it to the back of his head after he decided not to mention it, and hadn't weighed himself since. Seeing Ferdinand and Carlos shirtless everyday had also meant that he hadn't noticed any change in them either. He had decided to chill and not get in their faces about it, and had succeeded, not only had he not noticed whether they had gained or not, he had failed to notice how chubby his stomach had got. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got up this morning he had for the first time seen his reflection in the mirror as he sat down, he had remembered 2 months ago thinking about his own tiny belly rolls when he sat forward. This morning he had seen just how big those rolls had become, sitting tilted only slightly forward they overhung by over an inch. The surprise had forced him to be late meeting Carlos and Ferdinand by the pool, so he could go and weigh himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately the palace was quite, and nobody had seen him slip into the room with the scales to use them. Even better nobody was even in the room. Nervously he stepped onto them, as the weights moved to find a balance with his body weight. After about 30 seconds the numbers began to appear: then eventually they did, 105.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n105.... 105. He had gained over 9 pounds since he last weighed himself. He had been 94 at the beginning of summer, now he'd gained more than he'd even Ferdinand gained in the feasting season.

It settled on 112.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit\" Carlos said, truly shocked \"What's that I've gained?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Errr... 17 pounds\" Jose worked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's more than even me!\" Ferdinand said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlos appeared shocked, but not horrified. He quickly returned to his normal calm, happy mood. Looking at him, it was hard to see how they missed it. Ferdinand was still a fair bit heavier, over 10 pounds heavier than Jose and 4 pounds heavier than Carlos. But the fact that Carlos had been only 95 pounds, meant that he had gained the most. His priviously toned and slender stomach was now very soft. Though unlike Ferdinand, and to a smaller degree Jose, Carlos' stomach wasn't bulging over his sides, his belly was massive, considering how thin he'd been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't believe your belly's not bulging over your sides\" Ferdinand noticed, \"look at Jose and me\". He drew attention to Jose's belly as well as his own. Jose's stomach was curving over his sides slightly, especially when wearing tight clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know\" Jose added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My belly's still pretty big you guys\" Carlos reminded them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit down quickly\" Jose said, guiding Carlos quickly towards a chair. When seated, his belly at the front protruded quite a bit, far more than what Jose's did. \"there the belly\" Jose said, taking a seat next to Carlos, he didn't feel as concious about his own stomach beside Carlos, it was hanging over his waist now, but it looked far less comparatively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's 40 pounds of belly fat here guys!, including the weight I didn't drop earlier this year\" </span></div></div>",

Also he sort of enjoyed being overweight, and he was pretty sure that the others were too. \"Do you want to go find something else to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, Carlos and Ferdinand said yes. They headed out of the weighing room, and made their way to the place where they usually ate. Food was brought to three of them, and more than they usually receive. They couldn't help but eat and eat and eat. Surprisingly Jose let go and end up eating more than all of them. They then just sat there all bloated. Ferdinand and Carlos were cuddling, and Jose eventually joined in.  He didn't care what anyone thought anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Jose you really packed in the food,\" Carlos said with a grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you ate more than Carlos and I combined,\" Ferdinand added in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Jose groaned. \"I have to have gained at least five more pounds.

His father died in battle (alongside his uncle, the former King), prior to his birth. The ruggedly handsome Charlie is athletically built and physically strong, on account of regularly working out. Charlie is a deeply ambitious and stronger willed than his cousin the King, whist he doesn\u2019t hate his cousin Laurence he resents his position on the throne, and considers him inadequate for the role. He hates no one more than Queen Mary of neighbouring Merica, often referring to her as the \u2018She wolf of Merica\u2019, as she is often known at the Aquitaine court. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Name and title:</b>\tHenry, Comte de Levroux <i>(Comte of Levroux)</i><br>\r\n<b>Age:</b>\t19<br>\r\n<b>Complexion:</b> Pale<br>\r\n<b>Hair:</b>\tDark brown<br>\r\n<b>Height:</b> 5'8\"\t<br>\r\n<b>Weight:</b> 11 stone 3 lbs --- 157 lbs<br>\r\n<b>Body type:</b> Skinny-fat<br>\r\n<b>Description:</b> Henry, Comte de Levroux, is the eldest child and the only son and heir of the Duke de Alacante, the richest man in Aquitaine. His father's position as privy councillor (and a member of the regency council) resulted in Henry being largely raised in court. Henry was skinny and hardly ate anything, much to the worry of his doctors, until he hit puberty and he began to fill our and gain rapidly (at age 12 he doubled his weight within 2 years from 4 stone to over 8 stone). Now weighing over 11 stone the skinny-fat Henry appears still to be fairly slender, though his stomach is not.... far from.

He has recently arrived at the Mercian court with his mother, father and two sisters; as his father begins his tenure as Consol to Mercia, Ezio and his family must learn to adjust to the court of such a powerful and influential nation. Ezio is intelligent, bookish and an introvert and feels uncomfortable around people he is unfamiliar with his; he is also very thin, and eats comparatively little food. As his sisters flaunt and flurt in this exciting court, Ezio is coming to terms with being gay, as he comes to the age where his future marriage must be decided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Name and title:</b>\tLord Francesco Morrette<br>\r\n<b>Age:</b>\t15<br>\r\n<b>Complexion:</b> Pale olive tan<br>\r\n<b>Hair:</b>\tLight brown<br>\r\n<b>Height:</b> 5'7\t<br>\r\n<b>Weight:</b> 9 stone 12 lbs --- 138 lbs <br>\r\n<b>Body type:</b> Average<br>\r\n<b>Description:</b> Francesco Petro is the only child of Lord Petro Morette a Magistrate of the Signoria (ruling council of the Si\u00e8cle Republic), and the nephew of the Gonfaloniere.

Though that was nothing when compared to the first sight when entering the harbour; the Florentine shuttle they travelled on was dwarfed by the Mercian battleships and galleons, everyone in Florentine knows about the legendary Royal Navy of Merica, only seeing it first hand could Ezio could understand the power of this Kingdom. No wonder Florentine is so eager to be allied with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ezio, and his family, entered the Royal Palace and were guided toward there temporary accommodation, the palace's guest apartments, Ezio and his sisters, Margaret and Jane, gazed in fascination at their first sights of the court's formalities, style and fashions. Mercia wasn't so much famed for it's ostentatiousness like Aquitaine, but still this court must gave them a good run for there money. Margaret and Jane were mesmerized by the gowns, shoes and head dresses, the creative designs, the rich colours and jewels. The sheer beauty of it all had them both near infatuation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEzio too was fascinated by his surroundings, male fashions were also very different from back home, some of the most exotic and extravagant styles here would be considered quite feminine back home. To most, perhaps, but Ezio would disagree. His admiration went beyond the beautiful clothing, to those wearing it. Young blonde, pale and handsome Mercian boys, Ezio almost scratched himself for thinking of such a thing, about someone of the same gender. He forced himself to look away, as they moved past the bustling court rooms towards the guest apartments.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are\" the servant guiding the family opened the door to reveal a spacious apartment. \"Your arrival has been announced, I'm told a Lord of the Privy Council will be along before long to welcome you and make further arrangements\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much appreciated\" Ezio's father replied graciously handing the servant a pouch of coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much, your excellency\" The servant respectfully gave a slight bow. As he left the door closed heavily to a thump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother\" Jane finally broke her silence, \"when can we go clothes shopping\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We look so drab, and our heads look positively naked!\" Margaret added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have nice clothes girls, don't belittle your god appreciated privileges\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll need some new clothes\" Ezio's father conceded, \"It may be vanity on the girls parts, but we must be respectful of this court's traditions.... especially when we meet Queen Mary\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEzio had disappeared into the room that was to be his, and lied on his bed and gave a large sigh, it was stressful and depressing suppressing his feelings, but it was his duty to his family and his city to do as expected of him. And other guys wouldn't fit into that. From his room, Ezio could hear a loud knock on the apparently door, he got up and entered the room as a servent opened the door and announced the visitor, the Duke of Northton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Grace\" Ezio's father bowed, second's later Ezio, his sisters and mother followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Excellency, I hope you've settled in\" The Duke replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... it's a lovely city and palace. The girls are in awe\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duke chuckled, \"I am not surprised, court is an exciting place for ones so young. The Queen has informed me that as a welcome gift, you are all too place orders from the court tailors. She looks forward to meeting you tomorrow lunch time.\"</span></div></div>",

He felt so overdressed; on his upper body he was was wearing both a doublet and a jerkin along with slops, loosely fitting baggy trousers, cut to mid-thigh, all in such rich colours. To top it off he had a flat cap perched on top of his curly dark brown hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel so overdressed, how can they wear so much?\" He asked his mother, just as his sisters entered the room in ornate red dresses, topped with extravagant head dresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be a damp rag Ezio!\" Margaret responded briskly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, how can you not like this dress\" Jane added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay that's enough\" his mother said sternly, guiding her three children toward the door, \"your father met with members of the privy council an hour ago, and we're due to meet Queen Mary within the next fifteen minuets\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord and Lady De Santis stood with their children, Ezio, Jane, Margret, just out the throne room, as they waited to be received by Queen Mary. Ezio fiddled nervously with his sleeves as they waited, he shivered in anticipation. He hated meeting new people, and this Queen Mary was one of the most powerful people in the world, no doubt she was going to be intimidating, a women in a position in power was rare, especially in this case where her younger brother and uncle were both favoured for the throne, despite this she rules unopposed and peacefully within her own realm. Suddenly the doors swung open, and the 4 of them entered the massive room, and walked respectfully towards the throne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Royal Majesty\" Lord De Santis gave a low bow, Ezio followed suit, as his mother and daughter gave equally low and sweeping curtsies. They remained down until the beautiful Queen Mary turned her hand indicating they should rise. Her clothing was so unique, it extruded a sense of wealth, power and authority, her head dress stood almost a foot high upon her lovely blonde hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellency\" She at last spoke, following up by a signal that they were told about earlier. In order of importance the family approached her, knelt, was given a blessing and kissed her hand. Ezio went third, after his mother but before his sisters. Ezio fealt even wose now, he had shaken like a leaf the whole time he knelt at her feat, he hoped she didn't get the wrong impression. Ezio heard another loud bang as a side door aproached and three figures entered, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me to introduce me my mother the dowager Queen Katherine\" Queen Mary rose from her throne to introduce her family, Ezio shook more as it became clear that they were now going to meet the hole of the immediate and leading members of the royal family, and my brothers \"Crown Prince James, and Prince George\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStood next to the regal dowager Queen were two boys, the younger, George stood shorter and appeared somewhat chubbier than his older brother. James stood at roughly the same at Ezio, he was looked to be about the same age. Out of the three, he approached Ezio, bowing respectful to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your highness\" Ezio returned the bow. He was having a hard time not swooning, Prince James was incredibly attractive, as the rumours had told, Ezio couldn't believe that he was choosing to speak to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Ezio wasn't it\" Prince James said softly in a friendly tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes your highness... err Prince James\" Ezio replied tensely, he was shaking more than before, half out of pure excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your shaking... are you cold\" Prince James asked kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your country is far colder than mine....also truthfully I am very nervous around new company... I'm sorry\" Ezio replied, he thought honestly served him better, he couldn't think of what else to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need sir, I hate these formal things two, your mother and father will likely be longer than you... once you are done it would be my pleasure to give you and your sisters a tour of palace\" Prince James said, leaving by the side door without waiting for a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minuets Lord De Santis signalled for Ezio, Margret and Jane to leave. The room outside was bustling, Ezio could help but wonder what they were discussing inside the throne room. Jane and Margaret caught the eye of boys, and left Ezio alone as they mingled and flirted with every boy they could. Ezio found a seat near the end of the room and prepared to wait for his mother and father to exit the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Ezio\" Prince James called from across the hall, bizarrely, nobles bowed as he strode across the floor towards Ezio. \"Still up for that tour?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes of course your highness.... I can't see where my sisters are gone though\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their loss\" Prince James joked in his sweet voice, \"I guess it's just the two of us then\" he tapped Ezio's shoulder and the two left the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I doubt you'd consider my favoured past times.... fun\" Ezio responded light heartedly, \"I'm not really particularly fond of the parties and such.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, to look at you I didn't think you were a big party animal\" he replied with a big grin on his face. \"So...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like reading... history mainly. Your country's is particularly interesting\" Ezio noted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"History.... hmmm, good choice, good choice\" Prince James chuckled, \"I wouldn't say parties were my 'favourite' thing either, but you know court life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" Ezio croaked slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though... a good looking guy like you would do well at court\" Prince James pointed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, your highness, but I don't thi...\" Ezio started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you had many admires back home in Florentine?\" James continued.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEzio previously fiddled with his hair, he wasn't use to conversation like this, not to mention that he had nothing to tell. It felt slightly pathetic, oh how he hated being so social awkward. What would he say, as the son of a leading noble he had met many girls, though he had taken little interest in them... in that way, and as far as he'd noticed they'd taken little interest in him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay... I don't want to intrude\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I erm, don't know... I don't think so\" Ezio conceded honestly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I find that difficult to believe\" Prince James tapped his hand gently on Ezio's shoulder as he said it. \"Perhaps Mercian ladies will be different\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps, I think they also found me dull\" Ezio added, light heartedly, \"you though.... girls as far as Florantine have talked of you, and now I can see why\" Ezio looked slightly to the left at Prince James, he was one of the most handsome, cutest guys he'd ever seen, but it was painful to even acknowledge to himself that he was thinking such thinks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They've heard of me in Floreantine?\" Prince James asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEzio chuckled \"you can't be surprised your highness...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hard to say anything without saying vain\" James joined in, \"though I would lie that it's flattering, I wish they didn't\" he added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of his jerkin fealt like loose, Ezio couldn't help fiddling, but it was getting hard to hide the fact, but he didn't want to be rude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" James stopped moving so allow Ezio to sort himself out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These clothes are so fancy... they take getting use to\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like your jerkin has slipped\" James pointed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn...\" Ezio muttered under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come with me and I'll help you retighten it\" Prince James offered. </span></div></div>",

On the one bellow, Prince James could see where the problem was, there was a sizable tear in the fabric, that had caused both jerkins to slip, and now in the case of the upper one, fall off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a large tear that has damaged the coupling\" Prince James undid the bottom of the knot to he could retye it, this Jerkin was heavy though and unravelled the thread completely and fell to the floor with a thud. \"I did not expect that to happen...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEzio suddenly felt really self concious, Prince James had found the problem, when he put it on earlier he must have torn the lower Jerkin and not tied either up probably. And now his midriff was exposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, I'm really sorry\" Prince James said sorry, trying not to look at Ezio, who he could see was visibly self conscious about what had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no it's okay.. it's my fault.. these clothes are difficult to fathom\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are indeed. My valets normally do my own dressing.... so I'm afraid I'm not so much an expert\" Prince James admitted. He looked carefully at Ezio, he had thought that Ezio to be wearing a corset or something... but he wasn't, he looked so thin. From just looking at his midriff, James could see Ezio's ribs, he looked as if he didn't eat anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Ezio asked nervously. </span></div></div>",

Court life has fattened most of them.\" James explained, as he just fished reattaching Ezio's jurkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not you?\" Ezio asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I am perhaps a couple of pounds fatter than should be\" James chuckled, he placed his hand on his stomach. This was perhaps slight exaggeration, James was extremely slender, though as had admitted the fattening cuisine at court meant that his stomach had a little belly fat on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should be?\" Ezio smiled back, he hadn't been sure what to say. He was sure James must be exaggerating, he look so slim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only after I started living at court permanently I gained a few pounds, which seems to have gone to my stomach.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you go thinking that people in Florentine are malnourished, I've always eaten less than the average guy my age.\" Ezio explained, he had loosened up and felt able to talk far more candidly to Prince James, without such a worry about what he should say next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames chuckled, \"Haha, I was wondering if I should ask if it was a Florentine thing! I thought it might sound a little tactless\". Ezio grinned back at James, trying not to look into his eyes. \"Court will soon fatten you up\" he added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEzio appreciated the sentiment, and despite it's less serious nature he did hate being so gravely thin, though he self-consciously crossed his arms over his bare stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, lets get your jerkin back on\" James lifted the jerkin from the floor and placed it around Ezio's chest, and tied it up as tightly as he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

As he'd explained to Prince James many Florentines did eat this way, and unlike Mercians the far warmer climate meant hiding it was far more difficult. Traditionally because of this youths and younger adults would fast for a period before the hot season, it was seen as acceptable even appropriate; though only for males, never women; eating too excessively was seen as unlady like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how you feel... sort of\" James replied, he had at last sat down after reattaching Ezio's jerkin, on a couch facing an arm chair that Ezio was perched in. \"I can always help you fatten up. I'm at court permanently, and I know which food to eat and avoid\" He grinned kindly. James's younger brother George use to be slender when he was about 12 or 13, in the years since he came to court he'd gotten rather fat, he was 14 now and James was sure that George probably weighed more than he did. Of course he wasn't overweight or anything, and his dress sense did a good job hiding his weight, but James had seen his podgy stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

James was recalled from the marches, as was many of the solders. Though he understood the Royal Legion was remaining there. Ezio had been relieved that James had come back safe, he didn't have too many friends at court, and he longed for some friendly company with someone he felt he got on well with. Further than that, Prince James had invited Ezio for afternoon tea at the Crown Prince's estate in the Palace complex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEzio had been pleased with the invitation, he had encouraged all his children to become friendly with courtiers to heighten their position, he was glad that Ezio had become friendly of someone of such high position, and wasn't flirting with every boy at court like his sisters, Margaret and Jane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA carriage had taken Ezio to down the road to the Crown Prince's Estate, it was still attached to the main palace, but also formed it's own entity in the complex. He was still getting use to just how massive the palace was, it was like a city within a city. Ezio was shown into the estate by servant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your highness\" Ezio bowed upon seeing Crown Prince James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames signalled for the servant to leave, who too bowed before leaving, shutting the double doors behind him. \"Nice to see you again Master Ezio\" James bowed respectfully back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for inviting me your highness\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pleasure is all mine\" he replied \"I enjoy your company... It's such lovely weather I thought we'd have afternoon tea in front of the pool\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pool?\" Ezio asked, was he going to have to swim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For swimming...\" James grinned, \"it's the right time of year.... tea in the gardens or on the veranda is a far more formal occasion. You can swim okay right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, yes of course\" Ezio answered quickly. He was glad it wasn't going to be too formal, with many other nobles watching, and other formalities such as drinking and stirring in a certain manor closely observed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great\" James said as he showed Ezio towards the pool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEzio looked impressed, they stood on the carefully crafted platform overlooking the pool, on it was two chairs and a table. It still looked pretty formal, though apart from guards at the far end, and standing at the doors, it was empty. Ezio felt a calmness emanating from the room, the vents from the main fires meant the room was lovely and comfortable. He and Prince James went into separate changing rooms, in Ezio's was a choice of swimming garments, he picked something white and simple, and placed a dressing gown around him, and headed out towards the table and chairs where James was sitting, wearing very similar swimming garments, as well as a loose gown that he hadn't tied up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just in time, teas just arrived\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I really didn't expect to be invited to this...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrince James lifted his gown off and placed it on the back of the chair, out of courtesy Ezio followed suit untying his own gown and placing it on the back of his chair. Prince James was so pale, in comparison to Ezio's own olive tanned skin. He couldn't believe he was seeing the Crown Prince shirtless, making him in Ezio's eyes looking even more attractive. James was slender, and had very little muscle mass, from what Ezio could tell. He could see the small amount of fat on the stomach that James had mentioned he'd have, it was both more and less than Ezio had expected, his belly button was also quite deep, considering he had very little fat. \"You can see what I meant when we talked\" James said as he appeared to have caught Ezio looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the food at court is like\" James chuckled, \"just looked at the portion they've served us up with\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's allot there\" Ezio agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well enjoy\" James said taking a scone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two chatted and laughed as they ate and drunk their teas. Unlike the first time they'd eaten in the grand hall together, Ezio ate more than James. A fair bit more. James leant back in his seat as James just finished the last slice of chocolate cake. By the look of it James looked full. Ezio too was feeling quite full, though far more slowly than a few weeks back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy the cake\" James said to Ezio as he finished the last bit of cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was delicious.\" Ezio replied, placing his folk on his plate and leaning back on his chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's added the extra pounds to my stomach, as you could see\" James said, patting his bloated stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" Ezio replied, looking at James's chest. Unlike his own it was bloated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As it has for you\" James noted, looking at Ezio's chest. He was looking far fuller than what his midriff had shown when he reapplied his jerkin a few weeks back. James was actually surprised just how different he looked, more than just fuller, his ribcage was no longer visible and he had a fairly notable layer of flab lining his belly. Considerably more than James had expected after only a couple of weeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so, Ezio replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget I saw your stomach when your jerkin fell off, because you were so thin.\" James pointed out. \"We should swim before too long\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two moved to sit next to the pool, their legs dangling in, as they sat up straight James observed Ezio who's belly fat formed a notable roll and hanged slightly over his waist, in this upright position. His own stomach also hung over slightly, at this angle. The deepness of Ezio's belly button just went to show how much flab there was on his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your certainly getting a bit fat\" James said candidly, not pulling any punches, he placed his hand gently on Ezio's stomach and prodded, and shock it slightly. It was incredibly soft, and moved almost like jelly. He took Ezio's hand and placed it on his on belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEzio was in amazement, first Prince James had openly said that he thought that Ezio was getting fat, which left Ezio wondering if he should feel embarrassed or flattered. But he'd also prodded Ezio's stomach and jiggled it slightly, that certainly left him embarrassed, especially by the amount it jiggled. Now James had taken Ezio's hand and placed it on his stomach, his heart was beating with excitement on actually touching the body of this really nice and attractive guy. James stomach was also soft, owing for the lack of muscle, Ezio prodded slightly and it appeared to go less in than his own and jiggled to a lesser extent. </span></div></div>",

Magistrate Alberto was confident that anyone ally would strengthen him enough to secure his bid. Especially given his knowledge about the Gonfaloniere's illness, that wasn't yet public knowledge. With any luck he will have his alliance struck, and will be able to take the seat of Gonfaloniere with out opposition when the time comes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure you are on your best behavior Francesco\" Alberto said sternly after he noticed the carriage draw up at the palace, \"these continentals can be strict with formalities, you are not to speak out of turn, or unless permission is granted\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they all like that?.. I thought only the Mercian's were so rigid\" Francesco replied facetiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they get worse the further north you go\" Francesco's mother, Lady Elena, speculated, \"the Aqutiaines may seem promiscuous but I've heard they're unyielding when it comes to formalities\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to have an open mind Elena\" Alberto said sarcastically, \"these people are important to me... to us. If you wish to be Gonfaloniere one day Frankie then you have to understand the importance of diplomacy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes father\" Francesco said obediently, \"atleast it's warm and sunny here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't see much of that when we go north. Cold, wet and gloomy.. especially Mercia\" Elena said, her prejudice toward the northern nations undisguised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In places, the Palace seemed more like a fortress, it had tall battlements and spires, solders in full armour lined the walls and high gates prevented anyone from entering uninvited. The carriage however took them around the side where the Royal Palace was grander and far more palace like. It stopped outside a great door where in line with a green carpet that had been placed for their benefit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancesco's father got out first, followed by his mother who rejoined Alberto next to her husbands side as Francesco still was stepping out the carriage. He shuffled along in order to catch his parents up. Beside the honour guard, there was nobody outside to meet him. Was that usual? Just as he was about to ask either of his parents, Francesco stopped himself. This wasn't a place where 'children' asked their parents questions, the idea of doing so did infuriate Francesco somewhat, though he didn't wish to show his father up infront of all the important people that could help secure his place, as well as Francesco's place as Gonfaloniere of Si\u00e8cle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Lord\" a Castilian noblemen said bowing to Alberto, \"My Lady... It is my immense pleasure to welcome to Castile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you my Lord\" Alberto started, \"your city is beautiful, we are so pleased to be here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancesco tried not to smile at the complements, he imagined his father would give the exact same complements to the Aqutiaines and Mercians. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" the noblemen smiled, as he guided them further into the palace, \"as you should know the King is not in too good of health\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Political speak for he's dying, no doubt', Francesco thought, as they walked he was constantly looking around, for boys his own age to start with... eventually anyone. The palace seemed deserted. 'Was the king dying keeping courtiers away' wondered, as they went though yet more rooms and corridors without seeing anyone.</span></div></div>",

Francesco waited until his mother and father had passed him, before taking up position a few paces behind them in the centre. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Lord Alberto Morrette, Magistrate of Si\u00e8cle. Your Majesty\" the noblemen stood beside the King. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point Nicolas knelt as his father and mother had just done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance your Majesty\" Alberto said respectfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I.. you, my Lord.

He was lost forewords in this King's presence, even though he wasn't actually suppose to say anything. He bowed low as his father had done, and stepped backwards to return precedence to his parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A..and this is my wife\" The King said, presenting the Queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Queen Isabella\" she said softly, standing up before Francesco and his parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer manner was very regal, Francesco guessed she was a significant age younger than King Philip, a decade or two atleast. Regardless of her age she was still quite beautiful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The King apologises for he is in ill health and can not afford you the usual hospitality of the Kings of Castile.

They had gone onto a balcony that overlooked the palace gardens, as well as a great deal of the city of Jaca and the ocean. Francesco waited until the three were all seated, the Queen took her place at the end of a table, Alberto took the seat closest to the Queen on one side of the table, and Elena the one beside it.

My own brother's death will leave a number of question marks\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah tea\" Isabella said, as the servants brought an extravagant tea service along with some sandwiches and cakes. She had the servants pass the cups of tea around and then offer cakes before she resumed her conversation. \"Your country has always been a question mark in my eyes... in the eyes of us 'continentals' if you will. You are a republic yet function as a monarchy does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the gist of it\" Alberto replied. \"It's a complicated system I agree\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not just you continentals that don't get it... I was born in Florentine, a Principality, and I can't understand why our neighbour masquerades as a republic\" Elena said casually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you are to be Gonfaloniere one day?\" the Queen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.. should the transition go smoothly.\" Alberto replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonfaloniere!\" Elena said sarcastically, \"they would have had a King or a Prince, but they go with Gonfaloniere!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen chuckled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancesco said there quietly half listening to the conversation, and looking at the view. He had plenty he wished he could say, but it wasn't his place to talk, unless the Queen or somebody invited him to. If this was going to be the excitement of his visit, he was going to wish he'd remained at home. Hopefully there will be boys of around his age for him to socialise with... or anyone. All this diplomacy he wasn't aloud a part of was as dull as hell.</span></div></div>",

As he first stepped out he couldn't help but marvel at the beauty of the day, the warmth and fresh air was a refreshing change after the weeks he'd spent traveling from Si\u00e8cle. The gardens were noticeably busier than the palace court rooms, he observed several groups of people in conversation, classic court gossips he speculated, others were seated having drinks or sunbathing, while many were just milling about as he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLadies with parasols, and scantily dressed men strolled along side the steams, it seemed odd to him that women dress so conservatively yet men did not, the younger men at least. Back on the peninsular people are far more liberal about their dress sense, especially in the summer months. It seemed unfair that younger men were aloud this freedom yet, no women were. He was glad that the older men did dress more conservatively mind you, the sight of older men half naked was not one he enjoyed. Though embarrassingly he did actually enjoy the site of young men half naked, so all in all the circumstances fitted him just right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter strolling away from the palace for about twenty minuets Francesco reached the touring fence that marked the edge of the palace gardens, looking though the bars beyond them even more of the city was viable. After a steep hill, immediately after the fence Francesco could see public woodland, beyond that he could see the life of the city, markets, street entertainers. It was quite amazing just how close the two very different worlds came to one another, but people in the palace could not get out, and people outside could not get in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't want to go too near the walls... the guards wont like it!\" Francesco could here a voice from behind him. </span></div></div>",

Of course the Duchess mentioning this to the Duke had been a mistake, it had sparked a massive row, and after giving her son a kiss on the head the two had angrily parted ways to carry out their own respective duties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Prince Michael...</i></span></div></div>",

He would find hard to understand why his father would despise this expect his mother does like it, just so he loves to meet people as of means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe he\u2019ll be hoping tomorrow would be a better day, and no wonder what will happen when he couldn\u2019t wait to go back to the court sometime soon.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After getting home Prince Michael had gone straight to have lunch, and then up to his room to relax. The food had been far duller than the past couple of weeks he'd spent in the Royal Palace at Queen Mary's court, settling back into the norm was going to be hard. Even the nature of his clothes reflected this, when at Court he had worn an ornate jerkin, silk trousers and a fancy hat; now he was wearing a far simpler beige jerkin and dark cotton trousers. The only relief being that this clothing was far lighter and looser, though that didn't make up for missing out on the fashions of court. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael sat on the floor flicking through one of his history books twiddling his curly blond hair round his finger, his bleach blonde hair typical of a Latimer, his thin handsome face could have come from either, of both, his parents. His Latimer characteristics were one of many reasons that Michael's father was often disappointed, annoyed and angry with him. Another was Michael's thin, non muscular physique. The Duke found this an issue of great contention, 'boys must be tough, strong and athletic' he often said, to which the Duchess insisted he was fine as he was. This wasn't the end however, far from it. As Michael had got older he'd started to fill out, news that, in theory, should have pleased the Duke, for once, especially after the amount of exercise sessions he'd insisted Michael did. Sadly for Michael, he hadn't gotten any more muscular; he had filled out, just that. The weight the young prince had gained was mostly fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrince Michael lifted his arm from around his face where he had been twiddling, his hair to scratch an inch on his chest, as he did so he pushed up his loose jerkin to reveal his pale stomach. His ribs were no longer visible, and his lower stomach had become quite soft with the belly fat he'd gained. Fully dressed it wasn't noticeable, other than to those who could see how skinny he had been, such as his father. The Duke had never spent that much time with Michael, and seldom took any notice. But when he noticed he was filling out he became more content, naturally assuming that with the exercise sessions he had become more muscular. Michael remembered that a while after he first noticed he had turned up to in Michael's bedroom told him to take of his shirt and do 20 push ups. Obediently Michael did as he was told, only for the Duke's jaw to drop on the sight of his skinny, pudgy bellied, son, with no noticeable abdominal muscles and a deepened belly button. He had expressed how angry he was that Michael was still the weedy skinny boy he'd always been, but with a chubby stomach. He had avoided Michael allot after that, and took little interest in his exercise or eating regime. This had meant that, especially after the time spent at Court. Michael had gained a little more weight since. </span></div></div>",

He replaced his hand beside him, as he pondered what to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill leaning forward somewhat, Michael could see that his belly was protruding slightly over his waistline, out of interest he pinched the flab.

Besides, your mother did said it just growing into your body.  So I\u2019m sure everything would be fine.

He would look at the mirror again and tried to come up to terms with it.  But even when he come to device between The Duke and The Duchess, this is hard for him to say who is right and who is wrong?  But despite of it, he would start to eat some snacks just so he can have some satisfying taste for some comfort.</span></div></div>",

The people he'd so far met were imperious, somewhat xenophobic and their choices of head wear was bordering on the ridiculous, traits that had grown and grown until Joseph had reached Rochester, Mercia's capital. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoseph was only 17 and he had been deployed by the Duke of Lyon to the heart of the enemy, the Court of Mercia's Queen Mary. Joseph was a spy deep inside enemy territory, and as he full well knew if he was caught his death would not be a quick one. His primary objective was to attain state secrets, secondary was to actually assassinate the Queen. The Duke de Lyon would use opportunity to somehow undermine Mercia, perhaps through invasion, and use it as a spring board to launch his campaign for the throne. It was hard to imagine if successful the court of Aquitaine favouring is weak King over his far stronger cousin who has proven results. To archive that outcome was a tall order, and Joseph had no delusions to the contrary, failure was more likely than success and either way he would almost certainly die. Still the Duke had decided this was to happen, and who was Joseph to turn him down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoseph stepped out of his carriage and stepped straight into the presence of the great cathedral that now loomed over him, although it pained him to admit it Rochester was a beautiful city, wealth and power were symbolised in it's magnificence, if they had a ghetto they've done a good job hiding it. Joseph looked left down the mall where he could see the Royal Palace, the seat of power. It is incredibly hard to imagine Aquitaine ever occupying this great city, even should he be stealing the intelligence and assassinating the Queen. The great dreadnought he'd seen the estuary was beyond anything the Aquitaine navy had developed. Still, now wasn't the time to get sidetracked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoseph was at the Cathedral to meet a contact that was to assist him in gaining entry into the royal palace. He climbed the great steps and took a seat just out side the main doors of the Cathedral. As he sat waiting, the thought of his failure crossed his mind once again. It occurred to him that Duke of Lyon, or Charlie as he was affectionately known, intended for Joseph to die in his mission. The two were lovers, they had been since their early teens, and should Charlie try to take the throne of the legitimate king, regardless of how inept he might be, it would be a sight lot harder if people knew he had a boyfriend... or male lover as it the Duke might prefer for it to be described to lesson the damage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoseph had been waiting for almost 15 minuets before his contact finally contact turned up, and now that he had arrived he said nothing, instead he sat down on the bench and placed a newspaper beside him. After sitting silently for about 2 minuets he rose again and descended down the great stone steps, leaving the newspaper on the bench. After a couple of minuets Joseph mad the move to pack up and leave, he gathered up his bag in a motion that allowed him to take the newspaper unsuspiciously. He entered the cathedral and exited again a few minuets later though another door where another carriage was abating him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce safely in the carriage Joseph pulled out the to files, they were case studies of individuals he would pass himself off as, one was a cousin of the Royal Family, a young Earl of Lancaster, the other was a servant named Jonathan Howard.  </span></div></div>",

The carriage had taken him to a nice part of the district, to a house almost big enough to describe as a mention. Immaculately kept outside for the outward world to see, inside.. just the same. Everything immaculate. Rich colours, tapestries, paintings, expensive furniture. Everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Joseph turned to agent operating the safe house, apparently code named 'the landlord', \"who owns this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Kingdom of Aqutiaine... don't look so shocked, not all safe houses are squaller\" his voice was course and totally lacking in humour. It matched his appearance well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can assume we'll be safe here\" Joseph asked looking out the window at folks walking past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've operating this house for over 50 years, as long as your future actions does not lead anyone here then yes, we'll be safe here.\" he replied scornfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Point taken\" Joseph said, not wishing to debate the point, \"is the Lancaster boy here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he's here\" he replied bruskly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then take me to him\" Joseph demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt the landlord signaled that Joseph follow him upstairs. They climbed two flights of stairs and Joseph was lead towards a bedroom at the back of the second floor, landlord inserted a key and took Joseph in. in keeping with the rest of the house it was well decorated, Joseph noted the windows were all but barred. At the far end was a double bed, and on it lay a nude boy, gagged and died up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... stand up\" The landlord approached him and booted him in the back so that he fell to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to be so rough\" Joseph said suggestively, just by the look he got in response showed that his suggestion had fallen on deaf ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thirty seconds or so the boy rose to his feet and shuffled forward so that he was standing in front of Joseph. Before anything else, Joseph couldn't help but notice how badly bruised he was, with only a loin cloth to cover his modesty the poor boy was covered in bruise marks all over his chest, signs of whip marks on his shoulders, and a black eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly he was being treated abysmally. His hands were tied behind his back, and his mouth was still gagged. Joseph looked at him, and assisted him. He was about the same height as Joseph, perhaps an inch or too shorter, and a fair bit thinner, with no defined muscles. His hair was the yellowie blonde his family were renowned for having, fortunately Joseph's own hair was a dirty blonde so dying it wouldn't be difficult. The only probable posed was Stephan was incredibly pale, another family trait apparently. Far paler than Joseph. And there wasn't really much Joseph could do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of minuets analysing, Joseph lent forward and pulled off the gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh..where am I.. who are you\" he asked nervously, Joseph could see he was physically shaking. He must be scared out of his wits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We work for the King of Aqutiaine\" Joseph replied calmly, inviting Stephan to sit down. He didn't, clearly too scared to even move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I here? What have I done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a sad sight to see, the young boy was so terrified. As he spoke Joseph could see tears rolling down his cheeks, \"You've done nothing. You'll be released soon, i promise you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't look reassured, the landlord sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..if it's money you want\" he stuttered, \"I can get you money. My.. my cousins the Queen, she'll pay for my freedom\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's not money we want\" Joseph replied calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's paying for your freedom now?\" The landlord said sarcastically, \"only an hour ago you threatened that she would have our heads if she found out\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan was unable to reply, he looked at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoseph didn't appreciate the irony, \"I dare say the Queen would put our heads on spikes should she found out... given your treatment of the poor boy, I hardly think she'd show you in particularly any mercy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Joseph's surprise, the landlord offered no retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once our operation is complete, then we'll free you\" Joseph said. \"In the meantime landlord, I want you to treat him sell.

He didn't know how to reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You plan to kill her!\" Stephan sputtered, the look between his two Aquitianeian kidnappers said just as much as words could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm yourself\" Joseph replied, Stephan was struggling trying to move towards the door, after less than a step he collapsed because of his injuroues, not that he could have gotten anywhere. \"Landlord.. help the Prince onto the bed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Landlord grunted and lifted the young boy from the floor and dropped him carelessly onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can leave us now\" Joseph ordered. For a second he thought the Landlord may refuse, but the look Joseph gave him must have made him change his mind. \"I will be using you as a guise to gain entry into the palace.\" he explained as he turned to face Stephan, he shot the frightened boy a reassuring smile, though he can't imagine it made him felt much better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why.. why me?\" Stephan stuttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because... it is thought that I might pass as you. We are about the same age, height and body type.\" Joseph explained, he picked up Stephan's clothes that were hung to the side and put them on. They were traditional Mercian noble dress, expensive cloth, rich colours though not quite as extravagant as he was use to. It was a little snug around the waist, where Stephan was a fair bit thinner than Joseph but other than that it was ideal. \"Not a bad likeness\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan refused to respond and turned the opposite direction. </span></div></div>",

A professional barber had been brought along to do it, the processing of dying took around an hour, and once it was dry the barber cut it into a style similar to Stephan's. Fortunately very little was taken off, as Joseph's hair wasn't much longer than the prince he was attempting to imitate. Once he was done he got dressed and returned to the room in which Prince Stephan was being kept. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look like your splitting image... wouldn't you say\" Joseph said proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose\" Stephan replied reluctantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will assure that you are kept well\" Joseph said comfortingly to Stephan, stroking his face. \"and you'll be able to go home before too long.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your a good liar\" Stephan replied solemnly, as Joseph stood up and headed for the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoseph didn't know how to reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J..just know that those of the Mercian Court are also adept liars.... and th..they hate Aquitaines.\" By now he was breathing heavily, struggling to get the words out, \"if.. if the Queen should find out then... then you will crave.. th..the release of death.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Joseph didn't know how to reply, Stephan neither sounded like he was threatening Joseph nor warning him, only stating facts. And as hard as he tried to reject it, he knew that Stephan's words were only too true. Rumour had it that Queen Mary was an incredibly intimidating women, a women utterly loyal to her family and country. She wasn't weak like Aqutiaine's poor excuse for a King, and despite his inflated ego aside she would eat the Duke of Lyon for breakfast. Joseph decided to say nothing, he excited the room and closed the door softly behind him, not taking another look at the unfortunate Prince they were holding prisoner. </span></div></div>",

Joseph didn't know which of the guards or servants accompanying the convoy knew of his plans, some were Aqutiaine spies others had accompanied the convoy before it had been secretly hijacked, and thus knew nothing. Truthfully it was probably best Joseph didn't know what others knew. For the next months, or years he wasn't Joseph - he was Stephan a Prince of Merica and a member of the House or York. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the carriage made it's way towards the palace, Joseph was impressed by it's size and grandeur. It was easily a rival of the Royal Palace back in Aqutiaine. As the carriage drew into the palace gates and stopped beside a side entrance, Joseph could see an honour guard had assembled to greet him, complete with trumpets and a red carpet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His Royal Highness, the Prince Stephan, Earl of Lancaster\" it was announced as Joseph, in his guise as Stephan took his first steps into the Royal Palace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grandeur inside was easily a match of the outside, it had been years since Joseph had spent anytime in a Royal Court. His jealous lover, Duke Charlie, rarely visited the Aqutiaine court, thus neither did Joseph. It was hard not to be swept up in the magnificence of it all, Joseph had to remember that this was the nexus of the enemy. All around him were people who would gladly see the end of his country and it's ways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He followed up with a slight bow, this women was certainly of high rank. Her ornate headpiece was truly unusual, covered in lace, and diamond and perched upon her head it was almost a foot in height, it must make going through low doors a problem. The worrying thing is, he could imagine the women of Aqutiaine going for such a fashion, yes they may not have such an obsession with hats, but they've got weirder with other clothing, and hair styles - this would be right up their street, and anything to beat this royal court. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am the Duchess of Cleaves, I attend your cousin the Queen. She demanded your presence as soon as you were brought to court.\" She went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then lead the way.\" Joseph replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lady Cleaves lead Joseph to the throne room, he began to feel more at home when he saw the ridiculousness of some of the dresses worn by the court women, as well as the overly feminine clothes worn by some of the men. When he first caught a glance of the Queen, he was expecting her to be no different. And though she was a magnificent dress, and large headpiece she didn't look at all ridiculous, she looked powerful and intimidating. As attractive as any women he'd met before, he doubted she's be anywhere near as flirty or promiscuous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Majesty\" Joseph said, kneeling before the raised throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cousin Stephan\" she replied, he tone was cold yet soft. It seemed she was being as friendly as she could manage.

She explained the porters would bring his lugage up before long and left, quite apruptly. The Montrose appartments were suprisingly large, Joseph entered into them via a large that made him feel as if he was in a country manner house, from just a glimpse of the three coridors he could see that there were atleast two dozen rooms, likley more. And if the hall way was anything to go buy, they would all be richly furnished. Though Joseph couldn't have expected anything less in a Royal Palace, even if it's only the appartments of a noblemen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone here\" he said loudly, Joseph had expected to be met - either by members of the Montrose family, or there servents. But the apartments seemed to be empty, it did seem the perfect time to explore... see what he can find out, but the dossier mentioned in detail how Prince Stephan was a quite boy with very good manners, exploring places that don't belong to him would be quite out of character. So it was probably prudent to remain in the hall way unti lsomeone turns up for him, Stephan was also said to be patent, something that Joseph was not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoseph took a seat and waited for about fiveteen minuets and finally someone turned up, a finely dressed women, Lady Cecelia perhaps? Though this women looked a little too old. \"Maddam\" Joseph said, standing upon the women's entry, bowing slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your higness\" she returned the respect with a curtsey, \"I am the Baroness Walwich, I surve as the Dowager Duchess' cheif lady. I'm afraid, my lady is in a meeting of council at the moment.

Shortly after his lugage was brought in and placed on the floor ifront of his double poster bed. The room was double the size of his one back home at the Duke of Lyon's palace, and the furnishings were significantly nicer, more ornate. On the wall were portraits of what he presumed were Montrose noblemen of past, or Mercian hereos, as well as landscapes of the country side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter unpacking Stephan's clothes and nicknacks, Joseph lay on the bed to have a nap as he awaited the return of the Montrose family. </span></div></div>",

As they progressed towards the lounge, Joseph got a better idea just how big the apartment was, and it was even bigger than he had first guessed. Easy for most to get lost in, he imagined; fortunately Joseph had a good sense of direction, and in general could find his way even after seeing it once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Grace\" Baroness Walwich curtseyed low as she lead Joseph into the lounge, \"this is Prince Stephen\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Royal Highness\" the Dowager Duchess of Montrose, and a young women sat beside her, stood up and respectfully curtsied to Prince Stephan, obviously despite the rank of the Montrose family Stephan was still higher in the order of precedence on account of being Royalty, however distant that may be. \"Please take a seat\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you your Grace\" Joseph said, he took a seat opposite the Dowager Duchess, the beautiful young women sat next to her was presumably the Lady Cecelia, Stephan's future bride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my daughter, Lady Cecelia\" The Duchess confirmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Highness\" Cecelia smiled at Joseph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now introductions are over we will adopt a more informal style... when in private\" The Duchess explained, \"you may call me Lady Margaret... and we will call you only by your first name... as you will my daughter Cecelia, and son Alexander, after you've been introduced to him of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes your Gr...

My father's bad relationship with his brother, the late King William, resulted in us all getting banished from court, I was only 2 when we left.\" Joseph explained Prince Stephan's story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.. I didn't know that.. I'm sorry.\" Alexander said apologetically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, Queen Mary was kind enough to invite me back to court... she didn't share her father's grievances. I only wish my mother could have seen the city again before she died.\" Joseph continued with a somber tone, he leaned on the window ledge and looked distantly into the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexander didn't reply, he just stood next to Joseph and looked out on the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long have you been here?\" Joseph asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been here ever since we were driven out of Montrose by those scum of Aquitaine.\" the words of Aquitaine were like venom on his tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dukes of Montrose were the viceroys of the Duchy of Montrose, a Mercian province to the south that Aquitaine had taken about ten years ago on the orders of the now deceased King Louis. The Ducal family had fled to Rochester, both for their lives and with the hope of getting King William to commit solders to retake the province. After months of posturing the King chose did nothing. More than nothing, he decided to keep the peace with Aquitaine, he ordered the Montrose estates and wealth to be confiscated, their position and rank was reduced to almost nothing. Fortunately the former Duke had the foresight to ally with William's daughter the Princess Mary, who was never expected to become Queen. When she did take the throne, ahead of her brothers, she returned the wealth and estates to the the Montrose family and vowed to retake the province. Though she hadn't done so yet, the Duke never lost faith. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does the Queen plan to take the province back?\" Joseph asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She says that she does...\" he started, unsure, \"we have no reason to disbelive her. Queen Mary has been very good to us, where her father was cruel. It's not as if Aquitaine's pathetic excuse for a King could do anything to stop us\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" Joseph agreed, clearly the Mercian's didn't think highly of King Laurence, though saying such things about an enemy was common in this case they were deadly right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, it may not need to go that far. If King Laurence's fool cousin decides to make a challenge for the throne then we can just take take it... and more, and Aquitaine will be unable to stop us\" He said confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Duke of Lyon might not be happy to know that his ideas of challenging Laurence for the throne are common as gossip... and worse jokes, at the court of Mercia. They clearly don't rate the Duke's chances, or they're banking on the instability creating a weakness, which undoubtedly it would.</span></div></div>",

The realisation of his position suddenly dawned on him when he noticed Queen Mary and her entourage, which included the Dowager Duchess of Montrose, enter from a hallway into this grand hall, one of the palace's great courtyards. He was in the very centre of power for the Kingdom of Mercia, the havoc he could reek here could cause the collapse of the Kingdom. He could assure that Mercia never again rose to threaten Aquitaine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come...\" Alexander said, tugging Joseph's arm, \"this way\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoseph did as he was bid, and followed Alexander, he couldn't stop himself from looking back at the Queen who had stopped to talk to somebody. As Joseph extended his vision he could see the extent of security, Royal Guardsmen lined every door way, stood either end of every pillar. And what of the courtiers? How many were armed? The momentary foolishness of the grandeur of his success suddenly made Joseph feel uneasy. This centre of such power is quite likely the most secure place in the entire world. Joseph would have to be far more clever and inventive if he was to succeed than take such obvious action here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you looking at Stephan?\" Alexander asked, noticing that Joseph's attention was else where. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.. nothing. Sorry.\" Joseph responded, refocusing his attention on Alexander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Queen?\" Alexander deduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..I suppose so\" Joseph admitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is a.... strange human being\" Alexander commented, he turned with Joseph took look across the room at Queen Mary who was conversing with important knights and noblemen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange?\" Joseph wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never known anyone quite like her. Power doesn't usually come to women, and Queen Mary holds more than any man in our history. Nobody would ever question her authority....\"  he paused, though the words sounded somewhat derogatory they were said with much admiration, \"They say the Aqutiaines call her the 'She Wolf of Mercia'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoseph knew it was true, he'd heard Duke Charlie curse that 'shewolf' on many occasions. Queen Mary would probably consider it a term of endearment. \"I'm not surprised\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Alexander agreed, after a few seconds he turned away and guided Joseph toward one of the many of the grand hall's exits, \"are you hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am rather\" Joseph admitted. Joseph had been trained and conditioned so he could do with out food, though that didn't mean he didn't get hungry.

As they passed the two Royal Guardsmen at the door, Joseph peered around the room. The room was full of nobles, some important and others less so. Like before most were stood in little groups talking... conspiring perhaps, others were seated eating and drinking.  Joseph noticed that the food was at buffets and that they would have to help themselves, not that this was a bad thing. Contrary to Aqutiane slurs, the food here looked great, and no doubt tasted just as good. There were meats, pastries, cakes and much more, Joseph was impressed by the choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexander tugged Joseph's sleeve suggestively, and headed towards one of the tables. After picking up a plate he started piling food onto it until there wasn't any space left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You eating anything?\" Alexander asked, looking at Joseph's empty plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah.. of course\" Joseph replied absent mindedly, \"you go start eating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" Alexander chuckled, \"I'll just go and sit down over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoseph turned his head slightly as Alexander went and sat down next to a window that overlooked the palace gardens, Joseph quickly turned back to the table and started placing a wide variety of food onto his plate, after grabbing a drink from the previous table he went and joined Alexander. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Almost half his plate was already clear, and considering how much he'd piled onto it that was saying something. As Joseph took his first bite, he could see why, the food was delicious and moreish. He started all but shoveling the food into his mouth, at a pace that would give Alexander a run for his money. After about five to ten minuets his plate was completely clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've finally finished..! Want to go get pudding?\" Alexander asked, he stood not waiting for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thinking\" Joseph agreed. As he followed Alexander to the table with the sweet foods on it, he noticed the servants were quick to remove their empty plates. Once again Alexander was far quicker serving himself up, as Joseph hesitated. After much consideration Joseph took a slice of chocolate cake, grabbed another drink and returned to the table where Alexander was waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all your having?\" he asked, looking at Joseph's relatively empty plate - with only one slice of cake on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, erm\" Joseph murmured, Alexander had again filled his plate, he had several slices of cake, and an assortment of pastries on his plate. He wasn't sure why he found the fact that this young Duke stuffed himself with so much fattening food. Courts of all kind were always places of overindulging. Even for relatively thin guys like Alex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, you have this.. I'll get my self some more\" he pushed his plate infront of Alexander, not taking no for an answer he went back to the table and returned with another full plate of deserts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I could definitely do with a nap\" Joseph said, rubbing his stomach softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both stood up and Joseph followed Alexander upto the room. The walk back to the apartment was about was about ten minuets long, though they were so full it took them getting on for twenty. Once they got back they parted and went into their separate rooms, as he looked upon his bed and considered changing Joseph noticed his bed was completely unmade, he left the room once again and knocked on Alexander's door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, Come in\" Alexander shouted to Joseph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoseph opened the door and entered Alexander's beautifully, and ornately decorated room, \"hey, my bed is unmade...\" he said looking upon Alexander's large four-poster bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, the wouldn't have expected the room to be made up until tonight\" Alexander explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem\" Joseph said turning and heading back towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may as well just kip on my bed, we're only napping... there's room enough for two\" Alexander offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheers\" Joseph replied, he closed the door slipped his shoes off and climbed on to Alexander's bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your welcome\" Alexander said kindly, he too removed his shoes... in more of a kick. Before climbing onto the bed he unbuttoned his shirt and slung it onto the bedside table, \"At that's better\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoseph loosened his own shirt, and shifted up on the bed as Alexander sat beside him, he looked at Alexander's stomach. It was pudgy, as he'd thought earlier, Joseph couldn't help glancing at the deep belly button and the flab that protruded over his waist as he sat, as he did he rubbed his own stomach which felt round and incredibly bloated. \"Tell me, what did you mean about eating like that most days?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When?\" Alexander wondered, before remembering, \"oh back in the dining hall. Oh just that meals are nearly always so grand at court, you get a taste for it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, cos I ate such allot today\" Joseph said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so did I\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't even going to have that much cake!\" Joseph chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you'd be hungry if you didn't\" Alexander smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha.. no! I'm stuffed\" Joseph said patting his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before I was allowed to actually attend court, I was as thin as a rake\" Alexander admitted, patting his own stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were?\" Joseph replied, \"I can still see that from the rest of your body. Since when have you attended court?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I started regally attending earlier this year... and I noticed you said 'were'\" Alexander said with a broad grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh.. sorry. Are... sorry\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I was only kidding. My stomach has become somewhat flabby\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look fine\" Joseph tried to placate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I put on a stone from in like a couple of months.. thankfully it slowed right down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much\" Joseph asked, he felt that he was getting a bit nosey. But he was shocked about open Alexander was to him, as if they'd grown up as brothers.. as if Joseph really was who he said he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must weigh about ten and a half stone...perhaps getting on for eleven.\" he added, \"hope not though\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm about ten my self\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But your not in the least bit fat\" Alexander pointed out, he stretched out his hand at patted Joseph's stomach, \"yet..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued to chat, until they eventually settled down for nap.</span></div></div>",

His hand sat upon Alexander's underwear, right around his genitals, Joseph instinctively moved it before Alexander became aware, and began  to shuffle along the bed away from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he felt his bed partner begin to stir, Joseph placed his hands around Alexander's warm shoulders and rolled him to the right. He held his position for a couple of seconds before it became clear that the young duke had settled down again.

There was something about the young duke that he found really alluring, in an odd kind of way. He was clumsy and good humoured, much unlike the pompous and strait laced Duke de Lyon, his lover, and lord and master. Alexander was thinly built, his body was untoned  and pudgy, especially his stomach. The Duke de Lyon on the other hand had a great physique, he was muscled and athletic. The boy stood infront of him was completely unlike the Duke de Lyon, the only person Joseph had ever loved. Yet Joseph couldn't help feeling something for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to go Stephan?\" Alexander asked as he did up the final buttons on his shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure we're dressed okay to attend the Queen?\" Joseph asked looking at himself in the mirror. He'd looked smart enough before he'd undressed to have a nap, but he now looked somewhat scruffy. Alexander who's hair had the classic bed-head look, looked even worse. His shirt was untucked, his trousers uneven, and his shoes untied. </span></div></div>",

This time he placed them carefully and neatly on the bed, so that they might be put on him correctly. \"Okay then, ready.\". Joseph turned to face Alexander, now all but nude again. He had also completely undressed, though unlike Joseph he hadn't placed his clothes neatly, they sat screwed up on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't need to undress now\" Joseph protested, \"I thought we were doing me first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are.. I, erm\" Alexander started, \"I'll get dressed again\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Alexander gathered his clothes in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no don't bother\" Joseph replied, he approached Alexander and took him by the arm and marched him over to the mirror, \"Your undressed now, you might as well stay that way till we dress you\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexander chuckled, \"That's probably wise. What shall we start with?\" he asked picking up one of Joseph's garments from the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hose\" Joseph, who had always dressed himself, said definitely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hose?\" Alexander replied, looking at Joseph's clothes bewildered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those\" Joseph replied, pointing at the white tights that lay beside the trousers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah\" Alexander replied. He gathered them off the bed, and knelt down at Joseph's legs. He slipped one, and then the other of Joseph's feet into the ends and then started to pull them until he they reached the height of the underwear. Alexander turned Joseph around to straighten the front, he spent an unusual amount of time doing so, and Joseph the young duke softly caressing his waist, as he moved away his hand brushed against Joseph's gentles. As if the caressing, and rubbing hadn't already aroused him, that now had him fully erect. Fortunately Alexander seamed so dense that he wouldn't notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter only a couple of seconds it was obvious the boy duke hadn't noticed, he placed his two hands on the sides of Joseph's stomach, in an effort to turn him around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two boys, nude in a room together\" Joseph said jokingly, \"good job nobody can see us\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Joseph had guessed, Alexander recognised the joke, or atleast he seemed to. He kept his hands on Joseph's stomach for a few seconds later, as he seemed to ponder what Joseph had said. \"We're like cousins now... it doesn't matter\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another ten minuets Alexander finished, and to Joseph's amazement he'd done a pretty good job.</span></div></div>",

He got them as far as to just bellow Alexander's underwear, when he noticed something wrong. \"Your Grace is wearing his underwear back to front\" he said barely unable to contain the smile at the obvious mistake, surely Alexander must have felt that it was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am? That's why they felt weird\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can turn them around, I wont look\" Joseph walked around to the back of Alexander as he pulled his underwear down, he couldn't help looking at the young dukes bare bottom until the underwear again covered them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can look again\" Alexander said, turning around to face him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were uneven, and wonkey, but alteast they were now on straight, \"Better\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he pulled the hose over Alexander's underwear, he pulled at it, to even it out around his waist, deliberately brushing his hand against his gentles a couple of times as he did so. To his pleasure, the second time he did it he could feel that Alexander was fully erect, which certainly bolstered the chance that he was also into other guys, rather than women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\" Alexander said sheepishly, as he moved his hands to cover his gentle area to cover up the erection. By that time Joseph had moved on to his upper body, he placed the shirt on and started buttoning it on at the bottom.  It was a very tight shirt, so much so that by the time he reached Alexander's belly button he was finding it hard to reach the button hole, it was easily rectified as he gently pushed at Alexander;s soft pudgy stomach, and the rest of the buttons went in place. The rest was reasonably easy, once he was done, he fetched Alexander;s exquisite hat from the side and placed it on him. \"That's better... you look good now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you\" Alexander replied.</span></div></div>",

Since going to sleep his stomach, so bloated that it looked like he'd eaten a football, had deflated right down. Thankfully, after such a wasted afternoon, he did now at least feel comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth the idea that Prince Henry didn't have better things to do was a copout, an excuse.. His guardians often urged him to socialise and shore up support for his claim among the local nobles. And Henry himself knew he could also be practicing his riding, hunting or physical training; there were many things. He simply rarely had the yearning for such endeavours, and it more or less came down to laziness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry did often circulate and attend the Aquitaine court, who are so kindly hosting him in their capital. Though not for the reasons his guardians intended, for the Prince in exile had pretty much given up the idea of reclaiming his father's throne. Some days he even considered renouncing it just so he would be all out to return to Merica, perhaps attend one of the York Princes at the court of his people, rather than here, which is dominated by people who despise his homeland, and see Henry only as a political pawn. Indeed the only reasons he did regularly attend the Royal Court of Orl\u00e9ans were, one, the luscious eye candy; and two, the regular candy. Aquitaine had wonderful food, it was probably one of the only decent things about the country. Just the thought of it made him drool at the mouth.</span></div></div>",

This radically changed when he neared his fifteenth year, as he reached toward the end of puberty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry's had appetite increased significantly. Not only did was he starting eating breakfast and lunch, but he was eating substantially larger portions.

He'd never loved the fanciest of Aquitainee food, but he adored their sweets; anything surgery. The sudden surge in appetite coupled with his fattening choices of food, had resulted in some fairly rapid weight gain. Although he'd not noticed it himself, it had only taken him a month or so before he was no longer considered underweight. Almost a year on he had gained over stone, jumping from just over eight stone, to almost ten and a half. And though blissfully unaware the weight had gone only one place: his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pudgy stomach that still looked so slender when hidden by shirt, now sported a sizeable layer of flab. Even sitting and wearing nothing tight around his waist, his belly bulged over his waistband, two or three three rolls of fat protruding onto his lap. There had been occasions when dressing that Henry noticed certain items getting tight, but had always dismissed it as 'old clothes'. It didn't help that Henri, probably one of the only people who ever saw him without a shirt on, never mentioned anything.

It made him glad at times that a women as fierce as Queen Mary sat on their throne, it's not as if Aquitaine's monarch could ever match her, not even his rival Duke Charles. It just made Henry all the more enthusiastic to return home... to the land he'd never actually been. Though it was entirely possible that the Yorkist court would be just as hostile, if not more, if Henry was to return. Although if the Queen gave him an amnesty he would be a Prince again, and no noble would scorn a Prince. Unless he was foreign and in Aquitaine it seemed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs these awkward court events had occurred, Henry was at least able to sate his hunger with delightful Aquitainee foods. No pastry or cake was better than those served at the Royal Court of Orl\u00e9ans, and as always Henry had taken full advantage.

What a petulant child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCareful holding his trousers up as he went, Henry checked several rooms along a corridor for a good place to try and fix his trousers. Going further than he intended, the Mercian prince ended up on in a third floor corridor where at last he had stopped coming across people, when he opened the first closed door he came across he was in luck. An empty room, one of a hundred or more bedrooms. Perfect. He creeped in and quietly closed the door behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at his trousers, they clearly weren't going to be as easy to fix as he'd hoped. The button that acted as the fastening had come right off, likely now sitting on the floor where it fell, downstairs with the Marquis. It seemed hopeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it\" Henry said in annoyance, he couldn't sit around for the rest of the day with trousers that would fall down when ever he let go. What if he forgot? The whole palace would see his underwear.

And it wasn't that the trousers had shrunk, as he'd originally believed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at his stomach, seated he could see that his belly flab was protruding over his underwear waistband, sitting in his lap.

Then his stomach was round and often protruding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenri on the other hand, had no such luxuries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough a bit smaller than him, and a tad bit younger, Henri was considerably fatter. The younger boy was easily three stone larger than Henry, and flabby all over--from his his doughy moobs, to his overhanging stomach, and his thick thighs. Henry had only seen Henri nude a few times, but his stomach was already large enough to hang over his waistband and start to fill his lap when he sat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Henri was considerably fatter than Henry, and Henri was always poking fun at Henry's figure (sometimes literally), Henry never dared make fun of the younger boy's fuller figure. The reason being was simple. Ever since Henri was a young child, he'd adored sweets, fatty foods, and all of the other delicacies that Aquitaine food had to offer. Ordinarily this wouldn't have been much of a problem, except that, the Dowager Marchioness was one of the most vain woman in all of Aquitaine, which was quite the feat. She detested how chubby her son was and made all manner of attempts to curb his appetite, whether by reducing the amount of food he ate at dinner to making him participate in all types of training. However, Henri was almost as clever as he was slovenly and was easily able to subvert all of his mother's attempts to keep him from stuffing his face. It seem too mean to rib on Henri  on such a sensitive subject. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite knowing that Henri was sneaking food, Henry never quite knew how he did it. It had always been something that had wondered about, but he had never made any attempts to figure it out or catch him in the act. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Marquis merely shrugged at Henry's last remark. He crossed the room, and sat himself down on Henry's bed, causing it to creak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry stared at him for a moment and then deadpanned, \"Were you planning on letting me go to sleep, or should I put my trousers back on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenri leaned back, a devious smile crossing his cherubic face, \"I was actually wondering if you'd do the honor of joining me for a bit to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, all Henry could do was to stare dumbfounded at the Marquis. Henri said nothing more, but cocked his head slightly at Henry in amusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean?\" Henry sputtered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenri crossed his legs, a fat thigh pushing up against his soft belly. \"I, only, meant that my mother would love, oh so much, for us to spend some more time together.\" He smiled deviously again, \"You might have to put your trousers on again, though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry stared at the younger boy for another moment, before it struck him what Henri was asking. The younger boy appeared to be offering for Henry to join him on one of his secrete excursions to sneak food. Henry looked down at his soft belly. He'd already eaten much more at dinner than Henri had. However, this could be a rare opportunity to sneak more treats--if he could stomach being around Henri that is. </span></div></div>",

Henri's eyes lit up, probably happy to have a partner in crime. After quickly re lacing his trousers, Henry followed Henri out of his room and down stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is where they keep the left-overs,\u201d Henri whispered conspiratorially, pushing open a door. \u201cThere's always a ton of leftovers.\u201d He moved into the room, allowing Henry to see inside. What he saw was easily one of the most wonderful sights he had ever laid eyes on.In the room, Stacked high on the counters were stacks of uneaten cakes, and pastries, and chocolates. All from the night, festivities. Henry started to salivate upon sight of them, he could practically taste the sugar in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon!\" Henri said, mouth already full of a tart, \"What are you waiting for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry soon learned that the kitchen staff often over-prepared, especially on nights with special visitors (like tonight) and often would have an excess of dessert as most of the guests would have grown full by the time it was served. The excess was either taken home by servants or donated--all to increase the reputation of the family. Until then it was \"guarded\" by Annemarie, and aging member of the kitchen staff. She was a plumb old women, who firmly believed that 'growing boys' needed to be well fed. She smiled at Henry and offered both Henry and Henri big classes of milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, Henry tucked in, grabbing himself a large slice of raspberry cheesecake. At dinner, he'd only been able to have a small slice. He took a large bite and moaned--it was better than he remembered. It was rich and creamy and had just a hint of vanilla. He wolfed all of it down before he knew it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenri was still working on the tarts. He held out a tart to Henry. \"You have to try one of these!\" He said, moaning as well. \"They're delicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prince considered the treat in Henri's hands. It was rather large, about the size of Henri's meaty palm. The pastry had been baked to a golden perfection, and had freshly sliced strawberries and cream cheese piled on top. It did look rather good, but... Henry placed a hand on his belly. </span></div></div>",

It was as delicious as it looked. \"Mmmm.\" he hummed to himself, \"You should try the cheesecake,\" he added, but Henri was already digging in. Henry popped the rest of the tart into his mouth and looked around for what he should sample next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to try the desserts that he hadn't gotten to sample at dinner, greedily gobbling down candied pears, sugar cookies drizzled with icing, and chocolate cream pie. Then he moved on to retrying some of the things he had at dinner--chocolate mouse, handfuls of bonbons, and a couple of eclairs to top it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelching happily, Henry patted his bloated stomach and closed his eyes. Somewhere in between the chocolate cream pie ad his first handful of bonbons, he'd unfastened his pants, and now his distended belly was only being (slightly painfully) constricted by his shirt. Henri was seated next to him, in a similar level of bloat. His eyes were half closed, and his hands rested happily on his rolls. He's undid his pants and shirt, as well. Crumbs and icing were smeared on his chubby cheeks. He looked like a fat cat that had eaten the canary. Henry reckoned that he probably looked similar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was so goood.\" He moaned. Henri only burped in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the kitchens, Annemarie returned, \"Oh no! You poor dears, are don't yet?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry opened his eyes again and groaned. \"Couldn't eat another bite-\" He started to say, before he caught sight of what Annemarie had in her hands. The elderly woman was carrying an enormous chocolate cake, decorated with delicate sugar flowers. The cake was clearly heavy and at least three layers tall. Annemarie heaved it over to the counter and frowned at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a shame...\" she said, \"Everyone finished eating before we could unveil this cake...\" Such a shame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry glanced over at Henri. The younger boy was already licking his lips greedily. Biting his lip, Henry glanced over at the cake. It looked so delicious, but... Henri 's stomach gurgled in warning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would have turned her down, had Henri not said, \"If you can't handle it, I'm sure I can polish it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry narrowed his eyes, \"Oh, I can handle it,\" he grumbled, ignoring his stomach groaning in protest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys squared off against each other. Each sitting down on the opposite side of the cake. With little ceremony they began devouring the cake, almost stabbing it with their forks and not even bothering to cut themselves pieces. Henry ate quickly, barely even pausing to enjoy the cake. All he was concerned with was shoving more cake down his throat than Henri. After a few, furious mouthfuls, he could almost feel the cake hitting his stomach. Still he kept chewing and swallowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only a quarter of the cake left, when Henri threw his fork down. He moaned cupping his belly in both hands. He started to say something, but cut himself off with another unhappy moan. Henry tore his eyes away from the cake to look at the Marquis. He was leaning back in his chair, gently massaging his swollen gut. Frosting and ganauche were smeared all over his lips and cheeks. Crumbs dotted his breasts and tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry felt himself smirk, \"Tapping out are we?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooo-urp- m'belly hurts so bad-urp!\" Henri licked his lips happily and belched again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly filled with determination, Henry scooped up another forkful of cake, while Henri moaned and rubbed his belly. He was determined to eat more cake than Henri. He was a king , after all. Shouldn't kings be allowed to glut themselves? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, his stomach began to protest. It sloshed and rolled noisily, but he continued to eat, driven by an almost mindless determination to beat Henri. With a little groan he scooped up the last of the cake and shoved it triumphantly in his mouth. He swallowed painfully and let himself flop back in his chair. Unable to hold it back, he belched loudly, but it did little to ease the pain in his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenri was looking at him with half-lidded eyes, hands still on his belly. \"We should--ooooh--do this again sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry burped in agreement. </span></div></div>",

Though Rolan had disagreed with Alexander, he relished the warmth and the luxuries of the south, so he and Alexander parted company temporarily as Alexander journeyed back North to Mercia. Prince Alexander knew, even if only for himself, that he had to observe the goings on of these southerly Kingdoms and assess there strengths and weaknesses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of what he had descovered were screamingly obvious to those here, and he felt like an outsider just by asking the questions. The most powerful three Kingdoms are exactly as told in Sartov: Aquitaine, Castile and Mercia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAquitaine is said to be the most powerful of the three, it's armies are legion and it's territorial holdings great indeed - but it is held back by it's child king, and power hungry regents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCastile is very much the former powerhouse ignoring it's slow decline, though few people would put it as bluntly as that. It's once vast territorial holdings have been superseded by Aquitaine expansion, it's royal family is debauched, and it's decrepit King is the only thing holding the nation back from the precipice of chaos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen finally, there is Mercia. A country hated venomously in Aquitaine - though beloved by all who dislike Aquitaine. It's territorial holdings are impressive, but it's army is quite unremarkable. The most popular talking point on people's lips is it's King, or he should say Queen. For Mercia is ruled by a women, Queen Mary. Surprisingly enough, what all detractors perceive as a weakness is actually strength, regardless there view is a grave and dangerious underestimation. Of the three Great Kingdoms, she is the only leader with any competence - her court is undivided, and her Navy is nothing short of extraordinary. Alexander had seen just part of it for himself as his ferry carried him into port. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf any of the three are a threat to Ruscovia, then it's Mercia. Castile's decline and instablitiy speaks for it's self. Though Aquitaine's armies are massive, and powerful, Alexander couldn't see how they could threaten Ruscovia, or why they would want to. Such an invasion would be fraught with risk, with few tangable benifets. Mercia on the other hand would threaten Ruscovia in different ways, Alexander doubted Queen Mary would seak terreotiral control. It's ships are more than powerful and numerious enough to blockade traderoutes, which would further starve his people. To the releif, if Queen Mary was shrewd, Mercia would seek domion over him, and Ruscovia.. Even without meeting her, Queen Mary's Imperial ambitions are clear, just as are Aquitaines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndoubtably one way of securing Ruscovia and improving it's economy might be allying with one of the three. When Castile's King dies, then the resulting chaos will mean civil war, and Alexander doubts it will remain 'civil' for long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexander followed the other passengers as he made his first steps into Mercia. The port was only a short ride from the Rochester, it's capital city, which he was anxious to see for himself. Beyond that, he was starving. </span></div></div>",

Clearly, somebody had anticipated his arrival. He nodded at them before gracefully entering the golden carriage. He wondered if the extravagance and efficiency was an example of what was to come. Or was it simply bravado. For Mercia and Aquitaine seemed intent on constantly outdoing one another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach growled loudly, he was starving, he recoiled slightly at the thought that the driver or somebody might have heard. Alexander was use to the hunger and it didn't use to faze him; despite being Royalty food wasn't always plentiful at the Palace of Sartov back in Russcovia, at least not food that he found particularly appetising. Though after a few weeks in Florentine and the other city states of Antiqua, Alexander had quickly allowed himself to become bothered when he was hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a long way to Rochester at any rate, he could cope with the hunger until then with no problem. With any luck he'd have the opportunity to eat soon after he arrived. He placed his head back softly on the cushioned headrest. It was a mistake thinking back to the cuisine of the southerly city states, it had only made him more hungry. His younger brother Rolan who had remained there could testify to that, unsurprising that he had chosen to remain there longer. Alexander remembered Florentine, it was hot - unbearable as far as he was concerned - but unlike it's citizens he wasn't able to dress weather appropriate. Had he removed any layers then he would have gotten sunburned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about half an hour the carriage drew though the gates of Rochester. The city was magnificent, even from the city gates he could see the Grand Basilica looming over the entire city, the towers and the domb are likely visible from all points in the city, it was apparently positioned in the centre point in the city infront of the mile long The Mall that lead to the Royal Palace.

The Mall was a mile long, and plastered with royal flags, all along it people were milling about, talking, looking over at the river, basking in their nations power and pomposity. After passing through an arch the Palace itself swept into view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe treas and the arch had obscured it as he traveled up The Mall, but no longer. It was magnificent. He found it difficult to describe it. He imagined the Ruscovian Palace might have been that impressive had it been maintained better. The carriage took him around the side, and through a gilded gate, after stopping, the door was opened and he was ushered out onto a red carpet. The four guards formed an honour guard standing either side of a middle aged man, and the Russcovian ambassador. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Royal Highness\" he said with a sweeping bow, as Prince Alexander carefully stept out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pleasure\" Alexander said, performing a lower bow, \"may I ask who you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am the Deputy Lord Chancellor. Had we had more notice of your highness's arrival then we would have been better prepared.\" He explained, \"The Queen has agreed to your Ambassador's request, and has granted you apartments here at court for the duration of your visit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexander was impressed, the ambassador had not been caught off guard with his arrival and had made preparations with the Queen. \"Ze Queen is very generous\" Alexander responded, following his ambassador and this Deputy Lord Chancellor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis apartments were beautiful and spacious. It came with four double bedrooms (of which he only needed one), a lounge, study and dining room. All the rooms were large. The ambassador had also arranged for his son, and the son of another Russcovian nobleman to serve as his pages (male equivalents to ladies-in-waiting he understood), they would dress him, provide him with advice and companionship. Glorified servants, was another way of thinking about it. They were both nice lads though, one was 17 the other 22, both were quiet and dignified. They both clearly had a good understanding of the court, and had already provided Alexander with a few useful insights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only had a short time to talk with them, and to look around his apartment, before they informed him that they were instructed to take him to a meeting with the Queen at the hour. </span></div></div>",

It was Prince James, Mercia's Crown Prince. On sight he almost swooned. The Prince was incredibly attractive, perhaps rivaling his own good looks. He was dressed far more richly than Alexander, and had an extravagant head piece in true Mercian fashion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and you must be Prince James\" Alexander responded, taking a seat next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames laughed in response to their introduction, \"May with dispense with the formalities, we are both Princes. You may call me James\" he replied kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexander smiled back, ignoring his brother's whores and manwhores seemed to worth it as he looked into Prince James's eyes. He felt so stupid. \"Likewise, call me Alexander.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames looked back at Prince Alexander intently, he too had noticed Alexander's attractiveness. Strangely the rumours never mentioned his devastating good looks, only he and his brothers slightly weird escapades. \"Tell me Alexander... are all Ruscovians as attractive as you?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas Prince James flirting? Alexander asked himself, that questioned seemed pretty sensual. He smiled back, \"no.. just me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" He replied, sounding oddly satisfied with the answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexander took the calculated decision that James must be flirting, and placed his hand on James', to see if he recoiled. Embarrassment meant little to Alexander, it seldom affected him. He wasn't disappointed, James didn't move his hand. He only looked up, into Alexander's eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two drifted closer together, James first rose from the seat, not letting go of Alexander's hand - prompting him to do the same. Alexander suddenly moved and kissed James streight on the lips. To his joy, James accepted it and placed his arms around Alexander. He couldn't believe how quickly this happened, he'd barely been in the room for 5 minutes. The two moved closer together as they kissed, before finally breaking apart as they heard someone  walking down the outside corridor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was great\" James replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" was all Alexander replied. </span></div></div>",

After a moment, Alexander reached out a hand to caress James' face and the blond prince closed his eyes in content. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Visit my chambers later, if you like,\" Alexander said softly as he drew his hand away and straightened his posture. \"We could continue to get to know one another.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames smiled, his cheeks tinged a shade of rose. \"As your host, shouldn't it be you visiting my chambers?\" he asked, crossing his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The best hosts always cater to the desires of their guests,\" Alexander met James' smile with one of his own, \"And I suspect that I will see your chambers before my time in Mercia is at its end. Should I receive an invitation, I would come, of course.\" Alexander placed a hand on James' shoulder then let it drift south until his fingers were hovering over the blond's collarbone. \"I remain at the mercy of your hospitality, James. Do stop by if you get the opportunity.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ruscovian prince and the Mercian prince locked eyes, various emotions burning in their eyes, and then Alexander turned and left the state room. Outside, he was quickly joined by his pages, who took up positions on either side of him as he strode back to his apartments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me, but I must ask for your names again,\" Alexander said as his pages synced their strides with his own, \"I'm afraid that they've slipped my mind amongst all of today's events.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, then...what can you tell me about Prince James?\" Alexander had waited until they had reached the privacy of his apartments before voicing this question. He'd draped himself across a luxurious sofa in his lounge, a comfortable room covered in green fabrics and tapestries with a large fireplace on one wall. Servants wood be arriving soon enough with a late lunch, but until then, Alexander had some inquiries for his pages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Highness,\" Misha, the older and taller of his two pages, began, \"The entire Mercian people wishes to go to bed with him. They differ only in whether they want to take him or be taken by him.\"  Alexander nodded thoughtfully at Misha's response. Such bluntness was valued by Ruscovians. And Misha, with his dark hair and wiry, but muscled body, was clearly a Ruscovian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had heard that he was...popular, yes. Now I see why. But what about James himself? How does he spend his days?\" Alexander asked. Across from him, seated in two plush armchairs, Misha and Nikolai shared a look. Unlike Misha, Nikolai, with his freckled face and pudgy midsection, appeared less of a Ruscovian, though he could be just as shrewd as his older counterpart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The prince's life is one of constant leisure,\" Nikolai offered, \"He meets with the royal tailors and jewelers monthly to commission various new clothes and baubles. Some call him vain, but I think it would more accurate to say that Prince James has a vested interest in...fashion.\" Nikolai scrunched his face together, struggling for the words, \"He...likes pretty things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pretty thing that likes pretty things...\" Alexander mused, then chuckled. \"I suppose that is why he has taken a fondness toward me. He leads a very carefree life, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisha and Nikolai nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Misha affirmed, \"Sometimes he quarrels with his brother, the Prince George, and sometimes Queen Mary tasks him with a minor state function, but other than that...\" Misha trailed off and turned toward Nikolai, who shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He meets with his staff, the tailors, the jewelers. He dines - on sweets especially - and bathes with imported oils. When it's warm, he reads poetry on his balcony.\" Nikolai tapped a finger on his chin in thought. \"Ahh, he occasionally spends time with a cousin of his. Lord John, a minor noble. Though I don't think I've seen them together much lately. They would spar in one of the courtyards, though their sparring tended to quickly devolve into simple wrestling.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexander's brow furrowed. What a strange pastime for James, who otherwise appeared to be a very sedentary prince. And who was this John? He would have to look into it later. \"And romantically?\" Alexander asked after a pause, \"I take it that James is a lover of men.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisha and Nikolai nodded. If either were disturbed by their own Crown Prince asking such a question, neither appeared disturbed. Perhaps they knew of the exchange Alexander had shared with James in the state room. \"Rumors suggest as much,\" Misha said, \"Some say that's the real reason why Mary ascended the throne, but they're the stupid ones who say that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More telling,\" Nikolai cut in, \"are the young lads. Sometimes minor nobles, sometimes the common son of a merchant or stable hand. 'Friends,' the prince calls them. They join the prince as pages, though none seem to serve more than a year in his service. More than one occasion has passed where a maid has spied the prince giving them his kisses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Interesting,\" Alexander said. So James' receptiveness in the state room had not been a product of whim. That was good to know. \"He tires of them in so quick a time?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would appear so, Highness,\" Misha responded, looking almost concerned for his crown prince. Perhaps he did know Alexander's intentions. \"Or perhaps it was they who tired of the prince. For all his quirks, Prince James has not a cruel bone in his body. If any in his service declared that they wished to leave it, he would permit it if it meant their happiness.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexander rubbed his chin, considering that possibility. \"What,\" he asked, after a moment, \"did his last pages cite as their reasoning for leaving the prince?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisha and Nikolai blinked. \"Why,\" Misha said, after sharing a glance with Nikolai, \"I believe personal reasons were not an issue for the last pages to leave Prince James' keeping.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The reasons being?\" Alexander prompted, one dark brow raised in questioning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Health,\" Nikolai offered, squirming slightly in his seat, \"Edward and Mark - those were their names - could no longer provide one essential, if rarely used, service: defense. And so Queen Mary released both of them from service, actually.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An accident?\" Alexander asked, curious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Misha said, his expression strangely sheepish, \"Obesity. You see, during the year they served as the prince's pages, Edward and Mark ate themselves quite large. I don't believe they had a stitch of clothing that fit them when they left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome hours later, Alexander had retired to his lounge again. Shortly after he'd dismissed Misha and Nikolai, a small army of servants had arrived with a late lunch. It had been a herculean meal; he had seen nothing like it before, not even at Ruscovian state functions, which were considered grand feasts in his homeland. He'd been surprisingly hungry and eager to try some of the southern delicacies laid out before him, but Alexander was still surprised that he'd allowed his appetite to get away from him so quickly. That was Rolan's downfall, not his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter gorging himself, he'd changed clothes, exchanging his more elaborate traveling clothes for a fur robe, and returned to the lounge. His robe was comfortable, especially compared to the traveling clothes, which had gotten a bit tight around his stomach after eating so much. It also left a slice of his naked chest exposed, which he though James might appreciate, though now Alexander was beginning to wonder if James was going to stop by at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, at that moment, a servant appeared to announce that...</span></div></div>",

His head hurt from his tavern-hopping the night before.  \"Dunce, wake up,\" Rolan heard his brother calling to him through a foggy sleep, \"we have a meeting with Mr. David Smith, the Queen's leading finance minister to help us get Ruscovia into a more economically viable place.\"  All Rolan heard, however, was that he and his brother had to meet with another stuffy, aristocratic bureaucrat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rolan washed, changed his clothes, and got a cup of black tea and a glass of cold water to ease his headache and wake himself up.  He only made his problem worse.  A good breakfast, however, eased Rolan's pain to a more tolerable level to allow him to set out for the Queen's Palace.  And having arrived, the two were shown to a small conference-room that looked far too small to be handling any sort of the complex affairs that a Treasury should have had.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0David Smith was not an aristocrat.  He was a thin, aging commoner with a nasaly voice and an irritating demeanor, a look of pity and condescencion.  Rolan was already in a bad mood, and this man had only made it worse.  The man gave a boring, jargon-filled interlude before Rolan decided to doze off before he heard the other man say, \"Perhaps your brother would be a good fit for a finance minister under the right conditions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rolan heard his brother laughing in true mirth, a reaction for only the best of jokes, because Alexander was not a man for humor.  But all Rolan could say was, \"What?\"  Smith chuckled and replied, \"Well, My Lord, if you had listened, you might have heard me say that in regulating the economy from a policy standpoint, he who generally governs best, governs least.  So perhaps you should be a finance minister because you seem so unwilling to govern.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rolan allowed himself a chuckle, sat up straight, and, for the first time in his life, was actually interested in learning something academic.  The man spoke well and in terms that Rolan could digest easily; Rolan despised jargon and nonsense of that sort and only used jargon which he had defined and illustrated with examples.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm sorry for the lack of detail in my explanation.  I can, however, send my finest advisor, Mr. Adam Ricardo, with you to Ruscovia if you so desire,\" Mr. Smith concluded before Rolan replied, \"If you would, sir, I'm sire my brother would appreciate it.

Your presence in the capital is required immediately.\"  The messenger left, leaving the room stupefied and eerily quiet.  Finally, Smith spoke, \"Your majesty, would you please, please accept my offer of aid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rolan turned furiously to the insolent man who nattered on about economics when he had been just told that the sovreign of a nation had been assassinated.  Suddenly, Alexander turned to his brother with one question: Why would someone do this?  Certainly, his father had been a reactionary, certainly, Ruscovia was not a better place because of his father; but what would killing their father have done?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rolan pondered this question for a moment before he responded, \"Maybe this man wants you for his king.  Maybe he wants a more liberal Ruscovia, one in which there is no special status under the law, one where a man is free to do what he wills.\"  Alexander smiled; he knew his brother wasn't dumb and could think when he wanted to.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This man was a call to action.  Mr. Smith, please, would you send your students as economic advisors to Ruscovia?\"  Alexander asked with a wan smile.  \"With pleasure,\" the man chirped cheerily.  Mr. Smith was amazed at the cool heads of the two boys.  They would make a fine king and Treasury Secretary, he thought to himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At their father's funeral, the head of the Church had asked Alexander to speak.  So he had.  He layed out that his father was a strong-willed but inept reactionary.  He would do differently.  He would allow Mercian and Saxon educators to come and teach Ruscovia's population how to read and write.  He would give the Duma more of a say in how the state would be run.  He would remove the unjust powers that nobleman had over their serfs which hindered the economic progress of Ruscovia.  He would liberalize Ruscovia and make it a great nation again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His message caused visible discontent among the nobles.  He was their leader, but they still wielded great influence in Ruscovia.  Rolan had avised his brother to strip the nobles of much of their power and would force them to earn a living by producing something of value to others.  Petty bureaucrats had led to the corruption that plagued Ruscovia to that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But reforming a bureaucracy was always difficult.  So instead of reforming the bureaucracy, Alexander had decided to cut it altogether.  Rolan thought it to be brilliant.  Rolan had been instated as head of the Treasury with the advice of Mr. Ricardo as the de facto leader on cutting regulations.  Tariffs were slashed, regulations were slashed, taxes cut massively.  All of these things were with the consent of the Duma.  Mr. Ricardo showed Rolan all the implications of policies and taught him to think things of a policy through to their logical conclusions; and he approved Rolan when he did and chastised him when he didn't.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Meanwhile, foreign investments from Mercia, Saxony, and Florentine.  There was initial reaction and mob violence from natvist reactionaries, which was punished severely and quickly vanished.  But resentment rarely truly dissipates, and the Trust Square Incident was no exception.</span></div></div>",

But a combination of Queen Mary's determination, and his parents ambition had meant he could not turn down the post. His coronation had been lavish, Edward suspected it perplexed locals as it was traditionally Mercian, like nothing they'd seen before, even now Courtiers refused to dress in traditional, not to mention simpler, Castilian dress. The extravagance of the Mercian court fashions were no less prevalent than in Mary's court back in Rochester. The idea of dressing, and behaving as the ousted regime did was repugnant to most of his courtiers, and though Edward's thoughts on the matter weren't quite as strong, he certainly agreed their opinion had merit. The majority of the women wore nothing on their heads, and their dresses were quite thin, and revealing; all unbecoming of women with noble blood. And the clothes of men were too simple, and drab. Courtiers said that the younger noblemen wore little more than underwear during the summer months, though Edward found it difficult to believe that Lords of Castile could have such little self-respect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward stepped back into his chamber and saw an ageing man waiting patently for his attention. \"Lord Chancellor\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Royal Majesty\" the Lord Chancellor said as he made a sweeping bow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please take a seat\" Edward offered, as he himself sat behind his grand desk, which had belonged to King Philip and all the great Kings of Castile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you sire\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I do for you\" Edward asked, making a point to be polite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our warships captured Ferdinand of Trast\u00e1mara, pretender King of Castile, as he attempted to escape to the Free Cities.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent news, what has been done with him?\" Edward asked, trying not to sound curious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've bought him to the Palace\" The Chancellor replied, \"he has said nothing to nobody.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Assemble the Lords of the Privy Council, and bring him before me in the Throne Room.\" Edward said, he flicked his wrist to indicate the Chancellor should leave his presence. </span></div></div>",

Assuming peace can be attained, you will attend. She will shortly be making a state visit to Jaca where you, and your court must pledge all loyalty to her Imperial Majesty\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be done.\" Edward bowed his head, his heart was beating at an alarming rate. This was an unexpected move. Mary had claimed the title that had gone unused for almost 500 years from the Old Imperium, the fact that the Pontifex was crowning her, it was likely that nobody else was going to be claiming the title.

Her entire manner was very regal and imperious, far more so than Edward ever remembered. She was sat straight with her arms leaning purposefully on the throne's armrests, as if she was having a portrait painted. Stood behind were three of Mary's ladies-in-waiting, and flanking the three of them were Mary's new Imperial Guard, formed from members of the Elite Knights of Rochester as Edward understood. All went with her new title presumably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ferdinand of Trast\u00e1mara\" the Herald announced to the throne room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was accompanied by two of his Royal Guard, Edward had made an effort to keep Ferdinand's humiliation to a minimum. The two Guards stopped and nudged Ferdinand forward, he reluctantly approached the thrones and stopped four or five metres from them and didn't say a word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak\" Mary said coldly. \"Your King informs me that he made an offer\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerdinand remained silent, thus far he'd failed to provoke an angry reaction from anyone, Edward hoped dearly that Mary wouldn't crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary tapped her fingers repeatedly on the throne, seemingly impatiently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak\" Edward demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA resemblance of a smirk appeared on Ferdinand's face, before it vanished as he stared blankly in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good\" Mary clapped her hands \"you haven't lost your sense of humour!

And now you stand before me, and you are silent.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was naive for the thought of Mary cracking even crossed Edwards mind. Her mind games didn't seem to have provoked Ferdinand to respond yet, but if the thoughts were implanted in his mind, perhaps its enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you hoping that we'll leave? That the Castilian people will rise up against us?... Or perhaps Aquitaine will come to your rescue. You must know how likely that may be.

The Aquitaine invasion of Castile was a desperate attempt by King Laurence to hold onto his throne, the bluff can't sustain it's self for long. The more we push, the weaker it gets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aquitaine outnumbers us more than two to one, how would would you envisage a full scale invasion ending?\" Edward asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is why we must outmanoeuvre them, use subterfuge and tricks.\" She replied. \"I don't believe that weak King Laurence has the will or confidence to order an invasion that could potentially be suicidal to him. Besides plans have already been formulated theorising anything Aquitaine could do. I can't imagine we'll be caught off guard\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuchess Katherine was confident that her opinions were right, and she was a clever women, Edward couldn't doubt that she had a point but overconfidence too was a foolish stance. \"I will consider what you have said\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good, your Majesty. With your permission I will take my leave\" Katherine stood before he granted the answer she knew she could be getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Of course, my lady.\" With Katherine present his lunch had been extremely unrelaxing, Edward was in no doubt that the discussion was truly Katherine's way of giving her advice and orders to him, and though he was King he didn't consider it wise to argue with her. For all her faults Edward sensed her allegiance was fully to Mercia and Mary, and that she wasn't playing a power game. Katherine was one person that made the southern Castile regime stronger than the northern one, and Edward wasn't willing to weaken it for vanities sake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments Edward shook his hand, indicating that he wanted the empty plates taken away. While he was at it he ordered more food to be bought to him, the stress of working lunch is hardly helps the appetite. Even before he'd arrived in Jaca, Edward disliked Castilian food, he considered it too exotic, and without supplies from Mercia his court had settled on eating Aquitaine style foods, which wasn't so bad. Other than the meats, fish and bread, pastries, and cakes were the foods most commonly served food, and they were all among his favorite. As disdainful as basking in Aquitaine culture, Edward found it unavoidable when it came to food, especially when he was so far from home. </span></div></div>",

Walking briskly for forty minuets in that unbearable eventing heat wasn't something he wanted to do often. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's just in there Your Majesty\" The lead guard said, pointing at the isolated door at the end of the corridor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" Edward said as he patted the guard appreciatively on the shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard stepped in the chamber first, it wasn't what Edward was expecting - far more luxurious, and not prison like at all. Though he had ruled that Ferdinand was treated honourably, this must be how the Castilian treat their more privileged prisoners. Ferdinand was sat on a large chair facing the window, to the left of him was a small table and on the other side another large chair. The room also featured a good quality four poster bed, a large desk, a dinner table and a fire place. And the window a view of the entire city of Jaca. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will speak to King Edward alone\" Ferdinand said dryly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward nodded at the guard who handed him a dagger, and left the room closing the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not too bad... for a prison cell\" Edward commented. He placed the sheaved dagger in one of the Pyjama trouser pockets, and stepped further into the room, so that he was standing only a few metres away from Ferdinand, who had his back Edward as he gazed out of the high rise window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still a cell\" Ferdinand responded, captivity isn't all it's cracked up to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's better than being without a head\" Edward pointed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so... marginally.\" Ferdinand replied with a smirk on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... So. What is it you wanted?\" Edward asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To talk.\" Ferdinand said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that it?\" Edward said in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?...

Edward couldn't help but notice that Ferdinand wasn't wearing a shirt, he couldn't see the bottoms but I guessed they were just underwear. It seemed his advisor and courtiers were right, if he wore what he wanted then he'd be wearing what the Trast\u00e1mara pretender was wearing. It didn't matter an awful lot, but clothes were in a way as symbolic as a flag or coat of arms, they displayed your allegiance, your wealth or your mood. It wouldn't be proper for a Yorkist King dressing as the Trast\u00e1mara's did, especially after they expressed the the depravity as well as the apparent inferiority of the former ruling house. \"And now foreigners divide our land and place their own puppets on our throne.\" </span></div></div>",

They covered none of his legs, only his bum and genitalia. But Edward's eyes quickly were drawn to Ferdinand's torso, which was incredibly toned. His abs were well defined, and he appeared quite strong and athletic. Edward couldn't believe it. He'd heard that Ferdinand had been thin and lanky as a child, but became quite pudgy as a teenager. Clearly life on the run, and now in imprisonment had forced Ferdinand to getting into shape, but he was shocked to the extent. All of a sudden he felt quite self concious, he realised how soft his stomach had become... how soft it had always been to be perfectly honest. He'd never been skinny, even as a child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that doesn't mean I appreciate my current predicament\" Ferdinand continued, he stepped backwards and perched on the edge of his bed. \"Our first and only Queen was sent here after she failed to keep the throne, eventually she lost her head. Her sacred position didn't save her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won't kill you. It wouldn't be in our interest... to make a martyr of you.\"  Edward promised. To his dismay, his eyes were once again drawn to Ferdinand's naked torso. He still just couldn't believe how toned Ferdinand was, even seated Edward could see no body fat at all, he on the other hand was all to aware of his own stomach protruding over his waist when seated. More worryingly for Edward, he was turned on by Ferdinand; he could feel that he had an erection, fortunately the pajamas hid it, but it was seriously disturbing that he found a guy attractive, and a Castilian prince of all people. </span></div></div>",

It was true it was far cooler back in Mercia, a far better climate for that sort of thing in his opinion; though that had never spired him into exercise as a child, he'd always preferred reading and other indoor activities that didn't require much energy. No wonder he'd had a pudgy stomach all his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe crawled into his bed and took a deep breath, before turning over and going to sleep. </span></div></div>",

Once again his stomach rumbled and he quickly placed his hand to try and calm it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minuets of pondering as to whether he'd grab a snack or just try and get back to sleep he decided that he would, he was never going to sleep while he was so hungry. He crept to his personal cupboard which was stocked with food for his personal convenience, he grabbed a tin which was full of giant cookies that had been baked earlier in the day and took it back to bed. They were delicious, though he'd taken two out to have then and placed the tin to one side, soon enough he returned to the tin to get out an additional cookie along with his book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor half an hour he read his book, and snacked on the cookies in complete peace. It was so relaxing in comparison to the other events of the day. As he became full up, Edward decided to go back to sleep. He dropped his book back on his bedside table, and placed the lid back on the tin off cookies. There were only three left, had he really eaten almost an entire tin? That must have been over ten cookies. He was sure it had been full when he'd started, perhaps not after all. As he slouched down into bed and lent onto one side he could feel that his stomach had become quite hard and bloated in the process of his snack. No doubt he was going to have to cut down on what he ate, he couldn't afford to get any more unfit that he already was. </span></div></div>",

He looked around, at the massive swimming pool, the running track, the wrestling ring, the weights and the fencing ring. There was plenty of choice, obviously he couldn't wrestle of fence without a partner, or an instructor. He hadn't bought swimming gear, so if he did that he'd have do to it naked.

Edward placed his order, though being the same as everyday it came so quickly that he assumed it was prepared with the presumption that he'd be having it yet again. He started with simple bread, cheese and butter, until they bought out the soup and meat which he dug into heartedly. Just the smell had made him all the more hungry, he was relived that his stomach had at last stopped rumbling. Once the young King had finished that course he knew the next was his favorite, it included the sweet dishes. His servants bought through an assortment of pastries, cakes and biscuits. He was spoilt for choice, or at least he would have been had he not finished everything, as he initially assumed he wouldn't. They'd bought individual cupcakes, chocolate gateaux, lemon cake, shortbread, \u00e9clairs. It really should have been a far too much for someone of Edwards size to eat. But they were his all time favorite foods, as he had tried one dish, he had do try another. Despite feeling full to bursting, Edward continued to softly place the last of the chocolate gateaux into his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was great\", he said to himself under his breath. After it appeared that the servants were going to come and clear up, Edward got up and headed back to his bed chambers to relax before he had to attend court this afternoon. He walked almost as slowly as he had in the morning after exercising. Upon reaching his room he climbed onto his bed and let out a sigh of relaxation. So much for starting to cut down on what he ate, he so bloated that he was forced to unbutton his jerkin to feel comfortable, as it had constrained his rounded stomach When it came lose he decided to remove it completely and just though it to the floor. Edwards eyes started to flicker, as he rubbed his stomach gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward had fallen asleep for half an hour, good job he wasn't expected at court for another hour. In that time his bloating had gone right down, he felt normal again. That was far quicker than usual. Was it even good that there was a usual when it came to bloating? He sat up on his bed and looked at it's stomach, never had it looked flat and toned or even thin. He had always had quite a slender build, but his stomach had always been pudgy, even as a child. Likely on account of his love of sugar, and his hatred of exercise. Stting up his belly was protruding a good inch or so over the front of his trousers. He rubbed it once again, and this time it jiggled ever so slightly.</span></div></div>",

If that is the case, they are being lead by the Viscount of Saragossa, Felipe de Trast\u00e1mara. He is the son of the Duke of Aragon, who was transported to Mercia on Empress Mary's orders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is being done about it...\" Duchess Katherine demanded, \"forces must be sent to meet them\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Based on their location it is entirely possible they are planning a forced march to the Ciudad Rodrigo Fortress, a key strategic point on the western coast that would give them access to the sea. Or another part of Aquitaine held territory. I fear that should we rush to engage them that we would not win, we simply don't have enough soldiers. And doing so would alert them to the presence of our spies.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if they are to attack Jaca?\" Edward asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we assembled a force on route, we could attempt to delay them while we wait for re-enforcements.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only a delay?\" Edward replied with disappointment in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that is the case then Ferdinand of Trast\u00e1mara should be moved from the city as soon as possible.\" Katherine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Duke of Aragon is one of the key claimants to the throne, and without him Felipe de Trast\u00e1mara, as Crown Prince, will surely be intending to serve as regent. I can't imagne that they'll seek to 'liberate' him\" one of the other councillors said scornfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They may seek to harm him.. quite possibly kill him.\" Katherine pointed out, \"while it would be a difficult argument, they could then try and pin it on us\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree with the Duchess\" Edward quickly added, \"he should be moved at the next best opportunity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dreadnought Ark Royal is three miles off the coast of Jaca.

As soon as the decision to move Ferdinand of Trast\u00e1mara came up, Edward had in it his mind that he would make a second visit, perhaps a final visit, to the deposed Prince. There was still useful information that he could give them, and based on how difficult it was to get him to talk Edward couldn't see him giving such information to anybody else. Beyond that Edward was intrigued by him. Ever since the first visit, Edward had been considering excuses to use to visit him once again. Though he was doing all he could to deny such reasoning to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another warm night, and though the walk seemed to take for ever they made it there in less than twenty minutes. When Edward and his guards approached the door, they repeated the drill from the previous visit and waited outside, after they had opened and closed the door for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hoped you'd come visit me again\" Ferdinand said to Edward in his seductive Castilian accent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike last time Ferdinand rose to his feet immediately and offered Edward a seat next to the window. To Edward's disappointment he was fully dressed this time, well by Castilian standards anyway. He was wearing a light looking pair of short trousers, leather sandal like shoes, and a thin satin vest. \"I assume you were informed that you were to be moved from here in the coming days\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come to say goodbye?\" He asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't answer my question\" Edward protested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nor you mine...\" he added cheekily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked first\" Edward said starting to sound exasperated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha\" Ferdinand laughed, \"you're so cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward resisted smiling, though he wasn't able to stop himself from blushing, \"you still haven't answered...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay... yes, I was told. Taking me somewhere nice?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be moved to the dreadnought Ark Royal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I've never been on a battleship before\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not going to be a pleasure trip. You're being taken there for your own security\" Edward explained, he felt compelled to inform him of this fact and not only because of how quickly he became exasperated of Ferdinand's responses to his questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww shame\" he replied, completely unphased by the mentioning of the fact that his life could be in danger. \"Can't be worse than this... at least I'll get some fresh air\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I imagine that you'll disagree once you've spent a day on board\" Edward couldn't resist smiling that time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo... back to my question.\" Ferdinand said quickly, changing the subject, \"did you come here to say good bye?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nn..no of course not\" Edward quavered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, so you only came to ask me if I knew I was being moved... that's not the job of a great King.. usuper or no... now is it?\" Ferdinand asserted with a big grin on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had other questions\" Edward insisted, \"what do you know of Felipe of Sargossa?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's my first cousin\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very helpful\" Edward said sarcastically, \"anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His father... my uncle, tried to claim my throne when King Philip died. I expect he would have succeeded to had you northern bastards not launched simultaneous invasions.\"  Ferdinand explained, his tone was noticeably more serious know. Edward was surprised about how candid he was being, openly admitted that he thought it uncle would succeed in taking his throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You agree that your uncle could have won?\" Edward was shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Why not?\" Ferdinand smiled, \"he had more men than me, he was more popular and would have made a far better king. And it's not as if I wanted to be king anyway, had it been my choice I would have just given him the throne... but my branch of the House wouldn't allow it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Edward said, lacking any other response to the surprising explanation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And cousin Felipe?... He's an Infante of Castile, Viscount of Sargossa and future Duke of Aragon. Had uncle succeeded he would also be crown prince and the future King. He might yet be. Has he assembled an army against you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say that\" Edward answered, it was no use lying. The information though sensitive was no use to Ferdinand, who was he going to tell? And it wasn't as if Felipe was an ally of his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's why you're moving me. Your already expecting to lose the battle, and with uncle dead or missing, he could be King very soon indeed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Duke of Aragon isn't dead... or missing. We know exactly where he is\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a fellow prisoner?\" Ferdinand said joyfully, \"some good news at least\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And even if we should lose the battle against him, it doesn't mean we're planing on abandoning Castile. Besides with us gone, Aquitaine will have nothing stopping them from taking the entire country. Your cousin could do little to stop that\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fair point\" Ferdinand said, \"though isn't Aquitaine a greater enemy of yours than we are? That point would be bad for both of us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did say we weren't planning on abandoning Castile\" Edward reiterated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... of course. Well I'm sorry, but there's very little else I can tell you about cousin Felipe. He's a good tactician.... he's tall, dark and handsome.\" </span></div></div>",

Imprisoning me... and now interrogating me?\" he quipped, \"why would I hate you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward didn't know how to respond, he was so embarrassed he didn't know what to do or say. But some part of him didn't want to leave. \"F..f..for those reasons?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they give me cause to dislike, but not hate. The Aquitanians did it too. As did we in our hey day. But I could never hate anybody as cute as you\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cute?\" Edward blurted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your not tall, dark and handsome... and your skin is so pale it looks as if you've never been outdoors\" he said bluntly \"your sorta attractive, in a boyish sort of way. And your hair... I've never seen such blonde hair\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\" Edward croaked ineligibly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerdinand slowly unbuttoned his and brushed it to the ground revealing his nicely toned torso, he took Edwards hand and gently tugged it, pulling Edward back closer toward him. \"I noticed you admiring my body on your last visit... you seemed disappointed today when I was fully clothed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nn..no, I\" Edward stopped as he looked at Ferdinand's naked upperbody, he certainly was dark and handsome. \"I had never realised you were so toned\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't... when I was a teenager I lived in a permanent life of luxury... then came the civil war, then the invasion. You'd be surprised what that environment does for one's body.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward smiled coyly as Ferdinand moved even closer to him, and placed his left hand on Edward's knee, and his right arm around Edward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can touch me my pale Mercian usurper\" Ferdinand said in an affectionate voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..I\" Edward stuttered as he turned to face Ferdinand, he slowly moving his right hand and placed it on Ferdinand's olive toned chest, it was warm and hard and as sexy as it looked. Edward was fully erect as Ferdinand leaned in and kissed him squarely on the lips, Edward moved his left arm up onto Ferdinand's back as he fully reciprocated the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a good kisser\" Ferdinand admitted when the two finally parted.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" Edward said shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerdinand took Edward by the shoulders and gently laid him down on the sofa, as he knelt next to Edwards legs looking cheekily into the pale boys blue eyes. \"You've seen my sexy body.. on more than one occasion. It's about time I saw yours\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn amongst the intense pleasure this thus far short experience had brought Edward, this was the moment he was fearing; showing someone as sexy, handsome and athletic as Ferdinand his own body. \"O..okay\" he said nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward started at the top unbuttoning his jerkin, as he did so Ferdinand undid the button two buttons then proceeded to untie the cord. The Castilian prince was a fast worker, the cord always took Edward for ever to untie. Edward subconsciously gulped as Ferdinand impatiently opened his Jerkin and pulled his arms out and thrust it to the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still living the life of luxury I can see\" Ferdinand said with a smirk on his face upon setting eyes on Edwards soft pudgy stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward managed a chuckle in response, despite Ferdinand's smirk his face and tone was very kindly. Poking fun seemed to be something he did on a regular basis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd never have known with your torso covered\" Ferdinand said as he placed one of his hands on Edwards chest before he leant in for another kiss, \"is this the reason behind your ridiculous court fashions?\" he added after they again pulled apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ridiculous?\" Edward said slightly indignantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To help concede your chubby torso?\" he joked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N..no\" Edward managed another smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry... a few extra pounds is sexy as hell\" Ferdinand stated as he placed his arms on Edwards soft rounded stomach beside his sexy deep belly button. Edward was chubby, but he wasn't overweight. At most he was a stone or so heavier than people who consider themselves of an average body type. Ferdinand slipped his hands lower down where he he could see, and feel, Edward's flab protruding over his waist. He couldn't resist rumbling which caused it to jiggling slightly. He then moved forward to kiss again and until he was lying flat on Edward, there two bare torsos touching each other as they touched one another amorously. </span></div></div>",

Ferdinand was being moved to the Ark Royal earlier than previously anticipated, and he was being escorted by elite marine commandos, and their presence in the Palace meant Edward was obliged to inspect them. Fortunately it almost meant Edward could see Ferdinand before he left. His royal guards took up their positions either side of him as he headed out the steps into the palace courtyard where 20 soldiers were stood to attention. He walked between the the two lines in the middle who were facing each other and carried out the tradition of inspection, not that he'd know what was wrong if there was something. He smiled to each of them, and as a mark of their good training none responded or even moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he reached the end of the line he noticed Ferdinand being brought through in chains by two Palace prison guards. \"Your Majesty\" Ferdinand said , his bow somewhat sarcastic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward nodded in response and headed back into the palace, just as he reached the steps he turned to the Marine's commander, \"Keep him well commander, he may be our prisoner but he is royalty... he is deserving of some respect.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Your Majesty\" The commander agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey loaded Ferdinand into one of the two carriages that had pulled up, half the marines took their positions ontop, and in, of the carriages the others rose to their horses and moved into escort formation.

Edward had noticed the Ark Royal from his balcony, as it had moved into view of the port, where it could not dock due to its massive size, it had become visible for all in Jaca to see. Ferdinand would certainly be safe on that ship, neither the rebel Castilians nor the infamous Lord of the High Seas would risk attacking such a vessel, for if they did they would perish. </span></div></div>",

After the pleasure of the previous night, he knew he should be feeling great, but somehow he was feeling depressed. Now Ferdinand was gone, and what's the chances of him remembering Edward? It was said that the promiscuous Prince 'shagged what ever he wanted' an unkind rumour that did not cease when the Castilian courtiers fled. It's one of various topics of discussion doing the rounds among the current Mercian courtiers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward took a large bite into a barbecued chicken leg as he gazed our to sea, the Ark Royal was well in view from his balcony, Ferdinand would on board by now, perhaps in the brig if he was unlucky. It was occurring to Edward that his mind may have put an overly romantic spin on his 'forbidden love of two princes', especially when one prince is probably moving onto the next man of women. In addition, their love was forbidden. All over the the continent the act lying with another man considered sinful, regardless of the fact that people who commit the act are never punished, Ferdinand was one of many throughout history, to do it openly, before the fall of Castile that was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leant across the table and grabbed another two chicken legs, and a burger. They were starting to get cold, as Edward started his forth chicken leg he noticed the servants coming through with desert, and others coming to clear up the current course. As they placed the assortment of deserts on the table in front of him, Edward quickly chomped down the rest of his current course.  For desert they had brought him, cakes and pastries, as usual, but also ice cream, sweets and chocolate. The warmth demanded that he started with the ice cream, before it melted. It was thick, creamy and delicious. A sentiment he shared with the cakes, chocolate and the rest, which he proceeded to eat with tremendous enthusiasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnavoidable Edward burped, though he managed to hide it from the servants. After he had taken the last bite of cake he could manage, he singled to them to clear the table. They had brought him far too much, he must have left more than a third of it. Fortunately most wouldn't go to waste, what wasn't started would be given to the servants for lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result of so much being brought Edward had eaten more than he would otherwise done, and rather stuffed himself. He undid the two lower buttons on his vest, and the upper button on his trousers, to loosen them for his bloated stomach so that he was more comfortable. After which he breathed calmly as he was relieved of the strain, and lifted his legs onto the table and placed his head back onto the chair and began to doze off.</span></div></div>",

The forces of the Viscount de Saragossa had breached the city walls with a force that outnumbered the Mercians five-to-one. Many courtiers had already fled, the wiser had been evacuated to waiting Mercian battleships. Advisers had insisted that Edward and the Privy Council be evacuated first, but he had insisted that as King he must remain as long as possible, or look weak.

She was one of the most senior people at Court and in a very real way, the most powerful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you on the Ark Royal sire\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you your grace\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that the two departed, Katherine headed down the road and Edward followed the route to another narrow ally.

Native Castilians might turn them in for a reward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward stopped for a breather as he had been almost constantly running for an hour. Surely he was nearing the dock by now. His heart had never belated so fast, he couldn't know how much further he could physically go. It was certainly true that he should have been fit and in shape, like Ferdinand was when he was on the run. Edward was exhausted beyond measure, all those years of lack of exercise were now paying there toll. And if he died, or was captured that would be the reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately Edward found the energy to go on, he was running of adrenalin now.

They placed the tray on the table on the far side of the room and started to unpack it as Edward climbed out of bed. Upon him standing up they all bowed respectfully before finishing their job and then leaving his chambers. Edward looked at the table, expecting to be disappointed by it's content. He wasn't, they had brought him bread and an assortment of cheeses, a selection of cakes and a milkshake to drink. He had been expecting to see fruits, veg and other healthy type food, and in far smaller portions that he was now sat in front of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of a proper meal was a relief, Edward again felt his stomach rumble, far louder this time. He instantly dug into the food, downing the bread and the cheese really quickly. The slices of cheese were probably a little on the thick size, and he probably used too much butter - but he was starving, this wasn't the time to worry. Even as he finished that course he was surprised by how quick he'd been, and was disappointed that it was all gone. The disappointment didn't last long, as he set his eyes on the cakes they had brought, a large slices of chocolate gateaux with double cream, and two generous slices of lemon sponge. He gorged himself on the desert course faster even than the he had the bread and cheese. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn retrospect gorging himself like that probably wasn't wise considering the the fairly massive problems that were going on right now, but he hadn't experienced such hunger before in his life. He'd never experienced being chased out of his home by invading troops. It had, had happened to Ferdinand and he'd said how difficult he had found it, Ferdinand probably went days without proper food, and unlike Edward when he attempted to flee Jaca there was not a friendly dreadnought to pick him up, only an occupying battleship which forcibly detained him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he'd mopped up the last crumbs, Edward grabbed his milkshake and stood up and walked slowly toward his bed. He hadn't eatern enough to feel bloated, but he did feel heavy and had a touch of indigestion from eating so fast. As he lay down on his bed he unbuttoned his trousers and vest, taking away the considerable strain from his stomach, and lay on his side for another doze. </span></div></div>",

He slipped off his vest and trousers and walked over to the othe rside of the room where his ceremonial navy uniform had been delivered. It was red, and covered in gold and blue to show status of his rank. He'd never actually warn it before, but he was looking forward to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe uniform felt and looked great on him, the only trouble was that it was too small. Edward had had a lot of trouble fastening the trouser button but had eventually succeeded despite the discomfort. While the shirt, and jacket had fitted just fight, he had far greater trouble getting the belt around them. The golden sash was suppose to go around his waist, just where his belly button was. But it wasn't designed to be tied, like the trousers it's fastening had only one setting; it was fortunate that his dinner had all gone down after the nap, because to get it on in the right place he had to breath in allot. Once he was dressed he looked at himself in the mirror and he was pleased with the result, it didn't look at all tight on him, no more than it was suppose to appear fitted. Perhaps that's why it was so tight? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a few moments to get use to the binding tightness of the uniform, he left his quarters and headed over to the Admiral's office to meet with him, and Duchess Katherine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Majesty\" The Admiral said to Edward upon him entering the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward smiled back at him, and took a seat beside Katherine, who looked surprisingly well for someone who was injured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you sire\" Katherine said, \"the Admiral and myself were discussing measures that will be taken against the invaders.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any more news from Jaca\" Edward asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Katherine started, \"Fellepie Trast\u00e1mara has reached the palace and taken up residence, while we had expected him to declare himself Regent he has gone one step further...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"King?\" Edward interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed\" Katherine continued, \"he has declared himself King of Castile, explaining that with the disappearance, or death, of his father he was better placed sitting on the throne himself, rather than keeping it warm. And he's right. The people are more likely to rally to their King, rather than the boy-regent of an absent or dead man.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't afford to wait for him to make another move\" the Admiral said sternly. \"With him as a King holding the capital, the resistance ceases to exist and becomes a legitimate government... it will give his soldiers have confidence, and more will join him. He'll sweep across southern Castile and wipe out our entire presence, and I fear we will then be unable to ever take it back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly not should Aquitaine then do the strategic obvious. Fellipe must realise that southern Castile would be so weak that Aqutiaine would be able to take it with him unable to do anything about it?\" Katherine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would have thought so... he might be hoping that once he proves that not only can we be defied, but beaten that so can the Aqutianie occupiers.\" the Admiral replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm\" Edward replied thoughtfully trying to take it all in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless of holding the city, Felipe doesn't control the sea... that is still ours. I would suggest bombarding the city into submission.\" Katherine said bluntly, \"should he refuse we can then make our counter invasion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's if the so called 'Lord of the High Seas' doesn't interfere\" Edward pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While his ships are inferior, and his strategy sporadic, it would be foolish to discount him as a threat.\" the Admiral agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are arrogant... When we first launched our invasion they warned us that the seas of Castile belonged to them, and they would not tolerate our presence there... there ships were torn apart as they attacked the fleet as if it was trading vessel. His strategy may well have changed, but i can't see that it's going to be that much difficult to defeat them.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe discussions went on, for well over an hour. Edward only chipped in every now and then, he only had to make a choice based on their recommendations. Military strategy wasn't his talent, he was impressed by Katherine's knowledge though. When the discussions finally came to a close they decided to sleep on it and make the final decision in the morning. The assault couldn't take place until tomorrow at the earliest, it was best to leave things open when events were so fluid.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He stayed his path and walked directly towards the officer, avoiding eye contact fervently.

Whether a lucky guess, or pragmatic assumption, Ferdinand was right and Edward was going to have to decide whether to deny him an audience or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When he requested an audience, we denied the fact you were on board.

With a bit of luck he would have time to change from his uncomfortable military uniform before Ferdinand was brought to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter only about thirty seconds he spent selecting clothes to put on he heard a loud knock on the door, obviously he wouldn't have time to change. \"Yes\" He shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door flung open and one of his Royal Guardsmen stepped in, \"The commandant has brought the Trast\u00e1mara boy, will you see him now\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward stepped speedily across the room and sat down on his chair, \"thank you... bring him in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Majesty\" Ferdinand said, like last time he gave a somewhat sarcastic bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wished to see me.\" Edward said, he nodded to the Guardsmen indicating that he should leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.. you fled from Jaca I see... my cousin must have been successful\" Ferdinand said, as he wandered around the quarters nosily examining the ornaments and d\u00e9cor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clearly so\" Edward replied, \"he has declared himself King ahead of his father, and has already executed many of my courtiers who weren't able to flee in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Ferdinand was intrigued, he turned away from a golden clock he was looking at to face Edward, \"I never thought he was so ambitious. I never realised your hold over Jaca was so weak.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll retake the city soon enough... you may be reunited with your cousin if your lucky\" Edward smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you will... Castile doesn't have any vessels as impressive as this, I could see even the great 'Lord of the High Seas' falling before this ship.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He died when we first invaded, hopefully his successor has more sense than to attack an elite warship.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't the irony beautiful, you and your fleet sit of the port of Jaca... and you haven't the men to take the city back. Cousin Felipe holds the city of Jaca and is unable to attack you.

Duchess Katherine. Your cousin... sister\" he corrected himself, \"...Mary, she hasn't yet chosen a wife for you? No? Do I suspect that Duchess Katherine might be hoping to be rewarded for retaking Castile... that would be quite a reward.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No....no\" Edward replied nervously upon the mention of a wife, \"Katherine's already married... she's a Duchess after all, not a Dowager. There is still a Duke.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. I bet you are both very disappointed.\" Ferdinand replied in his usual annoying and sarcastic tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These things don't concern you... can we change the subject\" Edward snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.. Okay.\" Ferdinand reasoned, \"how about we talk about my cell... it's not exactly luxurious. Your's on the other hand... just look at what they have me wearing.\" Ferdinand was dressed in a simple loose black shirt and trousers that was commonly given to prisoners, it was a sign of Ferdinand's differing status as a prisoner here, than as a prisoner in Jaca. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did request that you be treated well\" Edward pointed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!.. I dread to think what my conditions would be like if you hadn't\" he chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny\" Edward replied, he smiled but wasn't quite as amused by it as Ferdinand was. Edward was now wishing that he'd kept Ferdinand waiting and changed first, with every passing minuet the uniform was getting more uncomfortable, if it wasn't bad enough that the vest was constraining him, the trouser buckle was only done up by the skin of it's teeth, and actually almost hurt when he was seated. </span></div></div>",

Especially if the vest then ripped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be shy my pale prince\" Ferdinand said affectionately, \"We have laid together before after all.\" <br>\r\nHe went around the front of Edward and started unbuckling his shirt, after a couple of seconds Edward slipped off his trousers and then took over, and Ferdinand backed away and perched once again on Edward's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the vest was completely unbuckled, Edward breathed a huge sigh of relief. The shirt was not at all tight, and for the first time in hours Edward felt comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look better now\" Ferdinand pointed out, \"fortunately for me these prison rags are far too loose to be so tight\" <br>\r\nWithout a moments further thought, Ferdinand just pulled his shirt off and showed his sexy torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing would be tight on you\" Edward said, somewhat mesmerized by the sexy Castilian prince sat in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is still Castile, and it's a fine night.\" Ferdinand said, implying that Edward should remove the shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Edward was reluctant, he would then be more undressed than Ferdinand... and this ship was far less private than the tower in Jaca. Ferdinand's persistent nudging however convinced him and he slowly unbuttoned his shirt, revealing his soft, pale and untoned torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerdinand stood up and placed his hands around Edwards belly and kissed him, \"I'll be shocked if you tell me that you hadn't guessed the real reason I asked for your presence?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kinda had\" Edward replied honestly, returning the kiss and placing his hands around Ferdinand's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minuet or so of kissing the two both lay upright next to each other on Edward's bed, Edward looked at Ferdinand's body... even sat like that he could barely see any flab on Ferdinand's body.

Pedro is small, fast and strong, and his intelligence is above average; unsurprisingly those who thought they could usurp the Lord of the Seas position because his youth didn't live long enough to realise their mistake. </span></div></div>",

The sudden expectation was a huge burden on Achilles, who was greatly unpopular across Arcadia for so poorly resembling Arcadian cultural traditions, especially physically.

As was tradition in Arcadia men worked out wearing only their underwear... some even completely nude. The workout in question usually consisted of physical wrestling, perfecting martial arts, and outdoing your every opponent. Such styles of entertainment had always drawn jeers from the kingdoms to the west and north, those that call themselves conservative, and moral. Disgusted by what they considered homoerotic ritual, and even worse - a culture based upon lurid sex, of all kinds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving wrestled two opponents, one around his size and build, and another a fair bit smaller... lighter, Theseus was content that he'd won every match against the two. Decisively, at that. He was acutely aware that this hadn't always been the case, and that his family's status depended on not only his political willpower, but his strength an virility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a young child, Theseus has been terrible at martial arts, bordering on the pathetic. The Curley haired boy had been a incredibly skinny child, all bones and no muscles, and despite having practiced with dedication, he rarely won any match. There was likely no noble lad around that hand't beaten him. Truthfully it hadn't bothered Theseus, he simply enjoyed the game, as he did today, and all throughout his youth, even if his teenage years didn't change for the better. As Theseus turned eleven, he finally began to fill out, and even managed to significantly improve his martial success rate, for a time. With an appetite that was rarely sated, the previously skinny child had grew flabby, soon becoming rather fat as he progressed into his teenage years. It was a shock for Theseus's parents, and his younger brothers - whom all had remained skinny, as he once was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Theseus left puberty, and his appetites decreased Theseus fast lost weight, and finally started to map out a successful martial career, beating many targets in and off the field, becoming athletic and toned... and the envy of his skinny younger brothers. </span></div></div>",

His men had high morale, and he fully intended to prevail at his second try. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had been a month ago now, and Georgios wasn't yet sure when he would be leading his forces back to the Sudetenland, whenever the Archon could convince the Senate that it was in Arcadia's interest. In the mean time he was taking full advantage of his leisure back in the capital, enjoying the luxuries not afforded to him in a legionnaire's camp, and giving credence to the rumours, the Archon's bed was one of those luxuries. A place that he found his way to as often as was humanly possible. The current moment was such a time, or it would be when the Archon returned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter almost an hour of lounging on the balcony overlooking the harbour, Archon Achilles finally returned.

His belly. \"Joe will be thrilled to have you as his soul mate. It was meant to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis, so athletic and strong, didn't need to say it. The implication stood for it's self. Francis often teased his younger brother Joseph for his body, whether it be how scrawny he is, or more relevant, how soft and flabby he is. Markus had not seen Joseph's bare body, so he couldn't really judge if the boy was growing flabby. He certainly ate allot of fattening foods, but to the average eye he looked every bit as skinny as the day Markus had first met him. It was entirely possible that he had become a bit soft, on the other hand it was Francis. Teasing and inconsistant jibes where his trade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough rounded, Markus knew he wasn't soft or flabby. Just a touch bloated, even he had acknowledged to himself that he'd stuffed himself like a pig the previous evening. And sure he was feeling a little heavy, bloated this morning, but in the long term it made no difference. Of that he was sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis didn't say anything else, it was obvious to him that Markus had known what he meant. The boy prince wasn't flabby by any means of the word, but he was looking slightly soft this morning - and not just because he was bloated. It had been a while since Francis had seen his father's ward with so little clothing, and he was certain that he looked softer. Especially around his belly button. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Francis was talking nonsense anyway, Markus may have stuffed himself last night, but that was it. He was just as slender, lithe and fit as the day he got here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"  Francis replied sarcastically, \"I'll tell him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up\" Markus replied, unable to stop the smirk that had materialised on his face with Francis crude comments. It wasn't even as if he truly had anything against Joseph - the youngest of the three brothers. He may be an enemy, but Joseph was nice. Unlike his two elder brothers, Markus had found Joseph to be intelligent and thoughtful - not like them at all. He was also quiet, and not so interested in all things physical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway. Full or not, you shan't be having breakfast.\"  Francis pointed out, returning to the topic at hand. He was right of course, even if Markus did wan't breakfast he would have time. He was expected at court imminently. Imminently and he was still naked. Naked and this elder boy was still here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can go\" Markus said with a sigh, in a calm tone that he knew Francis would take no offence. His gesture of poking at Francis in the upper chest, proved pointless as the older boy proved immovable.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for one so scrawny as you, Markie\" Francis replied in that ever so irritating tone, he took a pause and lifted up his shirt to reveal his well toned upper body, \"This is the body of a real man Markie. Not that... scrawny pudgy thing you've got going on\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up\" Markus said again, this time his words having more effect as Francis made his way toward the door. As he felt the pressure beneath his underwear he turned away. Was he getting an erection? Why for those mere few moments hadn't he been able to take his eyes of Francis's body. It was Francis... it was another guy.   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That said, he knew that while he remained slender, he had gained a pound or too in recent weeks. He had felt his stomach become softer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite this realisation, the young prince had remained unaware of his true gain. Yes, he still was slender... still quite skinny, but in recent weeks, and months, he had gained a fair bit more than a pound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, there was no harm acknowledging what he had accepted, even if it not been anything. \"Although\" he continued carefully, \"I have gained a few pounds, I know I have.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Joseph started, still in disbelief, \"you look fine to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" Markus replied flirtatiously, smiling back at the seated boy who he was imaging the body of. Not pudgy, apparently. Nor muscular, that was obvious. But skinny... slender. <i>Sexy.</i> Markus wondered just how much the boy had changed in the past months, since he had been lucky enough to see the handsome boy's bare body. As little as him, maybe? More... or less, perhaps?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, that leads me to what I wanted to ask you\" Joseph started... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He could not see his rib cage as he once had. That wasn't to say he could see any flab either, Although Joseph's navel looked deep to the eye, there was no flab surrounding it. Nothing close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very sexy\" Markus commented cheekily, \"how you manage to eat all that... and look like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoseph just smiled sheepishly at Markus as he dropped to the floor to do a push up. There the boy's scrawniness showed though, he made it only to six before stopping, \"six... I had expected better!\" he said with a giggle. Turning over and sitting cross legged on the floor. \"Your turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkus unbuttoned his night shirt, pulled it off and flung it to the ground. Joseph was immediately turned on by the sight. Markus too was not as skinny as he had thought, no ribs, a deeper belly button. And as he had said, a softer stomach. Although small, Markus' stomach flab was quite noticeable, especially when he dropped to the floor, and a singular roll sat his in lap. </span></div></div>",

Although Markus had expected more from it, in the knowledge that Joseph was due back from Mercia this day, he had not yet had the opportunity to see him. Instead he was hauled in to sit on a tribunal discussing the conflict in his homeland. As the Grand Prince this was supposedly still his duty, it was a pity he had none of the powers a Grand Prince of Mainz, such as the ability to appoint a regent -  as was the law for one below 18 in the principality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond that many hours of men and women drowning on, he had been cohered into joining Leo, in various events. With his father absent,  Archduke Leopold was entrusted to watch over the governance of Saxony. With his two brothers absent, Markus was expected - as ward and most senior noble present, to participate in any and all matters of state the acting-Archduke desired. And that included sparing, jousts, and all known of sports. This day had been no exception. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling off his shirt, before he climbed into bed, Markus caught a glimpse of his bare body in the ornate mirror mounted beside the wardrobe door. No visible abdominal muscles, but it wasn't hard to notice the absence, or more accurately reduction, of flab around his stomach. He'd thankfully been able to maintain his diet of cakes, pastries and all things sweet, but this had meant he hadn't become skinny once more, despite being considerably more active. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was interrupted from pulling his bed shirt over his body by his door suddenly flinging open, to the welcome sight of handsome Joseph, who's eyes quickly dropped to gaze upon his bare body. The older boy was dressed casually, yet extremely finely, in a fashion that looked far more in place in Mercia than here. And completely unsuitable for any working out they might else have done, much to Markus' relief - that was the last thing he wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The prince lifted his hand cautiously, he hesitated for a few moments before setting it on the older boy's body. With that moment of spontaneity, he patted the obscured stomach... it was... sexy, but soft. Really soft.

That he must considered carefully what he ate, avoided what tasted nice in favour of what lacked in calories. That he must be physically toned, and fit. In other words, he must be a good Saxon. Markus was not a Saxon. He was the Grand Prince of Mainz. As Joseph rightly pointed out, he did not need to concern himself so much with his body. With a lithe physique, and a high metabolism, gaining weight was not an issue for him. It had never really been much of an issue until Joseph's brothers convinced him that it was. A pound or two of puppy fat, and they had him down the gym everyday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're right\" Markus said, smiling. All of a sudden he felt more comfortable in his body, less aware of the small but noticeable roll of flab that remained on his otherwise slender body. \"It's just your brothers...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!

There had been the odd state occasion, but relatively little tedium to stretch out those summer evenings. And thanks to Joseph being back at court, Markus had finally been able to avoid attending the gymnasium with the Archducal brothers nearly everyday of the week. Nor had he felt ashamed, or conscious when he ate the occasional... okay regular,  sweet treat. Especially since Joseph had as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight was a state occasion, but it was one of the less boring ones. Nothing for generals and administrators, this was a banquet to impress diplomats from rivals, allies and enemies. Showing Saxonie's strengths, it's culture and it's cuisine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe atmosphere was jovial. Markus was seated just to the left of the main table where the Archduke and Archduchess sat with Francis, their son and heir. While Markus sat with Joseph, and Leopold. One was a thankful gift... the other a nuisance, but nothing that ruined the atmosphere too much for Markus. Without Francis to egg him on, Leopold was not half so bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond the atmosphere, it was unspeakably the cuisine that made this event so bearable. With Saxonie seeking to show off Diplomats of fellow nations, they wished to project the most sophisticated cuisine outside of Aquitaine. To that Markus was convinced they had succeeded. The savoury courses had not long since finished, and like the two boys beside him, Markus had pigged out on the meat on offer. The chickens, pork, lamb, even swan and venison. He had tried a bit of nearly everything... two bits in some cases. Thus was also true with with Joseph, and surprisingly, Leopold. The latter boy had not shown any inhibitions about restricting what he ate.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkus couldn't help but keep an eye on what Joseph was eating, for he possessed a residual concern that he might look greedy should he eat more than the older boy. There was no real problem on that front, as far as Markus could tell Joseph had gorged himself to an equal or greater amount on the savouries, and was now doing the same on the sweets. Both he and Markus had filled their plates, to the slight chagrin of Leopold who to Markus' laugher had soon felt obliged to have done the same himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe he hadn't eaten as much savouries as Markus had thought, or perhaps he simply had a larger appetite.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkus smiled, and lifted a spoon into his mouth. Despite being full it was divine; and he was starting to suspect he might well finish it after all. \"Starting to feel full\" Markus said honestly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already? We've still got the pastries to go!\" Joseph said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do?\" Markus said, feeling even more disappointed, after taking another spoonful of the moose he slid the plate toward Joseph, \"You wanna finish my helping?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Joseph replied as he surreptitiously added the moose to his own, carefully evading disapproving looks that might have come from his father or brothers, all of whom had drunk enough now that they didn't so much care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>How much more weight has Joseph put on?</i></div></span></div></div>",

With every bite the older boy took, Markus was regretting giving the tasty desert up. Even to Joseph. Sure he was feelingly slightly bloated... and even full, but after the lemon pastry, moose was just about his favourite morsel this Court could serve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you wouldn't regret it for long\" Joseph said astutely. True to his observation, the waiting servants were to now serve the lemon pastries that Markus looked forward to more than anything. Joseph had clearly seen the reluctance in Markus's eyes and voice as he gave up the moose, so to did he know that the following course was to be Markus' favourite. If that was indeed the case, then it was yet another thing that Markus adored about the handsome lad he was seated next to... if not then, well it didn't matter. He still got to eat the pastry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat he did, and at a record speed. He was barely finished his first slice, when the serving boy lifted a second slice onto his plate. Markus couldn't help but notice when Joseph was also given a second slice, that he had taken this course slightly slower than he, or maybe more accurately he'd not guzzled it as if it was water on a scorching hot day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay Joe?\" Markus found himself saying out of the blue. All of a sudden, with a snap, Joseph's hands had dropped to his lap, leaving the half eaten pastry on his plate. Only moments later, the older boy had risen from his chair, hands still at his waist, and sidled out. When Markus' queries went unanswered, he too rose from his seat and followed the boy from the court room attracting a shockingly little amount of attention.</span></div></div>",

After not having expected following to be quite so tricky, Markus had found himself traipsing along corridor after corridor, down and up flights of stairs. And with a touch of indigestion, the young prince found rushing to catchup undesirable. Or at least he had when he'd expected this to be a short walk. By now he had something of a stich, and physically catching up with Joseph seemed impossible. Of course it didn't help that Markus hadn't the faintest idea where he was going; much of the palace corridors looked identical to his untrained eye. For Archduke Joseph, however, he had grown up here; this wasn't a wild goose chase for him, he was surely heading one place in particular. <i>'Only where?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a distinct sense of relief as Markus emerged around a corner to hear the click of a large wooden door close. The prince didn't waste anytime, and swiftly pushed on the door handle, thrust the door open, and marched in. It was a bedroom. Portraits hanging from every wall, a picturesque view of the palace gardens, the exquisite four poster bed. This was Joseph's bedroom... <i>'At last!'</i> he almost said to himself, grinning wildly as the older boy suddenly took heed of his presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkus did his best to conceal the smirk that emerged as Joseph's trousers dropped to his feet as he span on his heel, putting his tight white underwear on full display. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Markus!\" Joseph said, shocked he bent down and pulled the trousers back to his waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Joe\" Markus said still grinning, \"why'd you leave the party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I felt, unwell\" Joseph replied unconvincingly, as he spoke he appeared to fiddle with his trousers at his waist before sighing heavily as they slipped from his fingers, and fell to his feet once more. \"Or, to put it another way... my trousers have broken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that\" Markus said, he approached the older boy as he once again pulled up his trousers. Initially cautiously, Markus lent out his hand to help Joseph do up his belt button, only to find the fastening missing, and the trouser ends difficult to meet. \"they look a tad tight.\" <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

His stomach becoming bloated from the many courses of the state banquet must have just let them finally give way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are rather\" Joseph replied cheerily, masking his embarrassment behind a smile. \"I tried to fix them at the table, but... yeah, as you can see, that wasn't too successful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Change...

As rival successors fought over the throne and pulled Castile into the abyss of civil war, the powerful kingdoms to the north saw their opportunity and made their moves. Aquitaine sent armies across their souther boarder and overwhelmed the divided and weakened Castileans, capturing over half of the vast nation in less than a month. With the majority of the Castilian army fighting in the northern regions of the country, a vast Mercian battle fleet landed a substantial invasion force in the south, which succeeded in capturing the southern most portion of Castile, with it the capital city Jaca, with little resistance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter restoring order to north and south Castile, Aquitaine and Mercia, respectively, pressed on with their attempts to capture the entire country. Both appointed puppet kings, and sought to cut off external trade for the other. Aquitaine stationed soldiers across the border while Mercia blockaded all major northern ports, east and west. Thus began the uneasy stalemate, as everyone wondered who would make the next move.  </td>",
