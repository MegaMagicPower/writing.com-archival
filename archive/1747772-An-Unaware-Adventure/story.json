This was not my bed with the overpriced sheets. This place was strange, dark and cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK. Think back. What\u2019s the last thing you remember\u2026? Going to sleep at home\u2026 But you\u2019re not home now\u2026\u201d A light in the distance, just a crack like the sun rising but this was different, it was cut off in a rectangular shape, miles wide.  The ground beneath me was a light color and looked somewhat like tile, but it stretched on forever surely it must be some kind of rock formation. Who would ever need this much tile? Then the tremors started rhythmically, one shortly after the other, each time becoming more and more powerful, until, a shadow cutting off part of the light on the horizon. Then it was gone. The Tremors faded away.  Slightly unnerved I sat there for what felt like an eon then the tremors returned and shortly after the shadow with it. An almost familiar sound and then the farthest corner of the strange rectangular light shot up for an eternity and started to spread. In shock I stared at the colossal outline in front of me.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She reluctantly crawled out of bed, turned on the hall light and trudged towards the kitchen to start the coffee. This was her normal routine. After turning the coffee pot on it was time to get ready for work, she headed for the bathroom. Opening the door she paused long enough to stretch and yawn before stepping inside and turning on the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was\u2026 It couldn\u2019t be\u2026 But it was\u2026 A giant woman\u2026 \u201cThis is a dream, a nightmare!\u201d I said out loud to no one in particular. Standing before me was a woman too big to comprehend. My senses were returned to me rather abruptly as the sole of her foot sailed inches over my head and her heel landed hundreds of feet away. She had only taken one step but that one step had covered acres and acres of distance. This was unlike any other dream I had ever had, I had felt the body heat from her foot, and the gust of wind as it crashed down almost knocked me off my feet. Logically that was impossible right? But if that was impossible then I must be awake. <br>\r\n\u201cBut if I\u2019m awake that means this is real\u2026 and logically that\u2019s impossible.\u201d My mind raced as I attempted to reason with myself. I barely had time to laugh at the fact that I was talking to myself before I was thrown sideways by an earth shattering force.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her brown hair with the blonde highlights was a mess. Her green eyes were still half closed unadjusted to the light hanging over the sink. The tile of the bathroom floor was cold beneath her bare feet she shifted her weight to her right foot and turned on the water. Splashing her face with the cold liquid to shock her self into consciousness she stood upright again and walked out of the bathroom to get a towel from the hall closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had just shifted her weight. To her this was a miniscule motion her foot had only moved half an inch to the side but it was enough to send me a good ten yards across the tile. I was alive, bruised a little, but still alive. I looked up in time to see water droplets the size of cars raining down from above. Scrambling to get under the slight overhang between the floor and the sink\u2019s cabinet I barely made it before being drowned. When I turned around she was gone.</span></div></div>",

Luckily my haven under the cabinet gave me sanctuary from her tremendous foot falls. Had I stayed where I was minutes before I would have surely been crushed. Her toes faced me momentarily before turning towards the gargantuan bath tub. They were painted a metallic pink, the polish was slightly chipped but then again at my size even the slightest imperfection was painfully obvious. Seconds later came the sound of running water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty retrieved a towel and walked back to the bathroom still groggy but starting to come around to the idea of being in the waking world. She turned toward the sink just long enough to lay her towel down before stepping toward the shower to let the water heat up. \u201cThis is going to be a long day\u201d She muttered to herself. She was only 21 a girl her age shouldn\u2019t have to work this hard. She should be out partying with her friends or studying for her finals. But no She had to be independent, so she worked a full time job at the local mall. She was Assistant manager of Sturbux Coffee, not bad for her age. With the steam from the water fogging up the mirror she began to undress.</span></div></div>",

This was definitely not a dream I had come to terms with that fact, but if it were a dream it was about to get a whole lot better. The gentleman in me was shouting to look away as the pajama pants and oversized t-shirt hit the floor but the pig in me was definitely louder at the moment. Personally I blame it on the near death experience you can make your own assumptions. I only wish my eyes would have taken in the sight before me in a little more of its entirety. It was as if I was reading an 800 page novel in 5 minutes. Definitely not enough time to appreciate the beauty. In an instant the shower curtain was drawn and my sight was hindered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warm water was a welcome guest on her skin. She enjoyed her showers but with her job she knew she had a limited amount of time to get ready if she was going to eat breakfast. Rinse, lather, repeat, and then it\u2019s time to shut the water off. As she stepped out of the tub every drop of water on her skin glistened in the artificial light some of it dripping onto the mat below. Still standing on the rug she reached over to the sink and grabbed her towel, running it across every inch of her before tossing it onto the floor and walking out of the bathroom to go get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwe is the only word that can express the feeling I had as I stood there staring, mouth agape as the goddess of a woman stepped back into my line of sight. And then she bent towards me, well towards the sink at least to grab her towel, allowing me to take in a few more pages of the novel so to speak. I had to step out take a closer look. My mind knew it was a mistake but I wasn\u2019t thinking with the mind on top of my shoulders at that point in time. Looking back it was stupid but still it was totally worth it, until she dropped the towel of course. Everything was dark, I was trapped, and cursing my stupidity.</span></div></div>",

If you\u2019ve ever tried to breathe through wet fabric you can appreciate the fact that I was in fact still remotely coherent. The towel was heavy and smelled of lavender body wash. I wasn\u2019t in hell but I wasn\u2019t at peace with the situation either. It\u2019s funny the things you think about when you\u2019re a fraction of your normal height. Perhaps it was the lack of oxygen but my mind was wandering to all sorts of odd places. I believe the idea of feeding mayonnaise to tuna popped into my head at least once. Hell may be I was just bored. My thoughts were interrupted as the vibrations in the floor that I had become so accustomed to returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty headed into her bedroom to select which outfit she would be wearing to work today. Not that she had much of a choice, Sturbux had a rather strict dress code of khaki pants and either a black or white top, with any pair of black closed toed shoes. So this process took all of 5 minutes. After dressing it was time for coffee. As she walked past the bathroom she remembered the towel on the floor. Her mother\u2019s voice rang in the back of her head \u201cPick up after yourself lil miss!\u201d Sighing she bent over retrieved the towel and proceeded to toss it towards the hamper at the end of the hall by the washing machine. She had made it halfway in that was good enough for her anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could smell the coffee all the way from her room but as she entered the kitchen the aroma began to perk her up. She did love her coffee.</span></div></div>",

The towel holding me pinned to the tile moments before had been ripped from its resting place pulling me in its wake. The air current sent me rushing past a khaki colored wall that cut off abruptly to jet black. The will to live must have been strong because I still don\u2019t remember grabbing hold of the loose thread. But there I was hanging thousands of feet in the air by one hand no less. I thought the wind from the towel was bad when the world I was clinging to started to move the gusts felt like I was standing behind a jet engine. If there was ever a time I wished I had taken up mountain climbing this was it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill blissfully unaware of the mortal struggle happening right under her nose, Misty poured herself a cup of coffee and popped some toast into the toaster. Then she turned to the fridge to grab herself some milk, poured it into a bowl, and debated on what cereal she should eat this morning. Deciding on cheer-e-os she grabbed the box and at down at the table with her bowl and spoon. About that time the toaster popped, so she quickly hopped back up and grabbed the other part of her balanced breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMust hold on\u2026 Don\u2019t pass out\u2026 My journey thus far had taken a lot out of me to say the least. I struggled to remain in a conscious state as the vertigo and exhaustion threatened to take me under. I managed to hold on as I hung over the toaster falling in there would definitely not be in my best interest. I managed to hold on as the cold air of the fridge beat down upon me. I even managed to hold on as she sat down at the table. Unfortunately I was not prepared for the sudden movement as she popped back out of the chair as soon as she sat down in it. I went tumbling past the wall of black. Eyes closed I waited for death but it didn\u2019t come instead I felt cold, and wet.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Had she known there was a tiny being struggling for survival right under her nose she probably would have helped. Misty wasn\u2019t a mean girl, quite the opposite actually, she would normally make a conscious effort to help her fellow man in her day to day life. The knowledge of what she had put this tiny person through probably would have riddled her with guilt. As they say \u201cignorance is bliss\u201d and she was quite content as she dug her spoon in and took the first bite of her breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was in shock as I surfaced, surrounded by an ocean of white with hundreds of tan islands. It hadn\u2019t dawned on me where I was immediately. Of course the enormous silver object dropping out of the sky a few hundred feet away snapped me into the reality of the situation rather quickly. I had fallen into a bowl of cereal the size of one of the great lakes. Swimming for my life seemed my only option but I never was all that strong a swimmer and minutes later the side of the bowl still seemed miles away. Of course even if I had made it there would have been no way I would have reached the rim of the bowl to pull myself out. The spoon dropped in relatively equal times, it was only a matter of minutes before I would be scooped up. This I knew for a fact.</span></div></div>",

Nothing eventful about the process after about five minutes she looked down to see only a few pieces of cereal left in a nice neat cluster with a swoop of her wrist they were on her spoon and on the way to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew now that trying to swim for the edge of the bowl was a mistake I was so exhausted that I was forced to use one of the islands as a flotation device. Looking around the water\u2026 Err the milk rather was calm. \u201cThis is where the jaws music comes in right?\u201d I had barely enough time to finish that thought before I felt movement below me. Up I went out of the bowl thousands of feet above the \u2018lake\u2019 I was stranded in. Until there it was in front of me, the gate of my would be doom. Her face was far to epic to even begin to take in but her lips they were just big enough to scare the shit out of me. They parted slightly releasing a combination of morning breath, milk and cereal. The light from the kitchen window shone in at just the right angle to illuminate the moist cavern in front of me, pink walls with razor sharp teeth slightly yellowed from smoking it looked like, and the floor was an undulating pink monster. Behind it the most horrific part of all, a hole leading to total darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty slid the spoon between her lips and pulled it out clean. As she chewed the last of her cereal she picked up the bowl she carried it to the sink. After swallowing she headed back to the bathroom to brush her teeth before leaving for work.</span></div></div>",

Had I not already been soaked to the bone from the milk I would have been from the humidity of her mouth. Suddenly I flipped violently as the metal floor below me was yanked and I was left on the monstrous tongue. Few people have ever had the chance to appreciate total darkness, that pitch black color that gives one the illusion that the world is pressing in around you, perhaps I\u2019m just claustrophobic. My ride wasn\u2019t over yet, without warning there was a lurch beneath me and I knew I was flying towards teeth strong enough to crush things 10 times my size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot one to give up I opted to curl into a little ball and managed to roll across a molar as her teeth clamped down. The sound of the cereal crunching made my blood run cold, but what really got to me was the gulp I\u2019m somewhat proud of myself for not fainting at that moment. I was safe\u2026. Wasn\u2019t I?

This didn\u2019t take too long after all who did she have to impress at Sturbux, no one that\u2019s who. She pulled the toothbrush out of her mouth and grabbed for the toothpaste, then proceeded to bush her teeth and spit into the sink. After rinsing off the toothbrush she put it back in the cabinet behind the mirror and turned out the light. Sighing she trudged down the hall, slipped on her black sneakers, and left for work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight burst through behind me I had gotten so turned around inside her mouth I was actually moving in the direction of her throat not the exit I was hoping for. \u201cThat\u2019s an odd looking thing.\u201d Of course now I realize it was a giant toothbrush at the time what would you think if you saw a shadow like that soaring over your head? It crashed down onto the molar above me and the mouth clamped shut again leaving me in darkness. \u201cThink Troy...\u201d Oh that\u2019s my name by the way Troy Joyner, and by now you\u2019ve noticed I have a problem with talking to myself. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get out of here or you won\u2019t live long enough to regret it.\u201d It was stupid, it was reckless, it was down right insane, but then again this entire day had been insane. I reached up and grabbed one of the bristles on the brush, and as the mouth opened I was removed with it \u201cIT WORKED! OH\u2026\u201d I released the bristle without even thinking my brain had finally gotten to the point where it could recognize everyday items in their gargantuan states and I knew that was a tube of toothpaste coming towards me and going back into that hell hole was not an option. Closing my eyes for what felt like the millionth time that day I awaited death, may be I was living under a charmed star, may be it was just dumb luck, once again death didn\u2019t come. I had fallen into her make up bag right onto a powder-puff. After the initial sneezing fit from the cloud of make up that had engulfed me, and was probably too tiny for the goddess above me to even glance at, I stood covered head to toe in the tan powder. The light went out and she was gone again. Just happy to be alive, I let myself fall backwards and passed out.</span></div></div>",

There was an ungodly noise coming from outside my prison, the sound of a thousand and one fighter planes all lined up together and at full throttle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes were blurred; the light was on in the bathroom which meant the unnamed goddess was obviously home. The noise stopped and I was comfortable lying where I was. Well as comfortable as one can be in a world so drastically altered. I was definitely content with the idea of letting her just go about her business and worry about getting her attention tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately that was not in the plan.

Well go get dressed we\u2019re going to the club tonight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKami I don\u2019t think\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNuh uh, stop right there you\u2019ve been moping around for months now. You need to just forget what happened. You\u2019re coming tonight whether you like it or not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that e\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said you\u2019re coming end of conversation\u201d Kami said with a laugh. \u201cNow go get dressed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClick\u201d Kami had hung up on her, but may be she was right may be it was time for her to get out of the house. May be she could even meet someone new, yea may be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a renewed energy she hopped up off the couch and half skipped her way down the hall to her bed room. She found her little black dress hanging right where she had left it in the closet, tearing off her work clothes and grabbing a fresh towel she made her way to the bathroom to wash off the coffee scent left over from work. After towel drying her hair she walked back to her room pulled on the dress and found a pair of black open toed heels and her black handbag to go with it. Then it was back to the bathroom to do her hair and makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blow dryer did its job quickly enough and she reached for the makeup bag. First turning to a tube of light red lipstick, She liked getting dressed up but she was never one for much make up. Her natural beauty was more than ample so she never had much use for it. Dropping the lipstick back into the bag she reached for the powder and lightly applied it to her face. With that done she flicked off the light grabbed her purse from the floor by her feet and headed out the door.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Better question how many times would I be falling today?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first impact on her cheek didn\u2019t quite knock me loose, senseless yes, loose no. The second I found myself completely loopy for lack of a better word\u2026 Her skin was soft and after the initial impact it was actually rather enjoyable though all too brief. The third slam is where I found myself tumbling through the air. I thought at first that I would land down the front of her dress, and really that wouldn\u2019t have been such a bad way to go, but apparently this was when my \u201ccharmed star\u201d decided to be eclipsed. I tumbled past her cleavage and saw her toes staring up at me far below, but that was not my destination either, between her feet sitting open like the maw I had been trapped in earlier was a purse. Small on her scale just there to carry a few necessities: cell phone, gum, etc...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo me it was comparable to looking down on an Olympic sized pool while sky diving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the only target I had, so it would have to do.</span></div></div>",

Now was my chance to split before the titaness finished what she'd started, despite the bruises I'd received that made even walking a chore, much less running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, they also served as the grim reminder of the mortal danger I was in. Dashing across the plateau-like bathroom tile, I decide to make for the bathroom doorway before stopping to plan, since at least from there a quick exit could be made if she approached again. It's not like I wouldn't have a blatant, tremorous warning when that happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving just emerged from beneath the cabinet, there wasn't a whole lot of ground covered as I'd turned my back to the giant chick. I heard a noise reminiscent of thunder as clothing began to thud to the tile from above; the giantess' pants coming down in a heap behind me, and her shirt <i>crashing</i> down just about ten \"feet\" (relative to my size) in front of my path to the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a small bathroom, but not at all to me. So here I stood, trapped between two friggin' Great Walls of Clothing on my front and back. Rather than waiting like a sitting duck, however, I hesitantly altered my course and headed for the left wall of the bathroom for safety. This, at least at the time, seemed like a prudent decision.</span></div></div>",

Survival before pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping the blood from my mouth onto the back of my wrist, I turned to survey the area.  Beyond the clothing hillocks was the shower cubicle, currently home to several tons of woman and water.  There was a fairly clear path to the exit, but once I left this room what would I do?  Scurry around like a bug?  No,perhaps I would need to contact the woman. While the coast was clear, I could secrete myself about her garments, to maybe get her attention later.</span></div></div>",
