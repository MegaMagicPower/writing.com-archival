Tyler then dug into his pocket and pulled out his billfold. His fingers delicately crawled through the bills, he finally pulled out a crisp fifty and placed it on the counter. The cashier held a scowl, he wanted a nice pet like Tyler had, but instead he typed in the total. While The cashier did so, Tyler held  Alex close while he stroked Alex\u2019s fur through the shirt. \u201cWhen we get home, Were going to have some fun.\u201d Tyler whispered as he picked up the bag of toys and carefully placed his change in his wallet, and his wallet into his pocket. Tyler smiled at the cuddlesome wolf holding on to his arm, he remembered how he found the wolf. <br>\r\n              Tyler had been expecting his new maid to be a girl, all his others had. But his mother had sent him Alex, She had a thing for anthros, She thought they were cute. So he was shocked when the maid arrived in a French maid outfit, feather duster and all. The blush on the wolfs face showed through the fur, his eyes never left Tyler\u2019s six foot frame. Tyler\u2019s pants couldn\u2019t hide the excitement he felt. That night he called the new maid into his quarters. \u201cyou missed a spot.\u201d Alex looked so frightened, he looked around the room looking for said \u201cspot\u201d but saw nothing. In fact Alex didn\u2019t even go into this room. It was until Tyler took off his pants that Alex finally figured it out.<br>\r\n   \u201cYou want me to what?\u201d Alex almost shrieked, he was a virgin, and had never even thought of it before.<br>\r\nThat started a chain reaction, every night Alex was summoned into Tyler\u2019s room and they did it. Soon it was not enough, Tyler got more romantic, Alex more submissive. And soon Alex went from maid to pet.<br>\r\n               Tyler opened the door to Alex\u2019s side, letting the wolf out.

Tyler blushed, still a little embarrassed about the new twist on their relationship. He'd met Alex six months before, and they'd hit it off right away. It had been a crowded club, not the type of place that had sex in the open, but the kind of place where people who wouldn't mind that kind of thing went to meet. They had been kissing and groping an hour after introducing themselves to each other, and slept together in Alex's bed that night. Normally the wolf would politely kick his bedmate out the next day, but he decided the human just looked too cute to be tossed out without another romp or two. They both had been expecting only casual sex, maybe a nooner the next day, but to their surprise it had turned into a real relationship. The more time they spent with each other, the more they grew to like each other, until they fell in love. Then, almost a week ago, Alex had casually suggested that Tyler might enjoy being his pet. Tyler thought he just meant roleplaying in the bedroom, as they had already done a number of scenarios like that, but Alex meant it more as a lifestyle. Tyler could act as his sexpet in and out of the house, wherever they went. Alex had tried it with a former boyfriend who had turned out to be a jerk, and he wanted to try it again. The human needed some coaxing and petting before he consented to trying it out. So far he was enjoying himself, even if it was still kind of humiliating to crawl around the house wearing only a collar, or be lead by a leash from place to place. Alex was a good master, and he made sure Tyler was having fun being his pet, not to mention all the kinky fun he himself was having with his human pet. Seeing Tyler naked at all times, completely subservient to the wolf's will, was a 24/7 turn-on and Alex hoped it would never end. Then again, he couldn't help but wonder what it would be like on the other end of the leash...<br>\r\nThe cashier rang them up, and Alex handed over the money. The wolf grabbed their purchases and tugged on Tyler's leash, leading the nearly naked human out of the store and back towards their home, eager to try the products out. <br>\r\nOn the way back, they... </span></div></div>",

He knew he had to get Tyler over being shy, but he wasn\u2019t sure how he would do it. Still, Alex\u2019s mind wandered to the bag he held in his right hand, along with the leash.<br>\r\n    \u201cTyler, where do you want to eat?\u201d Alex smiled down at the nearly nude boy at the end of the leash. Alex, even though he was the master, made sure he asked Tyler what he wanted to do. He always felt like Tyler had the best plans, he was just \u201cnot allowed\u201d to voice them. Alex gave him that voice.<br>\r\n    Alex hated how Brent, his ex, Would make all the decisions for him. The domineering Horse always pulled the chain too hard and in the direction only he wanted to go. Now every night that Alex lays his head down before he goes to sleep he remembers the testosterone-filled tyrant, and vows to never be him.<br>\r\n    \u201cLenny\u2019s! They have the best burgers. Plus I love how you drink your shakes.\u201d The humans cheeks burned bright read as he confessed watching the wolf slurp up every last drop. \u201cI think it\u2019s cute.\u201d Alex smiled and kissed Tyler on the forehead.<br>\r\n    \u201cI love how you eat their fries.\u201d<br>\r\n   \u201cAnd I loved when you used to be mine!\u201d shouted a burly voice, coarse, and worn. \u201cYou always curled up next to my feet.

The only reason I stayed with you as long as I did was because I was scared you would hurt someone.

Alex had been walking along the streets in the pouring rain, just after being kicked out of his house for being gay. His parents were big on religion, and took the bible a little too seriously. Tyler was just leaving his house, which he had owned for just over a week. There on the street in front of Tyler\u2019s house they bumped into each other. Alex was the first to apologize, quickly helping up the downed human.<br>\r\n    \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I couldn\u2019t see where I was going, what with all this rain.\u201d Alex tried to put on a smile, it was transparent to Tyler seeing through the wolf like he were a window.<br>\r\n    \u201cRain or tears?\u201d The human reasoned, with a reassuring smile. \u201ccome on, lets talk inside out of this rain.\u201d Tyler led the freezing wolf into his house, heated by a nice fireplace in living room. \u201cMake yourself at home, bathroom is upstairs, I was just about to go shopping, but first things first, Why are you crying? Alex sighed, it was inevitable, he told him first that he was gay and watched the reaction of the boy. Nothing, so he continued telling how he had come out, then how is father lost it. Throughout the entire story the boy showed more rage toward the wolf\u2019s father than anything for him. When Alex finished Tyler said the one thing Alex had not expected<br>\r\n    \u201ccome live with me. I\u2019ll do my best to get you back on your feet.\u201d Alex readily accepted.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\nTHREE WEEKS LATER: Alex was about to take a shower he had a towel, and a change of clothes, he opened the door, and there, completely naked, was Tyler. He didn\u2019t seem shocked, but Alex was blushing deep red under his fur. He hadn\u2019t wanted to stay this long but he couldn\u2019t help it, he was frozen in his place, and slowly Tyler\u2019s glare went from Alex\u2019s eyes to his crotch, a grin slipped over Tyler\u2019s face. He pulled the boy in further, pushed him to the ground closed the door, and began taking the wolf\u2019s clothes off. As soon as he pulled Alex\u2019s pants past his balls he forced his face there, taking the entire length, He could guess was about 9 inches long, 2 inches wide. He forced his mouth over it. But he quickly got off and looked Alex in the eyes, fear filled them. Tyler quickly sat up.<br>\r\n    \u201cI\u2019m sorry Alex, I-I couldn\u2019t help myself. I have wanted you ever since you got here, and.\u201d He was silenced by Alex\u2019s fingers to his lips. As Alex turned and presented his virgin ass.<br>\r\n    \u201cTake me.\u201d the only words Tyler needed, he reached into the medicine cabinet and pulled out the lube, slathered it on his pulsing prick, and lightly lead his way to the wolf\u2019s hole, and slowly spread the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since that night the had experimented and tried different things, but when they tried this master/slave it just stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the hour the two reached their home, ready to try the toys Tyler had bought.

He still couldn't believe the wolf had actually gone through with the bet...<br>\r\nAlex and Tyler had been friends since their families had moved into two houses right next to each other. The first memory each of them had of the other one was peering over the edge of a windowsill and seeing another small face peering at them two yards away through another window. <br>\r\nThey had hit it off at once, and were inseparable throughout their childhoods, playing tag and making forts and fighting in epic snowball wars. <br>\r\nThey slept over at each other's house so often that both families bought an extra cot for their child's bedroom, though they usually wound up snuggling together in the same bed.<br>\r\nIt was in high school that they started to notice they were attracted to each other, and had gone from hugging to kissing to heavy petting. When they'd discovered frotting, few days passed without them pressing their groins together, rubbing and grinding until a mutual climax was reached. Naked in the showers after the other guys had left, clothed in the bathroom between classes, or any private moment when they could risk it. They didn't find out about other sexual practices until a <i>very</i> friendly puma named Tom had introduced them to blowjobs and anal sex. More often than not, they had to flip a coin to see who would suck who off, or who would top who, since they both enjoyed both roles so much. <br>\r\nThey dated all through high school, and though their families weren't thrilled about it, they didn't object too loudly as long as Alex and Tyler didn't rub their faces in it. The sleepovers still happened, and more often than not Tyler would wake up to find a cute, fluffy wolf butt in his face, or Alex would get woken up by human teeth gently teasing his nipples. Of course, they were still teenage boys who were best friends as well as lovers, so there was a lot of friendly competition and betting. Tyler would try to beat Alex in a soccer game with their friends and force the wolf to buy him dinner if he lost. Likewise, Alex would study hard to get a higher score on a test than Tyler, who would then have to give the wolf a foot massage. More often than not, though, it was games like \"Bet I can make you cum faster than me\" or \"Bet I can get off more times than you\", with appropriate 'punishments' for the loser. <br>\r\nThey had eventually graduated from high school and gone on to college, as roommates, naturally. They had a lot of fun with the full freedom that being separated from both sets of parents brought them, both with sex and the kind of mischief they could get into. They discovered that the local gay community was mostly into BSDM, and were drawn into the world of slaves and masters, whips and chains as curious observers. Eventually, they started to incorporate some of the things they had seen in their love life, but Alex schemed to take things even further than ever before. <br>\r\nIt had all started at the Superbowl party that their friends were having. Whooping and cheering and booing as their competing teams crashed and struggled on the football field, the two of them were feeling the rush as their teams fought for dominance. <br>\r\nTyler scowled, remembering clearly how Alex had cried out during an especially brutal play \"Hey, Tyler! I bet you <i>anything</i> that my team wins!\" <br>\r\nThe human had been too caught up in the game to see the gleam in the wolf's eye, and had scoffed at his best friend/boyfriend. \"Ha! I'll take that bet, loser!\" <br>\r\nTyler's team was making the push forward, and he cheered until his throat hurt, the noise dying down just in time to hear Alex speak in a lower voice as he leaned closer. \"Fine. The loser is the winner's slave for a whole year.\" <br>\r\nIn retrospect, Tyler really should have seen it coming. Alex always wanted to watch the slave/master pairs when they went out, and had been dropping subtle hints about how hot he thought it was for weeks. At the time though, Tyler suspected nothing and just laughed. \"You're on!\"<br>\r\nOf course, that was the moment when Alex's favorite team burst through the other team's defenses and scored a touchdown. Tyler had forgotten the bet during the rest of the game, but Alex sure didn't. <br>\r\nThat night, he'd strolled up to Tyler in their apartment, wearing the cockiest grin the human had ever seen. \"Well?\"<br>\r\nTyler was confused. \"Well what?\"<br>\r\nThe wolf held out a spiked leather collar with a padlock on it. \"Aren't you going to put it on, slave?\"<br>\r\nThe human was confused for a moment, then suddenly remembered the bet. \"...What?! No! We were just kidding!\"<br>\r\nAlex continued to hold the collar out, still grinning. \"A bet's a bet. We've never not lived up to our end of the bet before. You really wanna start now?\"<br>\r\nTyler had tried to argue, but it was no use. Alex was right, neither one of them had gone back on a bet before, and Tyler didn't want to be the one to break the streak. He reluctantly donned the collar. <br>\r\nThe wolf had carefully locked it in place, then put the key to Tyler's collar on a chain around his neck. In the local BSDM community, this told everyone who saw them that Tyler was the slave and Alex was the master. \"Now strip, slave.\"<br>\r\nTyler's face burned with blushing as he stripped down for his new master. It was so degrading, but it was strangely arousing... He was hard by the time he'd taken off all his clothes, and Alex began to stroke the human's strong body with a furry paw. \"Good slave, good boy...\"<br>\r\nThe human had to admit that he had a lot of fun that night, as Alex firmly ordered him around and dominated him so utterly. They'd always had equal roles before, but Alex was taking to his new job as Master really well. <br>\r\nStill, Tyler's pride burned as they walked around in public, the things on their necks telling everyone what kind of relationship they had. Not to mention the way Alex ordered Tyler to do chores naked, or wearing a skirt with no underwear, or other equally degrading things. Or making him follow him around in public wearing nothing but bicycle shorts! Yet Alex wasn't being mean, just teasing and toying with his lover, and Tyler knew it. It was bad for his pride, but he'd never been so horny so often. And when Alex bent him over and had his way with him at random times, rough and long and tenderly loving, Tyler knew he liked this way more than he had ever believed he could. In a weird way, the degredation was a <br>\r\nOf course Alex had offered him an out, not long after he'd put the collar on. He'd said that as much as he wanted to do this, he didn't want to do something that would make Tyler miserable.<br>\r\nThe human had opted to stay a slave for the full year, as long as Alex promised that he could stop if he really wanted to. The wolf had agreed, then ordered Tyler to clean the bathroom naked while Alex watched. <br>\r\nThe sex was still awesome, weeks later, and their dorm room had never been so clean. Now Alex wanted to start adding toys like these to their games, and Tyler knew that he'd enjoy it in spite of himself. <br>\r\nThe wolf paid for the stuff, and ordered Tyler to carry it, looking back just in time to see the human blush as he walked outside wearing nothing but the shorts and the collar.

The short, cat-like snout and pointy ears held remembrance, especially the left one which had a tare after a brutal fight; he didn\u2019t like being called a fag. There sat Tom, or as his friends called him \u201cTom cat.\u201d He had kept in touch with Alex and Tyler, but hadn\u2019t visited them in a while.<br>\r\n    \u201cYour back, I was wondering if you would ever show up.\u201d his strong masculine voice echoed off the paper thin walls. \u201cYou see I found.\u201d he stopped as he saw the collar around Tyler\u2019s neck. \u201cOH ho ho! You two have been busy, why didn\u2019t you guys tell me about this?\u201d Tyler blushed a deep crimson as Alex began to explain.<br>\r\n   \u201coh, I see. So you guys have only been s and m for about a month, I actually kinda half expected Tyler to be the master.\u201d Alex and Tyler got caught up on what was going on with the Puma, But before he started Alex ordered Tyler to get into his outfit, Tyler knew well what he had meant. His outfit was in fact his birthday suite, Alex also had him serve him and Tom their drinks.<br>\r\n    \u201cGo ahead and touch him if you want Tomcat, he doesn\u2019t mind.\u201d Alex laughed, he knew of Tom\u2019s feelings for Tyler, and he loved how embarrassed Tyler got when He showed them. When Tyler got back from the kitchen holding a tray of glasses filled with water and milk, and wearing only a blush Tom made his move as he was handing the glass of water to Alex, Tom grabbed his ass. Then slowly slid up to fondle his balls. Tyler shrieked and spilled the water all over Alex.<br>\r\n    \u201cserves him right\u201d thought Tyler as he pulled away from tom. It wasn\u2019t enough to quit the bet, but it did make Tyler furious.<br>\r\n    \u201cOk guys listen up.\u201d Tom spoke in a whisper, as if to keep the people next door from hearing him. \u201cI found this little vial of liquid. I\u2019m not sure what it dose, And I want to try it out, but I wanted to do it with you guys, that way I know I\u2019m in good hands.\u201d Tom popped the cork off and began to put it to his lips.<br>\r\n    \u201cNo. Let me try it.\u201d Alex grabbed it out of Toms hands, \u201cyou are a scaredy cat, you wouldn\u2019t try it unless you knew it\u2019s effects would be good for you.\u201d Alex smelled it, then downed it. Tom smiled at Tyler,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s all yours now. The antidote is in the bathroom medicine cabinet, it\u2019s the red one.\u201d With that Tom got up and left the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~what dose the potion do?~~~~~~~~</span></div></div>",
