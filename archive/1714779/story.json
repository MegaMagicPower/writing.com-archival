I let out a soft and high pitched groan, feeling dizzy. \"Wake up <i>little girl</i>...\" she says, adding emphasis. I rub my eyes when my weight shifts upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god you are the cutest little squirt.\" Jessica says. Before my eyes can focus I'm lifted right out of bed. The first thing I see in the morning is Jessica's breasts coddling my face. Her exposed cleavage from a black cami holds my face as a strong and large hand presses me in. I try to step back but my feet aren't touching the ground! I shriek in surprise, but it's muffled. I feel myself being swung from side to side in my sister's arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I want to hold her now.\" I hear Amanda say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" her twin responds. Squirming, I finally get to see as Jessica's hands hold me by the armpits, as something soft and fuzzy comes to my attention. I let out a high pitched \"EEEK!\" as I'm dangling a few feet above the ground. A bright pink full body nightgown drapes along below me, as I see two small feet dangling beneath. The soft fuzzy felt feels warm with the white ruffles along the neck, sleeve, and dress lines fill it out. I turn forward to see Amanda looking massive now. I scream again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-what's going on?\" I squeal with a high voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just made some changes that'll make our lives easier.\" Amanda says. Jessica carries me to their restroom and into a mirror. My short brown hair dangles down and I see a shocked little girl looking back in Jessica's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://awarenessismyjob.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/endofaug-032.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://awarenessismyjob.files.wordpress....</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we can control a lot of great stuff about you little sis.\" Amanda says, looking smug and patting me on the head. Too stunned for words, I just stutter and start to freak out a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean control? You can't just do this like magic!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, it kind of is squirt.\" Amanda says.</span></div></div>",

She snapped her fingers at me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy vision flashed for an instant, and I felt a jolt go up my body. I immediately felt colder than before, and severe tightness around my chest, torso, and butt. My arms were bare and no longer covered by a pink fuzz. Instead my shoulders were gently draped by a see through light pink fabric. As I turn to look down I feel a weight jingle around and I feel something heavy and warm. I saw a big pink rose meet me, the rest of my upper body was tightly covered by a solid and smooth pink top with frills on the shoulders. It was very cool and skin tight on me. It was then I realized it was more of a leotard as a stiff pair of briefs rounded my butt and smooth frontal area. Around the waist were a bunch of bows and a long, puffy pink dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://everafterstore.com/media/dressup_pink_princess_party_dress.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://everafterstore.com/media/dressup_...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wha? How?\" I stammered. I stumbled back and fell down making my two sisters look even bigger than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, did you have to maker her so pretty in pink style? That's so...cliche.\" Jessica said, bending over and wiggling the tiara on my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" I whined, trying to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tough luck kiddo, since Amanda got the physical changes you're probably going to be wearing cutsey stuff all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well duh, I wouldn't let her wear anything else.\" Amanda smiled. She snapped her fingers again. \"There we go, nothing but dresses and skirts in her closets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are so predictable.\" Jessica rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's go get you changed out that sweetie.\" Amanda stretch out her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I don't want to wear that stuff either!\" I cry, crawling back up. The leotard riding as I stretch and the dress floating everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you have to wear something...\" Amanda sighed.</span></div></div>",

She helps me out of the princess dress as I stand there naked in front of her. Her much bigger size and my new space lower down made me very embarrassed. Amanda dug through one drawer and handed me a pair of panties. It was white with a blue flower print. I didn't care that it was girly, I just wanted to cover up. They were tight and cool, and with fabric pressing against my er, new parts I felt like a girl even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda then handed me a pair of white socks, with lots of lace and frills at the top. I reluctantly put them on. I kicked around a bit as the frills waved every which way. For some reason I became amused with them when Amanda came back over to me from the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arms up sweetie.\" she said. I could see she had something deep blue, but I couldn't tell. \"Come on honey, I'm not going to do anything bad.\" she assured me. I slowly raised my arms up as whatever it was came over my head. Amanda pulled it straight down as the cold fabric pressed against my skin. It went down like a tube down to my shins. It was a normal blue dress that was tight at the top but flowy on the bottom. Amanda finished it by putting a headband in my hair and making me put on a pair of black dress shoes that buckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.alittleindulgence.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/ds-12-09.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.alittleindulgence.us/blog/wp-...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it cute?\" Amanda pleasantly asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's better than before.\" I say, tugging on the dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, this is so cutsey I want to hurl.\" Jessica butts in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh be quiet, that's not nice.\" Amanda says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but it's my turn to do something...\"</span></div></div>",

I gripped my head, felt the mental storm subside, and opened my mouth to yell at Jessica for doing that--whatever it was--to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead I squealed in delight and spun around in the dress. \"Thank you for the dress, Amanda!\" I said, hopping up and down. Part of me tried to stop this embarrassing display of prepubescent cuteness, but my body and mind refused. \"Now I can pretend to be the royal, English princess. 'Ow are you, love? Would you like some more tea?\" I curtsied after my poor, stilted imitation of a British accent, and Amanda and Jessica applauded. \"I can't wait to show my friend Tanya this dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you won't,\" Amanda said, and then, to Jessica. \"Funny the person who hates Rachel being cute makes her even cuter than I ever would have thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a temporary thing,\" Jessica said, smirking. \"I'll give her a few hours to act like this before we have the <i>real</i> fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say.\" Amanda turned to me, prancing about my room. \"Where's the toy unicorn?\" I asked to nobody in particular, and Amanda giggled as she picked me up. \"All right, Rachel.

You didn't do anything to me, I know it.\" I began to tug on the trap and pull and strain. Instead of simply pulling out, the trap tightened and held my thumbs in place. I tried my hardest but I couldn't get free. I knew I could do it but the trap wouldn't let go. I got tired from pulling and I sat down, still essentially tied up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-give up yet?\" Jessica grinned at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you're being mean Jessy.\" Amanda said. She picked me up and cuddled me in her chest. I began to sniffle from being so tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, you're treating her like such a baby.\" Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is! We wanted a little sister to teach things to.\" Amanda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God both of you suck.\" I moan, still tugging on the trap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And for that we're not letting you go so easy.\" Amanda sighed.</span></div></div>",

She easily draged me towards my closet, then turned to Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See squirt, you're as smart as any seven year old girl. Don't you agree, my litttle sister. Behave and we may be nice\" Jess says grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" I said, trying not to make things worse. The fact they can do this to me is driving me crazy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What shall we dress Rachel as today?\" Amanda muttered going through the new clothes she had doubtlessly placed with the strange spell that they're placed on me. Jessica had shifted her attention away from me, and onto whatever horror they're planned to afflict next. While I can't see what she is finding, you feel it can't be good, especailly since she triumpantly yelled \"This will be good on her\"</span></div></div>",

Once I got to middle school, they'd <i>consider</i> cutting me some slack, but until then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door slammed shut, and I stood in the middle of my room in a goofy princess dress, ashamed to wear it in the first place, but even more ashamed that it fit me. To an outsider I probably looked natural in it, a young girl dressing up for a tea party with her stuffed animals. I knew that's how my sisters wanted me to appear, and it was only a matter of time before they began parading me around the streets. Grandmas would walk up to me and say how cute their little sister is, how well-dressed she is, what a beautiful girl she'll be when she grows up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI climbed up on my bed, not used to being the same height as my mattress, and tried to get comfy with the skirt frills puffing out every which way. \"This sucks,\" I muttered. I wanted to say more than that, to cuss and talk dirty, but no swear words came to mind. Jessica's spell had robbed me of all my teenage language and profanity. Such an abstract concept boggled my mind, just like basic mathematics, science, and history. I thought of last year's English class and couldn't remember the books we read. When I thought of Dr. Seuss, though, my memory lit up. I thought of football, which I remembered doing throughout high school, but had no idea what the word meant. It became all too obvious, when I grossed myself out wondering what they called the thing guys have under their pants, that even though I remembered high school, those memories meant nothing to me. I should have known that from the start, when five times seven stumped me and the Chinese finger trap...but I preferred not to think of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clock read \"7:43.\" Only five minutes. Now <i>that</i> math I understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What should I do now?</i> I thought. Half-an-hour was a long time to think about how much my new life sucks, so I looked around the room and considered my options.</span></div></div>",

I quickly pulled the dress off, the frilly skirt, the leotard top, everything. I stood there buck naked, amazed at my naked body and lack of material between my legs. I figured I didn't have time for this, and looked for some underwear. On the top drawer above my head, I figured it would be there after trying the lower ones. I had to reach above my head to pull what I could tell were briefs out. They were pink with a heavier pink lettering of \"Barbie\" on them. I groaned but knew I didn't have time to be picky. I slid them up, annoyed that it didn't feel any different from the leotard bottom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then heard the footsteps coming up the stairs. I hurried and pulled the first thing I could grab from one of the outfit drawers. It was a white causal dress with pink flowers on it. I pulled it over my head quickly and let it flow down to just above my knees. \"Ugh, this isn't any better.\" I groan, as the two of them come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time's up squirt.\" Jessica said, barging into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could've at least knocked.\" Amanda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a little kid.

Amanda and Jessica didn't seem to be around here, but I was still cautious. I didn't know what they would do to me if they caught me trying to escape. As I reached the bottom after a much longer time than normal, I looked around. I didn't see the two of them, and I quickly ran to the front door. My little legs went slower than I would've liked, and my tight clothes felt weird with my exaggerated motions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up at the door and much to my fear there was one of those child safety knobs over the normal knob. It was white and plastic, and it needed to be gripped to open. I jumped and just managed to get ahold of the safety knob, but I just couldn't grip it. I fell a few inches off of it and onto the ground. I thought about the door to the garage, but there's no way I'd be able to get the garage open without them noticing. I scurried around to find a play area with all sorts of dolls, stuffed animals, and tea sets around. 'What should I do?' I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's go get little sis.\" I heard Jessica say from the basement stairs next to the room I was in. Panicked, I saw a toy chest and climbed inside. It was filled with plushies as I threw one or two out to make room. I shut the lid and heard them go by. I knew they would think I tried to get out, and I needed to think of something fast.</span></div></div>",

They're just starting to wake up and get their bearings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck!?\" One of the girls says. She has long straight black hair, short and sweet looking. The other girl had long and curly blond hair. She stammered to her feet next to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This happened stupid!\" Their little squeaks pierced the air as the blond girl shrieked in surprise. They were wearing pink and purple frilly dresses. Their hair was held by matching headbands and they looked adorable together. Also, they were both wearing white, choker necklaces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\" What I assumed could be Amanda began to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I didn't do anything!\" I stammered to my defense. It was so strange looking down on them for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liar! I'm gonna make you the dumbest sex driven slut around you bitch!\" Jessica yelled and snapped her fingers. I cowered in fear but nothing seemed to happen. A look of shock gripped Jessica's face as she snapped over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Amanda cried a bit more, shaking her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet down! I'm trying to figure this out!\" Jessica shoved her sister aside. I snapped my fingers out of pure curiosity, but that didn't do anything either. Then I realized the necklace was on the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you both have the necklace on now.\" I speak to them. They immediately turn to each other and point in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do!\" they said in unison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Take these off!\" Jessica whined, tugging at the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...what if something even worse happens?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could it be worse!\" Jessica struggles more. \"I'm a little girl and I'm wearing a cute little girls dress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you love dresses when you were little, right?\" I nonchalantly ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! No I don't!\" Jessica screamed. Suddenly the necklace lit up and she began to wail on the floor. I ran over to her with Amanda trying to help. After a horrifying moment Jessica began to regain her composure. I helped her up as she looked around some. She eventually became fixated with Amanda next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\" Amanda asked, a bit nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're dress is cute...c-can I try it on?\" Jessica blushed and shyly looked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to be kidding me.\" I groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Rachel, help us somehow! We'll change you back if we fix this!\" Amanda pleaded. Jessica stood there twirling in her dress watching it rise and fall as she spun.</span></div></div>",

I have no right to be a vengeful bitch, especially if I want to prove I have the moral high ground over my sisters. Keeping that in mind, I nod to Amanda and say, \"Of course. But first thing's first - call me Roger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" Amanda trails off, experiencing a mental crisis just like I did, I'm sure. After weighing the consequences she says, \"All right, R-Roger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled. After hearing Rachel over and over and over, Roger sounded good, sweet, nostalgic. It reminded me all was not lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now find a way to help us!\" she yelled. \"There's a magic practice book in our room, but it's old and I don't know how well you can read it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica, at that point, had wandered off to her room in search of cute dresses and was humming some children's rhyme or another under her breath. I watched her totter through the doorway while I considered my options: I could go find that practice book and see what it had to say about these sort of spells, although from the sounds of it Jessica and Amanda hadn't used it in a while, and there was no telling what age-caused damage had fallen on its pages. Then there were the collars...if cutting mine had caused this, then cutting them again...but what if it didn't happen? What else could possibly happen? Still, it was better than nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI considered my choices and, seeing Amanda's increasing desperation, I decided:</span></div></div>",

I was their play thing, and now the tables are turned. I'm not one to be mean if someone's mean first, but these seemed like special, extenuating circumstances...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you talking about, Amanda?\" I say in a sweet, gooey voice. Amanda just stares wide-eyed at me, not sure where I'm going with this. \"What's there to change? I'm your big sis and you're my little, baby sister. That's the way we were born.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hits Amanda. \"Don't you dare!\" she yells. \"That is not how we were born, that is no--AUGH!\" The necklace tightens around Amanda's neck and fills in with pink. She falls to her knees, earning a concerned \"All you all right?\" from Jessica. But then she gets up, blinks a few times, and cupps a hand to her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When was I born...?\" she wonders aloud. \"199...19...2004?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, Amanda,\" I say. \"I'm so proud of you! My li'l sis can finally remember when she was born!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day continues like that, as Amanda and Jessica succumb to their roles, and the necklaces fill out until they're both a bright, hot pink. By the evening, there's no way of knowing that the twins were once juniors in high school, on their way to college. I've reclaimed that role, even though it's as a voluptuous, blonde bombshell. I try to turn myself back, snapping my fingers, scouring my sisters' room for any spellbook or magic recipe, everything. I find an old, worn-out book, but half the text is borderline illegible and the rest is in a language I don't understand. Oh well. You win some, lose some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not fun looking after baby sisters, though. They run around, knock each other over, run up stairs they might fall down at any moment. At least Amanda and Jessica could alter my behavior and actions to keep me in check. When I'm really frustrated, I wish I could control them like they controlled me. Nietzsche had a phrase to describe that: \"He who fights monsters...\" I know I've got the moral high ground, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs life goes on and I fit into my new role as Rachel, I look at my sisters and wonder, \"Did I do the right thing? Are we better off like this? Would they have turned me back?\" With no way of knowing, though, I truck on, focused on college and the freedom it'll grant me from my sisters, the reminders of the choice I made.</span></div></div>",

I guessed it was around seven o'clock, so she'd still be getting ready for work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, there was Mom, just stepping out of the bathroom with a towel wrapped around her, dripping wet from head to toe. She didn't see me at first, too focused on the pile of clothes she'd set out on the bed for herself. I waddled over quietly, not sure whether to disturb her and risk finding out she had no idea who I was. Was she in on Amanda and Jessica's plan? Did they cast a spell on her so she remembered me as a girl? Or were they doing this behind her back, making sure she never noticed that her son had gone missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she dropped the towel and put on plain, white panties and a...piece of fabric over the balloons on her chest--I kind of knew what the thing was and vaguely why it was there, but for the life of me I couldn't remember what it was called, probably because I'd never had to wear it yet it, as an eight-year old--I resolved to talk to her, tell her what had happened, or at least get her to protect me from Amanda and Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy,\" I said, the word coming naturally to my lips.

In less than thirty minutes, I had triumphed over my sisters and would momentarily be rewarded with my old, male life. I enjoy the sad, angry looks on Jessica and Amanda's faces, and silently thank Mom for her help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica and Amanda look at each for a second, during which time I look towards my mom. I try to see the expression on her face, but that's when the twins smile and snap their fingers in unison. A vibrating, mirage-like blur clouds my vision as my body tingles, growing numb and malleable, expanding so I can vaguely make out that I'm growing closer in height to Mom. <i>I'm almost a boy!</i> I think ecstatically. <i>Thanks to Mommy, I'm almost a....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI notice I still think of Mom as \"Mommy,\" and even though Jessica snapped her fingers, there's no giant pain in my head signaling a mental change. Neither of these facts mean anything to me until the transformation ceases, and my eyesight is restored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go,\" Mommy says with a smile. \"Honestly, girls, I already had to deal with your sister as a little girl once, I don't want to do it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sister?</i> I think. <i>Oh no...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look down, groaning when a lot of brown hair falls across my face. It doesn't keep me from seeing the giant, balloon-like lumps sticking out from underneath a green tank top and that same piece of fabric I saw Mommy wearing, along with a skirt shorter than any skirt I'd ever seen or worn. My panties feel weird, tiny in the back so they stick up my butt real far and I wince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to work now, but if you do anything like this again, I know how to take those powers away,\" Mommy says, now fully dressed in her work clothes. She wishes us all goodbye--calling me Rachel--and walks out the door. I stare at Jessica and Amanda, who listen as Mommy's footsteps get farther and farther away until the door slams and she's gone. The car pulls out of the garage and the twins turn to me. Jessica is grinning, but Amanda looks really sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to me!\" I yell. \"I'm a big girl now and I have these...\" I gesture towards my chest. \"Balloons, these lumps, these bags, <i>I don't know what they are</i>!\" I'm tearing up now, ready to start bawling, but Jessica snaps her fingers and takes the sadness away from me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't want to do this, Rachel,\" Jessica says. \"We wanted to get you acquainted with being female, teach you how to be a girl so when you grew up into <i>this</i> body, you would know how to use it. Now that you nearly ratted on us, though, I think it's only fair we give you a trial by fire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what that means...\" I say quietly. I used to know, I recall, back when I was a boy in high school, but those days make little sense to me now with this mind and its smaller, simpler ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means you're an eight-year old in a fifteen-year old body,\" Amanda says. She sounds <i>really</i> sad, almost as sad as I got a minute ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even more of an eight-year old than before,\" Jessica adds. \"I made some slight variations to your mind, while I also changed Mom's memories, enough you probably can't feel it. It means you don't just have the knowledge of an eight-year old but a thought process and inner monologue similar to what a little girl would be thinking.\" She says this really meanly, enough that I cringe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She would have been a great little girl...\" Amanda whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica shrugs. \"It's what we had to do to get Mom off our backs. So long as she doesn't know when we use magic, we're fine, but if she realizes it's a spell, then she can...\" But she doesn't finish the sentence. She turns to me, sitting there and poking at the fabric beneath the tank top, which feels like my princess dresses did: soft, frilly, thick and covered with pictures of roses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's almost time for school,\" Jessica says. \"Rachel, let's just say you'll have to learn quickly how the big girls act.\"</span></div></div>",

I push this strange hair out of the way but it comes back. I rub my head overall to get rid of the feeling when I feel hair all over the place even slightly down towards my back. I move my hands down to push it away from my shoulders when I feel two tiny straps laying over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look down to see some thin straps holding up a white Hello Kitty cami that cuts off just above the chest. What was exposed I can tell is really soft and smooth, while the top holds tightly to my body, as I can feel the slightest movement on me. I let out a soft yelp of surprise as I jumped back a little. It was then I felt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was tightly squeezing against my butt and some felt was pressing against a smoothness between my legs I never felt before. Looking down I see some dark pink checkered panties around my legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.webundies.com/images/agh9186.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.webundies.com/images/agh9186....</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, I look around to see a shady (it is still dark in the room) but very pink painted room. I tug at the top and look down as well as my legs. This couldn't be happening. Suddenly an insatiable urge to go to Amanda's room came over me and I darted out, shaky on my legs and into my sister's room. Inside I see both Amanda and Jessica up and ready to greet me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There she is!\" Amanda squeed with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, how cute we have our own mini-us.\" Jessica says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what the hell?\" I yelp in a high pitched voice. My legs feel very cool and my thin frame gives out as I fall to the floor on my knees. I hold my sides trying to check things out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing much, we just got a new sister that's all.\" Amanda says to me gleefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a...a...?\" I stammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a vagina don't you?\" Jessica sighed. I look down at my underwear and see it's completely flat. I gulp at what this could mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does your chest feel sore?\" Jessica blankly asks, coming up to my face. I focus for a moment and realize my chest is a bit sore in this top. I nod slowly. \"Cool, she's already getting boobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be happening...just, just how?\" I cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we can Rachel.\" Amanda says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright kiddo, we've got a lot of things to teach you about being a chick.\" Jessica says, helping me up then immediately shoving me into Amanda's cluttered but fragrant bathroom, and I see myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://agirllife.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/girl.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://agirllife.com/sitebuildercontent/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a dream.\" I say to the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afraid not sweetie.

Immediately a jolt went through my body, going from my feet to my head. I felt paralyzed for the few seconds the jolt went through. I didn't physically feel any different at first, but then my found my clothes felt tighter than they just did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all you did?\" Jessica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's only twelve, I can't do that much.\" Her twin replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" I asked quizzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't tell, really?\" Jessica asked. \"I told you you didn't do enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just made you a bit of an early bloomer Rachel.\" Amanda giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at my arms not to see anything and then looked down. Out of my top popped to bulges on my chest. Startled I took a step back only to feel their weight shift as I did so. They were big enough to see a hint of cleavage from my perspective but were still rather small. The top suddenly felt tighter than before, when I noticed the shorts felt even tighter. I looking around my sides I felt the shorts riding up on me as I saw deep inclines between my hips and my torso. Or rather, I guess my hips had gone out some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? I feel so weird.\" I complain, trying to dig the shorts out but with nowhere to go, did nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you were going to grow those anyway.\" Jessica rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is true sweetie you were. And besides, I made it so you'd be really full and curvy when you fully mature, so this isn't too bad.\" Amanda explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, my back already- wait what?!?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to be hot kiddo.\" Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That reminds me, since I changed her I need to adjust her clothes some.\" Amanda thought out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second.\" Jessica stopped her train of thought. \"Let's go shopping for it instead. Take Rachel on her first shopping trip.\" Jessica knew Amanda loved to go shopping. As soon as she heard that, Amanda's eyes lit up and she smiled some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! Let's do that!\" She happily exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way I'm doing-\" I tried to stop before this got out of hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I want to!\" Amanda moaned. \"Let's go...\" She snapped her fingers once again.Instead of my body making the weird feeling, my clothes instantly changed from what they were. Instead of pajamas I was now in a dress. I felt a pair of panties tightly bind where my legs met my body, and the upper part of the dress wrapped around my torso. The rest of the dress floated down towards my knees and stopped. I was shocked that Amanda could also change my clothes basically at will. Before I could protest, Amanda grabbed my arm and began to drag me to her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.bayareabags.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/baby-dress2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.bayareabags.com/wp-content/up...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-stop!

Why was this so desirable? Because bigger breasts meant bigger status in the world of middle school, where puberty brought with it burgeoning sexuality and desire. I knew all that, the reasons were clear and logical in my head...but it didn't matter! I still imagined what the material of a bra would feel like. Probably soft, silky. The support would be there every moment during the day, the straps digging in my shoulders. Maybe a little itchy too. Why did I want that? Because it was <i>new.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe store attendant greeted me with a smile. When my sisters told her why I was there, she nodded. \"It seems it's that day for a lot of girls. Just you wait a second and I'll make sure there's a fitting room available.\" She walked off, and I stood by the counter with Amanda and Jessica, looking at all the bras hanging on the walls, on stands, depicted in pictures of adult models scowling towards me. I fought against the curiosity and took control for just a moment, long enough to say, \"Couldn't we wait another day...?\" But then the attendant came back and led me to the fitting room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" she said, pulling out measuring tape. \"Hold your hands up please.\" I did as instructed, and she wrapped the tape around my chest, asking me to hold one end down, right over my left breast. \"Hold it there for a second...\" I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. \"30B. Not bad.\" She smirked. \"Not bad at all. You're going to be quite a looker in a few years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew the thought was coming. I tried to hold it back, tried to tell myself I wouldn't be like this in a few years. I'd be a guy again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the thought came: <i>I knew I'd get big.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, let me get a few bras to try on,\" she said.

So, my t-shirt showed how I was developing as I felt incredibly self conscious with the bouncing. Jessica was following close behind, as the mall was gaining people for the weekend rush. I was dragged down the line of shops before reaching a store called \"The Icing\" which was apparently a young girl's clothing outlet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what are we doing here?\" I asked timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shopping duh.\" Amanda says pulling me in with her. We scampered to the back, past some other girls my age looking at various clothing. My arm was sore from the pulling as we reached the back of the store were I noticed all the racks of training and normal (albeit small) bras hanging. I struggle to pull away, but Amanda snaps her fingers and I suddenly become to weary to do anything. I tiredly stand there holding her hand wondering what I would be forced to try on.

She needs a fitting.\" Amanda tries to explain without embarrassing me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This her first real one?\" the clerk asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" Amanda gleefully says. The clerk then takes me by the hand and into a dressing room. I can hear my two sisters whispering back and forth outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I need you take your shirt off.\" she asked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wha?\" I stammer. Crossing my arms over my chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to fit you, it's ok to be a little embarrassed, all girls have to go through it.\" she explains. Too weary to object, I slowly take my shirt off as she takes her measurement strip and wraps around me. I nervously shake, but too weak willed from Amanda's latest trick to get out of this. The clerk finished her business with my body and left for a moment. I hear the two outside still giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk came back shortly with a bright pink bra with her. I slide it up and she tells me to lean over while she hooks it up.The cups around my buds as she finishes adjusting the shoulder straps. Suddenly my back felt better and I seemed to naturally stand taller a bit. I couldn't understand why I suddenly felt better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A perfect fit.\" the clerk says.</span></div></div>",

The clerk's comment made me blush, and against my better judgment and sense of male identity, I felt honored to be an early bloomer. The bra tingled a bit, but it fit just right and already provided a sense of support. I looked to the clerk and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you get a few more bras this size? With some designs on them, really cute stuff, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, all right! Nice to see you're excited,\" the clerk said and walked back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was gone, I posed in the mirror and looked at the pink bra. I stood tall at various angles, jutting my chest out and giggling to myself. This felt better than I ever expected to be, both because my body naturally welcomed the extra support and because wearing a bra for the first time, and knowing just a day ago I'd been a guy with no need to wear such clothing, held a taboo, almost erotic appeal to it. Not many other guys, I'm sure, ever had a store clerk measure them for what bra to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk eventually came back with a pile of bras for me to try before leaving me to my own devices. I worked out how to put each of them on from having seen the clerk work the straps, and soon I got to posing again, seeing how I looked in a cheetah bra, a Hello Kitty bra, a polka-dotted bra, and so on. Eventually, Jessica and Amanda had to walk in and force me to pick a few to buy out of the whole lot. I think I bought about four or five bras total.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're already learning the importance of a bra, I see,\" Amanda said with a smirk. \"That's my girl! Soon we'll be shopping for even more stuff, I'm sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked away to hide my smile from her. Despite the fun I had bra shopping, my mind still fought against this sudden change. For goodness sake, just a day ago I had been a guy, with my own group of friends, hobbies, and expectations. One more week and I'd have been in my senior year of high school. Now I'm back in middle school and the opposite gender. That means making new friends and forgetting about my old ones, forgetting about my girlfriend Mary, and adjusting to being called Rachel. Sure, life as a middle school girl held some exotic charm, but knowing all that I'd lose...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to do now, sport?\" Jessica said with a nudge, interrupting my thought process.</span></div></div>",

I peek inside the bag sitting on my lap and flip through all the bras I had gotten. So many different colors and patterns, all so cute and pretty. Why do I have to wear all these again? And why did I like that so much? Suddenly my head thought for me with an answer of 'Well that's easy, you have boobs.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it dawned on me that I'm going to have to wear all these....every day! There wasn't any escape, as I look down and see how much bigger and perkier they look now that they're held tight in the wires wrapped around my upper torso. My body seems to disappear past my chest, and they're only going to get bigger from here. Wait, and I know how guys work, they're never going to look at me normally now. They're not going to look at me, just my chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car pulls to a stop as we get home, my two sisters climbing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey squirt, get out.\" Jessica knocks on the window, as my face is completely red and buried in the bag I was holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want me to help you put all your cute new bras away?\" Amanda cheerfully asks.

This is all your fault!\" I growl at all the bras on the ground. I lean over and gently pick one up with two fingers, a bit ashamed. God, what am I doing?

God, why can't this all be a dream? Why can't I wake up from the strange and confusing to find my old, male life waiting for me? I wouldn't have to worry about how a girl acts.

I could be your older brother Jason, and have a penis, and wear boxers, but I won't because, as much as I like acting like a guy, <i>being</i> a guy would suck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think being a girl is any better for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't, but that's only because it's been less than a day. After a week, you'll forget how weird your boobs feel. You'll wake up in the morning and look in the mirror and forget what it's like to see a guy's face there. You'll sign your name as 'Rachel' on school papers without even thinking, and by the end of the month you'll think of yourself as a full-fledged girl. All Amanda and I want is to give you a new, exciting life. You'll love being a girl, trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" I say, and turn away.

My sisters spoke to the clerk and bought a variety of bras in different colors and patterns. I objected of course, but my sisters would have none of it. They bought them all and we headed home. The rest of the day was my sisters making me try on all the clothes the new me owned. Tight jeans, short skirts, flowing dresses, I apparently had it all. Finally the day was through, my sisters set me free and I snapped the bra off and put on some pajamas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning I was to start school in seventh grade despite the fact I had already done it. I fought as much as I could but Amanda used whatever her magic was and I got dressed. My body chose a powder blue bra under a cute t-shirt and skirt combination. As my sisters explained, it was to look nice on the first day. I was treated like any other girl, which pissed me off. However, whenever I tried to speak my mind or explain myself, I felt it. For some reason breathing slightly heavier to talk made me feel it. It sat there on my chest holding me down. I'd try to speak my mind but then I'd feel it, and immediately become embarrassed and quiet down. I couldn't be myself because it was there, pinning me in a corner and reminding me of what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA month passed, and I finally felt normal enough to speak my mind. I was going to assert myself, take back some of my personality and thoughts. But by that time, I had become known as the meek and shy girl in school. To them I was cute, I was shy, pretty even. Everyone was being so kind and sensitive to me I backed off, feeling ungrateful. The next day my bra felt tight, and I noticed my chest had grown. Back to the mall, another size up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been almost six years since then now. Both Amanda and Jessica are out on their own, and I'm a senior in high school...again. The alarm buzzes as I slam it with my hand. I groan and sit up in bed, feeling the massive weights of those things there on my chest. I climb out of bed and go through the routine I forced myself to become used to. After a long shower and hair straightening, I went to get dressed. I went to my dresser and into the underwear drawer. Of course, there they were. Colorful ones, frilly ones, sports ones, strapless ones. Why did I own so many of these again? I pulled a soft pink plain one. I always felt the need to have one like this around. I slung my arms through, pulled it up, and clasped it in the back. The \"other\" twins lifted and separated, as I tugged and adjusted the shoulder straps. I looked down, unable to see past my chest. Sorry girls, I can't let you out. It's just the way. Things had gotten weird so fast I didn't notice them all at once. Then I noticed the time and had to hurry to get to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, I'm a D by the way....just barely. </span></div></div>",

That means you'd like to shop for a whole new wardrobe right?\" Jessica laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no way!\" I squeal. I was in NO mood to be going along with a shopping spree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, too bad because we're doing that anyway. Besides. We have your dress and your in panties and a bra.\" Jessica giggled holding the dress I was wearing before. \"Oh, and just to be safe.\" she trails off, whispering in Amanda's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I have to?\" Amanda sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Jessica answered quickly. Amanda just shook her head and snapped. Another painful jolt ran through me, but not as bad as the previous jolts from before. Where they getting weaker as I got used to them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what'd you do?\" I ask, looking around and not seeing any particular changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just try and leave this booth Rachel.\" Jessica invited. She held open the door, and offered me to leave. Despite being in nothing but underwear, I attempted to leave the booth. I took one step out when it happened. My legs slammed together from something I wasn't expecting. Between my legs I felt something...something hard. Nothing was there but I felt it. I blushed with extreme embarrassment. I took another step and out of nowhere it pounded upwards and I collapsed in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah....ow!\" I moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's what being a girl is all about.\" Jessica smiled, seemingly proud of her idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so cruel Jessica, she's not old enough to experience that yet.\" Amanda tried to reason with her twin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she's gonna find out eventually, and this'll keep her here to try on clothes by her own choice. Otherwise she'll be rechristened as a woman every step she tries to take.\" Jessica begins to laugh slightly. I crawl back into the booth, breathing heavily and a little dazed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry sis, our sister is a bit twisted.\" Amanda helped me up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's get her some stuff.\" Jessica offered and Amanda followed. I woozily stood in front of the mirror. Looking back was a young girl in her underwear seemingly trapped in the store. My legs were sore enough to barely stand after one step, but I had to do something </span></div></div>",

I didn't even really know what it was, but it was bad, and I had a feeling that to try to rebel anymore would result in something a lot worse, assuming that was even possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of wearing girls clothes, and well <i>being a girl</i> was bad, but it was something that I could realisticly deal with. Super natural powers or not, if I played my cards right, I could even be out of this damn mess! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I tried something that was never attempted by a man. Tears welled up in my eyes, as I looked over at Amanda, the sister who could stop this, pleadingly. I made sure the pain was present in my eyes, and that my legs, nay, my whole body was trembling. My right hand grabbed my right shoulder as I mouthed a simple message with ragged breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Help.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda looked conflicted.

Looking at the two of them, they didn't seem to see any physical changes with me, as I looked at myself some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, mental changes probably aren't noticeable.

As I searched my memory further, the only things that came up were previous memories of a girl's life. However, no sense of dread came up, as it seemed to feel normal. I knew I was an 18 year old guy, but my memories didn't say as much. \"Ugh, I have a headache.\" I moaned, holding my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ok sweetie?\" Amanda asked, coming up to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah I...\" I started.

I wondered why I wasn't panicking an more, why I didn't find the thought of them dressing me up in girl's clothing repulsive, but wasn't that obvious? I had memories of being a girl all my life. I knew what it was like to wear a bra, wear panties, and wear dresses. Maybe there'd be a little discomfort at first, since my body's not used to it, but my brain is. It began to dawn on me how scary a thought that actually was. In the span of one finger snap, I forgot my life as a boy. I couldn't even remember what my male name was...John? Rick? Danny? Anything could have fit, really, but Rachel...I knew full well that was my current name, and the name I had owned all my life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I wasn't saddened by that thought because it seemed normal, even though a part of me, the part that still remembered being a guy in his senior year of high school, insisted something was wrong. I cupped my hand to my head again and muttered, \"Oh jeez...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, pumpkin?\" Amanda said as she carried over a pair of jeans and a red blouse. Jessica followed closely behind with the undergarments - a training bra decorated with stars and a similarly designed pair of panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" I said. \"Just...nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better toughen up,\" Jessica said, \"because in just half an hour you're starting your first day of seventh grade!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI groaned. \"Seventh grade? If it's anything like sixth grade, then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact I remembered sixth grade clearly, like it happened a few months ago...which, in my mind, it did...caused my mind to hurt even more. Jessica and Amanda put the clothes on the ground and walked outside for me to change. I did as expected, largely because it's what my mind expected of me too. God, it's hard to balance two minds in one head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica and Amanda stepped back in when I was done and looked me over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She doesn't look too happy,\" Jessica commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I be?\" I said. \"This is what I wear every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your memories are getting in the way of enjoyment, hm?\" Amanda said. \"That's a bore. Maybe you shouldn't have done the memory changes so early, Jessica.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could leave her as she is,\" Jessica said. \"After a while, her female memories will overpower what male identity she still has.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, we might as well have fun with her while she thinks and remembers things like a guy. Once her period starts, she'll have no choice but to think like a girl, you know? It's only a matter of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins got together and whispered in each others ear, consulting over a matter I had little control of.</span></div></div>",

I haven't even had my first kiss with a boy yet...\" I murmur. This is wrong, I shouldn't be thinking about being a mom or having a boyfriend.

But what I heard myself, or whoever talking in my head worries me. I have to make sure what she said doesn't come true. With surprising determination, I stand up, put my underwear and jeans on. All I can say is that vanished quickly. Between the tight jeans and the horrible pain my body had I didn't feel up to taking a few steps let alone one. I force myself to gently tiptoe over to my desk. Thankfully my sisters had not gotten rid of my computer, well at least the fact I still had one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhirring it on, I was greeted with a background of Hello Kitty. I groaned and went straight online. I would have to clean out all the folders and settings later. I immediately turn on Google image search and put in some hot models. I was relieved to find that I still found them attractive. Indeed, all these gorgeous women in these outfits looked good alright. I was flipping through some pages with them on without too much effect when it slid into pictures of male models. I stopped at the very first picture. Some very fit teen boy with spiky black hair and no shirt stared back at me. Who was this guy? Why hadn't I heard of him? I pondered as I slid through picture after picture of this boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy face flushed, and my chest became tight. W-what's going on!? I was so confused. Part of me knew what I was doing, the other part didn't care. I breathed heavily, intently looking through all the pictures of whomever this hot guy was. A minute passed, and then another. My body began to shake slightly, and my eyes wouldn't leave the screen. Then I felt something different between my legs. No, it wasn't the period. Well yes, my stomach still hurt like a bitch but it wasn't that. It pushed slightly and instinctively I gasped lightly with what could only be described as some strange pleasure. My hand held onto the mouse as I reached to wipe away some beads of sweat on my forehead. But then something tugged my jeans out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Huh?' I thought. 'What's tugging on my jeans, and why can't I move my left hand?' I looked down and saw something I wish I hadn't. As one might expect, my other hand was digging in my jeans. When the hell did I do that? Nervously I ordered my left hand to twitch a finger slightly. I made a soft \"Eep!\" when I felt a poke between my legs...in a spot I really had enough feeling out of today. Scared out of my wits, I pulled my hand out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'W-what's wrong with me!?' I yell silently in my head. I turn my attention to my PC where pictures of that...that guy! That... gorgeous, handsome...cute... I begin to stare at him again with affectionate eyes. I become disillusioned with the world around me, my breathing slows again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...\" I moan slightly. I feel a strong and forceful press against my chest, rubbing slightly. I look down and see my left hand cupping my small breast on it's own. I snap out of it instantly again and slap my left hand away with my right. Then I look at my body with a sense of sheer terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N...no way! T-t-t-t-there's no way I can.... I can like boys!\" I stammer. </span></div></div>",

Humans are animals that give into feeling as well, and this new sensation is slowly blocking out my senses. I unbuckle my jeans and throw off my red blouse. I continue to stare at this male model on the screen, tantalizing me with his blue eyed stare. Embarrassed, I turn away, but my eye peeks and I'm sucked in again. A series of resistance and submission highs flow through me. For a while I massage either my girlhood or my breasts, then desperately try to resist and turn away. Just as I'm about to look at something else or try to amuse myself with anything but this, I get sucked in again. Time passes slowly, and then it happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I want this.' I think, and then I realize I'm caught. I stand up off my chair, swivel it away and turn towards my bed. Unzipping my jeans I kick them off towards where the blouse lays on the ground. I stand frozen in front of the pink sheeted bed in front of me, shaking slightly but completely unable to turn away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm just doing this once... To see what it's like. That's all.\" I try to convince myself. It's just a delusion though, and I pull back the sheets and climb in. I lay flat on my back, my longer hair laying about the pillow. My legs hurt, they really do. I squish my eyes shut. I can only imagine how a young girl in her underwear flat on her back in bed looks, but it couldn't be pretty... at least from my perspective. I desperately try not to think about boys, anything about them is turning me on for some reason. I don't know how long or how short I fought, but something got the better of me. I grit my teeth and quickly put my hand in the panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm not sure how long I was. Probably a while, as I'd never done it as a girl before. I lay on my back, slightly teary eyed. My breathing could be more easily described as panting, my face is warm and probably beat red right now. My legs are spread and my knees are up. I think I thrusted slightly while I did it. I can't remember how it went. My hand just went inside and every second was unexpected bliss. My hand was still inside...and it was wet. It was kind of a sticky wet... my hand was strangely sensitive to the inner workings of my....erm....lower half. Gently, I pull it out, and let out a slight gasp in the process. My legs flop into a flat position and I finally get to relax a bit. With the hand I didn't just do myself with, I lightly rub the insides of my thighs. Between the period and what I just did to myself, I was understandably sore. I look down and see a smooth thin body in a bra and panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with me?\" I groan. I feel unusually tired, and drift off into an unexpected sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You know I hate her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Amanda said, just a little bitterly. \"That's a real shame too. If you just gave her a chance instead of judging her right away, you'd find out she's amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact...\" Jessica, who was just about to open the closet and rummage through my clothes, turned around and smiled. \"Why don't we give you the chance to appreciate Miley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh no...</i> I thought. I knew where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please no...\" I begged, but Jessica didn't listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more of that classic rock and metal you call 'music,'\" she said, and snapped her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI held onto my forehead while the pain welled and then faded away, leaving me exhausted by all the throbbing and hurting I'd felt that morning. Amanda ran over to the radio sitting on my desk--decorated with Hello Kitty, of course--and flipped it on. As fate would have it, the first thing we heard was \"Party in the USA,\" and the guitar riff that instantly made me squeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, I love this song!\" I yelled, and started dancing to the beat. Jessica and Amanda were practically on the floor laughing at me as I rocked back and forth and lip-synched to Miley Cyrus. Finally, Amanda managed to stifle her giggles long enough to change the radio station to what had once been my favorite station, with The Rolling Stones and Aerosmith and all the classics, but hearing Queen's \"Killer Queen\" now, I grimaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eww, what is this shit? Change it back to Miley!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, ah, ah, watch your mouth, Rachel!\" Amanda said sternly. She flicked the radio off. \"If you want Miley, you're going to stick away from the profanity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\" I murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" Jessica said, whipping the closet open. \"Now it's time to get ready for your first day in the seventh grade!\"</span></div></div>",

I could feel my training bra wrapped around my top, but I was in the dress I asked for. It was black, sort of thick but fairly short. But instead of normal panties I had a solid pair of white tights.

There's that initial burst of pain, of course, but it grows weaker and weaker each time she changes me. More importantly, all the thoughts and memories of me being a girl disappear. I can remember my old life and name, Ryan. I hate Miley Cyrus like I always have, and Queen does <i>not</i> disgust me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that knowledge comes at a cost. Whereas I felt comfortable, even a little sultry in my dress with a female mind, it feels completely unnatural to a guy who's never even considered what a dress would feel like. It clings to my hips weirdly, which themselves feel odd with their unnatural wideness. The lipstick tickles my mouth, and I move my hand to wipe it away before Amanda tells me, \"Ah! Ah! Ah! Do that and we're changing your mind back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think I'm not going to make other mental changes,\" Jessica says. \"But I want him to know he's a guy through it all. It's a lot more fun, that way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI brace myself for another transformation, but the living room clock strikes seven and Jessica turns to look at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that'll have to wait. If we don't hurry up you'll be late for school!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Jessica! I mean...Amanda, please, both of you know I love you! Turn me back, I'm begging you, I'm a guy and I like my male life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is what I missed,\" Jessica says to Amanda. \"The resistance and begging. Rachel's not the same without a little feistiness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Amanda says with a shrug. \"I thought she was cute without it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda doesn't argue the point, though, and I give up fighting myself. My sisters have made it clear that they've chosen my life and will never change me back if they can help it. Deep down, I hold onto the hope that some time soon--maybe not today, but perhaps this week, next week, within the month--they'll tire of their new younger sister and turn me back. As we get into Amanda's car and she drives me to middle school, I assure myself there's no way they can enjoy me being female for longer than a month. They'll realize that they miss their brother by then...right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a five or so minute drive, we arrive at Taft-Hardy Middle School, where buses and other cars are dropping off children too. I remember going to T.H., more than four years ago, and here I am reliving those days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a good day at school, sweetie!\" Amanda says with a wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, uncertainly, I begin to get out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more thing,\" Jessica says, and I turn around. I know what's coming...</span></div></div>",

Nothing about my mind seems different. I think like a guy, remember being a guy...is it another subtle change? But what? I can't figure it out, and seeing as standing around won't provide me any answers or solace, I decide to head inside and get middle school over with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some meandering about and asking other students, I figure out where my classroom is. I avoid asking the teachers just because of their new-found height. It's been ages since adults have towered over me so triumphantly, and being in a girl makes the feeling worse for some reason I can't put into words. Nevertheless, I get to class a few seconds before the bell and our teacher, Ms. Donovan, tells us about the school curriculum and what's expected of as seventh graders. None of it matters too much to me. Now that I remember high school, the seventh grade should be a cinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt should be, but then I hear a whisper next to me and things go downhill from there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psst, Rachel!\" a redhead girl says to me. \"Beautiful dress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" I say with a blush. The dress still feels weird, but I'm nevertheless strangely proud of it. I add without much thought, \"you're looking cute too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you,\" she says and giggles. I giggle in return. What's with the ditzy laughter? Why are my words so...so...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel and Tammi, are we going to have to separate you already?\" Ms. Donovan snaps. We turn to attention, both smiling, both stifling giggles. Inside, I'm crying. So this is what Jessica did to me...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter homeroom I find out the change's extents. When I'm with other girls I talk like I'm one of them: gossiping, laughing, feeling dirty when I talk about boys and their private business. Tammi and I sit at lunch and make fun of some of the less-attractive girls sitting around us, and I feel bad doing something so outwardly cruel but it's a part of me. Half my mind rebels while the other does as it pleases. I know what Jessica meant when she wanted to keep me a guy even while she changed me. With two conflicting thoughts at any time in my head, she can torture me every second of every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tammi and I talk, laugh, and, after lunch, hug each other, I don't want to take this anymore. Amanda and Jessica put me in a painful situation and I won't stand for it. Telling Tammi I have to go to the bathroom, I go wash my hands, all while resolving to leave school and head back home.</span></div></div>",

Thankfully I live pretty close to the school, and after some heavy running, I make it to our front door.

I recount my actions through the day. While I talked and acted like a girl, and I most certainly didn't want to, I realized I didn't feel the forceful nature of some of the other spells Amanda and Jessica used on me. Unlike those two dragging me around, it felt natural that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed at this new problem, I pace around trying to figure out a way to solve this. I figure the best way to solve this problem is to experience it some more. I find my cell phone in my bag and flip through the contacts. Tammi's phone number was in there, as I had hoped. I hit the dial button and let it ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Rachel, what's up?\" Tammi's voice speaks through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Tammi.\" I speak nonchalantly. \"I need help with something.\" I say sweetly. It didn't seem odd so far, despite not me being in complete control of this conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What what?\" Tammi asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to think of a way for Kevin to notice me.\" I begin. We then spend the next hour continuing our talk from the end of school. We plan out all sorts of ways to attract Kevin's attention. While I had no interest in Kevin personally, I found the conversation surprisingly endearing. I became oddly engaged, speaking my own ideas rather than just the girl voice doing all the talking. After Tammi made a silly joke, we giggled and had to leave. I clicked the off the phone and apparently had control back.</span></div></div>",

Tammi mentioned something about her mom taking her to a Broadway show she didn't care for and disappeared into the crowd, and Kevin was nowhere in sight. Thank God! I thought, though those vague, dreamy fantasies about Kevin, chaste and sappy and completely spell-binding, still tried to distract me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut another girl, who my feminized mind recognized as Merissa, destroyed that train of thought. \"Don't forget volleyball practice in five,\" she told as she walked past. I thanked her and, no longer motivated to run away, I followed. The least I could do was delay my return into the clutches of Jessica and Amanda, so suddenly hell-bent on controlling my life with a strange magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe walked into the gym where a teacher I didn't remember as a boy or girl told us to get changed, we'd be practicing right away. <i>Oh no...</i> I thought. Not only would I have to undress surrounded by other half-naked girls, but I was walking into the epicenter of adolescent girl drama and gossip. Once inside the locker room, I had no doubt my self-control would vanish as I talked with some girls about who Johnny was going out with or some stupid shit like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I was right. Hesitantly, wanting to run away but not having the willpower to act on it, I followed the other girls of the volleyball team into the locker room and immediately heard shouts \"Oh my God!\" and \"She did what!?\" They were stupid conversations, I knew, but what I knew didn't sync up with what I wanted to do. As I pulled off my dress and took a uniform from the locker room supervisor, I joined in a discussion about French kissing vs. regular kissing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just sounds so icky,\" Merissa was saying. \"I mean, getting your tongues all in there and dripping and it's just...eesh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged, slipping on the insanely tight volleyball shorts. \"I don't know. I'd be willing to give it a try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With Kevin?\" a chorus of high-pitched voices rang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-W-Well...\" I stammered. \"With whoever I go out with, but not right away, like...in a few years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right,\" someone said that I couldn't pick out in the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe supervisor interrupted our giggling and told us to head into the gym right away. I quickly put on my red-and-black sports tee and walked with the other girls outside, surprised to see the volleyball nets had been set up in the time we were changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get into formation, girls!\" the teacher yelled. \"My name is Ms. Donaldson, and I'm filling in for Mrs. Murrick. We're going to play things like we did last year.\"</span></div></div>",

It was yellow with white fringes just poking out from underneath. The dress was yellow with a plaid pattern on it. It had a sewn on apron pattern on the dress part. Once it hit my waist, the dress became skin tight. It was wrapped up the front, crunching my stomach and tightly pulling down the straps on my shoulders.

Amanda grabs my hand and practically throws me into a dressing room. She shuts the door and tells me to stay there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI oblige, not wanting to go back out there again with all those people. I see myself in the mirror, and become fixated on what I had become. I lift the skirt and see my tight underwear, and ponder how girls can wear these all the time. This dress is tight and uncomfortable, not to mention revealing. I hated this, but it was about to get worse. A knock came at the door and Amanda came in when I opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's your new outfit, put it on.\" Amanda ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no way!\" I try to back up, but I'm pinned in the dressing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda sits me down and takes out all of the clothes. A thong, shrunken down to my size, a pair of steep high heels in purple, and a skimpy dress also in purple. It had spaghetti straps for the shoulders, started around the chest but stopped immediately after the waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please Amanda.\" I beg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted to be a grown up girl, now you can.\" Amanda sighs. She snaps her fingers and I freeze. She undresses me and lets my hair down. She hands me the thin black thong and I immediately step into it, and pull it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god I'm wearing a thong. I-it hurts my butt.\" I tear up as the fabric rides in my but t crack and tightly clings to the little amount of body it did cover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl up Rachel.\" Amanda says. She hands me the dress and I pull it up. It barely went past my butt, and hugged what little curvature this body could have. It was practically skin tight! I tug it down nervously but it just does go past where my legs become my body and the thong resides. I'm forced into the heels before I'm given control back completely. I wobble without much balance and my ankles begin to hurt right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I already paid, let's go.\" Amanda orders me. I take a small step and almost fall over. The dress goes up my leg as I did so, and I almost flashed my panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-h-how am I supposed to walk?\" I softly ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your legs together, sway, and hope no one sees anything.\" Amanda states rather coldly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI follow her, once again catching the looks of everyone I pass. I can't walk the way she talks about. I try to keep my legs together, but then the thong rides further and I can't walk at all. I try to sway but with the heels I almost fall over. I'm sure everyone has seen my butt at this point. We get back to the escalator at the front of the mall, prepared to head home. We ride down and the same boys are there. I notice them and they're staring up at me, blushing a complete red. I pull the dress down as far as I can and turn even redder. It's official, I'm a bunch of boys' eye candy.</span></div></div>",

The only thing on my mind was a thin piece of fabric was riding my butt, and that it was difficult to walk in a dress. Along the way I notice I'm getting a lot of stares, especially from the boys in the halls. Luckily, Tammi's locker was next to mine, so I didn't get lost. I managed to wedge the thing open remembering a trick from high school, of course I didn't know the combination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...Hi Rachel, nice day today?\" a voice came from behind me. I jump, startled and see a freckled boy with dirty brown hair. Some of the boys standing around were watching with eager eyes, for some reason anticipating my reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh....hi?\" I answer. I didn't know any of these kids, was I supposed to know him? Suddenly, as if a floodgate opened a few of the other boys approached me as well. Their eyes followed me up and down as they began to rapid fire questions about class and the day in general. The amount of people surrounding me became claustrophobic, and I began to feel incredibly nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of the way chumps.\" another, taller boy came through. He easily overshadowed the other thirteen year olds in the hall. He had spiky black hair, and was lean and fit compared to everyone else. Effortlessly he nudged the boys aside as they withdrew upon his arrival. \"Rachel's mine, remember?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Kevin. We know.\" Tammi sighed. \"After all, she's the only girl good enough for you.\" she murmured, but I still managed to catch what she said, a tinge of sadness in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's go Rach.\" Kevin said. He wrapped his arm around my shoulders and lead me along the halls. I wanted to run, I wanted to hide, hell do anything to get out, but Kevin's arm seemed so strong compared to my soft, thin frame. He lead me outside at the end of the hall where no one else was. He began to shoot the breeze as I dodged questions as best I could. Mercifully the early bell rang, the notice that students should get to homeroom. Kevin then did something I was completely unprepared for. He tucked my chin up with his hand, and kissed me on the lips for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya at lunch Rach.\" he smiled and headed off inside. I froze in place, my thoughts spinning and running a million miles an hour. What the hell just happened? Was this normal? Was I just roped into this? And...and...my body is feeling weird. My legs are all weak and wobbly, as I can tell a blush is burning on my face. My mouth has suddenly run dry. Wait...w-what's going on with my chest!? It feels really odd and my heartbeat is going too fast to be normal.</span></div></div>",

My body is hot and that little part between my legs won't settle down. The fact that I'm a girl right now won't leave my head, along with thoughts of Kevin. I squirm in my desk as first period starts. I'm sure I'm attracting some attention but I can't resist. My body won't do as it's told, and it's affecting my mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He's so cute.' I think. 'And I'm his girl. No girl belongs to Kevin but me.' I smile slightly. Blushing and embarrassed, I look down at my yellow dress and feel lost and confused. I shouldn't feel this way but I can't help myself. I see Kevin as something cute, desirable, and someone I wanted to be with. But I'm a guy damn it! There's no way I can be in l-l-l-love with a boy, especially one that's younger than me! My body won't let me think otherwise though. The first bell rang and startled me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ok Rachel?\" Tammi asks me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...yeah. I'm fine.\" I reply, not really thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never seen you so....weird before. Did something happen with Kevin?\" she asks concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-n-no!\" I say rather loudly. Thankfully our teacher for second period comes in and class starts. I avoid questions between classes as I try to pay attention. Sure I know this material already, but I'd rather pay attention to this than Kevin. The fourth bell rings and it's time for lunch. We shuffle out of the classroom and I follow Tammi, hoping to get something to eat and take my mind of classes. Then I see him, Kevin, coming right towards me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey cutie.\" He says, taking me away from Tammi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... I was kind of hungry, so I was...er...\" I try to get out of. But before I can object his arm is around my waist ans he's carrying me off somewhere. We find ourselves back outside where we were earlier. I blush deeply as I don't know what to do. I lean against the wall and he stands in front of me. He wraps his arm around me again...and...</span></div></div>",

Too bad it didn't matter anymore, and wouldn't matter for another three years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda snapped her finger and both she and Jessica went from their pajamas to bikinis similar to mine.

Whenever I fantasized about finally nabbing a date to take to senior prom, this was the sort of get-up I imagined: a slit along one leg, with the dress's skirt reaching strategically around the lower body, tapering out in the girl's wake; white lace would weave around the top of the dress, not low-cut, but still emphasizing the feminine curves of what would no doubt be a lovely, gorgeous girl; the dress would sparkle some, shine some, while golden high heels granted my date a gossamer gait and the red flower held back the loose curls of her hair we could dance barefoot to the faster pop and hip-hop songs, jerking our bodies without a care in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://site.flowergirlus.com/prom/promdress_nx1076_l.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://site.flowergirlus.com/prom/promdr...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, wearing that very outfit, I discovered just how much effort girls had to exert hobbling around in high heels, how prone they were to tripping on the bottom ends of their dress, what a heavy smattering of makeup--even more than previously applied--felt like, with even more lipstick than I thought necessary for even supermodels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, posing in a prom dress required less scandalous, cleavage-bearing positions and more elegant, stoic stares over one's shoulder. This suited me just fine, as it allowed my body a moment's recuperation after the soreness of wiggling around in pieces of string and nylon, and helped the photo shoot pass faster than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a natural born beauty,\" Amanda said in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed, more out of embarrassment than appreciation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's why,\" Jessica began, with jazz hands and a flourish, \"in just a few minutes, you're about to experience the high point of your teenage girl life!\"</span></div></div>",

Desparately, I looked over at Amanda to se if Jessica is just messing with me, but it seems that Amanda likes the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have eight hours before the prom starts\" Jessica smirked. I looked at her in surprise. \"Huh? You said it was in a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel\" Amanda scolds. \"A part of the experience is to get ready for it. We was going to give you the full makeover experience, but I think we better work some more to make certain you're the prom queen...\" She looked over at Jessica as if she wanted her opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do this.

I'm still wearing two pieces of clothing, covering only my groin and chest, but once the shock fades away the changes become more apparent. The material is different - no longer the smooth feel of nylon, but the softer, warmer touch of cotton. The top, what I recognize as a basic bra, has more hooks, hoops, and less aesthetic elements on it than the bikini top, and it's an undecorated blue. The new bottom, however - your basic panties - is purple and covered in hearts. Despite my best efforts and movements, the bottom rides up my butt like the panties I wore when I woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond that, it feels much like the bikini - the more noticeable changes are the gender neutral ones, like the violet arms-length gloves and green, winter cap holding down my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5nOZpPcENvs/SmhRWa-8O2I/AAAAAAAAAf8/GPlVr2LV7gI/s400/V290114_S02.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5nOZpPcENvs/Sm...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I look over to Jessica and Amanda, I see they're clad in outfits representing the other seasons: Amanda has a straw hat and garden gloves, while Jessica wears a baseball cap and autumn-colored leaf earrings. They, too, wear lingerie now instead of bikinis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is this any better?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good training,\" Amanda says. \"Remember you'll be wearing this every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless you want the boys to see your nipples poking out against your shirt,\" Jessica adds, rather bluntly. I blush at the thought, though that doesn't stop the fabrics from digging in and leaving sore, red imprints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" I say. The sooner we finish this, I think, the better, and I strike the appropriate poses as the photo shoot continues.</span></div></div>",

I had a feeling she'd say that even if I looked like a natural, but there's no point to protest or try again. Jessica snapped her fingers at me and the pain hit even harder than before. I collapsed onto the ground, biting my lips and trying not to scream. Screaming would only make it worse, so I held my head against the ground and nearly drew blood from my lip when the pain left...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to try again?\" Jessica said, holding her hand to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...?\" I looked up. My mind felt hazy, like a constant blur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to take a picture of you in that cute bikini,\" she said, and I smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet! This is probably, like, my favorite bikini, I always wear it around my boyfriend 'cause he, y'know, digs it a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Amanda said to Jessica. \"Are you trying to mock me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I'd make her girly and I did,\" Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, being girly doesn't make you a ditzy, valley girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, it's only for the photo shoot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched the argument between my sisters, which went too fast for me to follow. \"So are we gonna take pictures or...what??\" I asked. Amanda and Jessica turned to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes we are,\" Jessica said, and we got into position. This time when I struck a pose I felt no hesitation or discomfort. When I grabbed my boobs, I <i>really</i> grabbed them, and I puckered my lips with the benefit of knowing now a bunch of times in which I did kiss a guy. I bent over, I waited for the camera to flash, and Jessica traded places with Amanda. She was a little uncomfortable at first around me, but after a few pictures she opened up to my ditzy self, and we were laughing with each other as Jessica put the camera away and changed the three of us back into our pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This sucks!\" I said, looking myself over. \"Let's take a few more pictures, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Jessica said, \"but we've got other plans on the agenda. First I'll have to change your mind back...\"</span></div></div>",

My boyfriend will dig this shit,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got more than enough,\" Jessica said. \"How many more poses do you think a valley girl can come up wi...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's words trailed off as she put her fingers to her chin and considered a new option in her head. A devious smile spread across her face, and she paced back and forth. Both Amanda and I watched her closely, wondering what she had in mind. Amanda probably had a few ideas, being her twin, while I barely had enough cognitive strength to consider anything beyond the material world and body I inhabited. I could only hope it involved a new swimsuit, even more revealing than the one I currently wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless,\" Jessica finally continued, \"we make another quick personality change and see how that changes her posture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of that sentence made sense to me, but Amanda broke out into a smile. \"Ooh, of course! That's so brilliant, Jessica! What were you thinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Jessica had already snapped her fingers. My head throbbed, and I opened my head to say, \"Gawd!\" or something equally brainless when my intelligence returned. I once again had a grasp of all the high school subjects I excelled at - math, social studies, science - and more! Suddenly, I understood Spanish, loved creative writing, and knew how to play volleyball like a pro. All this knowledge, however, came with an acute awareness of how Amanda and Jessica were judging me. It wasn't the embarrassment of a boy who's found himself in the body of a girl, half-naked and exposed like never before. I knew what it was like to be a girl, have boobs, a vagina, etc., but a strong sense of modesty and an overriding shyness controlled my behavior. I couldn't help but blush and turn away slightly from my sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" I said. \"Do you have to be here while I'm in this...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, sis,\" Jessica said. \"We just want a few pics with you smiling, and then you can get dressed as you usually do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>As you usually do,</i> I understood, meant a sweater, pair of jeans, and a sports bra, all for the sake of hiding my curves, and I wanted that badly. Still, I fretted. <i>Why do they have to see me like this?</i> I wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you put these online?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Jessica said, but the way Amanda glared at her meant that, yes, they'd be online, probably somewhere I'd see them eventually. <i>Oh no,</i> I thought. <i>Not on my Facebook!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not wanting to be in this bikini too much longer, I nodded quickly and Jessica took the camera first. Amanda stepped beside me and whispered, \"It'll be all right, sis!\" She patted me on the shoulder and I mustered a smile. I held my hands together awkwardly and blushed. It was a struggle to keep from touching my hair, face, or body in a display of discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready...\" Jessica said. \"Smile!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Whether through sheer will power or the inability to do anything in my fright, I went through the rest of the photo shoot, turning away, blushing, and otherwise looking extremely uncomfortable for the camera. That pleased Jessica and Amanda sure enough, who thought my poses were \"cute\" and \"modest.\" After about fifteen or twenty more photos, all of which were transferred onto the computer, Amanda and Jessica nodded to each other and looked at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a successful, productive morning!\" Jessica exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine,\" I muttered. \"Can I get dressed now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, sis!\" Amanda said, and snapped her fingers. A cold rush flew up and down my body before figure-hugging jeans, a push-up bra, and a cleavage-bearing camisole replaced the bikini. They made sure the curves visible while half-naked still appeared when I was fully-dressed. This was far from my usual outfit, but with what I just went through, it was enough of an improvement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, then,\" I said. \"I'll just go to my room and, um...leave you two be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast!\" Jessica said, and Amanda snapped in fingers. My feet froze in place. \"Now that we've shown our friends what a pretty sister we created, they'll want to meet you in person, see how well you behave and act. Some of these girls will be your fellow high schoolers come next week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?\" I said, not understanding this talk of being \"created\" and meeting her friends, who I'd seen countless times before. Then Jessica snapped her fingers and my memories of being a meek girl vanished. After what had seemed an eternity of thinking feminine thoughts, I slowly came to my senses and reunited with my male identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also reunited with the understandable sensation that this body was not my own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just...what did I just do?\" I asked, running the fragmented memories of the photo shoot through my head. \"Did I really just--?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time to worry about that now, sis!\" Amanda said. \"We gotta start your behavior lessons!\"</span></div></div>",

Finally after a tortuous moment the pain began to dissipate. I sighed in relief to find my center of balance was off. My back seemed stiff as my arms lay slightly behind my body. I felt like I was falling backwards but instead of leaning forward I felt a force stopping me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl.\" Amanda delightfully clapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what did you...?\" I stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, your chest looks even bigger when you puff it out naturally.

When nothing went wrong, I tried another one. This time I was too hasty, and I was sent sprawling due to the shift in my gravity. As I hit the ground, my breasts sent shock waves of pain to my brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\" I screamed out loud, not caring how my audience was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk tsk tsk.\" Jessica tutted in disappointment. \"I thought that you would realize that sort of language is inappropiate for a young girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got up hesitaintly, unsure of what was going to happen. I tried to create some excuse for my behavior. In fact it was a rather good excuse, in fact I was quite proud of it! However when I tried to say it, something else came out instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry sis, I promise to be good.\" My quick movement of my hands to my mouth sent my breasts jiggling. I wanted to curse and scream at them, however that would not be the best idea at the moment. Amanda decided to speak in my absence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets try walking again! This time try to move with your hips.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried again, this time taking small steps. My hips swayed sexily, and I knew that if I did this in public every boy's eyes would be on my ass. That thought brought a blush to my face, and with it a flood of other thoughts that truly confused me. Then it hit me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm a girl.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat simple realization made me want to  over and die. Did I say die? I meant cry, though the other option didn't sound to bad at the moment. However I was currently incapable of slouching over, and just crying would just make me seem weak and the calming effect would be lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica clapped her hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job!\" She turned to her twin and asked, \"Now what?\"</span></div></div>",

An incredibly hard, wired pink corset clamped down on all sides. The cups worked as an unbearably stiff bra, as the hard bony structure went from my upper back to my hips. The strings pulled with an incredible force, crunching my body smaller. I let out a yelp of pain as the buckles fastened and held tight. My back got forced into place as I gasped for air initially. I managed to catch a wind despite my body unable to push outward at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! God that hurts!\" I cried. I desperately tried to find the fasteners on the back but I couldn't so much as bend over slightly to reach around. My whole upper half had to bend over which didn't help me reach around.

Jessica snaps her fingers and my head rings with pain and discomfort, like my thoughts have just been permanently scrambled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat turns out to be a pretty apt description. I close my eyes and shake my head, wondering what just happened, but when I open my eyes everything changes. I look down at my breasts, jutting out into my line of vision, their outlines visible through the thin fabric. A few seconds ago, it scared me to have those mounds sticking out of <i>my</i> body, of all places. Their random jiggling, combined with the extra sensitivity and sexual connotation, made me uncomfortable all over, but now...now those very same facts formed the reasons for why I suddenly loved my breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" I say, giving my chest a good squeeze. \"I never knew boobs felt like...it's nice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy attention veers towards my crotch, penis-less and previously another source of infinite discomfort.

I thought of guys at the beach and my body acted in a way I didn't expect. I became warm and tingly, as a blush came to my face. My legs came together and I couldn't help but keep my hands on my thighs. My chest became tight as they seemed to perk up some. I quickly became fascinated with this sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm?

We eventually made our way to the beach. It was already midday and it was crowded. I followed my sisters to a spot on the sand as they rested three towels on the ground. I was ordered to take off my cami and shorts, which I did. Standing in the sun with all these people in a bikini made me a bit nervous.

My breathing quickened, both from the reversal of my sexual orientation and from the ecstasy generated by feeling my softer, juicier, blemish-free skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda saw where my eyes went and went \"Oooh.\" My blush deepened and I turned away. \"Come on Rachel,\" she said. \"Don't be ashamed of your new feelings. That's part of being a girl. You like the blonde one, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy should I give her the time of day by telling the truth? She just wanted to see me squirm, I should seal my lips, be content with the pleasure derived from my body until I managed to convince the twins to change me back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut overwhelmed by conflicting, escalating passions, I nodded rapidly and wrapped the corner of my towel around my face, hiding it. Amanda laughed at what she imagined to be a cute sight and prodded my shoulder. \"Here, I'll help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on!\" Jessica, who had been silent while she soaked in the sun rays and further deepened her tan, sat up and lowered her sunglasses. There was that tell-all twinkle in her eye. \"We're not just gonna have Rachel mosey on up and ask the dude on a date, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Amanda asked. \"She likes him, she should ask him out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica shook her finger. \"No, no, no, no, no. You made her so hot she started off as a nervous wreck. I helped her appreciate her body, cleaning up your mess and setting her on the right course. I feel I should be the authority on boys here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis clearly did not bode well for me, and it warmed me to see Amanda feeling similarly. Her usually bright, open eyes tightened, and she took a step towards Jessica. \"What do you want to do?\" she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple,\" Jessica said coolly. \"She won't talk to him up front. That's stupid, Amanda. She has to flaunt her body while he's looking, bend it, grope it, stroke it, love it, and <i>appreciate</i> what she already admires. Then, when he comes over, he'll be really, <i>really</i> interested. She has to flaunt her best goods before she gets his best in return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteam practically shot from Amanda's nose, a horrifying sight for such a good natured, charming person. For the first time, I registered the tension between these disparate twins, whose lifestyles and personalities squared off against each other, even when magic and genetics seemed to hold them so close together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Amanda do?</span></div></div>",

He was also a member of the basketball team (we were teammates just a day ago), 6'3'', tan, a bit scrawny around the shoulders but a popular catch amongst the high school girls. He wore black swim trunks with white stripes down the side. His latest girlfriend, Gabriella, dangled from his arm and followed him into the water, wearing a green, strappy one-piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" I turned back, but Jessica had already noticed where my eyes had gone. \"Ooh!

All the more exciting a chase, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Jessica grabbed my arm and pulled me off the towel, onto my feet, and towards a boy I previously expressed no romantic interest in. Now, at the thought Josh might admire <i>my</i> body and desire to stroke every inch of it, the redness and cold sweat broke out once more. \"J-J-Jessica, please,\" I stammered, dragging my feet through the hand, resisting the growing lust. When that failed, I turned my head. \"A-Amanda! Help me!\"</span></div></div>",

I was only mildly listening as I tugged on my shoulder straps watching my body react accordingly. \"Hey, we gotta get you ready. C'mon.\" Jess pulled me up the stairs with Amanda close behind. For the entire day the two put me into different outfits deciding on what to wear and what to do. I didn't mind all the clothes, as I got to see and feel my new body in different ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never knew skirts were so...breezy.\" I mention, flipping up a frilly skirt I had on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better not act this way at the party.\" Jessica warned. After all options were exhausted, the two of them decided on a purple dress. The tight straps along my shoulders held the dress close to my chest. The fabric smoothed out around each bulge as my surprisingly tight bra perked them up. The fabric then went loose around my torso to sway as I walked. It then tightened around my butt and immediately stopped a quarter way down my thighs. It felt more like a mini-skirt attached to a loose top. I reached behind to pull out the thong riding my butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God would you stop.\" Jessica whined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't help it, thongs are uncomfortable... so why do I like it?\" I moaned, wiggling my butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think that's bad? Step into these.\" Amanda came over to me. She was carrying a pair of silver, toe-less high heels. I'd never worn heels before, and because of a certain someone's meddling, I was a bit excited to see how it felt. I stepped into the heels as Amanda buckled them. My butt perked outwards, not helping with the thong situation, as I had to hold my balance and stand straight. I took a few steps and found I couldn't go very far per step, and my body moved in strange ways, especially my legs. My feet being forced into a pointed position didn't feel good either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... this hurts already. They're cute and all but...\" I tried to lean down but couldn't reach the heels. My body kept stepping forward every time I tried. \"What the...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to sit down to try and get those off. Speaking of which.\" Amanda said, snapping her fingers. The buckles on the shoes disappeared and formed solid straps. \"They look good so you're gonna have to put up with it. Now let's finish it off.\" Amanda then went on to apply some light make-up. Skin tones, some lipstick, and other creams as it seemed to take forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eww I feel so gunky.\" I whined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Rachel, you're good to go.\" Amanda said, walking me over to my bathroom mirror.

I sat there tugging my the skirt part of the dress trying to give myself as much coverage as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, it's impossible to sit any way comfortable like this...\" My legs were scrunched together, swaying back and forth, leaning to the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The price we pay for being sexy little sis.\" Jessica said, turning to me from the passenger seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, I didn't know girls had it so hard.\" I said as I began to play with my hair to take my mind off of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, we're here.\" Amanda announced, parking on the curb where a lot of other cars were. It was a seemingly normal mid-suburbia home. I stepped out of the car and slowly made my way following my sisters. I noticed how much my body swayed, especially my legs and hips. This made my walking feel more natural, and I took note for future reference. We went inside to see it bustling with talkative teens with drinks and snacks and such. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked around and saw all the guys that were there. When I looked at all of them, my body reacted in a way I didn't expect. I felt excited yet nervous. My chest tightened as my heart rate quickened. I felt a blush form on my cheeks as I felt self-aware for the first time. Why am I nervous? They're just guys. Thinking the word \"guys\" again made my body squirm with eagerness. Oh right, I'm what guys want now. Hell, even I think this is great feeling around myself and the way I am. What's gonna happen when I get with a guy and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs my thoughts ran wild I began to turn red and act a little woozy. I was suddenly excited about the prospect of others helping me with \"body experiences\"...especially with guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See Amanda. If 'she' were normal she'd be freaking out right now. Now she actually wants it.\" Jessica smirked. \"Alright kiddo, the pick of the litter is yours tonight.\"</span></div></div>",

Jessica didn't need to adjust my mind any further, as I strutted into the center of the living room, where all the teenagers and college students were swaying back and forth to the music, drinking Bud Light from plastic, red cups and chatting airily. Taking cues from all the observations I made about optimal girliness, I wiggled my ass for all the guys around me. One, a muscular athlete in a basketball jersey, snuck up from behind and wrapped an arm around me. \"Hey babe,\" he said, putting on his best Bruce Campbell impression. \"I haven't seen you here before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't been looking hard enough, then.\" I said, pursing my lips in the suggestion of a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took the hint, and pulled at my dress strap with his thumb, the <i>snap</i> alone sending a pleasant tingle around my shoulder. I felt his breath tickle my neck and almost groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" he said. \"This place is nice and all, but I know a real sweet hangout spot. Few blocks down, a little hill overlooking the entire sub-district. There's a McDonalds nearby, we can get something quick to eat, drive up the hill to the very edge, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have you know...\" I hooked a finger beneath his gym shorts, feeling a tuft of pubic hair. This did little to excite me. The male body was so passe, viewed through the rose-colored lens applied to me by Jessica, and Mr. Hunky Dory only interested me as another means to exciting my easily excitable body. \"...I'm terribly afraid of heights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen grinned and shook his head. \"Honey, I'll take you down to Earth right afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the hell are you doing?</i> a tinny voice echoed through the farthest reachest of my consciousness. <i>Get away from this creep.

When my vision cleared and my thoughts focused, I remembered all the times I'd woken up and put on a bra. The memory made no sense, as I still remembered being a guy before today, so my otherwise intact-memories now included the moments where I got up, put on my boxers, and then put a bra over my flat chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is...\" I began, but Jessica's chuckling cut me off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've always been a bit of a transvestite,\" she said, \"and now you finally get to live out your dream!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more I thought about it, the more Jessica's words made sense. I <i>had</i> worn bras as a guy, secretly of course, lest I jeopardize my reputation at school. I liked the way they felt on me, and now I'd finally get to wear them without any shame! I felt jubilant as I put the straps on, struggling a bit to get the cups around my breasts but getting the hang of it in the end. The bra was slightly more comfortable, though a little tight on my smaller, more curvy body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That-a girl!\" Amanda said with an elbow to the side, and I blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice,\" I said, but then it occurred to me exactly what I was getting into. Being a girl didn't just mean wearing a bra every day. It meant giving up all the things I'd taken for granted as a guy, the friends, girlfriends, football...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now for the rest of your outfit!\" Amanda announced with glee, reaching into my closet...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She stopped, with her arm frozen halfway, reaching up into the closet for a hanger. \"Actually...\" Amanda stepped away from the dizzying rainbow selection of shirts, skirts and dresses and turned back to face me. She clapped her hands together. Her cheeks were almost completely consumed by her smile, and her eyes squeezed tightly in to provide them extra space. \"Oh my God! Why didn't think of this earlier!\" she exclaimed as loud as any ten-year-old girl. Jessica, who had been leaning against the door in a pose of aloof amusement, gave a start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pipe down, Amanda!\" Jessica whined. \"What are you thinking of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are we trying to rush her?\" Amanda whispered. \"She's been like this for less than half-an-hour. We got her acquainted with her body. She's dressed up enough to cover herself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI listened to all of this, still dazed from the series of mental changes Jessica had impressed upon me. My brain felt like silly putty. Thoughts that should have made perfect sense - I was going to Andy's place at 3 o'clock; I had to call my girlfriend Erica; I needed to make a list of all the dorm-room furniture I planned to bring - sparred with new, strange ideas, like the notion that I'd worn bras for the last four years, and apparently I liked the non-wired ones best, which was why the one I currently had on felt so peculiar, on top of being just plain uncomfortable; and the most bizarre musings like what would it be like when I went on my period, and how would guys look at me now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery little of what Amanda and Jessica said registered with me until Amanda seized my arm, and once again, I was being dragged down the stairs into the kitchen. I tried to pry myself away once I saw the blinding white glow through our kitchen's vast picture window, overlooking the dinner table. The blinds were parted wide and across the fence, I saw our frizzly-haired neighbor, Mrs. Lorenzo, dragging the hose over by her petunias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica proved stronger, and with a yank I staggered forward and fell flat on my ass, on top of a hard-wood chair. \"Owwwwwww,\" I groaned, picking the underwear from my butt crack as I shifted and tried to cover the parts of me that were now sore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda fell to her knees and slapped my thighs. \"All right, sis!\" she said, grinning manically. \"Here's the plan. It's your first day. And it's a Saturday. So... We're going to take it easy on you. You got the whole day to yourself to hang around the house. Get familiar with your--\" She turned her palms upward and alternated raising her arms like she was lifting weights. I deduced from the puckered lips and exaggerated motion that she was miming me, playing with my breasts, or something. \"We're not going to mess with you anymore. Not today. We'll hang around, watch TV, do homework... I don't know. You can come ask us questions, or hang out with us. It's up to you. But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to Jessica for support, but Jessica seemed a long ways away, crossing her arms and facing outside the kitchen. She had been the most active during the first few moments of my change, casting spells to mold my mind and make me her slave. I suspected another spell, in spite of Amanda's assurances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But!\" Amanda drew my eyes back to her. \"I did some magic, and for the rest of today... Your closet is empty. What you're wearing now--\" She paused for effect. \"Is all you have until tomorrow morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill settled across my skin. Instinctively, one hand came up and gripped the its partner's arm, rubbing up and down, a helpless gesture. I squeezed my legs together and leaned forward, shrinking down and covering as much of myself as I could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, sis?\" Amanda stopped mugging at me and crawled to my side. She lifted herself so she could drape an arm over me. \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like this,\" I said, which was the only coherent thought that made sense to me. I sniffled, but my eyes were completely dry and my voice composed. \"This isn't right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat I wanted to follow that statement was a loud, flustered \"No, no, no, no!\" and a tearful apology from my sisters as they explained that this was all a joke and everything would be okay in a few hours, or a minute, or just that moment. I knew that was wishful thinking, but it stung when Amanda responded, almost before sound had completely left my lips, \"Ohhhh, honey. It'll be all right. You just need to give it time and a little ol' positive thought!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And..\" Now Jessica sauntered toward me. I waited for her arm to lash out and grab my wrist, and I jerked in anticipation. Instead, she smiled coyly and slid a hand onto her waist. \"You better play the part. Your name is Rachel now. Whatever else you remember is a lie. Don't forget that...\" Her eyes twinkled. \"Because if you try anything funny...\"</span></div></div>",

Soon enough, I find out why. The bra in my hand, moments before a confusing web of fabrics resembling a Mobius strip, suddenly makes sense as I undo the hook, move my hands through the strap and, with the self-assured arm movement that makes it look like I've done this millions of time, hook it back together behind me. I adjust the cups so they're not scrunched up against my breasts, and then I marvel at how easy the process was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, the bra doesn't feel any less new and foreign. I don't remember ever wearing a bra - as far as I know, this is still the first time. Nevertheless, I somehow know all the steps to wear a bra like any other girl. Not too surprising, considering Jessica's previous behavioral change, but it still astounds me. In spite of all the previous evidence, it only now sinks into my brain that, yes, magic exists, and with the snap of my fingers my sisters can exercise their powers over me, and I'm powerless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?

A dubious mercy, I think at first as the pain clouds my thoughts, but then something gets my attention. A desire I never knew existed before, slowly welling up inside my gut and drawing my attention to the perks of wearing a bra. <i>Wear the bra,</i> the desire tells me, <i>Find out what it feels like to have fabric hugging your softer, more sensitive chest, supporting it, touching it constantly. Isn't that a little exciting?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" I say out loud, but inside I agree. From that perspective, a bra doesn't seem so bad. I get to try it on without being a transvestite. Nobody will look at me funny if they see a bra strap hanging out, because it's perfectly natural in this body to wear one. And just think! Maybe a bra will make my new found breasts a little less awkward. Their grip will provide the support--and maybe, I hope, a little erotic pleasure--I need to take this transformation less harshly. With that in mind, the choice seems obvious, and without hesitating I grab the bra and work my way through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes me about five minutes to put the bra on the correct way, figuring out just how to comfortably adjust it over my breasts and how to adjust straps placed on my shoulders just so they don't slide off. I finish the process by hooking the back, and everything comes together. The bra still feels a little bit odd, even after it stops hurting, but more than that I feel accomplished. I look in the mirror and smile faintly. <i>This is not bad,</i> I think. <i>In fact...it's great!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica and Amanda chuckle at my new attitude, but they look more happy than amused. \"Already, our sis is a little bit excited,\" Amanda says. \"How about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's better than her whining,\" Jessica agrees, \"but how about we get her fully dressed?

The pain shot through my head quickly, but it left even faster than it did before. \"--of my finger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe discomfort had disappeared along with the pain. My breasts felt natural on my body, as did the vagina. It was the thought of a penis, dangling from between my legs, that grossed me out and made me shiver. I got to my feet and walked forward, knowing exactly how to move with my hips if I didn't want to look like a dork. I wiped the hair from my eyes in one fluid motion and, when I talked, I used the tone of my voice without the squeaks and cracks of a guy just realizing he's talking like a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This feels natural,\" I said, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you sound damn sexy, too,\" Amanda said.

Rachel does make a good hot girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's still not right, though,\" I insisted, despite how my feminine behavior came naturally. \"I mean, I'm a guy at heart, that's who I was yesterday...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Jessica laughed. \"If we made you watch a horror movie right now, you'd scream and close your eyes. Watch a romance movie and you'd bawl your eyes out.

Funny how that seems so normal from my perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hurriedly slip the white thong on, commenting on how my body seems used to something so small and skimpy.

It was the kind that would blow right up on a windy day, but I seemed to know that already. I then pulled my thin and stretchy pink tank top up. I instinctively knew I had to pull it over my boobs and did so. As it got lower it stopped well short and hugged my entire body. My stomach was pretty well exposed and there wasn't any material left to cover it with. I tugged it a few more times before getting a \"ahem\" from my sisters. They pointed to some really tall high heels which I stepped into. While I expected to topple right over, my body compensated by pointing my butt out and leaning forward as I took perfect practice steps around my room.

Uneventful compared to all the shocks and twists and mind alterations of that morning. I stared out the window for the most part, watching the highway roll by and thinking intermittently about boys staring at me. My mind welcomed that thought, much to my chagrin. I still wanted to like girls, to spite my sisters and their all-encompassing sorcery, but try as I did to think of my old girlfriend, her body held no more appeal to me than my own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe reached the beach, crowded with families, college students, high schoolers my age, and all sorts of other people. I stepped out of the car and felt the sun beat down on my body. Jessica handed me some sunscreen, and I applied it to my body, never once feeling uncomfortable running my hands across my feminine skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave up all hope for the slightest bit of discomfort, the smallest shock to the system to confirm to me that I could act like a guy still, and walked down the beach with Jessica and Amanda. People ran past me left and right, some of them cute guys that made me blush. A few exchanged eye contact with me and I looked away, partially out of shyness, partially out of shame at my behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda set up the chairs as Jessica and I stripped down to our bikinis. Jessica wore a green bikini with white streaks across it, made to resemble spray paint graffiti. She asked Amanda if she'd join us in the water, but Amanda said she'd much rather lay down and tan. Jessica nodded and, after applying some more sunscreen to my back and neck, ran with me to the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cold rush of the ocean soothed my nerves and, for a minute, made me forget about the day's events. I had fun like I always did, splashing around, floating on the water, not thinking about anything. I welcomed the joy of the moment, leaving the past and future behind me...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...until somebody bumped into me and knocked my head underwater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" I said when I resurfaced. \"What's the big idea, Jess--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't Jessica. It was a tall, brown-haired boy with the clearest blue eyes I'd ever seen. He towered over me, when only yesterday I'd have been a few inches taller than him. That didn't matter, though. He put a reassuring arm on my shoulder and my heart skipped a few beats. All the cliches of romance - butterflies in your stomach, a chill up and down your spine - applied to me right then. I had fallen in love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said. \"Didn't see you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no,\" I said, \"It's all right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, showing the whitest teeth I'd ever seen. God, I didn't know if I could take it anymore...</span></div></div>",

I also tried to smile.<br>\r\nHe continued to smile as his arm remained on my shoulder <br>\r\n\"Rachel, uh.  Pretty name.  Perfectly suits a pretty girl like you\"  I blushed a bit upon that last sentence.  \"He.. he thinks I'm pretty?\" I thought to myself.<br>\r\n\"My name's Tony.\" He continued.<br>\r\n\"Tony.  What a handsome name\" I find myself thinking as I notice just how close Tony amd I are.  Nevertheless I somehow managed to keep my cool.<br>\r\n\"Say it's about lunch time, wanna grab a bite\" I offer him<br>\r\n\"Sure\" he replies<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily my sisters had brought enough refreshments 'just in case I picked up any boys', so Tony and I relax under the shade of the beach tent on the beach blanket as we chat with one another.<br>\r\nWe talked a bit about each other, in which I learned that Tony lives a couple of miles where I live, going to a different school but still close, and that he likes to swim a lot as well as surf, which I responded by mentioning that I surf on the beach as well (normally several times a year back when I was a guy).  I mentioned my sisters<br>\r\n\"Are they every bit as charming as you are?\" Tony asks<br>\r\n\"Sometimes, but a lot of times they can be pretty mean.  Amanda can be a bit bratty sometimes, while Jessica just likes to tease me.\"<br>\r\nI then ask \"did you come here with any siblings or friends or aynone in particular?\"<br>\r\nTony replies \"Nah, I came here myself for some fresh air and to enjoy the water.  Though if you are trying to ask me if I have a girlfriend, I'm still single status\".<br>\r\nHe adds \"besides you seem a lot more outgoing and adventurous than most of the girls at my school\"<br>\r\nYou smile and chuckle as you reply \"funny, there aren't really that many guys at my school who are as kind as you are\"<br>\r\nI grab another bottle of water from the cooler only to also touch Tony's hand who was getting a bottle as well.  We pause and gaze at each other for a few seconds before I scoot in a little closer to him as we continue to chat.<br>\r\nLater on, since it was 2 hours since I applied sunblock, I reapplied the sunblock, while letting Tony apply it to my back (which made me feel so gooooood) and the two of us lay down to soak in the sun.<br>\r\nAfter 30 minutes, I decide to make my move<br>\r\nI stand up next to Tony, making sure to pose very confidently as I say \"Say Tony, since the two of us are experienced surfers how about we try tandem surfing\" (tandem surfing is when 2 people ride the same surfboard - very difficult to do)<br>\r\nTony responds \"you know what, I am feeling pretty daring right now\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I was feeling pretty daring myself as well, I was still a little nervous (hiding that I was nervous though) about whether my female body would be able to surf as well as old me (not out of sexism, but rather because it was a different body in general).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though they were likely satisfied the 'results'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI on the other hand couldn't help but keep smiling as for once I was not minding being stuck as a girl.</span></div></div>",

Your sisters think otherwise and turn you into their own little barbie doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel\" - you in the story. While you never had a good relationship with your sisters, it wasn't bad either. Stuck as a girl and the whims of his...er, \"her\" sister's whims. <b>This is from the first person perspective from his/her viewpoint. Please write this way</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins:<br>\r\nAmanda - shorty curly blonde hair and blue eyes. The girly girl of the two of them. Quite the brat when you get her going and she's very angry. Can change you and everything about you physically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica - long straight black hair. Sort of a scene girl but still likes her twin. Very dark fashion sense. Learned she can change you mentally to think or believe anything she wants, but would rather torture you by making everyone else think you're a girl instead.</td>",
