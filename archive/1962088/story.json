My eyes should be a good starting point for your adventure,\" Celestia said telepathically, \"If you have any questions, just speak with your mind and I'll be glad to answer them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the Princess fell silent again, you walked toward the desired passage and began ascending a series of steps. The stair is really squishy and bouncy; the whole place would jitter with every step you take. Princess Celestia has been really accommodating and you're thankful for that. This is maybe the first time a human gets to explore the interior of the solar princess, a very rare opportunity to fully understand her workings. You couldn't help but feel bad for Star Light being traumatized by such an experience. <i>He sure missed out the fun part of being in a body</i>, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, the stairs gave way to an chamber the size of a large bedroom that many of Canterlot's nobles own. The room is devoid of anything except a pair of oval openings placed on either sides of the room. The throne room is visible through them. Guard ponies flanked both sides of the long hall with stoic expressions. The stained glass windows tells the stories of feats of the group of ponied known as the Elements of Harmony. Most exciting of all, you can see Princess Luna seated beside in a regal pose busy writing down some notes on parchment paper while occasionally glancing toward her sister. It's not often that you get to see these together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that you've arrived at my eyes, Mage,\" Celestia said, \"This is one of Star Light's favorite place during his stay within me.

A set of stairs in the fleshy corridor leads toward your destination as indicated by a sign. The ground trembles rhythmically, leading you to believe that Celestia is walking toward someplace else. The sensation of the movement felt strangely comforting. You slowed you pace just to savor the feeling of being in the safety of the solar monarch's body. You imagined the way she walked and how well toned her alabaster body looked. A quick self reminder that Celestia probably could read your mind stopped you from thinking further in that direction. <i>I really need to keep my mind out of the gutter. I'm in the Princess for goodness sake.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe passageway gave way to an even larger chamber. You originally expected to see a soft mass of wrinkles and folds. But the Princess' brain has more resemblance to a palatial library. The ceilings are tall and vaulted like the dining hall of Canterlot Castle. Tons and tons of tomes and books are arranged on shelves laid out in concentric circles. The library is quiet except for the echoes of you footsteps upon the floor. Some of the books looked worn and old while others have more contemporary designs. A quick browse of the titles and you found books about spells and Equestrian history. Others are about griffons, dragons, humans, and even a cake cookbook. You guess that Celestia's actual memories must be stored in another area in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe centerpiece of the chamber is a giant tapestry that depicts both Celestia and Luna watching over their kingdom. The Sun Princess has head raised high like the beaming sun above. At the opposite side, Luna looked serenely at her Moon and stars. Beneath the alicorns is the land of Equestria populated by the three races of pony. You quietly admired the work and thought about the countless legends you've heard before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, seems like the beauty within my brain has caught your attention,\" Celestia chimed, \"This is one of Twilight's favorite places to be in me. She would spent days studying the memories I permitted her to look at. She has gotten so curious about me that she once snuck into restricted areas housing my personal memories and watched some things not discussable in polite company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can imagine her doing that. I heard Twilight will go great lengths  to obtain information.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's more than that, my human. She will go completely crazy if she is ever a minute behind her checklist or schedule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...If I ever meet Twilight in here, be sure you always have a magical barrier handy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I bet you two will get along quite well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, I think. So, what's this tapestry for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"If you're curious, that tapestry is the visualization of my relationship with my sister. It's the indication of the harmony within Equestria. You can say that it reflects my state of mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Wow, cool indeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, wanna check out some cute filly Twilight memories with me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the Princess has just finished an explanation about the human in her to Twilight, which greatly piqued the purple pony's curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is unbelievable. There is a human who fantasizes about living in you, Princess? He must be a very interesting person. I have to meet this human! Princess, could you please use that spell on me again?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The albums are an interesting look into the relationship between Twilight and Princess Celestia. Each lesson learned by the adorable filly was filled with success, failure, and everything in between. Whether the end results were smiles or teary puppy eyes or nervous breakdowns, Twilight eventually works around the challenges. You can slowly see why the Princess would want her as a protege. From these memories, you also learned that the lavender mare has an older brother named Shining Armor. Celestia told you that he is the Captain of the Royal Guards and have fought numerous wars for Equestria. <i>Must be a pretty tough guy to make it that high</i>, you thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, you are on a page about one of filly Twilight's breakdown about mastering the teleportation spell. The pictures of her twitching, sleep-deprived face unsettled you. You were about to flip toward the next page to see the results when the book suddenly glowed purple and slammed itself shut. The sound of clopping hooves echoed from behind. Within split seconds, you felt yourself being painfully pinned down onto the ground and rolled over. Your eyes shrank when you saw Twilight Sparkle herself looking panicky at you. Her horn glowed as she dragged you up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What memories have you read about? Did you see how I failed my transformation spell pop quiz? Anything about how I turned myself pink? Oh Celestia, did you read about how I cried and snuggled the Princess at night for a year for being afraid of the dark? Oh nonononono. This can't be true. Tell me, tell me, tell me that you didn't know my pet name!!!\" the new alicorn exclaimed in rapid fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Easy there. Calm down,\" you said in an attempt to ease the nervous mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalm down? CALM DOWN?! How can I calm down when somepony is watching the most awkward moment of my past?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Celestia allowed me to see them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. All of my failures are....Wait....The Princess permitted you to see the memories?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I came here at her invitation. Celestia can verify my claim,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's alright, Twilight. I just wanted to share some stuffs with the human. He is kinda curious about you.</i>, the sun princess' voice said in both of your minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*sigh* \"You see, Princess, those memories are private and  I'd appreciate it if you refrain from allowing this human mage any further access.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hahaha. Alright, alright lil'Sparky. I'll try to ask you the next time I share my memories.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess! Don't use that name when someone's around,\" Twilight blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>heehee. Just have some fun in there, alright. I got some royal duties to attend to now.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Celestia return to her business, leaving you and Twilight looking awkwardly at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything you wanna do, your highness?\" you asked Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm....Let's go to my old bedroom first. It's a short walk to the base of the horn. There is a lot we need to talk about.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A bright light shone in the bedroom. Whatever that's shining is so intense that it rendered your eyelids ineffective at shielding out the light. You stirred in the bed for some time, trying to block out the light with the sheets before slowly opening your eyes. When you looked up from the bed, you saw the entire room glowing a brilliant gold. Everything from the bookshelves to the bed you're on is engulfed in the ethereal light. A subtle tingling sensation of magic courses through the entire chamber. As the veil of sleepiness fade, you recalled what happened in the last day and remembered that your are in Princess Celestia. <i>That must be the Princess raising the sun</i>, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attempted to leave the bed but was held down by something. You felt it gave you a fuzzy nuzzle while mumbling some indiscernible words. You turned around and found yourself looking at Twilight hugging your arm with her fore hooves and her rear legs sandwiching your ankles together. Her face is right in front of yours, close enough for you to feel her gentle breathing. Her mane is disheveled and matted. As much as you're uncomfortable with the bookworm clinging so close to you, you couldn't help but admire how adorable she looks when she's asleep. The purple alicorn also has a cute expression upon her face as she continues to cuddle you while still talking in her dream. It's probably a good one as you can make out words like 'great', 'books', and 'friends'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gently gave her a nudge, causing Twilight to give off a very unprincess-like snort that echoes throughout the chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwww, But Princess Celestia..... I want to learn more about transformation spells. Could we please extend class time today?\", she groaned in her dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stifled your laughter and gave her another nudge. This time, the princess stirred and her eyes gradually opened, revealing a large pair of mesmerizing purple gems. You saw your reflection smiling back in those half-lidded eyes. They are still filled with confusion and sleepiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhhhh, what a good dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Twilight.\" you greeted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's eyes suddenly sprang wide open and she literally jumped out of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gaaaaah!\" she shrieked and teleported right on top of you, pinning you to the bed and gave you a death glare, \"What in the hay did you think you're doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa easy there, Twilight,\" you tried to calm the alicorn, \"I didn't mean to scare you like that. I'm just waking you up. That's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight folded her wings and stepped off you but still giving you glares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everypony really need to stop waking me up like this. First, Spike. Rainbow Dash. Now, a human mage that I only know for a day. Who wouldn't get scared if the first thing you see in the morning is someone's grinning face?\" she motioned toward the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you were the one who cuddled me in your sleep, princess,\" you grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked at you wide-eyed while her face blushed brightly. \"Well I........ughh  fine. Just do that again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could do anything else, you heard Celestia's voice reverberating in the entire chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, fair mage and my dearest Twilight,\" you heard her voice beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Princess.\" Twilight replied to her mentor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also gave your greeting to the Sun Princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you two had a good night's sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did, Princess. Except the human scaring the hay out of my coat just moments ago when he tried to wake me, \" Twilight said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard Celestia chuckled. \"Since we're all up, why don't we all head for breakfast. You two should head for the Eye Chamber. I have a table prepared for you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight and you got off the bed, cleaned yourselves up, and set for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reached the Eye Chamber, you two saw a table laid out in the center of the room with plates and utensils neatly placed on each end. Looking out from the Princess's eyes, you can see her seated in the Royal Dining Room enjoying some toasted breads and light salads with a cup of tea. She's holding a copy of the <i>Canterlot Press</i> with her magic, reading the headlines for the day. Across from her, you see Luna eating a bowl of cereal quietly while doodling on her copy of the newspaper. She has a tired and exhausted look on her face. For the Night Princess, this is probably her dinner before she retires to her chamber. On the very far side of the long table, you saw the infamous Prince Blueblood eating a lavish breakfast with numerous attendants at his side. You heard about his disdain for humans and ponies who aren't royalty. Not a particularly good impression. The Princesses don't seem to pay much attention to him as they continue eating their breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight is amazing in many ways. It is sorta strange to see the Princesses eating something so common and acting so casual, like the average citizen of Equus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia felt the two of you arriving in the chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look pretty nice, isn't it?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a fine option, princess,\" you complimented, \"Might I ask, what happened to Luna? And why is Blueblood here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luna just had a rough night of dream patrolling. Several fillies and colts had nightmares after the release of a new horror movie. It was difficult trying to placate them of their fear. As for Blueblood, he is whining as usual about our lack of royal dining etiquette as well his nobility nonsense about being superior. It's best to just ignore him. Other than that, anything you two want in particular for breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have the usual as always, Princess,\" Twilight replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll be having what you're having now. Some salads and juice would do,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please take a seat and wait while I teleport the foods for you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight and you sat down on the chairs provided and waited for the Princess to get your meals.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Both Celestia and Luna rolled their eyes in such remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are no for me, nephew.\" she said with a false smile. In truth, she never liked blueblood, by tartarus, she HATED his family with every fiber of her being, each generation was more arrogant than the previous one, if his family weren't from Equestria's founders she would have striped from his status and leave him in the streets wearing nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here are your dishes, Princess\" stated one the chefs, she nodded and her horn glow, teleporting the ordened food inside of her Eye Chambers (Eye balls) for you and Twilight to eat, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, You can go now.\" the chefs nodded and head back the kitchen, Blueblood looked at celestia with wide eyes an the sudden spell, Luna chuckled at his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhen they finished their food Luna bid good day to her sister before heading back to her room for sleep, Blueblood goes outside with some unfortunate guards as bodyguards, Celestia decided to have a small flight around canterlot, her royal duties doesn't start now until much later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside of the Eye Chamber, You and Twilight were still eating, you notice the change of scenary of the outside world until you heard the sound of wings flapping <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight, Look! the princess of flying!\" you said while looking from the princess eye, Twilight notice it too and she couldn't help but wonder while looking at awe the sigh of canterlot from the very high height, everyone, pony an human looks like ant from princess perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this is very high distance from canterlot, I can see my exlibrary from here\" you rolled your eyes but chuckled afterward, Twilight glare at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is so funny?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"that you need to get out more, Princess\" you chuckled again but this time celestia chuckled as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mage is right, Twilight, so many books might convert you into one.\" You both heard the princess voice from beneath, your resist to laught while twilight glare on you with red in anger and embarrassment.  Anger because of you laughting in that remark. Embarrassment because is true she spend most of her time in books, her embarrassment is more stronger than her anger so she sight in defeat letting out all her anger from her system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no royal duties until much more later, Me and Twilight can take to a tour within my body in the meantime\" said the princess while lying down in a lone cloud she found in the skies of canterlot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good, Princess.\" you smile while Twilight smile as well wanting to lecture you about the princess insides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" said Twilight with excitement in her voice \"Since we are in the head we can begin our tour in the Princess' Spine-Train!\" said Twilight while you and her finish the food, you look at her with in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spine-Train?\" You ask she turned to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"in our size, the princess' body is enourmous, we would be walking for hours around here, so the princess created a transport system in her cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral and coccygeal vertebrae, These hours of walking become minutes using that.\" stated the young princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In other words, her spine has a train so we can avoid hours of walking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"that's a straightforward way to say it but yes, come, the train is in the backside of the princess' cranium.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You followed Twilight out of the Eye Chamber. Before reaching the doorway, you briefly caught sight of Celestia plunging her muzzle into the cloud as she lie down to relax. The Princess seems rather laid back right now. But she probably has to deal with excruciating meetings with officials and boring lectures from visiting dignitaries,  or worse, listening to the nobles (likely Blueblood) throwing fits when they didn't get what they ask for. Celestia sure knows how to manage her time and temperament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you waiting for, mage? Don't you want to check out Celestia's body parts?\" Twilight's voice echoed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts snapped back to the present. You turned your attention back to the alicorn and gave her a sheepish grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Twilight. I kinda drifted off. Anyway, please lead the way, princess.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next 15 minutes, you walked with Twilight through numerous hallways and spiraling stairs that rivals the complexity of Canterlot Castle itself. Instead of the color scheme of the castle, the halls inside Celestia is mostly white with blue and yellow accents. The gold-purple parquet floor echoed every time you and Twilight stepped on it. On both sides, the hallway is lined with marble statues of Celestia in various poses. On the walls are paintings of various cities in Equestria. You looked at your surroundings in amazement but Twilight seemed unfazed. The nerdy princess has been in here so many times that she probably consider it her third home after Canterlot and Ponyville.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNumerous time on your way, you looked down and indadvertedly caught glimpse of the purple alicorn's swaying flank. But you always quickly looked up and scolded yourself for doing that lest you want to incur the wrath of the bookworm. But admittedly, her flank does look nice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 15 minutes have passed, you two passed through a large gate marked \"Main Station\". The station is a replica of the one in Canterlot complete with a large platform and a rail track that leads toward a large white tunnel.  You spotted a train similar to the Pony Express waiting for you two. The train is painted to the colors of Celestia's body with a decals of her cutie mark emblazoned on the sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you had time to admire the train further, a speaker on the platform made an announcement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Final boarding call for Princess Twilight Sparkle and the Human Mage. Your train will be leaving in five minutes. This is your final call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice was none other than Celestia's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight first boarded into the coach and motioned for you to come. You entered the coach and found that the entire car has only two seats and is plushly decorated. <i>Princess-class accommodation</i>, you mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner you two are seated, the train rumbles to life and journeyed down the track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the train entered the tunnel, a pony walked in from a door in front of you and Twilight. The pony was a young white alicorn with pink mane and braces on her teeth. She also bore a sun cutie mark. The alicorn beamed a very adorable smile at both of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for joining us on the <i>Princess Celestia Body Tour</i>. I'm Celly and I'll be your guide for the day. First of all, has anyone wondered what the interior of the most powerful pony in Equestria look like? What are the differences and similarities between the Princess and ordinary ponies? Well, you're about to find out. If you have questions feel free to ask me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight giggled at the introduction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess Celestia loves immersion and role playing,\" Twilight whispered to you.</span></div></div>",

Magic Essense factory?\" you ask, you never heard about these places before in your anatomy book, probarbly the princess' doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Me and the Princess will explain later on, the magic essence factory is conected to the heart's magic factory, In fact all three factories are conected, the Air Collector transform part of the Oxygen to make the Essence, the Essence goes to the Heart to be transformed into magic particules, the particles goes directly to every part of her body, specially the horn where is more concentrated, the orb we saw in the horn's tower is a magic node, there are many in each part of the Princess' body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work, Twilight!\" Celly appears again, it seems that the train is decreasing its speed until fully stopping in another station, there is a sign that said \"Lungs Station\" outside, Celly brighted and smiled showing her braces teeth  \"Our tour can begin now!\" she exclaimed, you three exited the train and go to the station's elevator that goes directly to the Lungs' Air Collector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Celestia is relaxing in the cloud she extended her will to a mini 'avatar' in her body so she can accompany her student and the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if the mage drink some of my magic blood in my heart\" she mused in the though a little.

When the doors slide open, Celly led you and Twilight out into a lobby where she go over some safety instructions while inside the Air Collector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be incredibly windy inside. For your safety, please do not venture away from the tour for any reasons. With that said, let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelly took you to a large door marked \"Air Collector     <i>Caution: Strong winds beyond this point</i>.\" She inserted her horn into a hole to unlock it with her magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on tight,\" Twilight tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the door opened, strong winds whipped up, causing you to almost fall over. The gust alternates direction as Celestia inhales and exhales. Celly conjured up a magical forcefield to protect you and Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This way please,\" chimed the guide as she lead the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe size of the lung is just massive, just like Twilight told you; it's basically a world in itself. In every direction, you see nothing but the horizon line and a landscape of flesh and veins.  Everything in here expand and contracts as air rushed in and out in intervals. Describing it as a desert would still be an understatement and this is only one lung. You looked around at the size and imagined that it must be large enough to hold hundreds of full grown dragons without problem. Above, masses of glowing orbs are suspended from the ceiling like organic chandeliers. pulsates in a steady pattern.  They also act as a light source in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are now in the Air Collection section of the lung. Like every living thing in Equestria, this is where all airs entering the Princess's nostril will come to. The large hole over there leads to the trachea which is connected to the throat, mouth, and nasal cavity,\" Celly explained, \"As a little quiz, can any of you tell me what are those things in the ceiling called?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are alveolar sacs, Celly,\" Twilight replied within a split second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct, Twilight. The orb-like structures lining the ceiling are called alveolar sacs. Their job is to absorb the oxygen in each breath we take and send it into our bloodstreams. They also serve as the primary point where raw magic is absorbed and stored in our bodies. Even though all ponies and even humans have this capability, their effects are most prominent in unicorns and alicorns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One question though. Does simply breathing allows you to acquire magic?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. That's the simple way of saying it. It would be too complicating if we were to go down the technical route,\" Celly smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Twilight clearing her throat with a dorky smile. It is clear to you where this is going. There's no stopping Twilight when she goes into 'bookworm' mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To put it in a way that most ponies and humans can understand, the air itself in Equestria is teeming with all sorts of magic. It's one of the basic forces of the world. It's ubiquitous and produced constantly. Everything from trees, rivers, and rocks to the air we breath contains potential magic that can be converted into its kinetic form if a magic user knows how to utilize it. For alicorns like Princess Celestia and I, we absorb the magic around us and store it in the a small lobe of the brain directly beneath the horn. It's known as the <br>\r\n<i>magilium cerebellum</i>. When we use magic, we simply release the energy store in there and mold it into whatever spell we want to use. The power will vary from unicorn to unicorn. As a mage, you used magic reciting incantations to concentrate them at a single given point in space. The...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Twilight. I think I get your point. That's the easy version? I'd hate to think about what the hard version looks like. And Celly's right about the technical stuffs. It's making me dizzy,\" you said as you massaged your temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I always can't resist the opportunity to share some info,\" Twilight grinned sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blu...  Okay. Looks like we're all set to visit the Heart! This way up those stairs,\" Celly exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, a very upset Celestia arrived on her balcony in the castle. She tried her best not to let her emotions influence the 'avatar' guide. Though Celly has some degree of autonomy, she's still part of the Celestia. The guard who informed her of the prince's latest trouble returned to his post after saluting the Princess. Blueblood has been enough of a problem and something must be done. But that spoiled prince probably would never learn. Perhaps Luna was right, Blueblood was long beyond saving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Princess marched through the palace with guards and other staffs shrinking from the normally-benevolent monarch's sight. She stopped at the entrance to Blueblood's quarter and shoved the door open with the full force of her magic. The Prince who was enjoying a cup of tea spill it all over his pristine white coat, a expression of fear and uncertainty on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A...aun..auntie....?\" Blueblood managed to form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence!!!\" Celestia demanded, \" I thought that you would get better and  drop your expression of speciesism and purity. I'm sadly mistaken.... Today, you overheard a colt expressing nothing but the truth about your character. Not only did you not accept his words, you even call for the exiling of humans and ponies who have relationship with them. All because the colt's father is a human. Don't you ever think about the consequence of your actions? I have lost count of how many times I asked you that question. But I will tell you the consequences this time. Your actions are extremely unbecoming of a royal prince. As the Princess of Equestria and Raiser of the Sun, Prince Blueblood III of Canterlot, I hereby stripped you of all your titles and offices.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..........\" The former prince remained silent.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's the usual snide, Blueblood? Aren't you going to beg me for the umpteenth time? Where's the \"my ancestors fought for and served you well\" defense? You possess no qualities whatsoever to even mention them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..........\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think I'll let you off easily like I used to do. I have a better place to imprison you. Somewhere I can keep a constant eye on you and, hopefully, set you straight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlueblood's eyes went wide as he saw the Princess close in with her horn lit.</span></div></div>",

Celly answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes, that's depending of the pony's size, for example Twilight have the size of a normal pony her heart is the size of, to put it simple, grow up human's fist, but in Celestia or Luna size is the size of a pony or human's head!\" Your eyes went wide again in suprise, hearing that simple explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big as a human head?\" you ask. this time it was twilight's time to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The heart of the princess need to be bigger for the magic conversion in the Magic Factory, similar to a horse, the heart is more rounder and heavier than a standard pony, you will see why.\" said the young princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are here!\" said Celly, there was a small corridor and a giant door guarded by two white alicorns with heavy gold armor, both of them seems to be \"clones\" of celestia herself but with the same emotionless or \"stone\" expression of the Royal Guard, kinda funny seeing the princess like that but worry you a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, these are the \"Royal White Cells\"\" Celly giggle a little at your dumbstuck expression. \"we transformed our white cells in this particular area to protect the heart from special danger.\" she finished, until the guards block the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"halt! state your business\" one of the guard said with celestia's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are here for the tour of the heart, fair guard, there is nothing to worry about.\" Said Celly both guard look each other before looking on you two, they both nodded and open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may pass, but don't get closer to the Heart's prison for your safetly.\" Celly and Twilight nodded but you got confused about the prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a prison? no, better question, there is prisoners here? in the heart of the most important pony in the world?!\" you almost shouted. drawing attention of the guards as well. Twilight's laught nervously before telling the guards that everything was alright, she turned to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there are two reasons why the Princess' heart is important; one is the heart itself no only pump the blood to mantain her alive, is also transform the magical essence absorbed by the lungs' alveolar sacs, as explained early, with our lungs we absorb magic from the environment, however the magic stored in our bodies affect most of our organs, specially the heart. For unicorns, their heart its completely hard like a rock but for alicorns is almost hard as diamond, that's lead the second reason; this hardness make the heart the perfect place to protect or imprison, there are two buildings inside the heart, one is the magic factory and the other the most secure prison of all Equestria.\" You nodded at twilight dumbstruck by the explanation. you two enter to the gates as the guards close it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... Amazing\" you three entered in a tunnel, the walls' membranes working as windows to look inside the heart almost like an aquarium, the heart's big as canterlot's palace, but rounded and pumping blood in and out of valves, gateways and other tunnels, there are two building visible at the inner walls of the heart, one has a huge orb core glowing in gold in the center, the building has mutiples gates for the blood to enter while others are expulsing it with another golden substance in the mix, <i>the Magic Factory?</i> you though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other building was surrounded by multiples white submarines and guards in diving suits, it was visible other guards inside of the building patroling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! its a mistake! I regret saying that, please auntie don't leave in this horrid place, please, AIEE!! My mane!\" You all Three heard a whining voice behind, it turn out to be blueblood himself being dragged by Two Guards toward the tunnel's prison but before enter he looked at you, his face of horror turned to anger as he liberate himself from the guards' grasp chargin at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU! You and your species are to blame! Thanks to your race I'm no longer prince!\" he charge on you with horn pointed in you but you were prepared, your arms glow channeling your magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't, <i>vulneribus!</i>\" you mutter as suddenly the former prince is trapped inside a energy cube with no way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! NO!!\" he yells as some guards grabs the cube with magic this time, there as huge \"NOOOOOOOOooooooooooooooo!\" as the Tunnel's open, welcome him the promising horrors inside the guarded part of the heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was incredible, what spell is that?\" Twilight looked at you with stars in her eyes, she never seen a human magic before just in books or in lesser forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is just a simple containing spell, nothing fancy or powerful, it will wear off in time without more magic to sustain it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say that was a suprising your reaction, mage, that horn was sharp and aimed to your heart.\" an female voice very different from Celly or Twilight or even celestia talked behind you, your turned around only to see only Princess Luna herself in all her glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess Luna!\" Both the three of you bow at her, Luna chuckled seeing two princess (or a princess and avatar of one) bowing. \"you two don't need to bow to me, you are princess, Twilight, and Celly... You why bow to me?\" The Avatar alicorn giggle, Luna rolls her eyes \"Nevermind, You may rise Mage.\" you do as ordened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess, nothing bad and all but, why and how are you doing here? normaly you sleep in day and you work in the night, I saw you very tired in the morning.\" You said with curiosity, it was true after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed you're right, Mage, this is no the real me, my body is resting in my bedroom but I placed my conscious in very small avatar to visit my dark side here. I'll been doing this each weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your darkside?\" said twilight confused when suddenly she gasped \"You mean Nightmare Moon?! I though the elements eliminated her from you!\" You and Twilight were suprised and shocked except Celly, Luna sigh before explaining,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After you and your friends used the elements to rescue me from <i>her</i> I was not completely free. Nightmare Moon wasn't utterly gone just retreated back to my mind, my sister knowing this offered herself to safeguard my darkness, at first I denied her but after hearing her ways to deal with her, I let her guard my dark persona, however, After visiting my darkside for sometimes, I discover that isn't a evil spirit but an jealous spirit, since then, me and my sister are trying to turn her to a good spirit but she still refuse, I wasn't expecting you to found in my sister's heart, after you tour in the heart, I can accompany you but for a while, this body will disappear and my mind will come back to my original body within two hours, maybe a little visit to the liver, is a short walk from here there is the good place... a very FUN place\" she said almost squealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her oddily until Celly whisper to you \"The Liver is where the Game Zone is, she is a hardcore gamer\" You drop you jaw after hearing this, it seems that the \"Gamer\" Luna rumor is true... she isn't the same MoonMaster24 you added as friend in steam? you shrugged in thought, the trio go to the Magic factory while Luna go the heart's prison to visit Nightmare Moon.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You three reached the Magic Factory by taking another tunnel leading toward the bright beacon. Along the way, there are several more Royal White Cells standing guard against any unwanted guest. Despite being clones of the Princess, the nature of their work meant that they have some differences in terms of physiology. Tall, muscular, and intimidating; Qualities befitting of a seasoned castle guard. Any threats to the Princess When they saw Celly and Twilight walked by, the guards saluted firmly without looking at the group. The last pair of guards opened a double door and ushered you all into the Magic Factory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first impression you have of the place is its distinctive design. Tall columns circled the entire complex to form an atrium, much similar to pegasi architecture. The structure itself is built from sturdy heart muscles that feels like solid rock beneath your feet. Twilight previously noted that it's hard like diamond but that doesn't make much difference now. The general view of the factory gives you a rough idea of the mechanism used here. Blood is pumped in through a series of transparent pipes in the ceiling before they're directed to a series of concentric aqueducts. The blood then flows into a large pool where the large orb occupies the center, supported by a pedestal decorated with ancient Equestrian glyphs. The sound of Celestia's heart is very prominent as the factory works on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. This way please,\" Celly requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guide led you and Twilight to a front desk. Celly lead you to a series of clothing racks and helmets placed on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to put these on to keep the area clean. The helmets are needed in case any excess blood rains down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you searched for the appropriate size of the equipment and get dressed. When you're all ready, Celly directed you all to a platform overlooking the series of tubes from the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pipes in the ceiling are connected directly to the return heart chamber outside. As the blood is pumped through the Princess's body, the magic imbued in them are gradually absorbed by the organs it was carried through. Once all magic is used up, the blood will appear almost dark purple. At this point, their job is to merely carry oxygen. The depleted blood is then drawn into the Magic Factory and directed to the aqueducts where they will sent down to the replenishment pool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelly pointed to the large pool as she took flight of stairs down. Once you got to the first floor of the factory, you and Twilight look at the large glowing ball in awe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The glowing object on the pedestal is magical essence collected earlier from the lung. Do notice that the pool and aqueduct are all smooth and gentle sloping. The reason for that is to prevent air bubbles from forming and causing problems later on when they're in the veins. The pool could hold enough blood to sustain the princess for three hours, meaning the factory performs this process a total of 8 times a day. Once the pool if full in a minute, the magic begins,\" Celly grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a minute, the blood stopped flowing and the magical essence on the pedestal shine brighter. Tendrils of pure magic shot out from the orbs and strike the surface of the blood. It looks like the blood is being electrified with glowing yellow arcs dancing across the entire factory. A stray bolt of magic connected with Twilight's horn, causing her to jerk abruptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The magic is really strong this time. That's the most intense magical charge I encountered in a while,\" the purple alicorn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five more minutes of a spectacular light show, the tendrils from the orb receded back leaving a bright red pool with sparking with golden shimmers before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The recharging is now complete,\" Celly said, \"Under normal circumstances, the blood will be drained to rejoin the circulatory system. But for today, I would like to share with the Mage a little alicorn secret. This is the Royal Blood in its most powerful form. In this state, it will grant anyone who drink from it immense magical power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....So the ancient books weren't lying about this.  Incredible! It also reminds me of those dodgy merchants who claimed to have retrieved a vial of Celestia's blood back at my town. I always thought that it was an old pony's tale,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I used to think the same way as you, mage,\" Twilight admitted, \"But after becoming an alicorn, I learned from the Princess her blood does enhance the magic of whoever drinking from it. She used to grant them in the Old Equestrian Age (450 years ago) to anyone who she deemed worthy enough to receive it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With such power...wouldn't that be problematic if that power falls into the wrong hand?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is exactly why I'm asking you to never let this information out. All books containing this fact are already locked in the restricted portion of the Canterlot Library. Could you just imagine the numbers of attempts on the Princess's life if this became common knowledge in Equestria?\" Twilight said worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have my words, Twilight. No words will leave this factory,\" you assured her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are we gonna take a drink or what?\" Celly asked at the sideline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Celestia actually wanted me to drink it? What did I do to warrant such an honor?\" you inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelly giggled. \"Her reasoning might sound a little trivial. When you used that spell when Blueblood charged at you, you not only acted in self-defense. You also tried to protect Twilight from imminent danger. That large horn of his could have easily impaled you yet you are willing to take the risk to defend the princess. That bravery really impressed the Princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celly, just tell the Princess that I'm just doing what's I feel was right. I don't think I'm worthy to receive her blood for such insignificant task,\" you said politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Princess really insists that you drink it. If not for the bravery, then take it for giving Blueblood his flank on a plate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I still can't....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then do it for me, for Celestia, will you? Pleeeeeeeaaaasssee.....\" Celly pleaded as she used her best puppy eyes and pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh......so much cuteness....princess...I mean Celly, you're not a filly. Please...stop!\" You tried to resist those eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plllleeeeease!\" Celly pouted again but intensifying her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still not giving in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PWEEEEEEEEEEEZZ!!!\" Her pupils are now larger than physically possible. Those watery purple pools are close to getting their job done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Too much cute. Obey Celly. Can't take anymore. Resolve collapsing fast. All down.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Fine,\" you finally muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelly's face cracked up into a big brace-revealing smile and gave you a tight hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you would yield eventually. So far, still no one can resist my cuteness. Not even Luna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree tall wineglass materialized in front of Celly. She took them in her magic and scooped the sparkling blood into them. The alicorn levitate two glass to you and Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheers!\" You three said at the same time before downing the cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about you two but the blood reminds me of unsweetened soda with some hints of alcohol. Now, I want to do some gaming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The womb works in three ways actually, as you first said, as an hospital, since the uterus is an organ that create and nurture life, We modified it a little so it can heal the existing ones however, the ovaries works differently, one collect and store genetic material and the other is a laboratory to create a perfect egg to make a succesful alicorn foal... if the situation arise, of course.\" Celly ended it blushing before adding another piece of information. \"We'll go there in the end of the Tour, I need to warn you that the womb, like the lungs, is pretty big.\" She said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" you said in debelief until luna stop in front of a wet and fleshy door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the door toward the Liver Mall, where Liver Games are in!\" She squaled, you rolled your eyes, after these squealings, you can't take the Princess of the Moon seriously anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors open revealing a amazing sight, the Liver is indeed a mall, there are multiples stores with distint products with Celestia's Image in it. there are clothing stores, gifts stores, jewerly and what luna and you wanted, the Game Zone or The Liver games as the title said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright we'll taking break now.\" Said Celestia's Avatar. Luna rush toward the game zone while you follow her laughting nervously at the Moon Princess's antics...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if the Celestia's Secret has the new sunlight socks, they are quite nice\" Twilight said while trotting toward said store before being called by Celly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight, I need to talk to you\" she said in hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what's going on?\" Celly's horn glow in ethereal gold and engulfing herself in white light when it ended, Celly was replaced by a grow up Princess Celestia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to talk you myself in private, my faithful student.\" said celestia with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess! what's going on?\" she said now worried, if Celestia want to talk with her in private it probarbly important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The tension between the Griffing Kingdom and the Dragon Tribes are rising, I'm affriad they may end in war in the end of the year, I need to go to the gryphons' capital city to stop this war before beginning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how this affect Equestria if these Kingdoms go to war? Ask Twilight confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight, if the dragons wins, they will declare to war to us. their leader believe the dragons should reign the entire world, he thinks that the elements of harmony should be used by dragons' claw for the sake of his twisted goal, they are declaring war to the gryphon to get us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! but how this happend? the dragons have been our allies since the end of discord's reign, how this leader want to break thousand of years of peace for the sake conquering the world?!\" now twilight was breathing frantically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down Twilight, there is still chance to prevent this. this warmorgen is still young and unexperience, many dragons aren't supporting him and its a good sight but I need to go in few days and I can't have the mage in me for safertly reasons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"how is this relevant? he should leave in the moment you have to go.\" said the Young alicorn confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here is the thing Twilight, He cannot return to normal for few weeks.\" Twilight's eyes widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! but how?\" she ask now worried for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight, There is a reason why only ponies and few humans, drink from my blood. in ponies the effect of my blood is instant boosting they magic in just seconds but in humans, my blood's magic take effect in few weeks but in order take effect properly, the human's magic needs to undergo a transformation to made it compatible with my magic.\" she said while lowering her head with shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"in other words, he can't return to his normal size by his own until that happend\" finished twilight before realizing something. \"But we can return him to normal right? the corridors, tunnels and pathway in you change our size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but that's different, in order for both of you to go to any of my organs, the enchanted corridors change your size to an extent and is continue to take affect until you all go out of my body. but we cannot use an grow spell on him, it will wear off by time and return to the size he initially changed so in order to return to normal he need to cancel his own spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he can't do that, He can't do magic in all during all that time!\" she exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I need tell him in the end of the tour but he might need a guardian and my options are You or Luna but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But luna can't be with him because her night duties and her body needs to be in a meditation state during Dreamwalk, oxygen will dwindle during sleeping, he will have hard time to breath during nighttime, possible dead suffocation!\" she finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's why my best option is you, Twilight, can I trust you in this task?\" She ask only to twilight do a military salute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it, Princess! I will not fail you.\" she said without sweat but there was a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You notice it right? You cannot take care of him in that size, you will need do the same as me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean let him live inside my body? but I don't have the same bodily control as you do.\" She said a little in shame but is mostly true she can't do the same as the princess without the same body enchantment as the princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's no problem Twilight, I can teach you the spell, is really easy actually.\" Celestia said with an smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*30 minutes later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Luna were exiting the Game Zone after a epic virtual battle, both of you are having an argument about being the best in some games, you both developed a friendly rivality after that time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you can't defeat me in Mortal Kombat!\" You boast while luna pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still I defeated you in Soul Calibur and in Halo!\" Exclaimed Luna, you two continue this until you encouter with twilight and Celly (who returned back to her young and cute persona)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You both finished?\" asked an irritated Twilight, they notice she carried heavy saddlebags full of objects \"we are going to continue the tour toward the Lower half of the princess's body which consist the small intestines, spleen, kidneys, bladder and the uterus\" Said the young alicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me help you with that\" you offer youself to carry with the heavy equipment she have, she smiled you for your generous action and give you one of the saddlebags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the rest of the intestines?\" You ask while a saddlebag, you notice that isnt heavy, probarbly the effect of the blood from the heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"the large intestines is only for the prisoners of the Heart, as punishment for their crimes, they must clean our bowels everyday.\" said celly, you nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, see that Elevator?\" Celly point a doorway. \"that elevator will take us back to the lungs station, we must hurry before the train leave us!\" she giggle while Twilight rolled her eyes...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The four of you entered the elevator which took you directly to the Lung Station where the train is already waiting. Celly led you all aboard and was generous enough to add an extra seat for Princess Luna in addition to yours and Twilight's. Once everyone is seated, Celly cleared her throat made an announcement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright now, everyone. The next stop will be the Intestine,\" Celly said, \"Normally, this is where foods go through after digesting in the stomach; where nutrients from what's eaten are ultimately absorbed. For Celestia though, she can also use it to hide all sorts of miscellaneous items from prying eyes or palace officials.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It may be a little impolite of me to ask, what exactly is the Princess storing in there that requires such tremendous security?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, for starters, she has half of the gold bits of the 'Royal Equestrian Reserve' stored in there. Insurance in the event that any unforeseen catastrophe occurred. I recalled correctly, Ponyville has constantly been on the request list for the last couple of years.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, Twilight gazed around uncomfortably. The library and town has been destroyed and rebuilt countless times since she moved there.  The aforementioned destruction caused by either crazy schemes, chaotic villains, or a spell mishap. Almost a million bits in damages has been raked up. But it was the last one that culminated in her ascension to a princess. <i>Celestia got one thing right. There IS a 'price' to my princesshood and it will bite into my monthly allowance soon.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight refocused her attention on Celly who was still talking the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...most of the palace's treasure are also locked in the intestines away from prospective robbers. Who would have thought of that? A portable and highly inconspicuous location to stash the nation's money. Heh heh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Let me get this straight. Does that mean that we've probably handled money that has gone a 'full trip' through Celestia?!,\" your eyes widened, \"Sorry Celly, but that has some rather unappealing implications.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no,\" Celly laughed, \"Celestia wouldn't engage in such abhorrent jokes on her ponies. The storage sections are made of solid materials away from the fleshy portion of the intestines and she now uses magic to teleport them in and out of her body. Don't make any wild conjectures about the Princess next time. You just might get it right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of silence, the train pulled into the Intestine station and screeched to a halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh lookie, we're here already!\" Celly exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intestine is a hybrid between flesh and the marble interior of the palace; While the floor is set in stones, walls and ceiling retain their organic characteristics. Along the tube-like main corridor, you see multiple doors on either side. A quick peek into one of them revealed large safe-like structure with several layers of protection spells placed on it. You can make out the crates of coins that are stacked neatly in the room. Several identical rooms are found as you proceed down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou curiously looked into another room that is refrigerated and found a large assortment of multilayer cakes laid out on a long table. Virtually all flavors is present and labeled. According to Celly, the Princess is a big fan of cakes and would indulge on several in a sitting much to the dismay of her doctors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A question I've been meaning to ask: Where did Celestia learned to create all of this in the first place?\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a filly two millennia ago, Celestia discovered this strange spell book in her parent's library detailing how to modify the body to house a pony or human in it. Though forbidden to enter, her curiosity still got the better of her. She read that book everyday for months and tried mastering them behind out parent's back. It gradually dawned on me that she possessed this fascination with inner body mechanism; a fantasy, to simply put, of living inside a being. When Celestia decided that she's experienced enough to handle the spell, she unfortunately chose me to be the explorer of her body. But the worst part is, she didn't successfully alter her body and had me trapped in there for a day. I endured all the bodily process mentionable. It was only after my sister got an earful from our mother when she learned about it that I'm finally freed. Now, I'm still waiting for the right time to get back to her on that one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I didn't do that on purpose, Lulu! I wanted to experiment with this newfound spell. Didn't you also botched up spell before?\" Celly defended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, sister. Nothing I've done could compared to that. It was a far worse experience than being on the moon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. I guess you wouldn't mind me showing all those kinky stuffs I confiscated from you to the group, right? I still got them stored here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Moon Princess turned red at the jab. \"You. wouldn't. DARE?\" she spat.</span></div></div>",

Celly use her magic to open said door but she was interrupted by you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute? the Rebelloius type? I'm sorry but I find it hard to believe that Princess Celestia, the most regal pony of Equestria could have been the Rebel of the family.\" You ask, Celly smirked and decided to humor him, she use her magic to change her actual appareance, her pink mane and tail become a rainbow of darker colors (Purple, Dark Green and Dark Pink), her golden jewelry become black and more gothic looking, her sun cutie mark has a pony skull in the center, there was a peircing in her tongue and snout, and her coat is a little darker. you and twilight are shocked from this transformation, Luna however, raised an eyebrown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forgot the cat-like eyes\" This statement made you two eyes widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" with another flash of magic from her horn, she made eyes similar to a cat or dragon. \"Now?\" Luna nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Celly? this was-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Celestia teenagers years, She was always the rebel while luna the peacekeeper, these years were the golden years of Celestia. Breaking rules, Prankin nobles, Night Parties, she even abused the Time Travel spells to go night clubs of this time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait this time? like now?\" You ask. for a moment you heard Twilight's Celestia Admiration breaking like glass <i>I can't believe it, my mentor and second mother figure was a Punk in her young... she was worse than Rainbow! </i> she shook her head, while she still admire her and love her like a second mother she couldn't see her in the same way again. You in the other hand, was still shocked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, these years were the No-Rules years until our parents blackmail her with cake.\" She looked down with a sad expression in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least they made the right thing in reforming you.\" commented luna, hoping that they would ignore her stuff's room but when Celly transformed back to her cute persona, there was a smile but no a cute smile but an \"I didn't forget it\" smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Lulu's stuff are right here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO, please stop sister!\" Luna pleaded but the door's open revealing a series of boxes with Lunas' Cutie Mark in it, beneath it there the type of stuff in it, embarrasing photos, sex toys, plans for a amusement park... on the moon, a pirate disguise with all and wooded sword, Love letters and a book, basically this was no a storage room but a a living room, you could see a bed in there. the room itself got a organic look like the rest of intestine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, what can be this embarrassing that can break the princess of night?\" you said while you grab the pink book open a random page and star to read it loudy. \"Dear Diary, today I find a cute looking-\" suddenly the book shut by a scared looking blue avatar alicorn's magic. then she narrow her eyes on you. \"You didn't see anything.\" she said in a stern tone. You nodded fearfully, no wanting the wrath of the night princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Lulu. there is nothing to be embarrased of... look at this\" she brought a Huge blue dildo, said dildo have \"Moon Breaker\"' engraved in it \"so this was your coltfriend? well it make sense since you alway said that he was big and strong...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TIA!!\" A red faced alicorn shouted celestia's nickname.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... what is this buttom?\" she pressed and dildo start to vibrated, she giggle perversely<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear that... that\" Luna think in something to counter her sister's boldness, \"'That' what? I have no secrets\" said Celly, until Luna finally found something<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Birthday Party #1353.\" suddenly Celly eyes widen, the vibrato fall from her hooves. \"Y-you can't be serious! You can't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will spread it to all Equestria the same photo of that party you burned from the album long ago\" by instict, Celly become Celestia (again) and start glaring daggers at her sister while luna smile triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will stop if you give that photo to me\" she said calmy but if you could notice the edge of her voice like fearing that she have been discovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it if you teleport this stuff to my room\" Luna said in a business tone, Celestia nodded and teleported everything of her intestine's room to Luna's Room in normal sized, Luna made appear a photo you two couldn't see it well but celestia' frowned then she burn the photo with her magix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it, my own sister blackmailling me\" Said Celestia in a defeated tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush now Sister, you always blackmailled with this stuff, I got my little sweet revenge now\" she said smugly, the Sun Regent's pout in a childrish manner while returning to Celly's form again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not fun!\" said Celestia-turned Celly while addresing the you two returning to her happy self \"Good! we going to the Spleen!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hay just happend?\" Said Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea...\" You said as you four return back to the train..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nothing eventful happened on the short trip to the spleen. All that can be heard is the humming of the train. Celly and Luna are seated far apart from one another, obviously still reeling in from their exchange moments ago. The sisters pretend to look away from each other while stealing the occasional glance when the other isn't watching. From the looks of their faces, there are signs that they are planning their next moves on how to one-up the other. You are amused by the sight; it's just rare to see Celestia and Luna being so petulant. But you got to admit that they look adorable acting like that. Hopefully this won't end with them sending one another to their respective celestial bodies. You look back at Twilight sitting next to you. You noticed her in deep thoughts with a somber look. Whatever is lingering on Twilight's mind is troubling her. But you can't tell what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight, are you okay? Something seems to be bothering you since you talked to Celestia at the Liver Mall,\" you asked concernedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple alicorn popped out of her thought and looked at you puzzlingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"uh...It's nothing important. Just a daily briefing of the usual politics and diplomacy stuff,\" Twilight lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...it must've been a real headache to follow all of those. I mean, Blueblood is already a pain in the flank; I can hardly imagine how you felt dealing with many more of those ponies everyday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. I'm pretty used to those now. But diplomacy is an entirely different story. As a newly minted princess, I have to attend every meeting alongside with the Princess to learn about the inner workings of politics. So far, you got officials from other countries who followed ancient protocols dating before Princess Celestia and others who seek to take advantage of Equestria's economic dominance by giving us the short end of the stick. Really stressful when you think about it,\" Twilight commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is Celestia planning anything important lately?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that she told me about. From what I heard, there's gonna be some economic summit between the dragons and griffons real soon. But I'm fuzzy on the details,\" the purple princess answered with a half-truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can ask another question, the train came to a halt as it slides into the Spleen Station. Celly was the first to stand up and take you all out onto the platform where she gave a description of the spleen..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the Spleen. This area is charged with monitoring the Princess's body for any anomalies and automatically eliminate any potential threats both magical and chemical-based,\" Celly said, \"You can say that this is the security system of the body, responsible for filtering blood for contaminants, detecting unfriendly spells, and tracking the prisoners held at the Heart Prison. If you all will come this way, you can get better idea of what I'm talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went with the group through a metallic doorway and into a large room equipped with several apparatus. One of them has a wall-sized display showing numbers and equations that you don't understand. The white letters flickered and rolled about around a map of Celestia, indicating unknown values for each body part. You tried to decipher the meaning behind it to no avail. The clip-clop of hoofsteps behind you indicated the arrival of a smiling Twilight, ready to flip on her 'bookworm mode' switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The equation you see on there is the 'Starswirl's Magical Constant' and the Tramareon Principle of Force. Without going into the technical detail, those are measurements of the amount of magical distortion in a given space and the 'force' which you \"push\" your magic from your body. By watching these measurements, it is possible to anticipate the type of magic that a caster is about to use against you and initiate a counterspell,\" Twilight said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded at the new information. Your eyes fell on something even more interesting. A control panel with buttons and knobs is situated on a podium in front of display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Twilight. Any idea what does that do?\" you said as you pointed toward them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. The control panel is used to control the flow of magic through the Princess's body. Depending on the circumstance, it can be adjusted to give each organ equal amount of magical energy or concentrate them into specific areas like the horn to enhance the spell capability. More interesting, it can also switch on the cameras at the Heart Prison to keep an eye on the detainees. Celestia took me several times here before during my time at magic school to teach me the principle of balancing power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why would you need that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long story short, back when I was taking the entrance exam for Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns, a series of bizarre events and an explosion caused my magic to abruptly explode out at once. In the barrage of spells I barely had control over, I turned my parents into plants and burned the mane off one of the examiners. Celestia stepped in and used her power to redistribute my magic and restored order. Afterwards, the Princess noticed my magical potential as a filly and asked if I would like to study under her. A big yes later, I began my life as the protege of the Princess of Equestria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an interesting story,\" you said as you fidgeted with the control panel, \"Any idea how you used this thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...I don't think it's good idea to...OH MY CELESTIA! What have you done?\" Twilight screeched abruptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just pressed the button marked \"Sight Share\". What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT!\" Twilight pointed to the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you turned around to view the screen, you see that it's depicting a first-person view of the Princess using her private bathroom. The sounds of something trickling sounded from the speaker. If that isn't awkward enough, her crotch and all its features are in plain sight and Celestia seems to singing a little tune to herself. The Princess even checked her Sun Cutie Marks with a wiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TURN IT OFF! TURN IT OFF!\" Twilight panicked, \"Celly's gonna murder us if she sees this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. What's the pro........,\" a familiar voice said then stopped. You turned back to find Celly turning deep crimson with eyes shrunken to a pinprick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yup, we're dead.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahahahahaha\", Luna laughed out loud as she rolled on the floor, \"Dear sister, I didn't know that you sing like that while you're using the washroom. So priceless!!! And it's clear now who's got the better flank!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelly glared menacingly between you and the howling Luna before stomping toward the control panel to switch the screen off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...think it's time we move on to our next destination, am I right?...\" she gritted her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna is still howling with laughter as tears roll down her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou will definitely love what I have in store for you at the Bladder,\" Celly grinned ominously.</span></div></div>",

Celly use her magic to lift from the catwalk, you use your own to cast an levitation spell but notice that you can't cast any magic, now you were completely scared, you grab a tube for support but her magic is too strong. You ask why she doing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my revenge for that little stunt you pulled in the Spleen!!\" you loose you support and fall in the green tank, the last thing you heard was Twilight yelling your name and Celly's insane laught...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>The End.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n... or that's what you thought as you float on surface completely intact, <i>this is acid?</i> you thought incredully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelly was rolling in the flood laughing madly while Luna bring you back to the catwalk, Luna couldn't too but giggle while twilight's eye was twiching madly. you look at celly angry but confused as well. angry because of this prank, confuse in why the acid didnt kill you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This acid is very speciffic one, it don't consume flesh but... clothes...\" Celly ended while blushing furoiusly in your naked form, you notice that too and try to cast some clothes quickly, it was useful spell for travels but unfortunaly you can't do magic something that alarmed and confused you until Twilight cast some clothes for you, you thanks to her but you see her and Celly with bright blushes while Luna's whistle and lean to the mares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He sure is big...\" she add with a chuckle making the mares even more red than before, meanwhile celestia outside chuckle at her avatar's fortune and twilight's misfortune<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should continue with Womb Tour\" Celly regaining composure this confuse you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"but what about the Kidneys?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Kidneys are the only organ that the princess hadn't changed yet except for the creation of these chemicals also, isn't recommended to go there for safetly reason.\" you nodded and follow Celly to an elevator that go to the womb, Twilight still in shock, her eyes twiching, Luna rolls her eyes and drag her with magic.</span></div></div>",

Celly led the way with you slightly behind her and Twilight and Luna some distance in the rear. In this position, you couldn't help but notice the sight of the white alicorn's swaying flank. The way they move and swing with her steps.  It's kinda hypnotic...You knew where this was heading and immediately purged the images from your conscious. And to make it all the more inappropriate, you are heading for the same location in the actual Princess. You thought about what to expect when you enter the Princess' most guarded space; untouched for centuries and too sacred to be gazed upon by ordinary ponies. <i>It will be a sight indeed. I might be the first human to lay my eyes upon her womb</i>, you thought,<i>Intriguing and frightening at the same time.</i> Nothing much happened until you felt a light prod to your side. You turned your head to find Celly looking at you with a mischievous glint in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You curious, mage?\" Celly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you bumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were staring at my flank for some times now. While I don't really mind that, I bet you're thinking about what a goddess can do,\" the alicorn cracked a cocky grin, showing her braces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no no no...\" you exclaimed as your face turned a deep red, \"I didn't mean to. You're in front of me and it's inevitable that will happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwww, don't be so coy with me,\" Celly said, her grin widening, \"I've seen those confused looks far too many times. One that wants to experience something new yet fearful and uncertain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Celly said that, you grew more nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it wasn't like that,\" you tried to argue, \"I didn't pay attention to where I was looking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celestia wouldn't mind if you're interested in her. In fact, she'll find it quite nice. You have some good tastes, mage,\" Celly giggled as she took in your shocked expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how to feel about this. Sounds wrong on so many levels,\" you lowered your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay for a pony or human to have a crush on Celestia. Otherwise, how did she get all those suitors who came from all across Equestria. Unicorns, Pegasus, earth ponies, and even a few brave humans,\" Celly said as she craned her neck over and gave a light peck on your cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha....Celly?! What in the hay was that about?\" you exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take that as an apology for the prank I pulled at the bladder,\" Celly grinned as she continued forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at Celly with a dozen of questions running through your head. <i>Alright, the Princess just kissed me or more accurately, with her avatar. What is going on with her? I thought Celestia would be a little more discreet with her intentions...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh heh. Princess...Celestia... Just... Kissed... The mage. My teacher and second mom....,\" you heard a manic voice laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned your head and saw two alicorns with very different expressions. Twilight Sparkle was shell shocked from Celly's action, taking further toll on her already fragile psyche. Her twitching eyes and crooked smile being the dead giveaway. She dragged her hooves as her heads tilted side to side with a wide unnatural smile on her muzzle. Her mind is still processing all the new things she learned about her mentor so far. Princess Luna was blushing and whispering things to herself. No doubts about her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is just getting crazy. I have a foreboding feeling about this.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all arrived at the womb minutes later. The first thing you noticed is the immense size of the chamber. Tub-like tanks are arranged in neat rows. They look large enough to hold and completely submerge a stallion with more rooms to spare. The tubs are made from a translucent material that feel rubbery. You counted at least 100 of them in this chamber The high ceiling is filled with a wide assortment of wires and pipes the pumps liquids into the tubs. Other than that, there is a peculiar smell lingering in here. You couldn't describe it but it's weirdly alluring. Luna and Twilight also seemed to noticed it. You decided to ignore it for the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the Healing Center,\" Celly announced, \"The uterus is used as a hospital-like facility to care for the ponies that are severely injured. During times of war in the past, the Princess will use her spell to take in all the soldiers or civilians she could save and put them in these tanks where they healed over a period of a week. The ponies in the tubs are submerged in a medical liquid with oxygen provided by a tube and foods fed through another attached to their belly buttons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basically these tubs are miniature placentas, right?\" you mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct, mage,\" Celly said, \"Ponies who been here are considered to be reborn by the Princess, the greatest honor that's receivable in a war.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of that, how long before we get to see your ovaries, sister?\" Luna joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will get there shortly, Luna,\" Celly said awkwardly, \"Come along, I have a lot to show you.\"</span></div></div>",

What is this?\" you ask confused with a hint of fear and unsecurity, soon you heard magic being used then you clothes disappeared, leaving you completely naked, you see celly transform back into Celestia, her eyes have look of lust in them and sultry smile appear in her muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now the next part is my favorite... \"extracting\" genetic material\" she said with lust in her voice, she come close to you like a predator nearing its prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-princess!?\" you are now terrified but excited down there, as she pounce at you. promising a good time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of the room, sounds of pleasure and delighful moaning can be heard, Twiliht stare in debelief at luna who laught nervously while containing her blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said that she prefer to do it in her room with sound-proof spell! they are DO IT right now and WITHOUT IT!!\" she almost shouted her eyes twiching and her mane unkempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well, In my defence, He's no rutting my sister but an avatar of her, basically is like masturbating using a magical construct\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH YES, RIGHT THERE!\" they both hear the voice of celestia shouting in delight, much to twilight's dismay and Luna's vivid imagination.

That was the best thing ever!\" said Celestia turned back into Celly, with a very satisfied smile in her face. \"look in the screen, you will see why I... had my way with you.\" She said smirking while winking at you, you blush more at the memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna and You notice that the screen was now active showing  your ADN and your millions of sperm cells in the screen being absorbed by spherical \"eggs\", you ask what is happening, she smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just extrated your genetic material and \"deposite\" it in the processing tube, your genetic material in now stored here for the final step, consider it a great honor mage because of you my project is complete!\" she said cheerfully while bouncing around like a certain pink mare<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are going to the Right Ovary where my project, a very careful modified egg is store there, ready for the next estrus to happen, you see as I said before this Project is called \"Alicorn Heir\" for many years I had many suitors, but I never gave birth a foal because of fear that my child might turn out like blueblood and second, ponies become alicorns in ceremonies and magical rituals but there aren't records of Alicorn conception and birth that's why I began this secret project... and you mage showed me something and I wanted to do this with you, I don't know maybe we can repeat this... outside, in my room, during my estrus week\" she wink at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Talking about Estrus, y-you never explained it\" you said shyly, still blushing strongly, Celly chuckled as luna giggled with a faint hue in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will talk about it during our trek to the ovary laboratory a warning, don't stay near the egg I will explain why and Luna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sister?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, wake twilight, I need her for this.\" she said as Luna Rolled her eyes and lift the unconscious alicorn with her magic and returning to the tram.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside in the throne room in canterlot's palace, Celestia is in court recieving many nobles and other citizens requesting, complaining and such, it was tiring and stressful but she manage to put a good mask of calmess, she sigh, she recieved the memories of her avatar, she blush a little but smiled that everything is going acording to the project's plan, however a unicorn guard messenger appears, bearing alarming news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess, Princess message from the Gryphon King!\" say the stallion, she raise a eyebrown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"a messange? what it say?\" she ask as the stallion bring the scroll to her, she reads and her eyes widen in suprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh no, the meeting is in three days?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Right ovary is just across from the left, linked together with the Fallopian tube. You walked behind Celly as she leads the way. Nearby, Luna carried the out cold Twilight on her back while blushing intensely. After what happened in the extraction chamber, you still felt a little queasy from the intense action of Princess Celestia. The method she used was questionable and just unconventional. But maybe your sample is exactly what she needs to create the perfect alicorn foal and you're happy that you helped her fulfill this project. If she ever gets pregnant, you wondered if Celestia give birth to a princess or a prince. The addition of an 'actual' prince to the Royal Family sounds lovely and a change from the four Princesses that Equestria has gotten so accustomed to. Unlike Blueblood, he'll be a caring and selfless pony. Speaking of Blueblood,  you smiled as you imagined him locked within a padded cell in the Heart Prison while pleading and crying for Celestia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter going through a slimy passageway, the group arrived at the entrance to the ovary. You saw Celly insert her horn into a panel beside the door and entered a combination on the keypad. The translucent door whirred and opened, welcoming all to look at its content. The interior of the right ovary contained even more equipments. You saw large machines lined with buttons and levers. A few had monitors that displayed technical details beyond your understanding. A long table is covered with thick stacks of blueprints and diagrams with several microscopes lying about. The centerpiece of the chamber is a large sphere with a hue of color not unlike Celestia's mane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before your eyes is the most precious thing in Celestia's possession: a specialized egg that awaits fertilization into the next alicorn to take the throne,\" Celly jumped excitedly, \"This egg has all the positive traits of the Princess imprinted in its gene and imbued daily with magic to strengthen it. The idea for an heir came about after the Princess had a particularly bad meeting with some awful nobles who also happened to be Prince Blueblood's ancestors. She saw no saving grace in those ponies who might one day take the reins of the kingdom and use those powers to benefit themselves without putting the wellbeing of others into the picture. Thus Project Alicorn Heir was born. It has been ongoing for almost 600 years thanks to all the \"volunteers\" she received.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Volunteers?\" you tilted your head inquisitively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What she meant was her male harem during her estrus period. She's got thousands of them,\" Luna whispered while blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...and what is this estrus I keep hearing about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you ask that, mage,\" Celly beamed, \"The estrus cycle is a period during the year when mares emits pheromones from their privates and are extra receptive to stallions. Also colloquially known as \"heat\", the mare in heat will constantly think about mating a stallion to produce a foal. If a nearby male picks up the mare's scent, he will know that the mare is searching for a mate. He can either respond to this call or ignore it. If the pheromones are intense enough, it may cause the mind of a sound stallion to go into 'rutting mode' and make him go on an uncontrolled mating binge. Sometimes, a mare will find several stallions at once to 'help' them with their heats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's exactly what you did, sister?\" Luna exclaimed as she points a hoof at Celly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Celestia recruited the entire Royal Guard to help with it. Virtually all guards for the last 500 years had done it at least once. Even Star Swirl the Bearded had his sample taken. Occasionally, some stallions from around Equestria will offer themselves for their Princess. And because of that I have in here a massive database of all of them including their samples.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelly went over to a computer and conjured up a huge screen displaying pictures of all the stallions she extracted from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"uhhhh...,\" Twilight groaned, \"What database?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you looked at the purple alicorn still perched on the Moon Princess' back with horror as she shifted her eyes to the display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh\" you all said together.<i></i></span></div></div>",

You're completely flabbergasted by the offer. It's an unprecedented offer but it sounds so wrong at the same time. Mares usually only showed their crotches to their foals or their partners for whatever kinky reasons they might have. Though human norms may have affected your perception of pony culture, to hear Princess Celestia herself so casually allowing a human to her most private part is totally unexpected. The princesses all stared at your nervous form, stifling laughter a among themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha... You should see the look on your face right now. It's priceless I tell you. It's as if you've seen my sister shaking her big plot for the first time,\" Princess Luna smirked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Night Princess's remark earned her a deadly glare from her big sister which caused the blue alicorn to shudder and stay silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, mage. There's nothing to be afraid about,\" Twilight giggled, \"The teats will be fun, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nCelestia led the group once again. It took her less than 5 minutes before you all entered a large chamber with two circular lakes next to each other. Gleaming white milk filled both lakes to the brim while a large waterfall cascade down from an opening in the ceiling. A sweet scent permeated the air and filled your lungs with its alluring aroma. The teat is smaller than the womb although its still immense. The place is decorated like a resort complete with a large white and gold building and several swimming pools around the edge of the milk lake. There are also hoofball courses and volleyball nets at the far side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot of the Royal White Cells you encountered  early in Celestia's body are playing, swimming, and lounging on chairs. The Sun Princess explained that these body cells are off duty and given several days off for their hard work protecting her body. Upon seeing Celestia walking their way, the royal white cells all bowed in reverence of her. Without their armors,  they look similar to Celly, the avatar, except for their aurora colored mane. You swore that a few of them eyed you lovingly and winked at you. You ignored them and continued with the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia led the group to a bar beside the milk lake and sat down. The bar is a small wooden canopy with stools along a white marble counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, the memories. This place hasn't changed at all since I last came here as a filly. Celestia always took me here on weekends when I did a good job in class. I still remembered the taste of Celestia's milky sundaes and banana boats. They were one of the greatest treats I had in my life.  The warm milk here always reminds me of my foalhood,\" Twilight reminisces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA female server came and handed out menus for the four of you to look at. You scanned the menu and settled for a milk smoothie. Twilight and Luna chose the sundae while Celestia herself ordered plain milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the waiter returned and served all of your respective orders. Twilight and Luna began eating their sundaes right away. Princess Celestia enjoyed a glass of her own milk with a contented smile plastered on her face. You looked at the tall glass of milk smoothie in front of you and felt wary as you eyes the frothy foam at the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong, mage?\" Twilight asked. Her muzzle is coated with a ring of melted ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does the milk taste good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good? It's absolutely wonderful! The taste is better than any milk I've drank. Come on, give it a try,\" Luna encourages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes fell back on the smoothie and remained there. You gathered your courage and took a little sip through the straw. What you tasted was unbelievable. An explosive sweet taste filled your mouth and teased your tongue. There are hints of hays and daffodils in the milk it they served to counterbalance the initial sweetness. In short, it was awesome! You quickly finished the smoothie and looked at the other princesses and saw that they have also finished their food. Celestia was the first to stand up and waited for the rest to do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I hope you all enjoyed your stay in my body. But sadly, our little stay in here will have to be cut short,\" Celestia said, \"I have an important announcement to make and it will concern all of you, especially the mage. A dramatic political event is unfolding as we speak. Could you all please follow me to the meeting room at the resort building? There is a lot I need to explain.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And how is it gonna benefit us in the short run?</i> Ever since Celestia told her about the imminent conflict between griffins and dragons, Twilight had been confused about her actions. It was as if her teacher was refraining from telling her the whole problem and leaving her out of the equation. Problem solving was one of Twilight's best abilities, an advantage that she could've used as a leverage for the Princess. Twilight was about to protest the Princess' decision when her eyes fall on her face. The sun goddess seemed to take notice of her protege's uncertain expression and craned her face closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There isn't much time left, my faithful student,\" the alicorn said urgently, \"The Gryphon King and the Dragons are waiting. Any further delays will spell war between them. I regret that things have to come down to this. Just trust me Twilight. Open your mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Princess, I don't really don't understand the point of\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was suddenly silenced as Celestia closed her mouth on her own and began kissing her passionately. The action came as a complete surprise for the purple pony. Twilight knew that Celestia love her as if she's her daughter. The two had many happy times together from her fillyhood to the day she was sent to Ponyville. But kissing out of the blue is not something that she would expect the Princess to do. Twilight tried to speak but was quickly subdued by Princess Celestia's large tongue as it finds its way into her orifice. With another powerful thrust from the Princess, she felt something being shoved down her throat. Twilight swallowed the object out of reflex before realizing that Celestia is transferring the human to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if caught by a sudden spell, Twilight kissed back in a way she'd never imagined she would do. <i>Oh my goodness, I'm kissing the Princess. I can believe this is happening. So strange yet soothing at the same time.</i> All her thought began to melt away as she extended her tongue into the Princess. The temperature of her body started rising and her breathing accelerates. Celestia noticed this change and smiled as she took a more assertive position on the floor. She stroke Twilight gently behind her head and they looked at each other in the eye. Twilight saw love and care within Celestia's violet eyes. Those pools are filled with so much mysteries and wisdom that few could read yet the Princess' intention was clear at this moment. It was the moment she had been waiting for.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes of caressing and kissing later, Celestia and Twilight broke their contact. The Princess panted a little for the intensity of the kissing. The purple pony wasn't any better; she was sitting on the floor with a messy mane and blushing face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was...\" Twilight tried to say, \"A sorta good sensation I was feeling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need for the compliments. The endless torrents of suitors has allowed me to understand the different \"techniques\" in the last millennia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Twilight said unsure whether to compliment that feat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight Sparkle, I am counting on you to look after the human while I'm away. I hope you can do it to the best of your ability. You two had a lot of fun in me. I'm sure that it will be even better now you two are closer together,\" Celestia said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess?!\" Twilight exclaimed while blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha. Just have you two. I shall be departing in the afternoon for the Gryphon Kingdom. I'll see what I can do about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Princess Celestia left the bedroom and went for the throne room.</span></div></div>",

Sunlight sifted through the window beside her comfortable bed and warmed her lavender coat. She was back in her library in Ponyville. When she got back home after a 3-hour train ride last night, she was bombarded with questions from her assistant dragon, Spike. She like how  he was always concerned for her well-being. Ever since she hatched him at the test, Spike considered her a surrogate big sister and the two bonded strongly together. Twilight didn't want him to be too concerned about her and told him that it was simply royal business, nothing much to worry about. The princess was still wary about telling her friends about the mage living inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No way to know how my friends would react. I don't want them jumping to conclusions like so many previous times. What if they think that he was a danger to me? Or think that I snapped again? Okay Twilight. There's no need to get worked up over this... Keeping his existence a secret will be the best way for now. </i> Twilight thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hoof, Twilight was also worried about how her mentor is faring so far. Princess Celestia is heading into an imminent conflict where both parties aren't too friendly with ponies. If things take a turn for the worse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight shook the thoughts out of head and helped herself out of the plush bed and headed down into the first floor of the library. I have to trust the Princess on this one. She knows what she's doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spike, could you get me to get some breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right on, Twilight.\"<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were awakened by the constant shaking of the bedroom. The shaking was intense enough for your body to be bouncing on the mattress. The sound of hoofsteps faintly echoed through the layers of organs and innards. Twilight is already up and going about her day. She's humming a little tune that you made out to be snippets from songs popular in Ponyville. Her voice is as sweet and lovely as Celestia's. you quietly listened to her songs as you tried to get a few extra minutes of sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to get up. The sun is up and shining!\" Twilight said melodiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your eyes and sat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm up, okay?\" you groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you sleep well, mage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure did. I would say that your bed is as comfy as the one in Celestia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just some basic magic spells, nothing too special. Say, you wanna get some breakfast? Spike makes the most awesome oats and fried eggs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's Spike?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's my assistant. You'll meet him shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To say that Twilight's brain is vast would be a serious understatement. Predictably, it took the form of a large library. <i>Twilight's nickname as the egghead princess isn't without reasons</i>, you thought. If it weren't for the sign at the entrance marking it as the brain, you might have thought that you've stumbled upon some long lost archives in the basement of Canterlot Castle. You couldn't help but wonder how a pony, or in this case, a princess could dedicate themselves completely to organizing their brains into the firm of a library. The stadium-sized chamber has a huge dome shaped ceiling that depicts the constellations of the Equestrian sky. There are about five floors filled with tall bookshelves made of translucent bone cartilages. Upon them are tons of books neatly arranges based on sizes, colors, old/ new, and importance. Veins and wires are connected to the shelves, possibly to transfer information around. Signs at the end of each shelf are labelled with numbers and categories. As you made your way around, you looked at the contents available:<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n<b>0001-0500</b>: Fillyhood Memories<br>\r\n<b>0501-0800</b>: Adventures with My Friends<br>\r\n<b>0801-1100</b>: Princess Celestia's Lessons<br>\r\n<b>1101-1500</b>: Chemistry and Science<br>\r\n<b>1501-1900</b>: Equestrian History<br>\r\n<b>1901-2100</b>: Awkward Moments of My Life<br>\r\n<b>2101-2500</b>: Royal Etiquettes and Protocols<br>\r\n<b>2501-3000</b>: Humans and Their Customs<br>\r\n<b>3001-3400</b>: My Personal Thoughts<br>\r\n<b>3401-3800</b>: An Analysis of Pinkie Pie and Her Antics<br>\r\n<b>3801-4000</b>: The Mage<br>\r\n<b>4001-4500</b>: Restricted Materials (no colts/fillies allowed)<br>\r\n<b>4501-5000</b>: Classified: Equestrian Government NOFORN<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are amazed by the sheer number of choices available here and you only visited the first and second floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stunning, isn't it?\" Twilight's voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whirled around and found yourself face-to-face with the purple alicorn, or a representation of her. She's wearing a blue shirt with a magenta bowtie and a pair of red glasses. Twilight looks adorable in this stereotypical librarian attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm amazed! How did you manage to study all these stuffs, princess? And why is there a section dedicated to my information?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just years of organizing all the tidbits of info flying around in my head and a little of memorizing books I have in Golden Oaks Library down pat. As for your library section, I must say that I'm really interested in knowing more about you. So I've been making some notes since I met you in Princess Celestia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't mind you doing research about me but you should ask for my consent the next time around. I'd really appreciate it if someone wants to experiment with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I'll make sure I inform you next time,\" Twilight offered with an adorkable smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are we supposed to do here,\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just follow me,\" the alicorn replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked behind Twilight as she led you to the atrium in the center. Oak desks and purple chairs emblazoned with her cutie marks circled a large marble statue of Princess Celestia on a pedestal. Around the pedestal are relief images of Twilight and her friends defeating various evils. You recognized Nightmare Moon, Discord, Queen Chrysalis, King Sombra and Tirek in the artwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just a little way for me to memorialize the Princess and the adventures with my friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to hear that,\" you commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, mage, the reason I get you here is for me to teach some history lessons. Since you were literally dragged into this, I think I need to give you some crash courses on the history of pony-dragon-griffon relations. It's gonna be so great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh no...</i>, you thought, <i>She's going bookworm mode again.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpurple\"><i>Why the long face? And do you have something against bookworms? Sheesh, you are just as impatient as Rainbow Dash, ya know. You just don't understand. Learning can be so awesome. Plus, I might even let you access the \"Restricted Materials\" section if you behave. And yes, I can telepathize my thoughts to you and vice versa. You're engulfed in my magic after all.</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh buck.\" </span></div></div>",

Next Pony-Dragon Relationship; as we all know, Dragons are a enigma, no much is know about them except to have a warrior culture with an strict code of honor, they are divided by multiples clans, some divided by their scale color, however but once 200 years they select a warchief to lead them all, it's chosen if one of the clan's leaders survive in a battle to death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... bloody, I mean, I never thought that the dragons were so fixed in war\" you say with dismay, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No at all, some dragons have great wealth of knowledge, like the Golden Dragonflight and the Blue Dragonflight are the master of magic in the Dragon Nations, some members of them live in Equestria only to share their knowledge to ponies and humans they prefer to talk rather than fighting, their cousins of SkyLancers are the most faster dragons in their species but the most violent as well, their rivals are the Cooper Dragons of MetalHorns that are constantly fighting for that position, the original Red Scale clan are divided between the warmorgen Warpaths Clan and the peaceful Life Binders, all of them are Red Dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPony-Dragon relations are neutral but we are allies with some different clans, like the Golden and Blue Dragonflight, and in contact with the Silver Drakes and the Cold Storm; an multi-colored dragon clan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why no all? to be allied with the entire nations and no fractions?\" you ask for curiosity, suddenly Twilight make appear a cup of tea, you were somewhat thirsty, you gladly accept the cup and start sip it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because no all the dragons clans are friendly to ponies or anyone, sometime even other dragons.\" She made another cup of tea for herself. and continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor nearly three hours, THREE hours, she lecture you about most of relevant history about the Three nations, of course, human species are mostly consider part of Equestria due to the destruction of the kingdom by nightmare moon's rampage. what you found this fascinating was twilight telling it with enthusiasm, she look so cute... you shake your head a little without her notice then you almost facepalmed, remember it that she can sense your thoughs but seemed that she didn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPony-gryphon-dragon relantioship is odd and kind of fragile, specially Dragon-Gryphon is being jeopardize by a warmorgen of warchief...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nsomewhere in a private island far away from manehatten, a certain alabaste alicorn princess was sunbathing while enjoying her fruit juice, this was quite elaborate plan from her part, since the mage saw twilight she notice how he looks her with lovestuck eyes, this was also good for her, Twilight really need company of somepony or someone of the opposite sex, of course she don't have problem with gay couples but she know that twilight need seriously that company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why I'm no Amused.\" a voice lightly startled her, looking back she was seeing her sister, Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh lulu... why I have the feeling that this is just a casual visit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it isn't. dear sister, you know that she will notice you little deception sooner or later, and if she doesn't, he will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lulu, you need to remember that my studient is also a mare, you saw her starting to fall for him and vice versa. A little more time alone and she would fall in love with a book! isn't sane, she need to love but no from family or friends but actual love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're starting to sound like our niece.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Lulu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But is really necesary to include Twilight's assistant?\" Luna made appear a letter of celestia that has writen instructions for Spike, letting him know about Twilight's little guess inside of her and a false Newspaper to continue with her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, everything will be alright, when twilight notice, they'll already immersed in love each other-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You love him too.\" The sudden statement from the Lunar princess made celestia to shut up, but then she smiled at her, she return to her sunbathing, clearly amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like him, yes I admit that... I felt like talking to an equal rather than being worshiped like an omnipotent goddess.\" she said in a dreamly tone this caught her sister attention, is rare to celestia to admit love or liking toward a certain individual, after all alicorns tend to live forever, their chosen too, when they drink blood from a royal alicorn there is a posiblity that said chosen become an immortal but is rare to happen, is possibly that her sister is <i>hoping</i> for that option but she willingly to let a potential lover to Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... How he was?\" She asked, adding messange in that statement, Celestia know it too well as she chuckled, telling her how you were with your time with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneezed, someone must be talking about you but you shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... and that's how the Treaty of Averius was firmed it cemented a long lasting peace between our three nations until now, any question?\" finally Twilight ended, Three hours of history lesson, you shook your head, understood anything she said but no all, there is no way you could have understood all of it but that's something, you see twilight looking you with an smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excelent! since you behaved enough, follow me to the restricted materials, please, I think you will like it.\" You notice her voice changed to a very... sensual one, this was a sudden change of aspect, as you follow twilight wondering the change of personality when suddenly, few images flash in your head, from Twilight's perspective she was seeing the plot of a cyan pegasus with rainbow mane and tail, caughing a glitse of her privates, the other image she was licking a orange mare her... you shake your head of these images, Twilight said that you and her now share a bond due to her magic, is she trying to fill your head with demostrations?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is Twilight doing?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Twilight?! \" you blushed deeply, \"What are you doing? Get those images out of my mind!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heehaha,\" Twilight giggled, \"That's just the preview of what's coming up, mage. My friends have a lot of things they prefer remain in their bedrooms. Just enjoy the stuffs I have, will you? Sooner or later, you'll have to learn a thing or two about pony anatomy and our little kinks. It'll greatly help you in the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight said her last sentence with a quasi-seductive tone to it which made you blush deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Real subtle, Twilight, real subtle,\" you commented sarcastically, \"Showing me \"details\" of other ponies. Are you trying to get me into a relationship with one of your friends? Lemme guess, you got the idea from a dating book.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Twilight exclaimed playfully, \"Even though everyone considered me a bookworm, I don't blindly obey everything a book says. That's a serious misconception I want to clear up soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why clear up that misunderstanding? I think it's a cute idea of you! An adorkable princess is something Equestria seriously needs.\" you grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have heard enough of those comments from my parents, brother, Celestia, Luna, and Cadence. I don't wanna add a human mage to that list. It's getting really annoying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See. Everypony concurred with my observation. You're cute when you do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rrrrrr.......I'll just pretend I didn't hear that lest you want ,\" Twilight gritted her teeth adorably, \"This way to the \"Restricted Materials\" if you please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I feeling that whatever you're showing will be particularly intense?\" you asked absentmindedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes it will be intense, mage. And you'll find out soon enough!\" Twilight said with a slighting jarring smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're taken aback by Twilight's expression and starting regret accepting her offer to show you her restricted materials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter filing past several bookcases, the purple alicorn stopped at a door made from membranes. \"Restricted Materials\" is labeled in large, bold letters on it. A hole in the door indicates a horn identification system is in place; those are some of the safest forms of security made for ponies. Twilight conjured her magic, inserted her horn into the said hole, and tweaked a few spells, allowing you to enter the forbidden zone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe restricted zone looks vastly different; it's a separate chamber in itself. Ambient lights dimly lit the carpeted floor with a few spotlights shining on the bookshelves. The shelves in the room is arranged in a circular form like the main library but on a much smaller scale. To your surprise and amusement, you also find several small reading rooms with a little bed and a nightstand where a visitor could enjoy the materials with more privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like it?\" Twilight grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...yeah. It's nice and all but I don't know where I should start, frankly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just pick whatever you want. You won't be disappointed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached a shelf and random pulled out a book titled \"The Princess' Catalog of Single Ponies\". The title sounds like an interesting one to start with. You cracked open the book and began reading it. It's content is presented in a first pony view. You can see Twilight's muzzle and part of her mane  in many of the photos. The subjects are mostly ponies of both genders from around the Ponyville area, though there are <br>\r\nalso a few Canterlot nobles included. Captions on the photos identified the subjects with a list detailing their stamina, strengths and weaknesses, technique ratings, and Twilight's commentary. Several ponies got marked 'Practice needed' or 'Satisfactory' while others were labeled 'Recommended' and \"Princess' Choice'. A few unlucky ponies were placed on a \"Only Suitable as Friend\" list, probably due to their personal beliefs or lack of experience. You browsed a few more pages of the book before returning it to the shelf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next book you picked is titled \"The Friendship Collection\". In this book, you find Twilight's friends engaging in pleasurable activities. Most of the acts are too intense for your is describe properly. A few mentionable examples include Applejack stuffing apples into her privates, Pinkie Pie posing seductively with balloons and streamers, Rainbow Dash having it her way with several Wonderbolts, Rarity indulging ecstatically on a diamond-encrusted 'toy', and Fluttershy asserting herself over a dragon several hundred times her size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...Did these actually happened or did you create these photos based on your imaginations?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a little of both...but I'm not at liberty to discuss the details. I Pinkie Promised my friends and breaking that promise will have dire consequences,\" Twilight said with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou randomly drew another book from the shelf as Twilight's face turned deep red at your choice. On the front cover, Shining Armor is depicted in full uniform pointing his \"gun\" toward you. The book was titled \"The Strange Case of  My Brother\". You cracked open the cartilage book to view closeup photos of the white stallion doing lewd things with a pink alicorn you recognized as Princess Cadence. Several other pictures showed him using his magic to 'relief' several of the guards from his brigade while they're off duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, these are intense stuffs, Twilight! Do you mind if I check some of these books out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not!  I read these stuffs whenever I'm bored or in need of releasing some stress,\" Twilight beamed, \"You can borrow them whenever you want. I'm a walking library after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Twi. I'd like to check out \"The Friendship Collection\" and \"The Strange case of My Brother\".\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely. I'll get the books ready for you,\" she said as she went for the shelves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched in amusement as Twilight shook  her tail side by side when she retrieved the books you went and returned to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, mage. Be sure to return them in 6 days or else I'm imposing a \"late fee,\" the alicorn remarked playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll remember that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer purple eyes shimmered brightly and her muzzle smiled in the most adorable way possible.</span></div></div>",

He was so bored that even going in and out of tartarus sound like a good idea, he missed his day of chaos god when was only... well chaos, outside down buildings, savory clouds, chocolate rains, inverting Ponies' Psyche and personality. it was good ol' days, altering the very nature and reality. it was fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nbut also there were boring days too, during his reign, he made up the changelings because he was supremelly bored, true, he cursed some ponies to live like insects and feed on emotions but hey! it was the fun part<br>\r\n<br>\r\nsomething that no longer he find funny. He sighed. he needed something new and.. refreshing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe already done anything, from altering reality, law of nature, controling ponie--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I never controlled ponies before...\" he pondered in that one, he never has outright controlled ponies, just altering them was the most close method he used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe allowed himself to smile machiavellically, maybe no controlling them with mind control spell but directly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So much fun can come out of it\" he said to himself but the question now was \"who\" will be his victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy? No never. he could never hurt her or control her. Rarity, nah, too fancy. Rainbow Dash? nah bad idea. Applejack, her will is too strong, So nah, Pinkie Pie, she freak him out with her 4th wall breaking power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nbut there was one pony... only one pony that he found perfect for the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight Sparkle\" He chuckled evilly, he have special plans for her, how to embarrass to the ground until she become nothing more but the jester of the town!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laught madly, his last act as evil chaos god shall begin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POOF*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in a study room, in peace reading  some more books that are also Twilight's own Knowledge, this time, it were spell and magic books, unfortunally most of them are pony-only magic and you found few multi-species ones, some that you already know, some that you found interesting but are extremely few others that were nothing but worthless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nno magic is worhtless tought, some has it use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou also spent some times looking that the books that twilight gave to you... you couldn't help but feel tightness at your pants when you take a look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo ponies practice incest? You don't believe so. but everytime you look at the book were it feature Shining Armor, you chuckled in the very trought of it, it was perhaps because most of the photos have Shining deepthroating Twilight, her own sister and fucking the very princess of love, You know that they were married but Ponies are... Open to multiples partners in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found Shining Armor relieving some of his very units when he was just a sargeant<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome even form herd, or harems for ponies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very idea was a taboo between humans but among ponies that's different, Mares outnumber stallions so they form herds instead of individual marriages. of course, some are differents, some choose to marriage and prefer to stay in that way that have multiples ponies living in the same roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nnow the most that turn you on was the fact that you found Shining fucking Twilight in her perspective, now that's intense stuff, but the next page show Twilight with a large round belly that seems to be the afterward, still Shining's tool inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't be pregnancy, they wont get that far and it's in the same room so my best guess is that is... inflaction?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Cum Inflation actually\"</i> the voice of Twilight startled you but you didn't say anything you allow her to continue. <i>\"It was after the Crystal Heart event, Shining asked me for fertility spell and we \"tested\" it and incredible well... I think my Daughter is playing with pinkies and the crusaders, Nyx is sure a cute little girl\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Just kiddin\"</i> She giggle <i>\"we didn't get that far and I will never go to cross that line\"</i> For some reason, you sighed in relief, you were about to freak about a inbred child between the sparkle family, and recite the societies taboos, even a very open society like ponykind, it's still taboo have a inbreed child<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You know, I'm really curious in one thing\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What do you know about Satyrs\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were taken back by the sudden question and you ask why she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, Between Humans and Pony couples, some offprings are born hybrids; lower-half pony, upperhalf human, I'm intrigued you know, some say it's magic but there is more than just that, such thing should be impossible but it's amazing that's actually possible\"</i> now you see why she was interested, to be greatly honest, that is a odd interest but it could be also a mystery and for what you know about Princess Twilight, she \"loves\" solving mysteries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, You see, there is no a exactly how there are hybrids or satyrs comes to be, it was a puzzling mistery indeed, normally if a pony and human couple have an offpring, the child will be either full pony or full human but Hybrids are rares, very rare. some doctors and scientist runned test at the parents and the very child but the answer is still obscure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Exactly! That's why I'm very interested in solving that mystery!\"</i> for some reason, she sounded a little... flirty. without you noticed you feel the avatar's head next to yours, she whispered at your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna help me get a Satyr~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*THOOOD*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laught alot when you fainted, your face was completely red when she suggested it, she shook her head still gigglin in her little prank, well what she said was half-joking, she still want to solve that mystery, perhaps is no a lie after all, if you're willing then she might solve the mystery with your help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps this spell that Celestia gave her is what she needed, in the pass there weren't such insight in how a hybrid is formed, perhaps having a Satyr by herself might give her a oportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well played Little Princess.\" a voice that wasn't you or her own talked to her or rather, her avatar. she turned around only to find Discord having a cup of chocolate... while drinkin the glass itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Discord!\" what are you doing inside of my brain!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I can't visit in your library? you hurt me, Sparkle. I'm so bored and there only one pony that can help me with this, you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, After all, I always got the question, what if I was somepony else then I realized, I can be 'that' somepony!\" he finished, Her eyes widen in realization and turned into horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, nononononono, you're no planning...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, you don't mind if I control your body for bit, no? thank you!\" he said in a sing-song voice and disappeared in a flash of light, suddenly the light in the brain turns from purple illumination to dark brown, the avatar, no- Twilight Sparkle, see in horror that her very brain was no longer in her control, only a fraction of it that is empowering the avatar. she only muttered few words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... B***\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Twilight eyes turned from purple to red like discord's, her face dorned with a playful smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now this is where the fun begins!\" She/Discord said</span></div></div>",

But you decide to be ready with your teleportation spell; just in case there are any problems.

You would probably be a bit nervous if you weren\u2019t admiring the esophagus' muscles contracting around you and the food-ball. It seemed almost like it was welcoming it, along with you, while pushing you downward. You soon arrive at the sphincter, seeing it opening, welcoming you to the stomach.

There's a lot to explain to Rarity and you aren't even sure what kind of plan she has in store for you. The gradual upward spiral indicates that you're going in the right direction. Ironically, for a unicorn who wouldn't even come in contact with things she considered uncouth or dirty, the tunnel she opened for you sure is dark and slimy. By the time you reached the end of the tunnel, you are exhausted from climbing and crawling up the steep passage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rest for a minute before allowing your eyes to take in the new environment. In comparison to the organic feature of the stomach, this chamber looks a lot more plush and comfortable. The flooring is a marble-like material tinted a light shade of lavender. A large couch large enough to seat 3 to 4 ponies is placed against one side of the room. The wallpapers are simply a light gray with a thin stripe of inlaid gems. An ornate coffee table lie immediately in front of the couch. If it weren't for the fleshy doorway behind you, you might thought that this is somepony's comfy living room. Curiously, a pair of oval windows showed a bedroom and numerous pony mannequins with newly made dresses fitted onto them. You observed the exterior environment and deduced that it must be Rarity's bedroom. The ground rumbled and the scene outside started moving toward a dresser mirror and you spotted Rarity's reflection looking back at you. A careful look at her face revealed your location to be somewhere behind her eyes. The unicorn noticed you in the mirror and formed a faint smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\"Ah. I see that you reached my head. Please take a seat on couch, dear.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Miss Rarity,\" you replied and sat on the couch while still looking at the unicorn, \"If I may ask, did you design this room yourself? It looks wonderful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Why yes, darling. Every little detail is made for a occupant to feel at home. I'm glad that you like it. Unlike one of my close friends who thought that it's too prissy.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now what do we do, Miss Rarity?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Now dear. Would you like me to get some tea for you? It will probably ease you into conversation.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Miss Rarity. But I wouldn't want to ask too much of you. I appreciate the offer.\"<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\"That just nonsense, mage. You really have to taste this new blend that I just got from the department store in Manehatten. You don't have to be so uptight here. We're in Ponyville, not some noble banquet in Canterlot. Please make yourself comfortable.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw here pour two cup of tea from a pot that she has set on another table in the room. Using her magic, she shrinks one of the cup and made it appeared on the coffee table in front of you. You took a light sip and found it to be one of the tastiest tea you had in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I do believe that there is some ways we can come to an agreement about fulfilling your fantasy and maintaining my privacy.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Curiosity overcame me and i reached out and touched the mass. Suddenly images filled my head in rapid succession. I saw Rarity smiling, I saw a group of other colored ponies and a baby dragon, then flashes of their journies and struggles. Next I could see Rarity hard at work on her dresses, all the numerous designs that encircled her head, from the simple to the impossibly elaborate, and the hard yet joyful process of her trying to bring these to life. The images stopped and I felt momentarily dazed, though I think I now knew more about this pony before me. She was ambitious and a hard worker, but cared deeply for her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could suddenly hear her voice again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I hope you didn't mind that, I just thought it was the fastest way to introduce myself. </i>I could somehow feel her smiling.<i>I also thought it would do well to prepare you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all Miss Rairty.

The pegasus stallion slept on the couch with his mouth wide open like a stereotypical snoozer. The river of drool flowing down his face further reinforced the impression. You hovered over his body and observed the stallion more closely. The feathers on Soarin's wings are all disheveled and out of shape and his mane is an even bigger mess than your typical bed mane. To put simply put, he looked horrible by every definition of the word. One of the grosser things you've encountered is his enormous sheath and testicles which is in plain view for you to see. Ick! You definitely don't want to further entertain the thoughts about how 'active' his life is so you tried looking for a distraction. <i>The magazine seems like a good spot.</i> But much to your horror, the magazine covering his face is an issue of \"Colt's Plaything.\" The subject of the cover is a pegasus mare revealing her privates to the viewer while undressing herself from a kinky flight suit. Your face turned red at the suggestive contents on the cover. You swiftly banish any inappropriate thoughts from your head and decided to continue your observation. A list of questions began to take form in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's just a little past twelve in the afternoon, why would one of the best flyers take his little nap now when he should supposedly be training with his team?</i> you thought, <i>Unless this fellow is slacking off on the job</i> It is hard to imagine that the pegasus before you is one of the most famous stars in Equestria. If pictures of his napping gets out, his reputation will surely take a big hit...and the wrath of his superiors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quietly landed on Soarin's muzzle and walked along his nose toward the face. His sheer size is more than enough to make you look in awe upon him. One of his nostrils is wide enough for you to crawl in and his closed eyes are three times your size. The sound of his snoring is loud enough that you need to cover your ears. In between maintaining your balance on the nose and trying to keep you hearing intact, you made it to the front of one of his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Soarin'!!!!!</b>\" a female voice suddenly boomed, \"You better get your lazy flank down here right this instant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin' slowly open his eyes, allowing you to see his brilliant green irises. From his expression, he still looked extremely tired and on the verge of falling back to sleep. The stallion haven't moved an inch from his sofa.  The look you saw in his dazed eyes is mostly confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soarin', this is a direct order: Stop napping and get yourself down here!\" the voice shouted again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh oh, looks like I have to someplace to hide first. You looked back at the blue pegasus and came face to face with his eyeball. There is something different about it this time. Besides your reflection, you could make out the shape of another pony that's roughly beside you. You turned around but you found no one there and turned back; the silhouette was still there. You walked closer to the pupil and noticed that the pony-shaped entity is also walking closer to you. You peered closely at it and your eyes widened in shock: it's Soarin' or technically, an image of him in his own eyes. The stallion seems to notice you and is beckoning for you to follow him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Huh? </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT'S IT!!! I'M COMING UP!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, a hoof shot out from the pupil and dragged you into the eye just as you see a very pissed yellow pegasus mare flew in through the window.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Reproductive Organ sounds like a good place to start. Though it was kinda questionable for you to take such interest in a normally private region, deep down you are always curious about the anatomical differences between humans and ponies. It's a fascinating aspect to research on. In particular, the farm stallion did boast about the size of his testicle; the biggest around Ponyville as he proudly claimed. Since Big Mac gave you this opportunity to explore his body, you aren't just gonna crassly turn down his offer. You told the farm stallion where you're going and took one of the tunnel marked with a pictogram of a stallion cock and testicles and entered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you enter the passage, hot and steamy air blow against you as you ventured deeper. The soft floor generally traveled in a downward slop toward the nether region. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah hope you'll like what ya see down there,\" Big Macintosh said, \"Ah'm not one of them fancy mages or unicorns with body altering spells but I sure would want you to enjoy what I can offer you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. But I don't mean to impose anything. There's no need for further accommodation. I just wanna explore your body,\" you responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nonsense! There's no need to be so polite, mage. The Apple Family is known for their hospitality and friendliness. It''ll be a shame if I don't live up to that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that's fine. This probably is just the beginning,\" you smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tunnel came to an end and opened up into a vast space. From a shrunken perspective, you are more than certain that the size of the region is larger than Canterlot and Ponyville combined. The pink flesh is virtually every where save for a red-green catwalk your on. The smell of musk permeates the air in here. Normally such smells would offend your nostrils. It reminds you of the intense odor lingering around Ponyville during those periods and mentally gagged at it. The ponies there find it a rather normal, even agreeable, occurrence; a natural process. Unfortunately for a human mage like you, it's unbearable. You recalled some mares teasing you for not knowing the significance of the estrus cycle and lacking some of the perks of being an equine. But Big Mac's is subtly different. It's a strangely soothing aroma with a hint of apple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes turned wide in amazement as your mind slowing processed what you're seeing. Standing proud and tall in the center of the chamber is the towering edifice of Big Mac's stallionhood. It is currently fully retracted into the sheath, extending all the way toward the ceiling like a spear ready to fire out at any time. Light pink veins covered the structure, pulsating in synchronization with his heart. You placed your hand on its slippery surface and felt the blood pumping through them, the warmth and heat emanating from them, and the stronger smell of musk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is what a stallionhood looks like: larger, longer, and normally hidden from view until needed,\" you quietly exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying the sight of my treasure?\" Big Mac's voice suddenly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...Yeah. For obvious reasons, I never encountered one before. It's nice to see one so close up thanks to you,\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm happy to hear that. Why don't you go for my massive testicles so I can show you more of what I got?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and walk around the pulsating pillar. Situated behind the cock are the most massive pair of testicles you've ever seen. The pair of pale red balls occupied more than half the space in the room. They dangled and swayed along with Big Mac's movement, held up by a series of connective tissues and tubes. The muted sound of hoofsteps outside tells you that the stallion is trotting. Solely by look alone, you can tell that those testicles meant \"business\". The catwalk leading up to them is split in two direction, each entering the testicle through an entrance at their side. A red glowing signs tells you that the left one leads to a \"Big Mac's Bar, Club, and Pool\" while the right one leads to a \"Mare's Hall of Fame\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty tough choice here, eh?\" Big Mac asked, \"If yer wondering about where to go. Lemme give some more information.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Big Mac's Bar, Club, and Pool</b>- a perfect place to relax by the \"sea\" and enjoy some \"exotic\" foods and drinks. Be sure to tryout the \"juice\"-flavored ciders and refreshments while you're there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mares' Hall of Fame</b>- check out the names and records of mares that I mated with. I can even share some of my fantasies with you there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what will it be, mage?\"</span></div></div>",

What's wrong!?\" you shouted alarmed by the sudden tremor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax is just me bucking an apple tree. Yes Zecora is the town's only zebra, she lives in everfree forest, during the estrus circle I took refuge in her hut but she was out of her special potion that prevent her heat. we did it in end.\" he said a little embarrassed. you notice a bottle with golden trims and decoration you see a little more close until you see very tiny black and white tadpoles in it. sperm cells but distinct colors, similar to a zebra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have two questions; Why you have these sperms inside of this bottle and what up with the different coloration?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeyup, these sperms are special for Zebras Mares, no only that, Ah can create special sperm for any \"special\" occassion.\" he said with a hint of pride. You acknowledge him and continue toward the center, you read multiples names of each picture, statue or murals some of them has special sperm's bottles., thinking that the prostitute rumor can be true but he said that he was victim of each estrus seasons or mares with discontrolled heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhen reaching the center you notice Four Golden statues in the center of the testicle's hall the center the very statue of princess celestia!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess Celestia?! you had sex with her?\" you asked suprised seeing the fact that Big Macintosh had sex with Royalty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeyup, Ah was part of the Royal Harem during a estrus week but the princess found another unlucky stallion during the initial days. ah got lucky to be out of the harem.\" he said while you see in multiples angles the statue but you see that there aren't a special sperm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How? why Lucky to be out of the royal harem? is an golden oportunity, you and your family would have ended rich!\" you exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, the princess choose stallions for the royal harem because of her... Alter ego, she isn't the same princess celestia during that week. is an... Molesting Nightmare.\" You stood there suprised by his remark, could this be the Molestia rumor true? after all, many stallions after weeks with the princess in his estrus return home traumatized or broken morally. you train of thought ended when expenting the other statues<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see an statue of a Pegasus Mare with three buttleflies cutie mark with the name \"Flutteshy\" engraved in it, there was a bottle with special yellow and pink sperm cells in it but what intrigued you was that there is a picture of a orange pegasus filly with purple mane and tail in the bottle you ask Big Mac about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"During a estrus week few years ago, I was doing a favor with fluttershy but her heat affected violently and she ended out raping me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Sorry about that buddy.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No biggie, in the end of the week. she ended pregnant with my foal with my special sperm, she gave birth to a adorable filly, we called her Scootaloo. however we couldn't afford to raise her so we give her to the orphanage instead, she got adopted by a pegasus family, we still give her support discretely, please don't tell anypony about this.\" he plead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Bic Mac! Your secret is safe with me! Archmage's Word!\" you said. he thanked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe third statue was another pegasus but with wild mane and a lightbolt cutie mark, you know this mare, is Rainbow Dash, the self-ploclaimed most Faster Flyer of Equestria. there was another bottle with cerulean sperm cell in it. Bic Mac explain that she raped him year later of scootaloo's birth luckily she didn't get pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nfinally the last statue shocked you, the statues is clearly Applejack!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big Mac? the last statue is who I think is it? you ask a little suprised until Big Mac speaked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Applejack came a little after Fluttershy's Pregnancy news, Applejack couldn't believe Ah mated with her friend so she decided to \"teach\" me a lesson. Look in the bottle.\" you do, the bottle under the statue has Yellow and Red sperms swimming in it, what suprised you more is picture of a yellow filly with red mane and pink bowtie in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Applejack ended pregnant too, she gave birth to a hearthly filly, we called her Apple Bloom but unlike Scootaloo we DID raise her but as our little sister instead of a Daughter, I told applejack to give her to the orphanage since in that time we didn't money to raise her but she didn't wanted that, she worked so hard to give her food, school and our home reconstruction, everything for her. Granny Smith didn't approved applejack's act to me but accepted our daughter but said that One day she needed to learn the truth.\" Big Mac ended you stood awestruck by the sudden reveal. her little sister is actually his and her sister incestous daughter! this probarbly the another of his secrets and very deep and dark one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really could use drink now...\" you said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you should go to my other testicle.\" he suggest, you nodded</span></div></div>",

The tour through the hall has really opened your eyes to a lot of Big Mac's interests and, of course, several fine mares from Ponyville. You got to admit that those mares look beautiful and attractive even for a human like you. The involuntary sex aside, you can easily see why stallions fell prey to them during their estrus cycle and end up like Big Mac who got forced by Rainbow Dash. Furthermore, the revelation of Big Mac relationship with his sister has shocked you but Big Mac shrugged it off like it's nothing. Perhaps ponies are more accepting of sibling relations than humans do, you thought. If the pictures of the very few human girls in the hall are any indications, some ponies might even be into interspecies relation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exited the right testicle and entered the right. It is just as spacious but with a very different lay out. The transparent tunnel in here seems bigger and grander, like the entrance to a fine restaurant. The view in here is far larger than in the right testicle; the tons of whitish sperm engulf you completely no matter where you looked. Even the sperms themselves are more active and swimming vigorously around. At your size, they look rather like thumb-sized tadpoles that swims aimlessly around. A few stray ones stopped and \"looked\" at you through the glass-like wall before enjoying billion others in the tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA set of stairs lead upwards until it broke the surface of the pool of sperms which looks more like an ocean at your size. A skeletal boardwalk replaced the tunnel and leads toward an island in the center of the testicle. A red barn not dissimilar to Sweet Apple Acres come into view as you approached. A large glowing sign reads <i> The Loaded Barn: Bar and Pool</i>. There is even a logo of stallionhood releasing a torrent into an overflowing cider mug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pushed through the barn door and was greeted by a dim stable lit only by orange ceiling lights. Hays are strewn on the floor to provide cushioning and a 'pleasant smell'. The compartments originally meant to house livestocks are used as individual table booths. Pictures of Big Mac's cock lined the walls. They are all taken moments before the action starts, providing any onlooker with a revealing view of the mare's rump and slit. The farm stallion even put up a '5-apple rating card' for each of them. Criterions includes pleasurability, intensity, speed, comfort, and immersion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n On the far side of the stable is a long counter with dozens of stools. A wide array of pipes and bottles are laid out on a shelve behind the bartender's place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a seat and lifted a little menu placed on the counter. It recommends you to try out \"Big Mac's Cider Shots\" and the new \"Stallion's Special Platter\". From the names alone, you could already guess  what's added to those drinks.</span></div></div>",

The replica smile upon seeing you before serving you a glass with said cider, you take the glass and drink in a single gulp, it was delicious yet strong acholized cider luckily thanks to your magic, you're immune to alcholism to an extend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I join\" a voice said behind you, you look around only to see Big Mac himself sitting next you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...?

I'm running before she get me!\" he said alarmed he ran toward the barn, entering. he closed the barn's door, feeling himself safe he let a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, look in my favorite stallion.\" a femenine yet tomboy-ish voice said across the barn, it was Rainbow Dash with seductive look in her face, the scent of her heat is strong that make Big Mac stallionhood rise from it sheath, she licked her lips upon seeing her prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow Dash, I thought your heat passed like the rest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pegasus heats are more extended than Unicorns and Earth Ponies, it means more fun with you and your big stick and delicious filled balls!\" inside the sack you heard everything but as muffled sounds, now you are alarmed by the presence of his previous captors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run!\" His voice said to your head. \"I can't guarantee your safetly in my testicles anymore, there is a emergency stairs that goes directly to my bladder, hurry!

Voices outside indicates that there is not much time left before you are sent straight into Rainbow Dash. The prospect of becoming the Pegasus' foal isn't one you're looking forward to. You darted across the boardwalk where the semen is washing over as it rises with Big Mac's involuntary arousal. The stormy and frothy mixture threatens to take you down and make you part of the imminent load. Dash's muffled voice is getting closer every second, ready to do her magic with the farm stallion. Luckily, you spotted the emergency stairs right ahead with its flashing beacon. You literally flew up the flight of stairs, reaching the half-filled bladder in under a minute. You immediately jumped into the warm, yellow liquid despite your strong, personal objection. Emergencies call for extreme measures. Floating around in the equally chaotic urine, you only hope Dash <br>\r\nlikes it quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dash, pl...please think this over,\" Big Mac trembled as the dominating Pegasus seductively trotted closer with her wing fully extended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did. And I want you, Mac. I want you to put that awesome stick where it truly belongs,\" Dash purred, staring at Big Mac's lengthening stallionhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dash...ah really don't wanna say this but you might get pregnant this time,\" the stallion said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feels just right,\" the pegasus grinned, \"I always wanted to have a couple of foals. A big rainbow family for you and me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Macintosh ran out of option to slow the mare and backed up against the wall. Rainbow Dash saw the opportunity and pounced on the stallion, pinning him helplessly to the ground. The mare is now nose to nose with the frightened farm pony. Big Mac searched her cerise eyes for any escapes, any signs of a compromise but saw nothing but desire and lust in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nopony gets away from Rainbow Dash and I have you on my exclusive to-rut list. You ready, big guy?\" she whispered in a tomboyish tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*gulp* Eeeenope!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad, you're getting the prize anyway. Stretch out those legs.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<i>Fast forward in time</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac lie on the ground completely exhausted and drenched with sweat and Dash's fluid. In the distance, the stallion could hear the triumphant laugh of the pegasus as she take off toward the sky. He has been violated in every sense of the word. Forced to experience pleasure that he didn't ask for, not to mention the bruises on his lower legs from the actions. The stallion mustered all his strength and stood up amid the disheveled hays covering the floor. He bent down and checked his groin. His stallionhood has long since retracted back into the sheath leaving only moist residues smeared around his lower body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac remembered to check on the poor human left in his bladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mage, can you hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes..,\" you coughed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay in there, buddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....yeah, I'm fine so far. Despite having taken a few mouthful of your stuff and getting my clothes ruined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. I didn't expect Rainbow Dash to pop up like that. That girl is crazed and obsessed with me. She's gone for now, thank goodness. Celestia knows when she'll come back to get more,\" Big Mac said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tossing and tumbling in a bladder while you get violated; I don't think I'll be coming here again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep a sharper eye next time. I knew I should've headed for the cellar,\" the stallion chastised himself,<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's get you cleaned up and possibly find some fresh clothing. \"</span></div></div>",

The relieving action of the hot water and the gentle aroma teasing your nostrils easily outshines the best spa available in town. Mostly due to Big Mac's insistence, you tried submerging in several pools each made with a different apple cultivar. Until then, you've never heard about all the species that Big Mac was explaining away. He also revealed that the Apple Family has a tradition of naming their children after the  names of the apples they cultivated. As an example, Big Mac said that his name is, in fact, a large red apple first grown by members of the Family who founded Ponyville. You listened to every tidbits Big Mac shared with you. In one, the stallion told you how Applejack has a cute habit of calling the apple trees in their orchard with various nicknames and hugging them affectionately as if they were her children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you got out of the pool, you smelled only of pleasant apples. You got up and walked as directed by Big Mac. It was a short walk from the pools to the elevator. As uncomfortable you are with being naked, it'll have to do until you got the clothes from Big Mac. The elevator took you upward to the eyes of the stallion. Moments later, the elevator stopped and opened its door. The new room is oval in shape with you standing on some sort of balcony about two-third the way up. The first thing you saw are two massive white spheres running with veins. From this vantage point, only the top part of them is visible. These are the eyes of Big Mac. Contrary to what you understand about anatomy, the eyeballs aren't separate but held together by a cartilage attached between them with the entire structure held in place by the muscles anchored to the ceiling, floor and walls. A pair of thick wires lead from the eyeballs to the high wall behind you before disappearing into the flesh. Their size is far larger than the barn house on Sweet Apple Acres.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the corner of the chamber is a wooden wardrobe filled with all sorts of clothing. You quickly went over and sifted through the collection. The clothes are neatly stowed and organized so finding suitable wears wouldn't be hard. You're happy to find that socks and shoes are also available. After minutes of digging and fitting, you got yourself a spare pair of underwear, a jean, a checkered shirt, work gloves, and a pair of sturdy boots. You looked at your reflection in a mirror in the wardrobe and found it satisfactory. Now you look convincingly like a farmhand which you considered apt in the current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah see that you got yourself a new pair of clothes. Looks nice on you, mage,\" the farm pony complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank, Big Mac,\" you said, \"I don't mean to be rude or something but how did you have all these spare clothes lying around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are actually given to me by human farmers from Northern Equestria that I had the pleasure of meeting and doing business with. They're some nice folks who love to offer these clothing as some sort of keepsake for our frequent trading,\" Big Mac recalled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...Good to hear about that. I guess they picked up the hospitality from the ponies in those parts,\" you smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true, mage. We'll save any conversations for later, now let me show you something real cool. Step closer to my eyeballs, if you please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou happily complied and walked toward the eyes. To your surprise, a ripple formed on the white surfaces as a tendon came out and tied itself around you. It slowly pulled you toward the eyeballs. You briefly panicked but Big Mac assured you that you're safe. As your body touched the surface, you felt you body sinking into it. It felt like a soft membrane is taking you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a short time, you are engulfed within the eyes. You found yourself surrounded by a dense gel as you slowly sink to the bottom. There is no air pockets in here or in sight which worried you greatly. Within seconds, you are losing your breath and began struggling, with you face turning red. Big Mac quickly noticed the problem and told you that you are able to breath the gel like normal air. He apologized profusely for forgetting to tell that. Breathing in the gel is a lot like breathing in water but with the burning sensation or the choking. It felt weird to say the least but also kinda fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirectly in front of you, you noticed two large openings framed by emerald green rings that changes it size constantly. Bright lights filtered into the liquid-filled chamber, causing it to diffuse into a soft blue haze. You swam closer to the pupil for a better look. On the other side of the opening, you saw Big Mac looking at himself in a mirror in the bathroom. There is a look of exhaustion on his face. It looks like he just took a long shower to wash away any messes that Dash has left behind in his coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big Mac, are you alright? You don't look to good,\" you said with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeenope. Dash gotten me hard this time. Nasty bruises everywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac shifted his head and gave you a view of his sheath and groin. Faint blue bruises can be seen dotting the entire area. A few bite marks can be seen on the thighs of his hind legs. Several purplish horseshoe prints can be seen on his cutie marks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow.... That's awful,\" you said with your mouth covered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see that, mage? That how crazed Rainbow Dash can get with me. My groin's gonna be aching for days and apple bucking will be a painful ordeal,\" Big Mac said dismally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know your feel, Mac,\" you said sympathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could reply, a knock sounded on the bathroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big Mac, what's gotten into you? You've been in the bathroom for like two hours now,\" Applejack's voiced said.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou saw Big Mac's reflection in the mirror turned sweaty and nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah'm fine, sis. I just took a shower to get the sweat out of m'ah coat. That's all,\" Big Mac said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah may not have seen your face but Ah could tell a poor liar when Ah hear one. So open up this door. Don't force me to buck it down for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah said I'm fine. Please just leave,\" Big Mac insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's horse apples! Ah could tell that something is wrong. Now open up, Big Mac,\" Applejack demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*gulp* If ya say so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw Big Mac undoing the lock on the door and opening it in the slowest way possible. But his effort is interrupted when an orange hoof forcefully pushed the door open and gave Applejack a full view of his body. Her eyes immediately widened as she stared at the bruises and hoof prints on his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BIG MAC!!! What in the hay jus' happened to you?\" the mare shouted as she glared at Big Mac, her green eyes boring deeply into his. You are an unintended victim of that glare; you swore that look could suck your soul out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah..Ah can explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......Dash,\" Applejack gritted her teeth as she observed the injuries, \"You get down here and tell me everything including that little speck you got in your eye.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll go with Applejack while you hide out. Man, those injuries to your testicles look really nasty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac looked sadly at his sheath and groin and gave a weak nod in acknowledgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Rainbow finds you again, who knows what she'll do then. I'd hate to see her wrecking your stallionhood for good. You got to hide somewhere safer this time. I think the apple cellar would be a good place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's out of the question,\" the red pony said bluntly, \"You may not know it but Dash loves cider more than anything else. She drinks several mugs of the stuff in one sitting and will fight over every last drop. And when she's drunk, Dash tend to do crazy things without really using her head. Our farm got more than a dozen barrels of ciders in that cellar. The last place I wanna be is somewhere she can have her cider to go with her heat and rut me till she's out cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whelp! So we have a cider-addicted pegasus with an out of control heat. Rainbow's got more problems than I previously thought,\" you remarked dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's just the start of it,\" Big Mac added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Okay, let's worry about that later. We've got to resolve the matters at hand. Namely, getting me over to Applejack and finding you a safe place. Any ideas how to transfer me to your sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...I can ask her for an opinion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac informed Applejack about your choice and asked her how she planned to get to over to her body. Additionally, he asked her if she knew any good hiding place on the farm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see Applejack putting a hoof under her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hmmmmm. That's a bummer,\" she said with a scrunched face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere something adorable about her doing that pose. Perhaps it's the way she fidget with her hoofs. You began to admire her the longer you studied her features. Her mane, hat, coat, well-toned body, freckles, and her cutie mark all worked flawlessly together to create this beautiful mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in a while, her green eyes will brighten at any ideas that comes her way. Unfortunately, all of them were shot down with a resounding \"Eeeenope\" from Big Mac. He didn't want to endure anything that involves his. You sit quietly in the eyeballs as the siblings went back and forth with various plans to get you out. Until finally, Applejack just heaved a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah guess this is where my Elemental power comes into play,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Big Mac 'huh' in confusion at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, Twilight's been explaining to us element bearers the secret powers that's contained within our amulets. Interestingly, we can access those power without even wearing the gems. And it only gets weirder from there. Twilight's must've been researching all those thick books she's been carrying around all the time. Gotta admire her studiousness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what does that have to do with our problem, sis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you see? Twilight said that each of the element granted a specific power to each of us. I  can use this power to our advantage and get you two safe and sound.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still a little wary about them magical stuffs. You sure you know what you're doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Ah guess it's better for me to show than tell,\" Applejack smiled, \"You ready there, sugarcube?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac reluctantly nodded along with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here it comes,\" she warned as her eyes started glow white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in Big Mac's body, you can sense the intense power of  magic emanating from the Earth Pony. It was shocking that a non-unicorn could so effectively casts a spell. But it's more plausible when you consider the fact that she possesses the most powerful artifact in Equestria: The Elements of Harmony. A tingling sensation spread throughout your body, numbing your arms and legs. Your surrounding started distorting as Applejack continued channeling her power into her brother. You started losing your consciousness as a pulling force dragged you through an empty void...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Some times later</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly regained your senses although everything is still a blur. What a ride!, you thought. Mustering your strength, you sit up and looked around. You're relieved to see the sight of the farm and orchards; Applejack didn't disintegrate you like Nightmare Moon. Next to you to the groaning figure of Big Mac all curled up like a ball. He is now at roughly the correct size ratio with you. Wait, does this mean the elements has turned you back to normal? That brief elation was squashed when you looked up and saw Applejack's huge face towering over you. In fact, you are resting upon the mare's hoof. Her face cracked into a big smile when she noticed that you're awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Howdy y'all,\" her voice thundered, \"You two alright?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine but that's not what I'm worried about. How's Big-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud high-pitched scream penetrated the air, stunning your ears. You turned toward the source of the sound and saw Big Mac with eyes like pinpricks looking at his sister with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Applejack, what did you so to me?!!\" he blurted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, nelly. Ya gotta calm down there, big brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm? How am I supposed to keep calm when I'm smaller than an apple? I'm the same size as the mage now,\" Big Mac exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen,\" Applejack stated calmly, \"Twilight told me my element's secret power is replicating a cast spell in my vicinity. It means that I can copy the effects of a spell and recast it on a new target of my choice without any prior knowledge of the spell in question. At least that's the way the bookworm puts it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but how am I gonna hide now? I can't do nothing at this size. I won't be hiding in the cellar, barn, clubhouse or even my room,\" his voice still sounds panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ya silly. You won't be hiding in those places; you be hiding in me,\" Applejack said, tapping her hoof on her chest for emphasis, \"Ah'm the safest option you got here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A place where you don't have to worry about being discovered by Rainbow or any other mares. A place where there's the warmth of family. And a place where I can always keep an eye on my big brother and make sure he's safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack leveled her hoof to her mouth and tilted it, allowing the fearful stallion and you to slide toward her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't worry, big brother. You are in good hoofs,\" the mare said in a strangely motherly tone.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don't know what to say\" said the stallion a little startled but calmiing himself. you both started to walk (or trot for Big Mac) around the entire chamber, then you saw  a tunnel similar when you entered in Big Mac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now this interesting, she is offering us a tour!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah\" he say trembling a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah still can't believe I'm in mah sister..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can't still believe how you can be so... terrified I mean, this isn't a family secret the whole bodily control thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah think you're right, is just that my sister just used magic and well... I don't like being tiny that's all.\" he confess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go inside that tunnel, it will lead to your rooms, Ah'll Talk with Rainbow Dash, I will tell her the truth about her condition.\" the voice of Applejack startled you both, going inside the tunnel you couldn't help but see how open is it, while slimy and dark it was spacious like big mac's tunnels and corridors. talking about the stallion see that he struggle to walk (or trot) properly prehaps because of his groin's pain, there was two gateway and over it there is two sign that said \"Mage\" and the other \"Big Macintosh\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean that will never bear foals in her own, I don't think is a good idea, I mean right now she isn't stable.\" you suggest, the red stallion 'eeyup'ed in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya don't know Rainbow Like Ah am,  believe me, she isn't the motherly type.\" She was already in ponyville's outskirt, where Rainbow's live, however when reaching it she heard unexpected sobs from inside the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow Dash?\" she yell toward the cloud house, the sobs stop until she heard a weak voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-applejack?\" it was rainbow's voice but it was weak compared to her usual go-lucky and bash self, this confused her greatly. <i>something isn't right, Rainbow's never cry</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come down now! Ah'm no happy what you did to mah brother!\" she shout with authority and she was rewarded but now what she expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhen she come out and land front of her. her hardered expretion turned into suprise when seeing her friend's face her eyes were red and tears coming from it, her mane more unkempt than before, an aura of misery coming from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry...\" she said weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I SAID I'M SORRY! ... This Year's heat was too strong that I couldn't control myself, I can't help but thinking in rutting him and bear his foal! ...

In the mean time we are in your sister, we could go for a tour\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeyup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Applejack sigh and cought gaining the attention of the cerulean pegasus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sugarcube, We need to talk...\"</span></div></div>",

She sniffed a few times as she focused her attention on the farm pony beside her. Although Dash tried her best to look calm and collected, those cerise eyes of hers proved otherwise. They were filled with regret and melancholy deep within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't understand. What is there to talk about? The damage has already been done. I rutted your brother like a mare on her first heat. I guess you and your brother will have a hard time ever forgiving me,\" she said dejectedly while eyeing Applejack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe looks on the pegasus' face made Applejack hesitate to share what she's been hiding for so long; she couldn't bring herself to tell Rainbow about her infertility and break her fragile psyche any further. The orange mare imagined the various ways that Rainbow would react to the news and none of them sounds good. But Applejack reminded herself that she can't hide the truth forever. She could delay it for a day, weeks, months, or even years but sooner or later, it'll have to come out. Telling Dash right now is her best option. Honesty is her element and she will do what's needed to uphold that. Closing her eyes calmly, Applejack took a deep breath and heaved a long sigh. <i>This is for your own good, Rainbow.</i>, she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sugarcube, did you remember the last time you went to the hospital 'cause of that flying stunt you were performing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...yeah. That's the Canterlot Aerial Show about a year or two ago. I ended up flying way too fast and crashed rump-first through the wall and landed in The Princess's room. That was the most awful injury I did to my rump. My backside felt shattered. It took about two weeks before I could sit down or use the restroom.... So why would you ask this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sugarcube, that's the problem,\" Applejack replied composedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, no. I'm perfectly fine. Didn't the doctor told me that I was up and flying sooner than he expected.? He even told me that my marehood is all fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack cringed at the last sentence. She knew how hard this is  going to be for the cerulean mare. The only thing she wished for was that Dash could somehow accept it. Applejack mentally gulped and prepared for the worst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow,\" Applejack said firmly, \"While we're in the hospital, the girls told you that there's nothing for you to worry about your body, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow only nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid that we weren't exactly honest with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time for you to hear what went down at the hospital that day,\" Applejack stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What really happened?\" Rainbow pressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack paused for a moment to collect her thoughts and put the story in a way the Pegasus could understand. She heaved another sigh before she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was almost midnight at your second day at the hospital. The girls are all gathered at the doctor's office to hear about your condition. when the doctor came in, that thick folder he had in his hoof told us something was wrong. I mostly understand the situation through Twilight's translation of those difficult terms. The doctor told us that crash you had directly impacted your uterus and ovaries, causing the awful pain you were feeling. That wasn't only some nasty bruises you got then. The doc showed us an X-ray photo of  tears in your Fallopian tubes which connects your ovaries to your womb. The uterus also showed signs of trauma in multiple areas. It was just bad. I couldn't bring myself to hear the rest of the doctor's explanation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow look at Applejack who was on the brink of crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..Wha...what does that mean for me then?\" she said fearfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The doctor said that those wounds would heal but there would be long term damages to you reproductive ability. Meaning that you.....,\" Applejack broke down and leaned against Rainbow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I'm what?! Tell me AJ! Just bucking tell me!!!\" The pegasus said frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".........Rainbow...you won't be able to have foals anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe revelation felt like a lightning strike for Rainbow Dash. Every single muscle on her body can to a standstill. Her wings fell limp to the sides as her mind threatened to shut down completely. Applejack could see the wide-eyed, dazed expression on the mare's face through her blurry eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"no.....no.........NOOOO!!! This can't be happening! It's all just a joke, right? Tell me Applejack, please tell me this is a joke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry sugarcube,\" Applejack said sadly, \"but that's the honest truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash looked up at Applejack to find her gazing back at her with remorse. In those emerald eyes, she saw her own face looking back at her with the same lost expression. Her multi-colored mane is completely disheveled and her own eyes red from crying.<br>\r\n------<br>\r\nInside Applejack's body, you and Big Mac quietly listened to the exchange and sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll be happy to have a couple of foals with you. A big Rainbow Family with you...\" she pounced him as he backed up against the wall, pinning him helplessly to the ground \"and Me.\" she finished. The pegasus mare is now nose to nose with the frightened farm pony. Big Mac searched her cerise eyes for any escapes, any signs of a compromise but saw nothing but desire and lust in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nopony gets away from Rainbow Dash and I have you on my exclusive to-rut list. You ready, big guy?\" she whispered in a tomboyish tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*gulp* Eeeenope!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad, you're getting the prize anyway.

In the distance, the stallion could hear the triumphant laugh of the pegasus as she take off toward the sky. He has been violated in every sense of the word. Forced to experience pleasure that he didn't ask for, not to mention the bruises on his lower legs from the actions. The stallion mustered all his strength and stood up amid the disheveled hays covering the floor. He bent down and checked his groin.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first you notice about your pitch dark surrounding is the strong scent of a mare in heat and the extremely humid air. You conjured up a light spell with a flick of your finger. A glowing blue orb no larger than a hoofball formed in the palm of your hand. The spell was not strong enough is provide you with full illumination but this will do for the moment. With better illumination, you can now make out the pinkish folds of the womb surrounding you. Dark purple veins spread over the equally soft floor like an intricate spider web, pulsating with the sound of Rainbow's heartbeat. An initial estimate of its size place it roughly with that throne room in Canterlot Castle. Your clothes are covered in the remnants of Big Mac's semen as are the floor and walls. You could smell the semen and Dash's fluids as they dripped and mingled with each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dash really did an intense one on the Big Mac this time</i>, you thought, <i>That freaking pegasus just can't resist her urges, can she? I really hope that he's alright and his testicles are still intact... In the meantime, I got to find a way of leaving this place; I don't wanna be in here witness the next victim in her way.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite that thought, your resolve to escape evaporated within minutes: you simply do not know where to begin. The cervix (the closest exit) is tightly closed and the tunnels to the ovaries are high up in the ceiling. The sheer magnitude of the womb made you realized that you're trapped in here and there's little you could do to change that. <br>\r\n_______<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash has landed onto the front yard of her cloud home with a gentle thud. Her mind is still filled vividly with some of the best moments she had with Big Mac just half an hour ago. The pegasus still remembered the way that she climaxed and the way the red stallion's own juice shot up into her cervix. That feeling of his large stallionhood entering her always made her tingle with joy. Dash turned her head back and took a look at her privates and saw that her fluids have dripped down her hind legs and dried into streaks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Big Mac is really the pony to go to if you have problems. I've done this several times and he never disappoints</i>, she thought, <i>One more victory for the awesome Rainbow Dash.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave herself a wide smirk at the \"conquest\" she had today and mentally tallied her successful advance on Big Mac to 5. Dash walked up to her front door and fidgeted for the key stowed in her wing. She unlocked the door and headed up for the bedroom to take a well-deserved afternoon nap. Dash went over to her dresser and looked at herself in the mirror. Her blue coat and multi-colored mane are even more disheveled than usual. A few pieces of dirt have found their way between the feather of her wings. <i>My heat will just get better and better with you, Big Mac!</i> The rainbow pegasus plopped down on her bed, one made from the finest clouds available from the Cloudsdale Factory, and fell asleep almost instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have been in the womb for almost half an hour and you still have no progress whatsoever. The only change you notice is the sound of Dash snoring coming from above. The air inside the chamber becomes increasingly stifled from the heat the walls are giving off. It was frustrating to say the least. Being trapped in a pony (like Big Mac) is one thing, but being trapped in the womb of a sex-addicted mare is something else entirely. There's no knowing what' will happen to you. Just when you decided to take one last trip around the womb, a long rumble rang in the chamber before subsiding seconds later. Once you are sure everything is safe again, you observed the surrounding once more. A fold in the wall has parted and revealed another tube that you could take. The mere fact that another passage has appeared out of nowhere made your heart leap with joy. This means that Rainbow Dash probably had her own series of rooms in her body like Big Mac. Did the opening appeared because she found out that you are inside her? There is no telling just yet whether she'll welcome your presence or deal with you like she did with Big Mac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother rumble rang through the womb: the folds containing the opening are closing up again. Not wanting to miss your only opportunity at progress, you ran and entered the hole seconds before it seals itself shut again. Blood rushed through your entire body as you desperately panted for air. You lie on the soft floor to catch your breath. It was minutes later before you had rested enough to stand up again. A flight of stairs greets you, each step is a color derived from Dash's mane. You slowly made you way up the steps toward where it leads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stairs quickly ended at a landing: There's only one door visible here and it's one made of wood (not unlike those you may find in Ponyville). There are posters of Rainbow Dash in various suggestive poses and kinky clothing pasted on the walls. A sign over the door gave you a hint of what's behind it:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"clblue\"><b><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">The <span class=\"cred\">R</span><span class=\"corange\">A</span><span class=\"cyellow\">I</span><span class=\"cgreen\">N</span><span class=\"cblue\">B</span><span class=\"cindigo\">O </span><span class=\"cgrape\">O</span><span class=\"cred\">M</span> /)^3^(\\</font></b></span></b><br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b><span class=\"chotpink\"><i>Good Cider, Great Food, and Even Better Mare</i></span></b></font> <br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"><i><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>Everything for the Stallion's Needs</b></font></i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped. There is no turning back now. You mustered your courage and pushed through the wooden door, prepared to take on any surprises.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The multi-colored curtains lifted to reveal Rainbow Dash herself in a more suggestive version of the Wonderbolts' uniform. The blue spandex suit fits snugly to her solid body, an aerodynamic design to increase the efficiency in flight. The back portion of the uniform has been cut away in order to reveal her well-toned muscles and her rounded flank. She's exactly the athletic and proud Wonderbolt recruit that everyone who met her described her as. Unfortunately, those ponies and humans have no idea that their favorite idol also has a shadier side when it comes to her heat. The pony seems to notice the attention you're giving her and batted her eyes slowly at you. You are so stunned at her beauty that you momentarily forgot how you got here and the fact that you're restrained by some tentacles. If it weren't for the fact that you got here unwillingly, you'd enjoy the most of this 'show.' <i>I'd hate to admit this but Dash sure is beautiful</i>, you thought, <i>Wait... Damn it! Get yourself together! Now is not the time to let my mind take its course. I gotta figure a way to get out this place before Dash makes me her first human target.</i>  The feeling of the restraints tightening around your waist that brought your attention back to the present. The pain forced your eyes to return to the stage where a platform lifted Rainbow Dash onto the higher level of the stage. She gave you a mischievous wink before donning her flight goggles. The lights around the bar dimmed to the color of faint ember as limelight on the stage focused on Dash's little dance. <i>This is gonna get really bad...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlow tempo-ed kinky music wafted toward your ears from the ceiling as the pegasus suggestively danced upon an artificial cloud prop. The pony rubbed her flank against the surface of it causing miniature lightnings and thunders to form against her flank. It's apparent that the lightning is electrocuting her in the place she wants, if the pleasurable on her face is any indication. The electricity had the effect of temporarily straightening her messy mane as she groaned suggestively. Dash intensified the speed of her rubbing.  Her moaning grew deeper and fast until a loud thunder finally cracked and the miniature cloud unleashed torrential rains unto the stage. The sound Dash made sends shivers done your spine as dozens of questions are running through your head. <i>What... the buck did I just see? How is it even possible for a pegasus to pleasure herself with a cloud? Don't lightnings kill? And did she actually DO that on random clouds in Ponyville?</i> The next time it rains, you really hope that what's raining down from above is actually water and not something else entirely. This really proves your former teacher's adage that some things are better left unknown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that part, the mare spread her wings and took off into the air. Dash started performing her own style of aerobatic flying around the stage. Many of the moves are ones you are familiar with from the countless \"Wonderbolts Equestrian Tour\" you had seen when your younger. It brought back some good memories from the depths of your mind. The one Dash is performing for you has more 'fancy' additions to it like flashing her privates at you, making out the contour of a heart with her rainbow trail, and pyrotechnics added for a good measure of drama. You don't know why but the way Dash is dancing is starting to have an effect on you. The complex mix of emotions you are feeling started to unsettle you. You seriously wanted to take your eyes off the show before you but you can't. There's so much internal conflict going on. A part of you is afraid of what will happen next. Yet another part seems to anticipate or even like it. It's literally fear clashing with your innermost want. Within a few minutes, Rainbow Dash ended the show with a sonic rainboom as she dropped down right in front of you.  Her wings flared wide open as her rose-colored eyes focused on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, there,\" Dash said gently, \"Welcome to \"The Rainboom\" where all sorts of needs get fulfilled. I'm Rainbow Dash but you probably already knew that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are wordless as the mare continued talking with her trademark smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't usually get human guests in here! What can I do for you, little guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" Dash dragged impatiently, \"There gotta be something you could asked the favor of...Right, perhaps I need to loosen up the tentacles to make you more comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the tentacles on you limbs and waist loosening and dissolving away back into the walls. You shot a glare at Rainbow Dash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ommph!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank goodness... Rainbow, what the buck were you thinking! You almost strangled me in that... passionate display of your techniques,\" you said with a hint of frustration, \"Care to explain about that little thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...What did you expect? This is a Stallion's Club! I was just trying to show you some of my awesome moves here. If you want to take it a step further, I could gladly accommodate that. Never thought that I would perform to a human though,\" Dash said as matter-of-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I never asked that you tie me up and watch you act. And just to get the message through: I'm not interested in this at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why are you here then? You don't just walk in here without knowing what's gonna happen?\" Dash asked as she crossed her arms, \"And that also raises the question, who are exactly and what's your purpose here? You aren't a changeling, are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash narrowed her eyes at you in suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I'm a mage and I...I was accidentally sent in here when you, or the real you, is have your little \"fun time\" with Big Mac.,\" you said as you glared daggers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That only partly answered my question,\" Dash commented, \"But what in the hay are you doing in him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was experimenting with my shrinking spell and I was living with Big Mac to understand a little more about pony anatomy. He was telling me about your heat-driven exploits on him when you came and did your thing. Look at what you did to the poor stallion. He'll probably hide in the barn for weeks because of you,\" you exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Everything has been getting worse for her these few months. This isn't entirely my fault,\" Dash said with a tinge of sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not your fault? How could you say that screwing Big Mac is not your fault?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, human...,\" the pegasus said affirmatively, \"I may look like Rainbow Dash but I'm not actually her. I am one of the many cells that sustain the pony herself. For some reasons, we are all identical to her, save for the fact that there are also male versions of her lurking around. We are all divided into sections and assigned different duties around the body. I happened to be in the \"Fantasy Fulfillment\" department, charged with intensifying whatever kinky thoughts she might have. If Dash has been acting real weird lately, you should bring the issue to the guys and gals at the \"Estrus Management\" and \"Self-Control\" Department. If they won't help you, get the \"Flight\" Department to help you out by disabling her wings.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Does this pony has more department than the Canterlot bureaucracy?</i>, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I verify if this is true, Rainbow, if I may call you that? The departments sounds awfully uncooperative if you ask me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's even worse. The department are extremely competitive with one another for recognition as the best. They just can't seem to agree on one goal for the future. It causes imbalances in Dash's stamina. For example, she's sometimes more active than Pinkie Pie on sugar. At other time, she's sleeping off for days at times. As for her recent heat problem, I figure it might be something similar going on there. I brought the issue of non-cooperation to the heads of various department. But they all write me off as weak, non-competitive, and most likely to have her flanks kicked in the face of danger. I guess I'm the only dissenting voice in this whole body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anyway I can help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can try if you want, but I don't think it's gonna change things much. The other cells rejected my complaints. What makes you think that they will listen to an 'outsider' human? They'll call the \"White Cells\" squad to get you...Okay, I'll be off my work shift in ten minutes. Maybe I could take you to my place in Dashville to get things worked out. The town's only a few tunnels up the spine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a town in here?\" you gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. And a beautiful one at that. Friendly ponies and loving families everywhere. All copies of Rainbow Dash. You'll fall in love with it at the first sight. I promise you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gotta be kidding me...\"</span></div></div>",

Intriguing show, you both exited of the club, returning back to Dash's Womb, Rainbow Cell (At least what you're calling her) you see that Big Mac's Semen is being absorbed by the floors, walls and ceilings, you follow her toward one side of the reproductive organ, she touch the surface few times then an with a loud rumble  an tunnel open up, showing a small spherical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to one of the ovary first, there is a shortcut that go the tunnels toward the Spine and the Wings\" the Rainbow Replica said you nodded. the elevator moves upward, there was a awkward silence, few minutes before she was giving you show of her asserts, then she was going to be your guide? there is a town here populated  of Dash's own cells that look exactly like her, there are stallion version of her too, here you're an outsider and there is multiples departments, now... who rules this place? of course<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Elevator stop and opens revealing an glowing spherical structure that was Dash's Ovary, tissues and nerves as well pulsating veins expanding like a spiderweb were noticeable in the large spherical organ, there was an small catwalk going toward the main entrance. \"Since Dash is no ready to be mother and probably never, We, The \"Fantasy Fulfillment\" department use them as headquarters, in estrus days. however, they are empty. You won't see nothing but empty rooms and bumps with egg cells, some of those cells are used for other things, normally, the \"Eggheads Association\" in the Brain use them for experiment, the town folks in Dashville has some for special events like the Rolling Egg Race, it won't happen until Next Dash Year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dash Year?\" you ask, she nodded, you both entered to the Ovary, you notice the Dark ambient, creating again an light ball, you see that you are in fleshy corridor with multiples rooms left open, it got an creepy feel but you saw some illumination coming from some rooms, as you walk further you saw that the illumination are from the very egg cells, you continue until you both arrive to the ovary's center, there was an car-sized platform, going to the platform, it activated and go upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, basically normal years except that is withing our world, Rainbow Dash herself.\" you nodded the platform exited the ovary going into another tunnel, few minute later, the platform stop, revealing a large hallway, instead of being made of flesh, it was white with some cerulean, The walls are covered with hard, plastic-like shells colored to match Dash's coat color. Dim lights are projected toward the arched ceiling which casts an even glow along the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are in the Spine's Path, see the dome there over there?\" You look at the end of the tunnel spotting an spherical wall, the only entrance was protected by two beings, Ponycells like your guide, but with White Coat instead of Dash's Cerulean. these must be the White Cells, you guessed but there is a thing... they both have Horns and Wings, like Royal Alicorns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about these guys, they are the Town-Only White Cells, they are no from the departments', if they see you with me, they will have some question that I hope you answer them, they... don't like outsider.\" You nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trek at the spine was uneventful, you asked her about the horns and wings of these white cells, they were glaring you as they spotted you with an a \"Pleasure\" cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you see, cells like me, are all replicas of the pony we live on but as I told you there are male version of her but there are also Earth and Unicorn version of her, some are human versions\" you stare her surprised \"Yes Human versions of Rainbow Dash, surprised?\" you nodded \" but there is also Alicorn version of Dash, they are not like Celestia or Luna or even Twilight, mind you, the white cells are created as alicorn for an optimal protection against outside danger like viruses and sometimes other 'outsiders' like you, mind you that there are other outside cells that live here in Rainbow Dash, believe me or not, Some cells of Rainbow's friends live here, as well some of the Wonderbolts and the Royalty, they came in a similar way but they accepted Rainbow Dash as their new home\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... I don't have words for it actually, are you actually telling me that some ponies that are like Rainbow Dash and Big Mac?\" you ask but before you get the answer you two were stopped by the White Cell's spears, luckily you maintained few meters from them, looking them with an neutral expression, all suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! Who and Where you come from, Outsider!\" one of the White Cells barked, by the tone and bulky built, this Dash Cell, was an stallion, their armor are similar to the Royal Guard except that isn't gold, their armor contain similar coloration to the wonderbolts's blue with yellow, the crest of their helmet was in similar color of Rainbow's Mane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... \" you try to but Rainbow's Hoof cover your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is a librarian, he is from one of Estrus' victim that our 'Master' milked before, remember? the Human she met yesterday? well he is from him\" She say to the guards, they look uncertainly before they could object, she continue \"I found him recently near the ovary's eggs storage, as you can see, he pretty much in bad state\" They inspect you as you smile awkwardly, they look at your dirty and tear up clothes, they nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our Apologies\" the other guard said, this one was exact replica of Dash except for her White Coat and Armor. \"Seems that the Estrus and Self Control Department are competing again, they will never learn, anyway, Welcome to DashVille, don't worry by other Dash Cell, few of the Town's Population are composed by others cells that come in similar way, have an nice stay in our master's body.\" the guards retreated their spears from you and let you two toward the passage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an Sign with Rainbow Dash's wings in it <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b><span class=\"cpblue\">WELCOME TO</span> <span class=\"cred\">D</span><span class=\"corange\">A</span><span class=\"ctan\">S</span><span class=\"cbyellow\">H</span><span class=\"clkhaki\">V</span><span class=\"cgreen\">I </span><span class=\"cteal\">L</span><span class=\"clblue\">L</span><span class=\"cindigo\">E</span></b></font><br>\r\n<font class=\"size3\" style=\"\"><b><span class=\"cred\">The most Awesome Town in Rainbow Dash!</span></b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nbefore entering the town. you were stopped by the same female guard. \"ehh.. if you see an Shining Armor Cell in the Town's library... give this to him\" She give you an small box with hearts, you saw her blushing before going back to her spot... you stare eye wide when she mentioned Shining Armor Cell, you heard your guide chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"before you said anything, the Rumors of \"Colorful Affair\" if you heard it\" You nodded, it was a rumor believing that Shining Armor was having an affair with another mare but that's months ago \"are all true\" she grinned proudly, while you stare her surprised.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once you walked through the gateway and the blushing White Cell guard, you officially entered the outskirts of Dashville proper. The town itself resembles an organic version of Los Pegasus. Another pegasus friend has once sent you a postcard from the city so you had some ideas of what it looks like. Like its real life counterpart, the tall buildings around downtown are built in the ancient Pegasi-style; their elongated columns and domed roofing made from clouds are some of the most beautiful examples of pony architecture you've seen. The only difference here is the fact that they're made from a combination opaque membranes and cartilages (for structural support). Imagine a cloud city 20 times the size of Cloudsdale and it will give you a rough idea of the size of Los Pegasus. Dashville seems to even exceed that. <i>My...a fully-functioning city right here in Rainbow Dash... Big Mac's nothing close to this. They even got parks and a river made from liquid rainbows. Goodness, how many things is Dash capable of producing with all this?!</i>, you mentally exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh...No matter how may times I stepped into this city, Dashville is always so beautiful,\u201d Rainbow Cell reminisced, \u201cCome on! Let's get going!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour guide smiled and flew ahead of you, leaving you to catch up with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Slow down there! Humans can't fly, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, I'm so used to doing this. I think you're the one who needs some adjusting here,\u201d the pegasus smirked, \u201cCatch ya later!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Rainbow Cell flew off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou focused your eyes on the flying pegasus as she weaved through the sky, which is light pink in color; there are even wisps of clouds dotting random spots above which adds to the great mystery of this city. The nearest destination from the city entrance is the <b>Rainbow Streams Park</b>. Rainbow Cell landed beside the sign marking the entrance to the park and motioned for you to follow her. When you entered the park, you noticed that almost all of the ponies in here are copies are Rainbow Dash; a sea of rainbow manes is all that you could see. Like your guide told you, there are unicorn and earth pony versions of Dash relaxing and playing around, engaging in all sorts of recreational activities you'd see in Canterlot Park on a sunny weekend. Much to your astonishment, there are also \u201cfamilies\u201d; a male and female Dash with several adorable fillies and colts versions of Dash running and laughing around. Despite being identical to their 'master', it seems that there are still subtle differences in their manestyles and supposed personality. As an example, you saw one reading an organic-looking book underneath the shade of a \u201ctree\u201d (which looks more like something you would find in a lung) and another doing loops in midair like a hyperactive filly. One of them kept her mane long and flowing while another had it in a mohawk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could do further analysis of your new environment, a male voice suddenly interrupted your thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Dash! Long time no see. How's your work at \u201cFantasy Fulfillment\u201d doing lately?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe source of the voice is a male Rainbow Cell a few feet in front of you two. He's wearing a safety helmet and a uniform with a wing lapel pin on it. The pegasus has the same coat and eye color as the real Rainbow Dash, but he kept his mane brushed up in a spiked fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, nothing much. Just more news about the 'master's' estrus getting out of control and I having to fulfill every one of those thoughts despite how much I hate it. I bet that \u201cFlights and Wing Maintenance\u201d is doing much better for you.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSad to hear that! The Cells running \u201cEstrus Management\u201d and \u201cSelf Control\u201d department just can't seem to put their differences aside and just had to ruin it for everycell here,\u201d the male pony said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. It's no use arguing with those foals...,\u201d Rainbow Cell laments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow! Who's that you're bringing with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, this is a human librarian. This guy here got here by the way of another estrus victim due to the competition at the aforementioned departments,\u201d Rainbow Cell scowled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother victim? So fast? I thought that the 'master' is done with humans already. My...he looks absolutely awful. He really needs some patching up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's precisely what I'm going to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI see...Anyway, weIcome to Dashville. I'm <b>Rainbow Cell #8347932</b> but you can call me Blazer for convenience,\u201d Blazer said while shaking your hand with his hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d you nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're really lucky that she found you, human guest. Rainbow Cell #0974564 here is a very caring cell, you see. Feel free to call her Dashie if you feel like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlazer! I though we're though with discussing my nickname!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut it sounds better than a string of numbers, Dashie,\u201d Blazer smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's none of your business. If you got nothing important to say, I haven't got all day with you. Bye!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Cell (you are calling her that for now lest 'Dashie' incurs her wrath)  dragged you away from the stallion and led you out of the park and onto the streets where even more cells are flying around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust ignore that guy, human. He's a former coworker who loves to pull jokes on me,\u201d R. Cell said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the way, the both of you remained silent. A few turns down the block, you reached a low-rise building marked: <b>T. Cumulus Building</b>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we are, 2132 Cirrus Lane,\u201d R. Cell announced as she led you inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Cell's home is on the 5th floor of the building. A ride in a spherical elevator, the designated floor is reached and a wall appeared in the front. R. Cell tapped her hoof on the wall in a specific pattern like some sort of password and the wall opened immediately, showing her home for you to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer home is vastly different from the organic world outside. It neither big nor small but very comfortable-looking. It's looks like the typical apartment in any of the cities in Equestria. The kitchen is right by the doorway but it's furnished with appliances and equipments you've never seen before. The living room is colorfully decorated: the couch and the tables are all rainbow-colored while the \"carpeting\" is cerulean. A large rectangular mirror is placed opposite of the couch. <i>That's a really strange place to put a mirror.</i>  Many recruitment posters from a \"Elite Rainbow Corps\" is pasted on the walls. From the look of the slogans: <b><i>Only the Best Cells Gets In</i></b>, you guessed that it's some inner-body counterpart of the Wonderbolts. Another hole allows you to look into her bedroom, which is designed to mimic the surface of clouds and the colors of the sky. A picture of Rainbow Dash in her victorious posture is hung prominently in an alcove in the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Cell led you to the couch and motioned for you to have a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my humble home, human. It's Anything I could get you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing I could think of now., Rainbow Cell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can just call me Dash,\" the pegasus smiled, \"Rainbow Cell sounds awfully bland like the rest of the others here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so, Dash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then... I bet you're having a lot of questions in your head right now. Feel free to ask anything you wanna know. Fire Away, then.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You had your questions about... virtually everything, why the departments are so fixated about competitions instead of mutual cooperation. They are more like rivals, enemies perhaps? Dash say that it caused imbalance to her stamina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" you started, \"While I was in Big Mac, his body was almost like a living city. Rather than a body with each organs acting like facilities, living apartments and so on. Here in Rainbow Dash, it's like another world entirely, I mean, Big Mac doesn't have this kind of city or even inhabitants! Yes, I saw some cells that looks like him but not in populated areas like this functioning city. Are there more cities like Dashville in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seem to ponder in what you asked her. \"Yes... there is Teatbeach, as you can guess, it's in Rainbow's teats. It's a beautiful vacation town where everycell can enjoy drinking and swim of our master's milk. It's nutritious and delicious, especially during her season. Livertown is in the liver, obviously. It is mostly a working town where most of the cell-ponies there are involved in the creation of new enzymes for the stomach, sugar's mining, and the creation of other chemicals to maintain the body. There is El Pulmon, which is in the lungs, where you can enjoy gambling, shopping and the wild nightlife, and where the Rainbow Corps live. And finally, there is the Head City, all the departments are there, also where the Dash Council is based. There is a rumor that our own master knows about us and have an avatar of her acting as queen.. but that's only a rumor and I find a quite silly if you ask me. There are other small towns all across Rainbow's body, for example we missed one that was in the womb's tubes, Foaltown, they have evacuated I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Intriguing... what about the Dashes cells here, are all like the real dash?\" you asked. Dash looked at you unamused, in fact, a little insulted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Is there something wrong?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I look like an arrogant, brash, hotheaded fool that goes around seeking every opportunity for cheap greatness?\" she snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no...I'm sorry if I offended you and-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, it's okay... actually, that's a really common question from foreign cells that lives in our master's body. Sorry if I snapped; every cells in here gets a little affected by the 'master.' As for your question about the personalities of the cells, each Rainbow Cell have a very different and unique personality, some changed their coat to another color and even adopt new names but in order to still be Rainbow Cell, you at least need to leave your mane multicolored,\" she answered while you nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That brings to mind another question: what do most of the foreign cells do in here? I presume that most of the works in here are already occupied by the Rainbow Cells.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's easy. They are given the right to live in Dash's body under the condition that they do not cause any harm to it or any other cells. They will be placed under the constant watch of the White Cells to root out any viruses or beings that intend to wreak havocs. Any violations of the terms would mean arrest and interrogation by the Rainbow Corps and sentence varying from lengthy community services in the Colon to outright expulsion. As for the jobs they do, the foreign cells have the opportunity to join any of the work associations in all parts of the body or participate in the various departments as advisers. Though, for obvious reasons, 'Leading Adviser' is the highest position they can attain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With all this economic activities going on, is there some kind of currency system used in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is the Dashcoin which is basically the same thing as the Equestrian bits. Yeah, I know how unoriginal that name is. But don't blame me, tell that to the Dash Council. They're the one calling the crappy shots around here. I just happen to read a lot about the outside world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fascinating , but the million-bits (or Dashcoin) question remains unanswered: why won't the departments cooperate with each other? It's really counterproductive and a threat to the integrity of Rainbow Dash if you ask me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No pony knows when the rivalry started. Some said that it's because of Rainbow Dash personalities, who are the owners of each department are in a very complicate relationship, Anger, lust, Love, Happiness, Pride, intelligence. All of the Personalities blame each other for lacking Common Sense. Since then, they don't get along well. As a consequence of this, each department's cells developed a dislike of their rivals over the years, they have become unstable and are affecting our master herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That explains Rainbow's constant erratic behavior and mood swings. It absolutely made her a trainwreck of a pony at times if the rumors flying around Ponyville are to be believed. There must be some ways I can help,\" you said, There has to be some ways to improve Dash's performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately no. As I told you before, they won't listen to you. They won't even listen to my complaints for goodness sake. You're just another weak outsider in their eyes and if you provoke them, the worst thing that will happen to you is being condemned to the Intestines Prison, bladder expulsion, or worse, the stomach execution lake, or exile through estrus activities. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it possible to talk with one of them, or at least convince a small minority about their shortcomings?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe... Lust Dash and Love Dash. The \"Sister\" are the only one that have a good relationship, they own the <b>Estrus and Love Departments</b> as well \"Fantasy Fulfillment. They usually go to Teatbeach for vacation to escape the usually stressful brain office. Love Dash is dating Shy Dash, while Lust have her hooves on Anger and Pride. Intelligence, happiness and Sadness are at odds with the sisters but you can start with them, they \"enjoy\" meeting new cells\" she finished, I hope this new information clears up a lot of things. All you need to do is to talk with them and convince the other personalities to work together, that's will probably change the views of the departments at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's some good news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But don't count too much on that. Lust and Love can be a little imposing and arrogant at times. But if you stay on their good sides, you're generally safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded in acknowledgment. An abrupt growl from your stomach made you blush as Dash giggled like a filly while rolling on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be starving right now. That reminds me, I'm eating out today at my favorite restaurant, my treat. Rainbow Dash is probably still napping and having whatever weird stuffs the Dreams Entertainment is playing for her. It'll be hours before she wakes up and cell activities increase. Let's use this time to get the best at the restaurant. It'll get real crowded at regular time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash headed for the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey wait up there, Dash. Where exactly are we going? Back at The Rainboom?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. We're going to <b>Brae's Waterhole</b>.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brae's Waterhole is situated on the crossroad between Hurricane Blvd and Firefly Rd, a few blocks down from Dash's apartment. In stark contrast to its surrounding, the establishment was designed with the feel and aesthetic of a hearty, South Equestrian restaurant. That region tends to be on the rural, undeveloped side but the farm ponies there made up for that with their hospitality. You guessed that the owner is likely a foreign cell given that Rainbow Dash was born in Cloudsdale. The faux-wooden boardings and timber construction of the building quickly catches your attention. A large billboard placed on the roof of the structure proudly advertised in bold capital letters: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BRAE'S WATERHOLE</b> <br>\r\n<u><i>A Western Taste for Everycell</i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash led you through a set of wooden doors into the restaurant. The atmosphere immediately reminds you of a barn. Wood barrels, troughs, and the oil lamps on the wood tables welcomed and immersed you in their rustic simplicity. A few other cells are slowly gathering in as it approached dinner time. You and Dash found a table and sat down on the bales of hay which doubles as the seats. As the servers were busy managing the other tables, Dash started to talk with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This here is my favorite spot, mage,\" Dash said proudly, \"You get a nice view of almost all the tables in the restaurant and, most of all, the diners. Unlike others who just focused on their foods, I just love to see all the different cells coming and leaving through the doors and wonder about which department they're working in or what were their thoughts when they trotted to their table. It's just an interesting way to observe you own surrounding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did the same thing pretty often back outside. What do you think about the cells around you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frankly, I think a good half of them are either average at best or outright boring at worst. Many of them supported the competition among the departments without thinking for the long term. They believed that division would create a stronger cell population and maintain the status quo, which they love to euphemistically say as 'that's what makes Rainbow Dash Rainbow Dash.' There are a few bright spots like me around the body but they are gradually being outnumbered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sad to see the jerks slowly taking over the rational cells here. All it takes is a few idiots to ruin it for everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd use stronger expressions if we weren't in a public area,\" Dash remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to continue your conversation with Dash but you were interrupted by a yellow earth pony trotted over to the side of the table. He is wearing a large Stetson upon his golden-brown mane and a brown vest covered his body. The stallion has a large red apple for a cutie mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Dash. Welcome to the Waterhole. Pleasure to have your company again. What can I get you on this fine afternoon, miss?\" he greeted with a southeastern accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just have the usual, Brae,\" Dash replied with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I saved some of your favorites: enzyme burger with a side of mitochondria salad and an iced glucose tea. Wow! And I see you even a brought a friend here. Always nice to know new guys around here! Might I have the pleasure of knowing who he is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, Brae. This guy over here is a human librarian I found in the Rainbow Dash's womb. He told me that he was doing \"anatomy research\" in a stallion when our 'master' unfortunately found the pony an easy target under the control of her estrus-crazed mind. This human was unfortunately sent in here with the rest of the stallion's contents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! I'm so sorry to hear about that. I know how bad RD could be in her heat. If it weren't for you, Miss Dash, I'd probably be a goner now. Dash's body is nothing like the old one I'm from but I'm getting quite used to seeing all the different Rainbow Cells 'round here. Sadly, though, I never found out what she did to my 'master' after being sent down here. I just wish I could give that mare a piece of my mind!\" Brae shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to mention that, Brae! I think we can all agree that some serious changes to Rainbow Dash is needed,\" Dash concurred. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare turned her attention to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to leave you out of the loop, human. This nice-looking cell here is Braeburn. But he prefers to be called Brae. He's the owner of this place and one of the better known foreign cells.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasure to meet you, Brae,\" you offered your hands to the stallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here,\" he said as he offered his hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice restaurant you have here. The atmosphere in here is certainly a nice diversion from the outside,\" you complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks a lot!\" Brae smiled, \"South Equestria has a lot more to offer than the city folks tends to think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might I ask how did you end up here in Rainbow Dash, anyway?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrae's expression immediately became uncomfortable at the topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhh...Don't ask about that? He just recently recovered from the trauma! Dash whispered hushly, He got in here about a year ago when Rainbow Dash found and played with his 'master' one night in a town called Appleloosa. I'll leave out the details of how he got transmitted here for sake of your sanity. Let's just called it unconventional methods. I found this poor guy stranded in the Colon barely conscious. I couldn't just watch another cell get hurt like that so I brought him to my place and nursed him back to health. But, to my surprise, Brae here is a really resilient fella. After rehabilitating for a month or so, he decided to open up this restaurant as a way to remember his old home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must apologize, Brae. I didn't know that,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. A lot of the cells here asked me that same thing. You won't be the last one to have asked that question,\" the stallion smiled and returned to a cheerful demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever since his place opened up, Brae provided us Rainbow Cells with a refreshing change from the bland foods they serve at our sorry excuse for a cafeteria. After a year, virtually everycell in town is talking about his restaurant,\" Dash continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shucks! I'm flattered, Miss Dash! That's nothing, I'm just doing what I love here and that is satisfying the appetites of everycell,\" Brae blushed, \"Oh, I almost forgot. What can I get for your human friend here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn expression of realization struck Dash's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm.....,\" she wondered for a while, \"Ummmm...Brae, could you please get the menu for us?\" the mare asked with an awkward expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, absolutely. I'll be right back with one, Miss Dash. Just sit tight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrae trotted away to another corner in the restaurant and disappeared behind a set of doors. Once Dash made sure that the coast was clear, she turned back to you with a sheepish grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly do you cell eat here?\" you whispered to Dash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...heh....Have you ever tried lipid fries, baked sphingomyelin pies, or peptide drinks before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".......\" you stared at her with an incredulous expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, well. I guess it's time for you to try out some awesome new food,\" Dash smirked mischievously.</span></div></div>",

Eventually, Scootaloo's massive tongue brought you and her meal towards her throat and swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip down Scootaloo's throat was short albeit fun.

My thoughts of it being nicknamed a cannon seemed pretty apt at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All fer me?\" Applejack asked back, grinning underneath her brother as she spread those hindlegs, Her dark tan netherlips and tailhole revealed as that brotherly dick rubbed up and down along the member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeyup.\" Big Mac shuddered and pushed forward.  The scrotum wagged about at the sudden thrust into those sisterly folds as the red stallion started to claim his orange sister.  The two ponies groaning loudly, making love despite any sort of cultural or genetic taboo.  Big Mac's back shuddered as he started his pace, bucking firmly inside the smaller mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack was taking it like a champ, though, squeezing and massaging that large penetration.  She huffs and groans some more, \"Nnnnnngh, n-now seriously... b-better not cum in me.  We'd be havin' a mess of explainin' to do in ponyville.\"  She did love her brother dearly, but since she became the Element of Honesty, trying to keep this sort of thing a secret would be mighty difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdjusting the projection, I was able to watch as Big Mac's member shoved deep into his sisterly channel.  That huge flared crown slamming and bruising AJ's cervix with his continued need.

Although invulnerable to digestion, you still feel a slight ticklish sensation. It was a comfortable place to be. The warm, pouch-like enclosure of the stomach gently shook as Pinkie Pie trotted over to the oven to retrieve a tray of freshly baked cookies. The pony lifted the tray and placed the fragrant treats into a glass jar on the counter. \"Mmmmm...The cookies sure looks good today,\" she said as she tried one. Pinkie then went about rearranging the cupcakes and assorted pastries under the display case while humming a little tune to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the stomach, you swam around the acid for some times before deciding that you had enough and found a dry area to stand on. You rested on the soft bouncy floor and looked up at the opening of the esophagus releasing more chewed pieces of cookies and cakes. Listening to Pinkie humming so happily really soothes your mind. That pony always seem cheerful and lovely no matter the time and situation. At least that is what other residents of Ponyville told you. As the minutes flew by, you got bored of guessing what Pinkie will be eating next so you stood up and take a look around. A few puddles away, you located another opening in the stomach wall. Normally, you wouldn't pay much attention to such little things but you counted two openings in the stomach. If one leads to the intestines, where does this one go? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou curiously walked toward the opening and found a flight of stairs for you to climb. You slowly tread up the steps wary of anything that might come your way. The stairs led up into a fancy-looking lobby filled with streamers and colorful furniture. A large banner with \"Pinkie Pie Welcomes You\" written in silly lettering hung from the ceiling. Several other banners are colored in bright pink and blue. In the center of the lobby, much to your surprise, a gleeful looking Pinkie was rushing toward you with a big grin on her face. You were knocked down by the sheer force she propelled herself into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh...oh my gosh...oh my gosh...I can't believe I have a visitor in here. Hi there, I'm Pinkie Pie and how did you get here?\" the party pony smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm... I'm\u2013\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Lemme guess.

And I must say that you are the weirdest one I've seen yet,\" you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a human mage?! Woo-hoo, I just got the first visitor in my body and it's a human!

The suit goes limp in your hands, indicating that Fluttershy's no longer at the proverbial helm. You see that the head has a set of goggles and a microphone near the hole for the face. Seeing no other openings on the suit, you start slide one of your legs in. \"Hey Fluttershy, I just realised that I don't know how to turn control on and off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be in control once you are fully in the suit and slide the goggles over your eyes.

You like there was something on your side and back when there wasn't before and you felt that you were laying on your stomach. You slowly open your eyes and see that you're on a couch. You cast your eyes down and see that you were laying your head on a yellow set of hooved forelegs. You get up and lay your back against the couch see Fluttershy's living room, but in a much more normal size than before. You look down and see a yellow body and forelegs with a long pink tail. You can see three butterflies on each of your flanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it...\" You say in a voice that's not your own. \"I'm...

The stairs all grayish and dim, lighted only by an occasional candle on the wall. You've never felt this afraid before seeing that there are far worst places you've seen on your journey through outer Equestria. <i>Could it be? Does this mean that some part of Fluttershy's personality still lingers even when I'm in control? This place doesn't seem like the typical Ponyville shop being all dark and shady; definitely not the kind of place a pony would wander in.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cpink\">'Ummmmm....let's go back...'</span></i> a faint voice said. It sounded as if it came from your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha....huh? Fluttershy?

I'm merely the dormant entity; you are currently controlling me using your mind and conscious. My own conscious is separate and still taking in my five senses. Meaning I....can still talk.... with you as a passenger even when you're controlling me.'</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy's voice trembled and sounds fearful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't sound too well in there. Is it because of this strange new place I'm going to?\"<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\"><i><br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">'.........yes...please...</font>can we go somewhere else? I don't like the feeling of this.

I've encountered a lot of worse things as a mage. Reanimated animals, hydras, dragons, spell-welding sorcerers, etc. etc. You get the idea. If anything goes wrong I can protect you using my spells. I promise you that it'll be just a quick look, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\"><i>'..............eeeee....I don't know about this....this place is a frequent hangout bar for griffons and other meat-eating animals. Have you visited this place before?'</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. This is my first time. I saw a cloaked pony heading down here and figured that he might be up to something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cpink\">'......*sigh*....Looks like there's no stopping your curiosity.

The place felt cold, chilly even. It took you a while to get your eyes (or Fluttershy's in this case) used to the dimness of the place. You gradually saw wooden tables and chairs and a bar counter on the other side of the chamber. The bartender is a unicorn who was busy wiping several glasses held in his magic. A phonograph piped out a light, calming music. Several griffons are banded together playing cards at one table while two changelings are seated at the counter drinking something you can't make out. There are even a couple of ponies down here chatting at their tables lit only by candles. You realized that some of them have slit eyes and bat wings, indicating that they're batponies, a rarely-seen species of pony serving in the Night Court of Princess Luna. Save for the darkness and the unappetizing place name, the bar looks like any you would find. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Fluttershy. What bring you here? I didn't expect to see you here at 'The Carnivore's Cavern'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" You spun around and came face to face with a pony in a cloak. The same one that you followed down here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha...You need to see the look on your face. Tell me, have you been improving on your fears lately? The last time I mentioned coming to this place with Gilda, you got all queasy and sick for a whole day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\"><i><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">'Oh my...what's she doing here.'</font></i></span> Fluttershy said. She seemed to recognized the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this, Fluttershy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you received an answer, the cloaked pony pulled off her hood and revealed her features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's actually nice to see more ponies trying out our more exotic menus. Although you need to exercise some caution since it's likely your first time trying meat. Is there anything else you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Thank you. That would be all,\" Rainbow said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay then. If you need anything, just tell me. Enjoy your meal!\" the pony said before trotting away to other customers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set your sights on the dish before you. There are several strips of chicken meat laid on a bed of lettuce, onions, carrots, tomatoes, and sweet peppers. The fruity dressing smells wonderful and made your (Fluttershy's) stomach growl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what are you waiting for? Dig in!\" Dash smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Um... please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh at the fact that you've been caught; Fluttershy knows that you're in her brain.Lying to her would probably only make things much worse for you, so the only real option you have left is to come clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm mage who is very interested in pony anatomy.

Well, as long as you aren't causing any harm, I'd say that you're free to explore any part of my body that you choose.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you Miss Fluttershy, thank you! I swear that I won't betray your trust!\" You can't help but smile wide at the permission that Fluttershy has give you. This truly must be your lucky day. As you glance around the hallway again, a thought occurs to you. \"Y'know Miss Fluttershy, I must say that I really wasn't expecting to stairs and hallways with metal doors inside a pony. It does make the tour a bit more interesting though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can thank Princess Twilight Sparkle for that. She cast a spell on the other element bearers and we so that we can act as living fortresses to protect Equestria's citizens in case of an emergency.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does sound really cool, though I have to wonder safe of a fortress you would be if I could get to important parts of your brain before you were alerted to my presence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, my body's magically enhanced immune system detected you the instant you touched the door in my ear, it just didn't consider you a threat because it scanned you mind and heart, determining that you're a good person. I eventually took personal notice of you when you started to near important sections of my brain. If you were considered a threat by either me or my immune system, armoured white versions of me made from my white blood cells pounce on you and either expel you from my body... or... they would destroy you.\" You gulp when she says this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well I guess the term \"living fortress\" is pretty accurate of a name with defences like that. It actually does seem really safe to me... and I'm sorry if I interrupted a pleasant dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry about that, it was just a little dream that I've had many times before. If you want, I would be more than happy to give you a tour of my body while you're inside me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Fluttershy.\" You say as you give a bow. \"I accept your great and wonderful.

You then walk into through the open door and see what the room for her internal controls look like. The first thing that catches your eye is a fancy looking waist high column in the center of the room that had a statue of Fluttershy perched on top of it, it was bathed in a blue light from above. All around the wall of the room were various monitors and control panels that displayed all sort of different statistics about Fluttershy body like temperature, hormone level and whatnot. You slowly step closer to the centre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Fluttershy, what's with this statue?\" You inquire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Statue?\" Fluttershy seemed very confused by what you said. You hear a strange whirring sound coming from above you. Glancing upwards, you see what looks like a security camera emerge from the organic wall, but instead of a lense, this camera had what looked like one of Fluttershy's eyes in the centre. \"I don't know where that statue came from, it wasn't there when Twilight guided me through here when she first cast the spell on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" You rub your hand against your chin in curiouscity. \"Now that's real mystery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou believe the best course of action you could take with the mysterious statue is to...</span></div></div>",

As you get closer, you end up tripping over your own feet and crash into the statue, knocking it off its pedestal. You hear a loud crash when it impacts against the floor. You look over that see that the statue has been smashed to pieces. You scramble off the pillar and move beside the statue's remains, hoping that you could somehow fix it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry, Fluttershy! I promise that... I'll...\" You felt that something was very wrong when you saw that light above the pillar changed from a light blue to blood red. There was a harsh hissing sound as the top of the pillar opened up and a new statue emerged from it. This new statue looked a lot like Fluttershy, but there were several things wrong with it. In place the soft looking birdlike wings were sharp looking bat wings. While the face on the first statue had a kind looking smile, this one had seemed to hissing and sporting a sharp pair of fangs. The last thing you notice was that her mane was ragged looking and her ears were curved and jagged at the tips. \u201cFluttershy, why does this statue of you look li-\u201d You stopped talking when you heard Fluttershy give a sick sound groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026 Mage, I don\u2019t feel so good\u2026\u201d You\u2019re really worried now, uncertain what your accident had done to Fluttershy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to you, Fluttershy\u2019s body started to go through a radical change.  Her wings were changing into batwings; her ears were changing shape and become more sensitive and two of her teeth had shifted into fangs. Her eyes soon snapped open, revealing that they were blood red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no\u2026\u201d You heard Fluttershy speak again. \u201cThis is bad\u2026 this is very bad!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFluttershy, speak to me! What\u2019s going on? What can I do to help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just saw in a mirror, I\u2019ve been turned into Flutterbat again!\u201d She shouts out as her body start to shake, she must be on the move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlutterbat? What\u2019s Flutterbat?\u201d You nervously scratch your arm as you question the frightened mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long story, but the important thing right now is that I\u2019m not in control of my body!\u201d You can feel all the colour drain away from you face as the panicked mare speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bat mare was practically ransacking the kitchen, searching for the fruit that she was driven to eat. Finding none, she ran out the back of the house. She used her wing to shield her eyes from the setting sun. She was about to rush back into the house when she caught the scent of apples on the wind. Once she determined the direction that the delicious smell was coming from, she spread her wings and took off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tumble to the floor as Fluttershy\u2019s body takes to the sky. You quickly get to your feet, despite the turbulence. \u201cW-w-what\u2019s happening?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy body is now under control of a vampire fruit bat\u2019s drive to find and eat fruits, specifically apples. I can\u2019t control of my body anymore; I can see, hear and feel everything my body\u2019s doing, but I can\u2019t stop it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Fluttershy, this is all my fault. I just don\u2019t get how breaking a statue could have caused this.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it may be somewhat of a metaphor or something that was made physical by the living fortress spell. The bat\u2019s instincts and drives weren\u2019t removed from me, but suppressed. Twilight\u2019s spell made my mind the dominant one in my body again while the bat\u2019s instincts were buried deep inside me and sealed away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that makes some sense, but I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019m really unfamiliar with all these different spells and the effect of them combining.\u201d You briefly ponder, trying to come up with a possible solution. \u201cFluttershy, do you think that if I pushed the bat statue back down into the pillar, you would be in control again?\u201d She remains silent for a moment as she considers your plan. <br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll work unless you can repair the original statue. Can you do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so. I learned how to repair flesh, not stone.\u201d You then take a deep breath. \u201cI still think that I should try to push the bat statue down. I think the worst case scenario would be it does nothing, so I think we should give it a try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, it does seem worth a shot. I just hope I don\u2019t end up eating all the apples at Sweet Apple Acres\u2026\u201d You hop up onto the pillar and place your hands down on the statue\u2019s snout and shoulder.  As you push down, it does\u2026</span></div></div>",

The angry mare was soon flanked by Twilight Sparkle, Rainbow Dash and Big Macintosh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand it; the last spell should have removed all traces of the bat from her system...\" The young princess was perplexed by this pony's predicament. \"Applejack, you wouldn't happen have another giant apple to spare, would you?\" She said as she started to sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eenope.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we could just get Big Mac to shake his flank at her!\" Twilight and Applejack both groaned at Rainbow suggestion while Big Mac stared down at the ground, his face becoming even redder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do y'all really she that she'd fall fer that cuz his cutie mark is a big green, apple?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That and I think it looks pretty big and juicy.\" Rainbow sticks out her tongue as Big Mac's face become redder still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Flutterbat reach for another apple to feast upon, she feels her hunger for apples vanish and replaced with something else. Now she was hungry for blood. She looked back at the four standing before her and no longer saw them as other creature that would keep her from her food, now they were her prey. She swooped down and lunged at Applejack, who barely dodged the bite that was aimed at her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! What in tarnation is going on?!\" Applejack yelled as her and her companions started to run away from the crazed mare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't AJ,\" Twilight called out as her horn started to light up. \"But I'm going to find out!\" She then disappeared in a flash of light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...

You turn over and see that a disoriented Princess Twilight Sparkle was above you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... what did I crash into?\" Once she regains her focus, her eyes widen before they harden into a glare. She points her now glowing horn at your throat. \"Who are you?! What are you doing in Fluttershy's head?!\" She snaps at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight, wait!\" Fluttershy's voice call out, making the alicorn pull back and stop her horn from glowing. \"This Mage is my friend, and me turning into a bloodthirsty bat was an accident!\" As Fluttershy talks, the purple princess climbs off you. \"That smashed statue was what suppressed the bat. If you can fix it, I'll go back to normal.\" Twilight nods at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While that's a good plan, it will take longer to repair this statue than explaining and enacting this other plan I've concocted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the plan, your highness?\" You ask her as you get back on your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll need your help with this Mage.

You can still hear Rainbow's loud snoring even through the layers of flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stepped into the room, a membrane formed and sealed off the way you came in. You're suddenly fearful about what's gonna happen next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard Rainbow gave a long yawn that shook the floor. The chamber gradually brightened as two holes opened in front of you. You could see Dash's bed and her hooves moving about as she shifted her body. The view moved toward a dresser mirror where you saw the Pegasus' smirking face and a bad case of bedhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha and welcome aboard the one and only Rainbow Dash!\"</span></div></div>",

You can basically feel the smugness radiating from the pegasus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To show you around my tight, aerodynamic body, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes went wide at Dash's remark. A deep blush showed itself on your cheek. <i>Are ponies this frank when it comes to relationship? Goodness, is Dash into humans too?</i> The pegasus looked at your flushing face and frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Don't get any weird ideas, alright? I'm just taking you on a trip in my body,\" Dash glared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you probably should better phrase your sentences,\" you retorted, \"Using vocabularies like 'tight' and 'aerodynamic' gives it a more intimate implication, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grahh... I only knew you for less than a few hours and you're starting to sound exactly like an egghead friend of mine named Twilight Sparkle. Anyway, just follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed the rainbow mare out of the bedroom and into a long hallway. It is very narrow with only several inches of space remaining on either side of you. The best analogy you could think of: it's like walking through a water pipe that's just big enough for you to walk through. The walls are covered with hard, plastic-like shells colored to match Dash's coat color. Dim lights are projected toward the arched ceiling which casts an even glow along the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, we are traveling along the interior of my spine which is the main way for you to access the three sections of my body. It is divided into head, midsection, and the tail; each area contains about 10 organs on average.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a lot of place to visit, Dash. Just to be on the safe side. Are there any places where access is restricted or forbidden?\" you inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually yes. I have a few rules I would like you to observe,\" Dash said, suddenly putting on a serious expression. The mare turned around toward you and snapped at attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" you said, slightly shocked at Dash's sudden change of tone from a casual into one that would sure make the Wonderbolts proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention! Because you are now in my body, you hereby subject yourself to regulations set by me, Airmare Rainbow Dash. In addition to following my instructions at all times, I request that you refrain from entering my brain or cockpit center. Those are restricted areas that are still above your level. During your stay, you are required to report for training at Dash Flight Academy located in the heart each weekday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me remind you, mage, if you failed to observe my rules, I can take you down into the 'brig chamber'. During your stay there, you will be only be provided with basic meals. Your rights to explore my body will be suspended for as long as I see fit. The length of your stay in there depends on the severity of your violation. Repeat violations will result in me putting you on \"Intestine duty\" for two weeks. As for the work details, I'll let you fill in the rest. That is all, mage. Dismiss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing her 5-minute military rant, Dash softened her expression and wore her usual confident smile. You were completely stunned by her loud, imposing voice and sharp looks. For a moment, you thought you were being yelled at by the Royal Guard Captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the buck was that all about? You nearly gave me a heart attack!\" you exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bwahahaha...Just a little thing I'd always wanted to do,\" the pony giggled, \"You see, I've seen my commander Spitfire did it but I was always on the receiving end of it.   Heh heh heh... But now I have my very own \"cadet\" now, I can be the one doing the shouting now. You'll sure see more of my military persona. Let's head for the academy for some Rainbow Dash-style orientation.\"</span></div></div>",

Her mouth opens up before you, like a massive red cave of uncertainty.  You enter her mouth and the tongue instantly throws you to the back of the throat, and you smack against something hard.  Meanwhile, Rainbow Dash wakes up slightly.  Inside her mouth, the teeth clench shut with a mighty thud and you are engulfed in darkness.  You realise you are hanging on to her uvula, dangling menacingly over the dark ominous blackness of Dash's throat, and so you hang on for your life.<br>\r\n        Rainbow Dash woke up and flew down to Ponyville to see what was going on.  She decided to get a cake from the bakery with Pinkie Pie, and as she opened her mouth to bite, you are blinded by the light that suddenly seeps into her mouth.  The teeth open wide to reveal the cake and the next thing you know, the mouth is active: teeth chomping, saliva working, tongue tossing lumps of cake.  \"Huh, tastes like there's a new ingredient, Pinkie\" Dash said, savouring each bite.   Inside her mouth, the uvula sways as you realise you can reach various parts of her head now that you're inside.
