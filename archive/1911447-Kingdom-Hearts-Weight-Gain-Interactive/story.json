You have all gathered her for a purpose. As you all know, Master Xehanort as his vessels have issued the challenge to face them in the Keyblade graveyard. However, the time is not yet right to strike at them, for we need more time to prepare and we need to think of a solution that will prevent the X-Blade from ever being forged again.\" the wise and experience Master Yen Sid spoke to the individuals gathered in front of him.  Located in his tower which existed on an offshoot of the realm of light, it was very difficult to detect and would be safe from any would-be attackers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thus, within this time-frame, myself and King Mickey have decided that it would be best to separate you all and guard the Seven Princess of Light.\" All present chattered among themselves, many agreeing that it would be the best option to go with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now, I will list the individuals to go with the respective Princess of Heart. Group number one will consist of Sora and Namine. Your princess to guard will be Kairi.\" A boy with spiky brown hair, clad in a black outfit and a girl with shoulder length blonde hair a blue eyes walked up. Alongside them was a girl that looked nearly identical to the blonde, but with red hair and a pink dress. The three nodded with each other and returned back to their places.  Continuing on, the robed man with his wizard hat continued to list the following groups:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroup 2: Aqua/Ventus guarding Cinderella<br>\r\nGroup 3: Lea guarding Alice<br>\r\nGroup 4: Riku/Xion guarding Snow white<br>\r\nGroup 5: Mickey guarding Aurora<br>\r\nGroup 6: Donald and Goofy guarding Belle<br>\r\nGroup 7: Roxas guarding Jasmine<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the preparations were set and each group was set to travel to their designated worlds.</span></div></div>",

Once it was done, the trio found themselves in a dark world, but not one claimed by the Heartless or the new Organization. No, this world's darkness had a more friendly tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora grinned as recognition lit up his features. Dashing towards a nearby gate, he hollered out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gate opened, revealing a town square and all manner of ghoulish creatures.

They're waiting in my home. Follow me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora did so, nearly dragging Kairi and Namine after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's home was quite large for the slim skeleton and easily fit the trio. Once up on Jack's bedroom, the three all smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquall, for his part, just nodded towards them. Tifa, on the other hand, embraced the three in a tight hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been awhile, hasn't it?\" the mighty brawler asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I'm glad we're here now,\" Kairi said.

Squall and Tifa were a bit on edge in staying in such a weird place, nothing in the Radiant Garden libraries ever described such a world. Just to be safe, Squall kept his hand on the gunblade strapped to his back. Kairi and Namine were calm, the former due to her immense trust in Sora and the later having access to Sora's memories in the past. The walk up the tower was rather quiet sans Jack blithering on about how with everyone around, he would get amazing inspiration for next year's Halloween. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Dr. Finklestein! I brought everyone!\" shouted Jack as he slammed the door open, causing the handicapped doctor to spill some chemicals on his workspace. The mad doctor let out a shrill scream as the fumes burned his nostrils. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, what have I said about barging in here! Ah well no matter, a little hydrochloric acid never hurt anyone.\" Everyone headed inside the small laboratory room, careful to not touch anything that happened to be moving, or dead, or both. Clearing his voice, Sora stepped into the middle of the room and tried to recall exactly what Yen Sid and the King had told him earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, since we're all together now, let's get down to business.  Our main goal is to protect Kairi here until our preparations are done and stuff.\" said Sora, pointing towards the girl with red hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what we need to do in the meantime is to train Kairi and Namine so they'll be able to fight as well.\" Kairi nodded, ecstatic that she could finally help out her friends and stop being the 'damsel in distress' of the group. Namine however was a bit less excited, the prospect of fighting, due to her demure nature. However, if Kairi was up to it, then so was she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what Yen Sid told me, me and Squall are gonna train Kairi, and TIfa will train Namine.\" Hearing her name, the woman with long brown hair piked her ears, looking towards the blonde, She had no idea what sort of weapon she used, but it wasn't a keyblade, otherwise she'd train with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, I have some other training partners too.\" said Sora as he focused a hand on his chest, causing his center to glow. A second later, three colorful animals appeared in the room. One was something that looked like a cat, or a dog or something in between. It was blue in color and had a little horn on top of its head. The next was a purple bat like creature that fluttered in the air, its eyes looking incredibly goofy. The last was a giant panda like creature, with sharp claws, a round belly and a cape worn around its neck. The group look in shock that Sora could summon such creatures. After his journey in the realm of sleep, he and Riku had manage to acquire a few new powers, including summoning these dream eaters from the other realm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These guys are called Dream Eaters. They're kinda like heartless, except they're all good and junk. They're called Meow Wow, Komory Bat and Kooma Panda.\" Let out a cute squeal, Kairi ran up to Meow Wow, scooped it up in her arms and cuddled with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Sora, they're all so cute!\" she exclaimed as the creature began to like her face. The others had similar reactions, and petted the creatures as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Astounding! According to books I've read, these creatures shouldn't even exist!\" shouted the mad doctor as his craving for experimentation increased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they're kinda weird like that. They're like made from rainbows and clouds and all sorts of good things.\" laughed Sora as Komory Bat landed on his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are these guys for anyway?\" asked Squall, not convinced of their usefulness just yet. Trying to think of a good way to show how these guys could be good for training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tifa, how about you punch this guy in the stomach as hard as you can.\" Surprised at such request, she trusted Sora enough to know what he was doing. Walking up to the bear, she readied a fist and launched an explosive punch right into the dream eater's center. Kooma Panda simply absorbed the force and caused Tifa to be bounced back a few meters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I even gave it a serious charge too.\" said Tifa inspecting her fist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, the only things that can hurt these guys are magic and Nightmares, but since Nightmares don't exist here, they're good. Oh I got one last guy to show you all.\" said Sora as he focused once more and another creature was summoned. This time it was a bipedal frog, orange in color wearing an apron, a chef's hat and help a skillet and top as makeshift weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This guy's name is Chef Kyroo. Since Halloween Town doesn't exactly have food that we can eat, no offense Jack, this guy can pick up materials from the Realm of Sleep and cook us up some nice meals.\" said Sora as he gently pet the proud creature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, human cuisine! I've never had that before. I'm sure that the people here will find it spookishly fun!\" shouted the Pumpkin King as he examined the small creature.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So guys, howabout some grub before we get started?\"</span></div></div>",

As dream materials tend to be fresher and more flavorful than their reality bound counterparts, its no surprise that some of the group went up for seconds. The group had retreated back to Jack's manor, the skeleton delighted to have such colorful guests over. He would have incredible fun when everyone was sleeping, after all, who didn't enjoy a nice spook every now and then?  They were now in his living room, discussing how to approach their plan next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so there's one last thing that Yen Sid told me before we all left.\" said Sora, bringing the attention upon himself.  Kairi and Namine were snacking on some seasalt ice cream that the small dream eater had managed to create for them, and the taste was simply out of this world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really get it, but he gave me a list of ingredients. Since we need to hide Kairi's heart away without actually, y'know, taking it from her again, we need to use magic that will conceal her from Master Xehanort and his lame cronies.\" explained Sora. Squall and Tifa had already learned of the old keyblade master's plot and how he was personally responsible for the initial destruction of their homeworld. Clutching his fist, Squall began to feel anger, and regret that he was powerless to save Radiant Garden. Tifa noticed a shift in his expression, she would have to talk to him later on.  Sora pulled out the scroll from his pouch and unraveled it, the parchment reaching to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's a little extreme don't you think?\" said Jack as he leaned down to the very bottom of the list. Reading a few of the ingredients, he formed a frown on his normally jolly face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, some of these might be a little hard to get I'm not afraid. I've never even seen a tongue-tied tongue before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's what he told me too, which is why we need to talk to the people around here for help too. I have plenty of munny so it shouldn't be too hard to get the more stubborn ones to comply.\" said Sora as he recalled the small fortune he had amassed from his travels. Heartless, nobodies and dream eaters had so much money on them for some reason. Eventually they agreed that the next day, Sora, Squall and Kairi would look for the more easier obtained ingredients while Namine and Tifa remained. It was a good opportunity for Tifa to teach the basics to Namine as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um Sora, before we go to bed, can I have more ice cream?\" said the red haired girl, finished with the pint of sea salt ice cream she had received.</span></div></div>",

All of the items were thrown on the table, some of the more peculiar items moving about very sluggishly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now what Sora?\" asked Kairi who was sitting on the couch right next to the brown haired teen. She wanted nothing more than to take a nice hot shower and sleep the night away. Perhaps a snack or two as well. Taking out another piece of paper from his many pockets, he unfolded the parchment and scanned it over. \"Hm, it just says to put them all into a cauldron and use fire on it. Seems easy enough I guess.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is magic after all. Magic doesn't need to make sense, I think at least.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well whatever it is, let's just hurry up so we can move onto training. The sooner we help these girls out, the sooner we can leave this weird place.\" said Squall, resting on the recliner, a bit sore from the day's endeavors.

In actuality, the things he had seen this day really weirded him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If all you need is a cauldron, I've got plenty, especially ones with hauntingly amazing designs. Don't fret, I'll be back in two shakes of a batratcat's tail. Or was it three?\" pondered the skeleton king, making his way down to his cellar. Namine smiled, she enjoyed it when everyone was lively, not to make a pun or the sort. Having a craving for that snack, Kairi latched on to Sora's arm, with a puppy dog expression on her cute face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sora, while we wait, can you take out the froggy and have him make me something to eat?\" A red tinge on his face, Sora needed to turn his head to the side since the red haired girl was invading his personal space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, not a problem.\" In response the girl gave him a quick hug, causing him to let out an awkward laugh.

In the fashionable decorated kitchen of Jack's stood a rather strange but safe view. It was Tifa who was bent over, searching in the fridge and eating some of the food as well. While Halloweentown cuisine was out of the ordinary it was safe for regular human consumption. Still trying to understand the scene that played before him, he noticed her sleeping attire which was a rather long black shirt and large baggy cotton pants. If Squall was a man who was more in tune with his 'emotions' he would have called the girl cute in this situation. Another minute passed of him watching the woman scarf down some leftover dishes and he decided he should at least ask her if she was okay, this seemed to be highly out of character after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tifa, is everything alright?\" Placing a firm hand on her unsuspecting shoulder, Tifa jumped back in shock, causing Squall to be pushed back a few inches by her rear, which also caused Squall to jump back even further. Turning around, she gave a sigh of relief in seeing who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Squall, its just you!. Man, you nearly gave me a heart attack ya big lug.\" said Tifa with a smile, still not accustomed to the custom in the world where scares literally happen every other second. Hell, she had been scared by Jack three times making her way down to the kitchen!  Straitening himself up, Squall sighed, this girl was just too eccentric for his tastes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, like I was saying, is everything alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah everything's fine. I was just peckish so I came down here to eat. Jack didn't mind, guess he just loves having guests or something. I'll be up right after I finish making a nice sandwich. Hey, you want one too?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm good. Just hurry and get to bed already, we have a long day ahead of us. Also make sure to watch your back, if I could startle you like this, imagine what our enemies could do.\" said Squall in his normally cool tone. Giving him a warm smile, she was happy that he was concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, Squall, you really do care.\" Letting out a sigh, Squall left and made his way to bed, it was way to late to deal with that woman.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n\"Hey Namine, are you still awake?\" asked Kairi, lying one of the beds in the numerous amount of guest rooms of Jack's mansion. It was decided that it was safer to have the pair together as Namine could also serve as a form of protection despite her current lack of fighting abilities. Kairi didn't mind it, while Namine was technically the Nobody born from her and Sora, she treated the blonde like a sister and Namine welcomed the notion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm finding it a bit hard to sleep, I've been thinking of a few things lately.\" Namine was thankful that it was dark as her friend couldn't see the bright red coloring on her normally pale face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if you give me some advice. It's about Sora...\" </span></div></div>",

When he first entered the Land of Dragons, he was surprised that it was such an open world, it was massive compared to the worlds he had been to previously. There he met up with the great ninja Yuffie and the princess he had been assigned to protect, Alice.  The three individuals had met with Mulan, a female hero that Sora had encountered on one of their previous journeys. She was informed beforehand on the current events of the situation and while she didn't really understand all of the details, she knew when she had to protect those who were being hunted by the dark. As per the Emperor's suggestions, they were allowed to stay in the imperial palace with guards on standby 24/7. The Emperor had also been informed and he could tell that the child was of great importance. Currently the trio were in one of the many rooms of the palace. Lea was reading up about the world, his curiosity getting the better of him while Yuffie was enjoying a rather hearty meal consisting of ramen and some pork cutlets. Alice was in the corner of the room reading one of the many fiction books from the grand library. It was difficult being away from her home, but this was to protect everyone and she needed to stay strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man Lea, you really need to try this, its soooo good.\" said Yuffie between mouthfuls of food. Staring at the girl, he only rolled his eyes are her slovenly actions. Messy girls were always so un-cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind that, one of us needs to be alert if anything were to come up.

But that didn't help how she felt. Even now, a small voice of doubt was whispering into her mind. \"You let yourself go, the darkness held you like a toy.\" But what hurt about the voice was that it wasn't condescending or angery. It spoke as if Aqua had been at the best spa of her life rather than the Realm of Darkness. It sounded pleased to have been in that cold realm and having turned against her friends by command of the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAqua tried to pay the voice no mind, walking along into the forest with no clear goal or path. This little trip was meant to get rid of that voice, she couldn't risk being around her friends if there was even a chance she might fall again.

She was still human, which wouldn't seem like much of an issue but she remembered Sora telling her of the various transformations he had to go through on his journey and didn't know what to expect. All around Aqua were several bushes and trees all spread out in rows, giving the impression that she was in some kind of garden. A few of the trees and bushes had already started producing, a few trees on the right were filled with thick apples while the bushes to Aqua's left had quite a few strawberries. Many of said plants, though looking otherwise healthy, were drooping. No doubt from the need to be watered as the heat of the sun was already taking it's toll on Aqua. So much so that Aqua almost worried she was hallucinating as she saw a few basic heartless dart between the smaller bushes. Pulling out her keyblade, Aqua surveyed her general vicinity. If she really was being surrounded, she needed to make sure she had a way out. Taking a glance behind her, Aqua found herself in awe of the large house that lay before her. It was big enough to be a mansion, stone white columns standing tall from the windows that she could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's gotta be someone inside. I have to get them out before these heartless attack.\" With that thought in her mind, Aqua hurried towards the house with only a partial thought given to just how she was going to find the house's owners in a short time. But those thought were quickly dashed as the back doors swung open. Three figures walked out, none of them human and none of them what Aqua wanted to see. Three Parasol Beauty heartless were staring back at her, each had their parasol open and covering their floppy purple hats from the sun. Aqua had seen a few of them before in the Realm of Darkness and the bruises they gave her still hurt in her head. Aqua glanced behind her to see what her options were for doubling back, and found there were still loads of grunt heartless surveying the land. Still, she had no idea where she was and the last thing she wanted to do right now was get lost. No telling what else was out there. Aqua turned back to the trio of Parasol Beauties, taking a tighter grip on her keyblade. Once they made the first move, Aqua would figure things out from there.</span></div></div>",

The way they just stood on the steps to the mansion could only be of malice and suffering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my, she is quite forward.\" At first, Aqua was silent. She wasn't sure if what she had heard was from her own imagination or if the heartless in the center really did talk. It had looked to the others around her and everything, but it was impossible. Heartless (at least of this variety) couldn't talk, especially not in such a stuffy and high class way. The one to her left giggled, as is there was an actual laughing sound accompanied by a waving of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there dearie. That sure is a might big key yer carrying there.\" This one had the inflection of a Southern Belle, still with a pompus undertone but the Southern side did make her sound at least a but more friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a keyblade sister.\" The Beauty on the right spoke with a heavy accent bordering on Russian. This one had never looked away from her. \"This is clearly one of those commoner warriors. Or at least someone imitating them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough blushing from that snide comment, Aqua was dumbfounded. She wasn't imagining it and if it was ventriloquism, then it was a top notch effort. The fact that these were in fact heartless kept her guard up, but the oddity of talking heartless was piping her curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh just look at the poor thing, she's gotta be near death in this heat.\" The Parasol Beauty on the left stepped closer to Aqua, showing none of the fear or disdain the keyblade wielder had often seen on heartless of all kinds. \"Would you like to come inside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Heartless in the middle pulled her back by her parasol. \"Sister, we mustn't be undignified. She doesn't even know who we are.\" With that, all three heartless gave a bow to Aqua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Velvet.\" The center Beauty spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Satin.\" The Beauty on the left giggled again as she waved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a 'humpf' the third said, \"And I am Lace. Now what is your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Aqua.\" Her guard was still up, but the (semi)polite nature of these Beauties was rather calming compared to other heartless. Speaking of which. \"Are you three...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charming? Beautiful? Stand out amongst those lowlife grunts out there? Thanks fer noticing.\" Satin twirled about, Lace seemingly snorting at the display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Satin dear, I think the poor girl is confused why we are not more like...\" Velvet pointed her hand to the fields, \"...we would love to awsner that question. But would you like to come inside? It is terribly hot out and our Parasols only do so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAqua had to admit, the heat was getting worse already. Maybe it was just seeing them in thier Parasols, but Aqua couldn't help but feel jealous. Then again, she didn't think heartless could feel heat. For now, she would accept thier offer, but be on alert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful.\" Velvet turned towards the door of the mansion, her sisters following suit and walking. Aqua put her keyblade away as she followed behind. She didn't want to arouse too much distrust. They walked up the marble staircase through the double doors and past thick purple curtains. Aqua found herself in luxury she was used to seeing in castles. High quality marble flooring and walls and blue and purple rugs lining the area. The three Parasol Beauties walked over to a group of pristine chairs by a massive fireplace. Above the mantel was a massive picture of what Aqua could only assume was the three of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, come dear.\" Velvet snapped her fingers and two grunt heartless carried in a fourth chair and rushed outside as soon as it was done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo better option on hand, Aqua walked to the chair and sat down. She could feel the cushions molding to her form, creating a hightened level of comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now listen dearie, I realize you must be a busy girl. Plus, it's about our mealtime. So if you want us to give a short version of the story, I can understand. But we feel you might be fasinated by how we came to be the height of Heartless we are.\"</span></div></div>",

Would one of you like to tell her then? You know how much I like to ramble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatin raised her hand before Lace shot her what Aqua could only assume was a glare. \"You're no better sister, and you known it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah darn.\" Satin put her hand down, her floppy hat drooping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLace turned back to Aqua. \"Well, if little miss impatient wants it quick, then here. When we were first created, those fools Xeanort and his silly organization thought they controlled us. Quite frankly, my sister and I thought they were a bunch of depressing children going on about 'darkness of the heart's and how depressing life is. My sisters and I simply had enough of it. So first chance we got, we vanished to this world. As for those lowlife grunts we you saw out there in the fields, that's exactly what they are. Nothing more than annoying little savages that my sisters and I were gracious enough to have working in our fields.\" Lace pulled our a small fan from a pocket and flapped it. \"After all, we certainly don't want these clothes ruined with working that all that dirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet nodded. \"Of course not sister, no need to make things more difficult for ourselves.

Velvet and Lace both tapped Satin with thier Parasols. \"Well look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Satin, there is no need to be rude. You shouldn't just say things like that to someone with truly getting to know them.\" A small bell coming from the next room over took Velvet's attention, as well as the rest of her sisters. \"And I suppose the quickest way to someone's heart is through their stomach. Miss Aqua, you simply must join us for a meal. Our servants may be dim, but they certainly know how to cook.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold it sister.\" Lace steeped forward towards Aqua, her heartless eyes studying Aqua's body. \"If she is going to find with us, she certainly cannot do so in her current state. I mean look at her, all of that dirt on her body. I swear it's a wonder why I allowed her in the house.\" Lace's words prompted Aqua to glance at herself. She did get some dirt on her from the fields, though it didn't look like that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw come on sis.\" Satin hugged Lace tightly. \"She's new here and the poor thing is probably starving. Ah now how long her little baths take. Don't be such a prude and let her dine with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLace's gaze switched between Aqua and the pleading eyes of her sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear sister.\" Velvet interrupted Lace's thoughts. \"At least let Miss Aqua eat first. Then we can give her a proper grooming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLace sighed. \"Fine, but when you're complaining about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLace didn't even have time to finished her statement before Satin rushed to Aqua, grabbed her by the hand and pulled her along. \"Come on then cute stuff. Time to show you how a heartless of class dines.\" The excited southern heartless pulled Aqua into a dining hall, it\"s extravagance rivaling that of the living room. In the center was a table streching out all across the large space, looking more like it would seat 100 rather than 3. Candles and portirats of her hosts hung from every wall. As for the spread on the table, it was a grand feast the likes of which Aqua had rarely ever seen. Veggies and fruits were abound, no doubt picked from the gardens outside while large roasted birds and assorted meats occupied the center. As for seating however, there were only three chairs present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh goodness, I am so sorry Aqua.\" Satin clasped her mouthless face. We should have reminded those dolts to prepare another chair. Don't worry, ah can fix this.\" With a snap of her fingers, a grunt heartless rushed into the room. Satin's chested puffed up as her southern belle voice became soured by a deep anger. \"Listen shorty, I'm gonna forget the stupidity of yah'll to not get a chair for our guest. For now though, you get to be Aqua's seat. Now get going.\" The small heartless wasted no time in sitting up to the table, propping itself up. \"There now, why don't you sit your little bottom down and we can begin?</span></div></div>",
