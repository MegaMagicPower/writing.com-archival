As you are brushing your teeth, you look up into the bathroom mirror. The reflection is sort of you, but it's female. You both stare at each other for a second. While you are in a beautiful bathroom, her room is dirty, with tile falling off the wall. Although her features are softer, she has your nose, your hazel eyes, and the same small scar from a car accident on the opposite cheek. Both of your eyes get wider. When she pinches herself, then bursts out, \"You do exist! You're not a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       You ask, \"Who are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"My name is Eve. I'm what you would have been if you were born female. Don't you know about me. I know everything about you from your dreams. While everything went right for you, something went wrong for me. In your world Dad was your best friend, playing catch with you. Taking you to sporting events, your scout leader, and when you graduated he bought you a Mustang. In my world Dad ignored me because he didn't want a daughter, giving all that love to my kid brother Max. While in your world your kid sister Maxine was treated like me.  In your world, Uncle Ralph got you a whore for your 14th birthday. In my world for my 14th birthday he raped me. In your world last year you won the lottery, while I was audited by the I.R.S.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"I admit I'm living the good life, but I've had nothing to do with what happened to you. You just got a raw deal,\" you told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"FUCKIN' BASTARD!\" she yelled while throwing a drinking glass at the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       The glass goes though the mirror instead of braking it, hitting you in the head. As you grab your head, she realizes that something has happened, weakening the walls between your dimensions. She grabs you and pulls you through the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       You wake up dazed on a dirty bathroom floor. You wipe blood coming out of a wound on your head. You look at the blood on a hand that is much smaller, then it should be. There is long hair in your eyes, and you feel like half your strength is gone. Suddenly all the memories of Eve's life join your memories.</span></div></div>",

Body parts shaking that have always been firm. There is the loud crying of a baby in the background, and some gangster rap turned up way to loud for the speakers to handle. 2 kids run into the bathroom. You realize that the boy is your 6 year old son Kyle, and the 8 year old girl is you daughter Ruth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"He broke my Ipod!\" the girl yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"She ate my Fruit Loops! She knows that's my favorite cereal,\" the boy says as he hits his sister in the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"You should have come to the table, instead of sleeping in you little stain,\" Ruth yells, as she slaps her brother in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"You yell, \"Stop it both of you!

You have to clean it up! I'm not touching it it's gross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        3 more kids rush into the room, Kevin age 10, Connie age 14, and Vicki age 15.

My hangover is killing me.  By the way you need to change the baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          All the commotion is giving you a headache. You touch the mirror in the bathroom to see if you can get back to your old life but no avail. You realize that if you do not get out of there in 15 minutes you will miss your bus for work, at McDonald's. You have been late 4 times this month and the boss threatened to fire you if you are late one more time. Your head is about to explode, and you decide...............</span></div></div>",

Your breasts are heavy and hurt your back. Your very hungry, but Carl weighs you every morning. If you put on a lb. he will hit you. In fact you had to loose 2 lbs. when you got your new breasts to stop the beatings. You remember other horible things like at 9 a.m. you must wake Carl up with a blow job, or else. He has subject you to botox, and a tummy tuck. In 2 days he is having your pussy tightened, and having you cherry replaced. You remember how bad it hurt when he did that to you 5 years ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      You quickly shave your legs, because if he gets razor burn there will be hell to pay. Putting on your makeup seems almost naturel like your body is on auto pilot. You put on your 4 inch high heels, and walk over to your husband, who is snoring away. You think about killing him and letting the world know about his abuse. Then remember, he is the most respected judge in the county.</span></div></div>",

Now quit hogging it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       You pull yourself of the floor, and remember your new past. You had your first kid at 15 and had to drop out of school after your uncle raped you. Your parents kicked you out after you were in a car accident that killed your brother, their favorite child. They have always blamed you for it, even though it was his fault. While living in a homeless shelter you got pregnant again.  With no education you couldn't find a decent job. Having 2 kids took a toll on you. In clothes your top half looks great, but you now have extremly saggy B cups. Your figure is now pear shaped with a 44 inch ass. You need a girdle to hold your strechmarked stomach in, and your pussy is a big sloppy one. No guy has had sex with you a second time after your last kid. 2 years ago they took your kids from you, after you were caught selling grass to an undercover cop. To make matters worse the I.R.S. expected you to pay taxes on the money you made selling drugs. They took everything you owned, and sent you to jail on a plea bargain. Last week you finally got out of jail, provide you live in a halfway house, and hold down a job. The only thing you could find was being a waitress on the graveyard shift, in a run down dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       You go back to your room to put on your clothes. You face is cute but not pretty. Your hands are rougher then when you were a man, with all the fingernails chewed off. Even though you are only a B cup a pretty bra will not support you comfortably.  You settle on sweat pants and head down for breakfast (dinner for everyone else). You try to think of how you are going to get out of this mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        </span></div></div>",

You are glad there is no one sitting next to you, as your huge ass takes up more then half the seat. Even though you had a master's degree from a good collage in your old life. You now only have a high school equivency diploma, you got while in prison. Instead of millions you have $7.36 in your checking account, and its 3 days till pay day. Your body feels so strange and weak, having never had a personal trainer. You dread the long shift you have coming. The bus gets to your stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     It's raining and you have 6 blocks to walk to work, in the dark. You hate how you butt and thighs jiggle with every move. Your soaked to your underwear then you finally get to work. Your boss tells you you look like a mess. He is the 19 year old loser son of the owner, mainly sitting in his office smoking a joint, while you, the cook, and one other waitress do most of the work. You have to change in the drafty, dingy ladies room. Your skirt is too tight, and it feel strange to walk in it, with the cold air blowing on your up your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      You start your shift, there are only 3 people in the diner at this hour. Your table is 2 teens drinking a bottomless cup of coffee. Over the next hour you are constantly refilling their mugs, while you hear them joke about your giant butt. When they finally leave you get a 35 cent tip. You clean up the table waiting for someone else to come in. A nearby factory has just let out the night shift. 25 customers come in, all wanting service at once. The cook mixed up several orders, getting the customers mad at you. People at tables that are not your's demand coffee refills. Everyone is yelling at you. When the last of them leave. You have quite a job cleaning up after them. Your feet hurt, you take a moment to sit down. You boss  looks at you and says, \"Time to lean, time to clean. Now clean up the men's room. Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       The bathroom is discusting, as you mop the floor, your back starts to hurt. As you finish up the other waitress, made $15 in tips, from customers that came in while you were cleaning the mens room. At 3 a.m. people come in as the bars close down. Most of your customers are drunk and rude. One pinches your ass, at least he left your best tip of the night. At 5 a.m. your boss makes you clean the ladies room, till the breakfast crowd comes in. 2 of the morning waitresses are out sick so your boss says you need to stay till after the lunch crowd. At 1 p.m. you get ready to go back to the halfway house. You change back into your wet clothes, and get ready to leave. Just before you do the manager demands his cut of 20% of your tips. You curse under your breath as you give him $22. You want to quit on the spot, but no job means back to jail. You just miss the bus, and have to wait 40 minutes for the next bus to take you back to bed.<br>\r\n.</span></div></div>",

There was your uncle, they guy you remembered so fondly. The guy who took you fishing and gave you your first football. Only that friendly, loving uncle that you remembered, was now a drunken man with lust in his eyes for your young body! How could that be? In a flash of thought, you wondered if he had ever done anything to your sister when you were kids? You didn't have time to dwell on that though as you heard him say, \"Get those clothes off you little slut!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to think fast. You were in the body you would have had if you had been born female, and you were only 14, but your mind was still 'mostly' that of a thirty-year-old male. You knew you couldn't escape him, and you sure couldn't overpower him. You saw only one chance. You smiled up at him, \"Uncle Bobby. That wouldn't be as much fun, would it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked confused, \"Huh? Whadayamean?\" His slurred speech and the liquor on his breath made it clear just how drunk he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt very strange in this female body, but you made yourself walk up to him and put your arms around him. Doing your best to ignore the smell of his breath, you gave him a gentle kiss. \"Your right, I am a slut. And I would love for a big, strong man like you to be my first time.\" You tried not to throw up in your throat as you kissed him again, and with great effort, you lowered a hand and began to caress his crotch. As you felt his cock begin to grow, you smiled and said, \"You need to give that more freedom Uncle Bobby.\" You were terrified as you undid his belt, then his pants. If this plan didn't work, being raped was probably going to be the preferable outcome, but you had to try. You smiled up at him, \"Let me help you feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were lucky that, in his foggy state of mind, he was thrown off by your seeming willingness. After all, he had come prepared to rape you. As you freed his penis, you started massaging it, wanting to throw up, or scream, or try to run away the whole time. If you had been born to this body, and knew nothing else, you would have, but you knew you had one chance. At the right moment, when he was in no position to stop you, you suddenly grabbed his balls and began to squeeze hard! He raised his hands to hit you and you screamed, \"If you hit me, I swear I will rip your balls off!\" And you squeezed tighter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe yelled, \"Stop it you bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a yank, \"Do what I say, or you will have more in common with women than men!\" He gave in! You had him sit on the toilet, pants and underwear around his ankles, then you pulled the waist band of his pants past his ankles so that they were inside out, but the legs still around his feet. \"Now, uncle dearest,\" You said with as much ice as you could muster, \"I want you to know this. If you ever, EVERY try to rape me again, I will not stop until I really have ripped your balls off And don't you ever call me a slut again, or I swear, you better not fall asleep in this house! You better never try to touch me again you pervert!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you let go of his balls and quickly jumped back. You got up as fast as you could, and ran out of the bathroom, intentionally leaving the door wide open, down the hall, down the stairs, and outside. You didn't stop running until you reached a thick patch of woods near your house that was a place you used to go to hide when you were a kid. You were glad it was still there in this life. Nobody could find you here. Even so, you tensely watched to see if your uncle was going to try to find you, but nobody left the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you relaxed enough, you broke down in deep sobs! How had this happened? How could you be a girl? How could you be reliving what should be a happy time in your life, only as a horror? How could you get back to your male body and life? You were shaking uncontrollably at the realization of how close you came to being raped! Did all girls have this constant fear?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you almost an hour to get yourself back under control. When you did, you began to take notice of your new body for the first time. Young, budding breasts were just pushing out from your small chest. Skinny arms and skinny hands. Slim legs, and just the beginnings of a narrow waist and widening hips as your body was just starting to take on the classic form of a woman. You felt how flat your crotch was, but you were afraid to explore that further right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while, but you finally got up the courage to, carefully, walk back to your house. When you got home, you found that...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When you got to the house, your uncle's car was gone, so you entered a bit more confidently. You were not far inside the house when your mother came around the corner, \"Eve! There you are! I have been looking all over for my birthday girl!\" She looked at you, \"You have been crying!\" She looked over her shoulder and all around. \"Let's get you cleaned up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took you upstairs, but there was something odd that you couldn't put your finger on. When you got into the bathroom, you started to become scared when you noticed that your mom locked the door and then turned on the faucet. She did get a wash cloth though, and as she washed your face she said, \"Eve. What did you do? I mean, to get your uncle to leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were scared, \"I, I didn't do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head, \"Sweetheart. You have nothing to fear from me. Nobody knows better than me how your dad's family treats females. I hated to need to leave to get groceries. To be honest, I was afraid that he would rape you while I was gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished with your face, and began to brush out your hair, which for the first time you realized when down to the middle of your back. It felt so good, it calmed you. Finally, you were able to say, \"Mom, he, he, he did...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped, \"He did rape you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly jumped in, \"No! I mean... well, he tried, but I didn't let him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mother stopped and stared at you, \"A little thing like you? How could you stop a huge man like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, \"Well....\" It took a while, but you told her the whole story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were done, she stared at you a long while, then, suddenly, she burst out laughing! She hugged you! \"Oh Eve! My warrior daughter! I am so proud of you! I don't think you need to worry about him any more. He would never want to face a little girl who beat him!\" She laughed, \"We will get you some food, then you go out and find your friends and have some fun. While you are gone, I will bake you a proper birthday cake to help celebrate your victory as well as your birthday!\" She hugged you again, \"I have one present for you already. I laid it out on your bed. I would be proud if you saw fit to wear it today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe present turned out to be a lavender sundress. You sighed, but knew that you might as well get used to dressing like a girl until you figured out how to get your own life back. After it was on, you had to admit, you looked pretty in it. (And it didn't even strike you as odd that you thought of it that way.) So after a good meal, you went for a walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked, you had time to focus and access the memories of Eve. It was strange. You could remember things as a little boy, and as a little girl. You could also remember your entire male life, and Eve's miserable female one. Perhaps it was because you were coming from a different place and time, but you could see that at least part of Eve's misery was brought on by her own bad choices. Much of it though, started this very day. The rape by her uncle had almost destroyed her, and what was left of that innocent girl that used to be, had very little self-respect from then on. Well, you had changed that part of history. Perhaps, when you got back into your own life, she would have a better one to return to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure how far you had walked until you heard a boy's voice calling, \"Eve! Hey Eve! Wait up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStranger and stranger! There, running your way with a smile on his face, was Joel, your best friend through high school. In the original Eve's memories, she had a crush on Joel, but after her rape, she rejected him over and over. She wouldn't admit it, but she considered herself not to be good enough for him after the rape. Instead, she fell in with a bad crowd, and worse boyfriends. Too bad. Joel was a nice guy who always treated girls well. In your male life, he was divorced only because he married a selfish woman who had treated him like dirt. It was strange too, that you were different, and you had a brother instead of a sister, but so far, everyone else was the same gender and person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped, and your smile was genuine as you saw your old friend. \"Hi Joel! Are you enjoying your summer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped close, \"Well, it is okay. I haven't seen much of you though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged, \"We were on vacation.\" He was hiding something, and he was acting very strange. Strange, but in a cute way. \"Um, did you want something Joel? You are acting funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled sheepishly, \"Oh, well, um,\" He hesitated, then brought a small box from behind his back. \"I, well, I have a birthday present for you, um, if you want it. I mean, you don't have to accept it if you don't want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a very curious way for him to give a birthday present. Why would he word it that way? You took the small package and opened it. In it, was a ring. Nothing too fancy, but both your male memory and your female memory knew that, in your school at this time, it was a friendship ring. Only, the kind that, if you accepted it, would mean that you are agreeing to become his girlfriend!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis moment had never happened in the original Eve's life! This was totally new! So your avoiding being raped by your uncle really HAD changed Eve's history! What should you do now though? Could you seriously date you old high school buddy?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Joel was probably very uncomfortable as you stared at the ring. A zillion things were leaping through your mind. Part of you insisted that you were not a girl, so you couldn't become Joel's 'girlfriend'. Of course, the attempted rape by your uncle was a strong argument against that! Part of you didn't want to commit to anything, since you hoped to return to your male body soon. But what if you never got back? Either way, you had a chance to set Eve's life on a better path. You had already done so, but you knew from her memories that she dated a lot of 'bad boys'. If there was anything you knew about Joel, it was that he respected women, and he didn't use them. In fact, he was always the one getting dumped, even later in life with his ex-wife. One thing was for sure. He could protect you. He had been in a martial arts class since he was young. Wait! That was it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to muster your courage to talk to Joel. It was funny, but your heart was pounding and your stomach was doing flip-flops as you said, \"Joel, I would love to be your girlfriend, if...\", you paused as Joel held his breath, \"If you will introduce me to your martial arts instructor and help me sign up for classes too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned huge grin. \"Of course! That would be great!\" You knew that Joel was always into marital arts, but what you didn't understand, even then, was that the thought of having a girlfriend who was into it was his dream!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't even realize you were hugging him tightly at first. When you let him go, you said, \"Would you come to my house for some birthday cake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was bright red in his blush as he said, \"You bet!\" Then he said, \"Um, would you be okay if we hold hands as we walked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled. Yes, actually giggled! \"I would be upset if my boyfriend didn't want to hold my hand!\" You looked at the ring on your hand as the two of you walked. It was pretty. And after the horror of this morning, being with Joel made you feel very secure. You couldn't deny that. If you didn't have to be the girl here, this could be a good time to relive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was hard to get used to being so close to Joel was the fact that you were so much shorter than him. As a male, you had been a bit taller than him all through high school. Now you felt tiny, as you were a good five or six inches shorter than him. And worse yet, as a girl, you probably wouldn't grow much taller, while he would. Again, you hoped you weren't female that long!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got to your house, you could hear mom and dad having an argument. You couldn't hear what they were saying, but it was actually unusual. Mom usually let dad have his way. You looked at Joel, \"Um, maybe you better wait out here for now. I will be back soon.\" You hated leaving Joel on the porch like that, but you hoped that he understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you walked into the kitchen, they both looked at you. Dad seemed very upset. He turned on you, \"Eve! How dare you accuse your uncle of being a pervert?!?! He was humiliated! And now you have your mother saying she doesn't want him to come to our house again! I expect you to apologize to him and tell him he is welcome again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could have exploded, and you did, \"What? Apologize! I was up in the bathroom and he tried to rape me, and you want me to apologize! Here is my apology. I am sorry I didn't rip his balls off when I had the chance!\" You were starting to cry, \"What kind of father are you? Do you really think I would make something like that up? Do you think that little of women that you would blame your daughter for being molested on her birthday, instead of your drunken, perverted brother? What kind of man are you? What kind of father are you!?!?\" With that the emotions flowing through me were too much! I ran out of the room, out the front door, and kept running. I didn't know where I was going, and I didn't care. Just somewhere out of there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ended up in the park, and I collapsed on a bench and sobbed my heart out. Somewhere, between sobs, I heard, \"Eve? Eve? Is there anything I can do to help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Joel! Oh my word! I had forgotten that he was waiting on the front porch! I still couldn't talk, so I just shook my head no. I felt him sit next to me. I felt his arms carefully and gently wrap around me, and just like that, I collapsed into his chest, still sobbing, but comforted by his touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I had cried myself out, he said, \"I'll tell you what. Why don't we go to my house for a while. We can watch TV or something. Whatever you want to do. When you are ready, me and my dad will drive you home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't sure what else to do. I knew that I didn't want to go home and face my dad right now. And it was god to have Joel there to support me. \"Okay. That sounds good. But for now, can we just sit here like this?\" I am not sure that he could say no. It was a long time before I realized how tightly I was holding onto him!</span></div></div>",

I think my parents would love to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at him, \"I can't. I must look awful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, \"Your too beautiful to ever look awful! Besides, its eight blocks from here. We can walk slow and give you time to recover. And I bet my mom would help you freshen up to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't really want to, but I hated the idea of going home right now, \"Okay. Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, he had his arm around me as we walked, not just holding my hand, and I had to admit, it felt good. I felt so weak and vulnerable as a girl. When we got to his house, he got him mom, and she helped me get presentable again. She was so sweat to me! It was annoying when I had to pee, and realized that, as long as I was stuck in this body, I could only pee sitting down. The real Eve grew up with that, so she didn't know different, but it was a major change for me! She better thank me when she got back to this body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I was introduced to Joel's family, I was reminded of something that I had forgotten. His dad was a cop! It was good he didn't know about what happened to me! Or maybe I should tell him? I had no real proof though. It was just my uncle's word against mine. I deemed it best to forget and move forward, so I said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis family was great, and when I offered to help with the cleanup after we ate, his mom said, \"I appreciate the offer, but not on your birthday! Go relax with the rest of the family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was great, and calming. And when it started to get dark, Joel's dad insisted on driving me home. I went right up to my bedroom, so I had no idea that Joel had overheard our earlier yelling, and knew what had happened, or that he told his dad, or that his dad talked to mine, and warned him that, if there was a repeat, he wouldn't need me to press charges since I was a minor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat I did know about was my mom coming up to me and hugging me, \"Sweetie. I am so sorry this had to happen to you, but I am so proud of the way you have handled it so far. I made it clear to your dad that your uncle is no longer welcome in our home, ever! What you said to him before you went out did hit him. I don't think he thought much about it from a female standpoint, but you hit him in his manhood, and that got him thinking. Try not to be too hard on him. He is just a stupid male after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI found myself giggle as she tried to lighten things up. \"I meant what I said mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hugged me, \"I know sweetie, and so did I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings calmed down a little after that. It was good to have Joel as a boyfriend, and we always enjoyed each other's company, even more than what I remembered when I was a male and he had been my best friend. We were still good friends, but it was much more than just that now. And it wasn't long before our first kiss. It felt strange at first, kissing my friend, but I quickly grew to enjoy it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got used to other things too. I had my first period since becoming Eve. That was gross! I had no choice but to learn how to tolerate it though. And the more time that passed, the less I minded the feeling of my breasts or the need to sit down to pee. Eventually, I hardly thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel kept his promise, and introduced me to his martial arts instructors. They were hesitant to include a girl at first, but I convinced them that a girl had as much right to learn how to fight as a boy, and probably greater need! As it turned out, I ended up being one of their star pupils. That was easy. Any time I had to attack a training dummy, all I had to do was imagine it was my uncle, and I had all of the motivation I needed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing was sure, in the now two months since getting stuck in this body, I had set Eve's life on a better path already.</span></div></div>",

I was so used to having breasts and a pussy that it was getting harder and harder to remember what being a male felt like. I had even long passed the point where I expected to see any face in the mirror each morning other than the female one I had become accustomed to. What was different was that, now, most of my friends were girls. And while all the people were the same in my memory, our relationships were different. Some guys I had hung out with as a guy seemed like sexist jerks to me as a girl. And some girls that I had thought of as cute or sexy were now friends, and I had no attraction for them at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI soon began to realize the different way I was treated. Sometimes I felt like I had entered a different social class now, and not for the better. What got me through those first days was being Joel's girlfriend. He was my anchor. If anything, those early days drove me even closer to Joel than I would have thought possible! There was soon no question in the minds of the other students that I was not available, so guys bugged me less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne evening, after school, Joel said, \"You do want to go to the dance with me, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled, \"Oh Joel! Who else would I go with?\" I leaned in and we kissed, and something in me changed at that moment. Part of me wanted to fight it, but how could I? I broke the kiss and whispered into Joel's ear, \"I love you Joel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe squeezed me tighter, \"I love you to Eve.\" And my heart leapt for joy! </span></div></div>",

After all, he was my best friend in my male life. I still remembered that life, but the strange thing was that Eve life, at least, her life as it was in the future, was fading. I took it as a good sign that I had made significant moves in changing Eve's life for the better. The odd thing was that I was starting to enjoy it myself. I was getting very used to being female. Perhaps nothing was more proof than the fact that I was staring at myself in the mirror, wearing a dress, and all I could think of was how I hoped that Joel would find me pretty. I spun, Loving the feel of the air rushing under my skirt as I smiled at the thought of Joel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel looked very handsome when he picked me up. Yes. Handsome. I had overcome my shyness at being attracted to males. Why shouldn't I be? I was a female as long as I was in this body.I was almost giddy to be with him that night. And it was a wonderful night! We danced, ate, danced and danced again! When he walked me home, we had a long, passionate kiss on my doorstep. And when he did kiss me that way, I didn't resist the thoughts of love and marriage that I started to have concerning Joel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeeks turned into months. And as time passed, the female things of this life began to become the norm. I never gave a second thought anymore to things that used to bother me. Things like sitting down to pee, having breasts, and wearing dresses, were all just normal. I even was as used to my periods now. Well, as used as any girl could be I suppose. And I even loved being with my female friends. I had learned that it was very different. Girls became much closer and deeper friends than guys every were. On the flip side, they also were terribly vindictive if that friendship was broken, and cruel beyond belief if they thought the betrayal warranted it. I made my best effort not to take part in the feuds, but school girls seemed unusually insistent that, to be a friend, you had to take sides. Then something happened that helped to change that. Well, for me at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne morning, as I was walking to my gym class, I passed the restrooms. Nothing odd there, except that I heard a strange sound come from the boy's restroom. I might have kept going, but that strange sound seemed like it came from a girl. I paused, and heard something muffled again. I had a bad feeling about this. I put my things down and edged to the door. I peeked in and could hear a struggle deeper. I took a deep breath and went in. It was a testimony to how normal I now felt as a female that I felt it odd, even wrong, to be going into the boy's bathroom. When I turned the corner, I saw what had caused the noise. One of the girls that was considered a bit to be avoided, Shelley, was pinned against the wall by two boys. One was already groping her breast, and I was sure that was only the start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI braced myself and said, \"Stop that and let her go! Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey turned, surprised at first, but then laughed, They were bigger guys from the football squad. The sight of this little girl telling them what to do was amusing to them. The first one, Craig, looked at the second and said, \"You take her. I will take this new one. Maybe even get her knocked up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left Shelley and came to me. As he reached to grab me, my training kicked in. I knocked the wind out of him and before he knew what was happening, he was laying on the floor gasping for air. His friend Jeff let go of Shelley and he leapt at me. I knew that if he got a hold on me my chances would go down. His size and weight advantage would be more than my current level of training would be able to overcome. Fortunately for me, his mass committed him to a straight line, and I was agile enough to dodge him quickly. He ran into the wall behind me. He recovered and turned around just in time for me to use a round-house kick on him. He went down like a rock!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at Shelley, \"Don't just stand there! Get out of here! Quick!\" I guarded her retreat and then ran out myself, grabbing my things as I did. I had to stop Shelley from running to hid in the girl's room, \"No! Not there! They might come in after us! This way!\" I didn't want to be caught again in a confined space. I was lucky the first time because of the element of surprise, but I didn't think I could handle both of those guys at once, least of all in a tight space. However, I saw a class going on, and the door was open, \"In here! Quick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, the teacher was shocked and upset when we came running into his class. That is, until he heard enough of our story to run out and catch the boys coming out of the restroom. He grabbed them and took them to the office, calling on us to come behind. Once there, he drug them into the principle's office while he told the secretary what happened and to take us to the nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a complicated time fore a while after that. I had to explain what happened to a lot of people. However, in the long run, it was great. For one thing, between my action, and Joel making it clear that anyone so much as bumping into me would have to answer to him. Also, whether I wanted her or not, Shelley was now my new best friend. Or, at least, I was hers. That was good, because, with her help, we convinced the school administration to allow us to start a self-defense club for girls. An almost heretical idea in that time. I was able to convince one of the female teachers to sponsor us, and get one of my instructors to come in once a week. To most girls in the school, I was suddenly a hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nice to be popular, but in all this, the thing I enjoyed the most was my time with Joel. By the end of the school year, we were inseparable, and I was beginning to enjoy this new life.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You enter the house cautiously, timidly. You would rather avoid another confrontation, in case your uncle still has ideas.  You find him sitting on the couch in the living room, seeming to have sobered up, holding what looks like a glass of water and staring down at it. Hearing you, he looks up. You stop, and take a step back, ready to flee if he makes a move. But he flinches when he sees you, and moves away to the side of the couch farthest from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pass by cautiously, keeping an eye on him as he watches you, except he's watching you with a deer-in-the-headlights look, which is unexpected. You glare at him, and he flinches fearfully and shrinks back, trembling slightly. It looks like he's actually afraid of you. Which is fine, you don't want anything to do with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to head up the stairs to go to your room. The room Eve has is the same as your room was at the same age, though with no decorations and a lighter color scheme. You lock the door (just in case) and sit on your bed, focusing on going through the original Eve's memories. You remember them just as vividly as your own, as if you had lived them yourself. Oddly, you have the memories of the adult Eve who had spoken to you, memories from <i>after </i>the time you ended up. Thinking through them, you see that the original Eve\u2019s rape was both the worst event of her life and the start of her life going downhill. Prior to this day, she had been kind and innocent, albeit neglected by her father (as she had told you). The rape had left her traumatized and miserable.  She had ended up dropping in and out of school, going on and off drugs, and ended up in a minimum wage job and suffering from trauma and depression. By preventing the rape, hopefully the original Eve will have a better life - if she\u2019s willing to take her life back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're interrupted by the sound of a knock on your door and your mother's voice calling \"Eve?\" From the original Eve's memories, her/your mother had treated her kindly; it simply hadn't been enough. You open the door and your mother gives you a quick hug. \"There's my birthday girl!\" Then she gets a good look at your face. You know that it's obvious you're upset and have been crying, and she recognizes it.  \"Eve, what's wrong?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you a few seconds to reply. \"It... Uncle Bobby, he... he tried to...\" you pause, and your mom looks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did he do?\" she asks, and you take a breath to calm yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He... he tried to... he tried to rape me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He what?!\" she snaps angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I stopped him, but...\" you trail off as your mother looks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stopped him?\" she asks incredulously. \"How did you manage that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, well...\" you sigh. \"I was in the bathroom, and...\" you tell her everything that happened from when your uncle forced the door open to returning and finding him afraid of you. When you finish, your mother smiles and pulls you into a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve my brave brave girl!\" she says. \"Good for you!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When the blackout suddenly found laying on a dirty bathroom floor. Slowly you opened your eyes getting up as you saw your reflection in the mirror. However it wasn't what you expected. It was your body, your normal male body staring at you with a sinister smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked! I can't believe it worked!\" Your male self said as you stared down to your own body seeing you were now inside your female dopplerganger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell just happened?!\" You cried out demanding an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is my secret Evan dear, or should I say Eve, as I am Evan now.\" Your old body said with a laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't' worry I will treat your body well I have your memories now too. You really are a lucky guy I can't wait to live such a privileged life. I might check back in on you in the future, I am curious what you will look like after the procedure. Oh and have fun with that scumbag Max! Get used to a lot of ass grabbing!\" She said as the mirror suddenly began to shift distort its image until your old male body faded away leaving just your new female reflection staring back at you....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared back at your reflection in shock. There you were your female counterpart. Your hair was the same dark brown but now shoulder length. You had a pair of modest breasts, probably large B cup or small C cup. Decent figure but nothing special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head began to suddenly ache as more memories of Eve's life began pouring into you. You saw her troubled childhood was indeed true. However she was always very smart and clever but due to growing up both poor and a woman her options were very limited. Her dream as a child was always to be a famous dancer. She had taken many different types of dance lessons as a child. However as an adult she has had to make due with being a waitress and server as a high end strip club downtown in the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had hopes of getting on stage one day herself. Show off her amazing dance skills and maybe build up a name for herself. Use the extra money to open her own dance studio. However the owner of the club, a guy named Max was a total scum bag and pervert. Just a week ago Eve had a meeting with him asking to go up on stage. Max laughed at her at told her no way. He said her tits were too small her figure too narrow. She was cute enough to get a man's attention but not nearly sexy enough for him to drop tips on her on stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis came as a crushing blow for Eve and seemed to be the last straw in her self confidence. She burst out in tears in the meeting begging Max for one chance. Max thought about it and pulled out a contract from his desk. He told her there was a \"procedure\" that could make her stage acceptable if she wanted, But it wasn't cheap. She would have to sign a year long \"employment contract\" where a portion of her salary would go to paying off the procedure and she was forbidden from quitting or getting another job until it was paid for. Forced with no other options Eve signed it....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memories seemed to fade bringing you back. You realized now why she switched bodies with you now. She couldn't bare the idea of selling herself like this. You still had no idea how she managed to switch with you though. It seemed she was able to block that memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes there was a sudden knock on the door as a woman was standing in your doorway. Using Eve's memories you recognized her as Candy, or at least that was her stage name. She was one of the strippers at the club. Her body was practically perfect. Huge round tits, long flowing hair, and a perfect hourglass figure. She was one of the most popular dancers at the club. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on we are late. The Doctor doesn't like to be kept waiting.\" She said grabbing your hand as you found yourself being dragged out of your apartment. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You found being almost dragged by Candy who took you downstairs and hailed a cab for the two of you. You could barely even say anything as she tossed you in the backseat of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...I'm...not sure about this.\" You spoke up in your new softer voice. You new it was futile to explain you weren't exactly Eve but maybe you could get out of this and try to find away to reverse this body switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen don't worry. I know it sounds scary but you will be fine. I had mine done about a year ago and I've heard it's gotten even easier since then.\" Candy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...its just, I've had a change of heart, I think maybe this isn't for me.\" You said trying to come up with a realistic way out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You already signed the agreement. Back out now and Max will own you....Trust me he will destroy your life if you run away now. My contract is almost up and I've made enough money to set myself up comfortably. Just do it and try to think of your next year as your wild and crazy phase. Your whole life is still ahead of you.\" Candy said from obvious years of experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized now how badly you were screwed. If you ran now any hopes of trying to establish control over this new body and life was gone, along with any hopes of trying to reverse it. If you went through with it you were signing yourself up for a year of stripping and exotic dancing, being the sex object for countless men to lear at. However at least this way you got to remain where you were and hopefully do some digging into just how Eve switched you to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little other choice you sighed and nodded agreeing to go along with the original plan. You had to admit if you were going to be stuck being a woman at least being a sexier one sounded more preferable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes the two of you arrived at an office building and Candy took you inside. After signing in at the front deck an elevator took the two of you to a laboratory like room where an older man with white hair and a lab coat was waiting for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up as the two of you entered as a small smile crossed his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back Candy, and you must be Eve. My name is Dr. Roberts.\" He said shaking your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know why you are here Eve?\" Dr. Roberts asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm....to become prettier?\" You said not really sure what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess that's one to see it.\" Dr. Roberts said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What we are going to do is. Series of injections that are going to restructure your genetic makeup.We inject you with millions of microscopic nano machines that reprogram your genetic code based on a design we create. This causes a much quicker and safer transformation. Compared to artificial surgeries, hair bleaching, tanning, nail extensions, etc.\" He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is...it permanent?\" You asked nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you always come in for more changes after a certain period of time...but yes the process doesn't naturally reserve itself.\" The Doctor explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What....what will I like look?\" You asked shaking a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's up to whomever submitted the design. I believe it was your employer Mr. Maximus Lustin correct?\" The Doctor replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see a table being prepped as several needles were being brought over as now was your last chance to submit or try and run.</span></div></div>",

You decided your best chance to beat this was to go along for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we are ready to begin, Eve could you stand over there we are going to take some stock photos.\" The doctor said pointing to a wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath you nodded and stood over by the wall. You were wearing just an orange blouse and jeans with flip flops. Nothing to special so you just made a rather half hearted smile as they took your photo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thumb9.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/81341/81341,1256313152,2/stock-photo-headshot-of-average-looking-teen-girl-39428170.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://thumb9.shutterstock.com/display_...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Eve, now please remove your clothing, we need to take a free nude shots to examine your body in detail.\" The doctor said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the way?\" You asked blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please, remember I am just a doctor this is for the procedure.\" He said reassuring you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't even seen your own body naked yet. You have definitely noticed the differences between being male and female but not to any real detail yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing you slowly began to strip down as you tossed your clothes aside. While not ugly you noticed why Eve felt so self conscious. Her butt was flat and her breasts were rather small and not totally even shaped. Her legs had clear razor stuble and her public hair needed a serious trim. She reminded you of this quiet girl you knew back in high school that once asked you out and you rejected her. The irony was starting to hit you that were actually talking about yourself now....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Eve. Now please join us over here.\" The Doctor said as he escorted you to a long table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please lay down and try to relax.\" He said helping you lay down comfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table was a bit cold on your bare skin but had nice head rests and padding on it. As you laid down the doctor suddenly reached over and grabbed some straps and wrapped them around your wrists and ankles, tying you to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...what's going on?\" You said getting nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just for your own protection. The process can be a jarring at times we can't have you squirming around too much. Just try to relax. The doctor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking deep breaths you were getting more and more nervous as they brought the needles over. You always hated getting shots as a kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are going to start nice and small. This injection will stimulate hair growth and color  follicles.\" The doctor said grabbing the first needle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor injected you right above the temple which stung a bit as you felt your head beginning to tingle. It didn't take long to feel your hair beginning to get longer as it passed down your shoulders hitting your mid back. You could also see the color beginning to lighten. It was getting brighter and was soon was a nice shade of blonde. It kept lightening until it was a bright platinum blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow....I didn't think it was going to be that fast.\" You said surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's fascinating right?\" The doctor said as they brought over the other needles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese next series of injections will complete the transformation. It will rework your skin tone, body hair, body structure. Everything. You may experience some discomfort during this stage.\" The doctor said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor proceeded by injecting a serious if shots into your feet, legs, abdomen, chest, and arms. Almost every major part of your body.</span></div></div>",
