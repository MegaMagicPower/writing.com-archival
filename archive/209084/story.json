Though it didn't last very long there was much bloodshed, <i>way</i> to much. People call it the Great War. After awhile the Great War moved to Yadar and humans and namorns met the lizard people. Now, the Lizard people are pretty peaceful, you leave them alone they'll leave you alone. But the humans and namorns saw the lizard people fight and decided that the lizard people were dangerous and had to be killed before the lizard killed them. So that added more bloodshed. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThis really doesn't <i>have</i> to have anything to do with the story, just lets you know what has happened.</span></div></div>",

People come through the crack in the sewer wall that serves you as a door. You heard them coming long ago. You sniff the air. A million smells come to you. You sort through them to find the sent of the newcomers. They are Namorns...six of them. Five of them must be bodygaurds, they smell of metal, leather, their personal sent, sweat, the sewer fumes, cotton. The other one must be Nazzar, the one who hired you. He smells of expensive fabrics, sweat, many different kinds of metal, his personal sent, hair oils, and rich foods. You breath deep, making sure you rememberthe sents.\r<br>\n\"Have a seat, Nazzar. I would offer food but I doubt you would want what I have to offer.\" A bitter sent becomes stronger - fear. Everyone knows you are blind and it scares him to have you waiting for him. You hear the scratching of the chair against stone and the rustle of fabric. The bodygaurds take places around their boss and draw their weaponds, they smell like swords but you can never be sure. You breath deeply turning your head. Now you know where all the gaurds are.\r<br>\n\"Is it true what they say?\" Nazzar asks in a high piched voice that hurts your ears.\r<br>\nHad you been able to see you would see your scales and hair get a pinkish tinge, you hate it when people want to know if what 'they say' is ture, \"I must speak to this scholar 'They'. For They have many things to say about everything, and it is rarely true. I must also speak the scholar 'Everyone'.\" You wait for Nazzar to say why he hired you. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou sigh and the pinkish tinge in your scales and hair gets stronger, \"How can I tell you if what 'they say is true' if I don't know what it is?\"\r<br>\n\"Right. They say that you fought in the Great War. Is it true?\"\r<br>\n\"Yes. I was defending my clan, it is how I lost my sight.\"\r<br>\n\"But you weren't able to save your clan, you're the only one.\"\r<br>\nYour scales turn into a light shade of red, \"Do you have a job for me or not? I have better things to do then relive memories with a namorn.\" </span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">The year is 7084 aliens have landed on Earth and that's old news. Now four young people set out to look for adventure, or just get out of the slums that they live in and see the world.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n<u>Jace Falconer</u>: Jace is a human, he has short reddish brown hair with brown eyes and is 23. He lives in the slums with his mother and sister Rhea. He's the leader type, always takes control and keeps a pretty cool head no matter what. He never knew his father, and is not sure he ever wants to. Jace works at a shipping company, loading and unloading, his mother works as a healer and midwife, his sister is a pickpocket.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n<u>Rhea Falconer</u>: Rhea is a human with shoulder length black hair with brown eyes and is 18. She knows the best way to travel, the quickest way and slowest way and things like that. Rhea always looks on the bright side of things, and can find good in almost anyone. She belives that if humans had tried being nice to the lizard people instead of hunting them there wouldn't have been so much bloodshed, and she is right(will be explained in 1st chapter). She wants to become friends with Tara sort of understand her better, if you will.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n<u>Marek Moonsword</u>: Marek is a human with short brown hair with ice blue eyes and is 20. He is a merchant and lives in the slums. He is Jaces friend. He knows how to get the best good, weaponds, food for the lowest prices and how to sell them for the highest. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n<u>Tara \"The Snake\" Quickclaw</u>: Tara is a lizard person. She looks like a reptilian human. She is a mercenary, who people call 'The Snake', no one knows her real name. The only thing people know about lizard people is how they fight and the myths people have made up and they are the most hated race in the universe. She has forgotten how old she is. Her scales and hair change to show her emotion(pink: irrated, red: angry)or at will. Other than that they are black. She is one of the best mercenary even though she is blind. Her eyes are all white, if she ever got her sight back they'd be silverblue. She lost her eye sight durning the Great War. Tara has many past demons and enemies. She could get her eyesight back if she went back to her home planet, Yadar, but she doesn't because she is afraid of what her people will think of her. Lizard people are actually rather peaceful, and being a mercenary makes Tara sick.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nPlease, please, please GIVE ME YOUR IMPUT AND ADD CHAPTERS!!!     </td>",
