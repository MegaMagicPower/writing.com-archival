She's a founding member of the X-Men, a lover of Scott Summers (Cyclops) and a very powerful psychic! Has something of a bad side though. Depending on whether or not she's in control of the Phoenix Force, some stories involving her get a little planet explodey. Has something of a bad reputation for cheating death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr there's the Time Displaced Jean Grey (teen Jean...Jeen?) from the pages of All-New X-Men. She and the other founding X-Men (Scott, Bobby, Hank, and Warren) have been brought to the future by Beast in hopes of sobering up Scott Summers. She's not nearly as versed in her powerset, and she's not really as moral either. She reads people's minds by accident most of the time, but she's not adverse to making people think what she wants them to think. Still pretty new to this whole \"X-Man\" thing. Also to this whole \"future\" thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then there's also some alternate versions of Jean too. So yeah.</span></div></div>",

It's more than understandable that someone not used to such an indulgent culture getting a little swept up in all the consumption and consumerism.

She grabbed hold of the plate with her hand and started to telekinetically bring the food up to her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since she'd come to the future, things had been a whirlwind of action. It had made her appreciate these moments of calm and quiet so much more. Not to mention, for all the crap the future threw at her, at least it had good food. So many things to try, so many more restaurants and that was before one went on to the internet and saw all the various crazy ideas! It was a tad overwhelming at first, but Jean had taken to it well enough as it helped take the edge of things. She'd also gotten into the habit of using her telekinesis a lot more. Her control was quickly increasing, the amount of power she could throw behind it was astonishing and she found multi-tasking to becoming easier and easier with every day that passed. She'd begun to use it in her every day life. It seemed only natural. What was the point in moving multiple feet to get an object when she could quickly bring it to herself with just a thought? Not only was it more efficient, it helped her to acclimate her powers to almost natural instinct. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, several people had express concern over her new eating and telekinetic habits. Not to her face, few had the courage for that, but they were definitely thinking it. Jean's telepathy made sure she knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'She should be careful. She's going to get fat.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Man, if she keeps that up...' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Is Jean looking a bit bigg-OH CRAP! She can read minds! I'm sorry!'</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean had to stifle a giggle at that last one. Scott was so easy to fluster sometimes. One would think she'd be angry. A girl's weight was a touchy subject by most standards. But Jean was not overtly concerned. Her powers dealt with her mind, not her body. Even if she turned into a butterball, it wouldn't really affect what she could do or hinder her performance. Heck, that was part of her reasoning of using her telekinesis so much more, to demonstrate that physicality really didn't enter the equation where she was concerned. If she happened to enjoy some extra perks or indulgences, what did matter at the end of the day? <br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n'Besides, it's not like I'm fat or anything, anyway,'</i> Jean reassured herself.

Quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jean, mind or not, I don't see why not you shouldn't have to work on your limbs, you know I've read our bodies are way more important i--- Is that another Hershey's bar?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no.\"  That was most definitely a lie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ah!

Was this like a fat person's mind? Oh, god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Jeanie.

Rachel!\" Yeah, this was awkward for the both of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.\" Rachel started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah..\" Jean..yeahed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heresthesandwichyourewelcome!\" Rachel said, arms out with the can and wrapped sandwich out for Jean, leaving Jean to sit up, but Rachel noticed the slight roll her stomach bunched into, and surprised she didn't even notice her..mom already had a mom bod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait that's weird, Rachel shook her head and went off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty snickered as Rachel stood by her again, \"Went well I suppose?\"  \"Shutu-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud <b> BRUURP </b> came from Jean's direction.

Chewing furiously as she made her way to her bed, and flopped down, stomach doing the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm..fat.\" She sighed, telekinetically feeding herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow can this get any worse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, wait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Packed to the brim with a variety of different fast foods, especially poor Jean, the...\"bigger of the two\" who's already pudgy stomach, was stiff and made her look like she was overdue. Kitty on the other hand, had it easy, yet still owning a watermelon sized gut, in place where her flat board stomach once was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour wait was enough to make both girls completely ravenous, and it did, sort of worrying. The food came in, and in a sort time, it was gone. The remaining wrappers, grease stains, crumbs, and others laid around the culprits. Getting a small whimper out of Jean as she realized, turning her head to look at Kitty. \"Think..um..we over did it?\" The redhead nervously smiled. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nWith a frown, the mutant slapped her own gut, and not surprised as it gurgled almost angrily.  Opening her mouth to respond, kitty quickly closed them, and Jean saw as her cheeks puffed up. A sound like someone was revving up an engine, pushed out of her lips and she sighed, eyes locking with the redhead. \"We over did it? What do you...<b>BHHTHINKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK.</b>\" Kitty was taken back as her words mixed into her belch, but as the two laid in silence, she started hollering. Slightly wincing to give her gut a quick a rub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didya hear that, Jeanie!\" She exclaimed, \"Haven't burped like that since I was a teenager!

Leaving Jean in some sort of disgust, before laughter started slipping out of her, and the two started laughing out loud like a pair of bloated hyenas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean, too embarrassed really to do anything, watched as kitty scavenged for any left over sodas and chugged them whole, leaving her with the ability to belch out the alphabet, and even an entire math equation, which she solved! That left Jean clapping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Jean. Just one.\" Kitty pleaded. \"Kitty, please- who knows, with my powers I could..I could blow you away or something!\" With an all too real worry, kitty brushed it off, sliding over a can of soda, and watching it roll until it bumped into Jean's gut. She swiftly grabbed the drink, cracked it opened, and took a large sip..... \"Urp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's..it?  Well, it was som-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, guys!

Any attempts at dieting stopped before they even started. Mainly due to the fact that she was used to eating so much now. Her stomach would let out a small roar if she didn't fill it, much to her embarrassment. She'd turned more than a couple heads that way, much to her chargin. There was always some kind of morsel floating around, ready to be eaten, tempting her. Based on that, Jean had taken actually exercising regularly; jogging, stretching, and all manner of general fitness routines to get herself back into shape. Surprisingly, she had stuck to it, despite all odds. If for no other reason than that Jean refused to become so useless pile of lard that could only do things with her mind and who'd end up red faced and wheezing if she had to climb more than a flight of stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that just made it<b><i>worse</i></b>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the exercise, her body demanded <i>more</i>. <i>More</i> to keep her moving, <i>more</i> to keep her going. This was on top of the amounts that it had already become accustomed to. As her need for sustenance increased, more and more weight piled onto her. Her gut had only become bigger, a globe of flesh that protruded outward like a great mound before her. Her modest bust had increased as well, though not to any ridiculous degree. Her arms and legs were not spared either, becoming laden with adipose. Her rear had expanded greatly, her enlarged buns big enough to crush any poor small animal should they find themselves underneath her. When she walked it was like her cheeks and hips were fighting to rise higher than the other than the other. Even her face had plumped, though she remained easily identifiable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only upside to this seeming vicious cycle was that the constant exercise had prevent Jean from turning into a flabby mess. Yes, she was big. Yes, she was fat. But she was...compact? Sturdy? More akin to a sumo wrestler than anything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean frowned. Once upon a time, she'd had never made that comparison and the fact that she was thinking that was a plus, of all things, just reinforced how different she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'There's got to be something going on. I don't think like this! I would never think like this.'</i> she thought, almost desperately. <i>'This cannot be natural. I have weigh over two hundred pounds and I shouldn't be able to gain that much so fast!'</i></span></div></div>",

And not think of the out of breath redhead that approached her with a puffy, red as her hair face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ra-wheeze-chel!\" Jean cracked open a smile, from her red face. The poor redhead huffed and puffed her way to the counter, opening her hand to let a water bottle fly into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean's all too short attempts at working out continued, and they seemed to just get shorter. Her 200 pound framed was packed into a top with a large \"X\" printed across her still intact breast, with her bulbous gut poking out and forming a bit of a muffin top, especially with her butt and thighs, forced into a too tight shorts. Definitely this out fit hugged her curves, but she did not want that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Workout?\" Rachel assumed, scanning the stature of her peer..ish. She almost felt pity for the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean responded with a quick nod, dipping her head back and chugging the drink like there was no tommorow, but there was. And a small burp was it's signal. \"Y-yeah.. took a lot of breath out of me, but we're getting there! Can already...feel the abs coming back..\" Her hand pressed into her gut, and sunk into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel blinked, bit into the sandwich, and blinked again.  This girl ain't gonna lose a pound.. especially if she keeps eyeing my sandwich. God, maybe I should... Maybe she should.. \"Hey, Jean?\" Jean perked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll spot you, get some weights... y'know? Work out together..bonding? Yeah, I think that's bonding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean looked at Rachel, almost staring at her like she just spoke in some foreign language, that probably wasn't that hard to learn but-- She hesitated, looking down at the growling gut she owned. And opened her mouth to......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dazed, Jean blinked a few times before making sure she was truly awake, her eyes shifted from side to side, she saw her room, her bedroom, intact and everything, but to the side of her...Emma Frost, Rachel...and Kitty?! What the heck, were they doing in her roo...and why was there..mm! Her thoughts were ignored, as the blonde beauty had shoved an entire folded pancake into Jean's mouth, the pancake was abnormally large, with syrup drizzled onto the middle. <i>Wh-whats happening?!</i> Jean, forced her eyes down..and mentally screamed when she saw her obese body, cramped into her usual outfit, now altered by tears with pudge seeping through them, and multiple stains from her binges. Her chins dug into each other, seeing her gut fill onto her lap, and her breast resting comfortably on the giant ball of fat. <i>Oh..no, oh no, oh...</i> Her thoughts were stopped again, when Rachel and Kitty fed her more of these fatty foods, more and more, these greased filled snacks were added onto her body by the second, and it stopped when all three ladies looked directly at Jean..and started...<b>BEEP! BEEP BEEP!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean bolted awake, breathing heavily, the girl looked down at the watch that was strapped tightly onto her soft arm. She huffed, placing a hand on her exposed pudgy stomach, exposed by her current outfit for her workout with Rachel. An X branded sports bra was clad onto her chest, leaving her stomach to poke out like a pimple. Not to mention her shorts, which bubble butt and all, were packed tight in, she could've sworn she was losing circulation in her bottom half. She sighed, resting her head back onto the couch, hoping this scheduled nap time was worth the wait, until her eyes were met with an unimpressed Rachel staring down at her.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made a schedule for this, y'know?! Had to reschedule some of my classes. But it's for...a good cause?\" Rachel spun around to see, a waddling red in the face redhead, thighs rubbing against each other, each step making her feel worse than the last.  \"This might just be the longest workout, of my entire damned life.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-------------------------</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One!...Two!....Three!..Four!..Fi... Five...five?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean struggled to rise from the floor, rising with the strength of a sloth, her elbow inched, and inched.. and... Down the redhead went, and sweat drenched fat slapped against the already stained mat. Placed in the custom programmed Danger Room session, which as it seemed. Worked...just a bit?  Rachel deadpanned, getting up and leaving the bloated telepath on her mat. The room around them, dissolving into a clean, sleek grey room.  \"Lunch...?\" Jean panted out, rolling onto her flabby stomach, and getting back to her feet, with a little bit of help of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----------------------------</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was unimaginable, that this sweet, powerful girl was devouring a handful of fries in seconds. Right next to me, I was a stick. A stick compared to Jean's growing body, her thigh practically touched over my excuse of one. And as I took my first bite, she already was on her last. It wasn't the most ideal meal for a post workout, but those puppy eyes she would do on you, couldn't resist, but the size of these hamburgers. Almost one Beast hand large, and this was just the medium sized one. Hell, the fries? Almost like sausage links, and this girl was absolutely devouring them.  As Jean states, it's to refill her \"energy\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPush-ups, sit ups, jumping jacks, all of those passed by during the week. Every other day, it seemed to get harder for Jean, as her gut, and all of her jiggled and wobbled about. Pull ups became hell, her soft arms, lost of any form of biceps or muscles, didn't move an inch, Rachel having to lower the bar, and it still didn't make a difference. Push ups were equally as bad, her arms barely able to lift her frame, and not to mention, her gut, inches from touching the floor, when she did manage to do the task. And running? Absolutely horrid, and the impact it left on her, leaving her exhausted, sweaty, and most of all, her stomach roaring out for any type of substance. Meaning as the days went on, Rachel noticed her post meals got even worsening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it'll only get worse by then, when Rachel Grey looked into the mirror, to find a bloated gut. And Jean Grey was lazily shoving slices into her maw. </span></div></div>",

So instead of crawling, now they all get around by relying on these awful metal spider-limbed harnesses that carry them pubah-style. And as if that wasn't bad enough, everyone in this sad little shithole of a dimension is constantly bombarded with time-displaced media waves that drive them steadily insane. It wasn't until they learned how to decipher these radio waves that they really came into their niche though. The waves were from <i>our</i> media. So once television was a thing, the Spineless Ones only got steadily worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey're not so terrifying to look at, really. Aside from being a jaundiced yellow, they almost look kind of human. If you can ignore the spider-harness-things that make up where their legs should be. They're all fat, sluggish people who are both enamored and enraged by Earth culture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo basically, they're day-time TV junkies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the leader of them all, the ruler of the Mojoverse, is Mojo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Shocker, right?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMojo's probably the most terrifying out of all of them. Most of them, the Spineless Ones, look more or less human. But Mojo... doesn't. He's incredibly obese, most of his body is comprised of a big naked yellow stomach, sagging man breasts, and jowls. But somehow he keeps his arms all stringy and spindly, which makes him all the more awkward to look at. Mojo's skin color looks somehow more sickeningly yellow than the rest of his people, and he is visibly the most unstable out of everyone else in his dimension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, he was the Villain of the Day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust another day in the life of being a time-displaced X-Man, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had more or less been your average day, as far as being a mutant went. Wake up, School breakfast, wipe up after that guy with the congealed exoskeleton, ignore Bobby, go to class with Professor Kitty, ignore Bobby, notice some unidentified flying objects Roswell-style hovering over a recently discovered mutant, and head out to save said mutant while ignoring Bobby. What was so strange about that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move it, brat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the few \"normal\" people in this awful place was some woman with white hair, clouded eyes, and six arms--two natural, four mechanical. She didn't seem to share the same kinship at being the two most humanoid beings on this terrible rock. Six-Armed-Chick held Jean's hands behind her back with one pair of appendages, held the power-dampening collar around her neck with another, and let the other two hang sharply at her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean Grey had spent the grand total of a year in the \"future.\" In that time she'd spontaneously developed psychic powers due to the stress of time-travel, learned that in this future she's dead twice over and became a planet-killing monster embued with the power of the Phoenix Force, learned that her boyfriend grows up to become a mutant revolutionary, broke up with said boyfriend only to have him go off and become a space pirate, attacked by a version of the aptly named Brotherhood of Evil Mutants that included herself from the future (not the one that's dead, but a version of her that never went back in time to... whatever, <i>her</i>), traveled to an alternate universe, been captured for the crimes of her future self (the, uh... the one that died) on <i>top</i> of nearly getting herself killed multiple times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now she was getting manhandled by a dominatrix with six arms in front of the poster-child of television addiction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that... is that really her?\" the great mooshy monster whispered excitedly, \"the fabled Teenaged Jean Grey plucked from time and space?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one and only.\" Jean whimpered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marvelous!\" Mojo roared boistrously, \"Oh what a treat! This girl, this <i>ugly</i> little thing has just been the talk of the town! People love you, people <i>hate</i> you, people can't decide if they want to hug you or rip your arms off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Thanks?\" Jean ducked her head, trying to avoid Mojo's putrid breath, \"Hey, I'm not--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but you ARE, my dear!\" Mojo stretched out an arm, his long fingernails scraping against Jean's chin, \"You're the biggest ratings grab this dimension has ever <i>seen</i>! You're almost as big as that scrappy little guy with the claws around here--what you and your boyfriend did to J'Son? BRILLIANT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not just some ratings... and Scott and I are not--!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I know, the relationship drama, the romance!\" Mojo's mechanical spider-legs clacked against the metal tile of his chambers, \"He loves you, you love him, that hairy fellow loves you, even the Angel loves you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean clenched slightly as Mojo let out a disturbing cackle that sent ripples through his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, everybody loves Jean Grey. You.\" Mojo purred sickeningly, click-clacking close enough to caress Jean's jaw, \"And that's just what I'm counting on for my latest project--Little Girl Lost... on Mojoworld!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean didn't have to be able to read minds (she kinda couldn't right now) to be able to tell that the woman who was holding her at attention was just about as excited about Mojo's latest \"project\" as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Picture it, dear: a girl, a mutant, <i>you</i> are stranded on an unfamiliar but beautiful planet that's strikingly different than the one you call home. You'll explore the culture, walk around town with those ghastly legs of yours, and try to find a way back home. But in the meantime there'll be plenty of time for your traditional fish-out-of-water excursions, hilarious misunderstandings, and maybe a romance or two to help spice things up a bit--you know, get the ladies a little riled up. And then--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is insane!\" Jean interrupted his rant with a sharp cry, \"I'm not some... toy! You can't just do this to people! Abduct them and... and take away their powers and make them perform for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but I <i>can</i>, you ugly little ratings eater.\" Mojo's smile widened evilly, \"Not only are you in the wrong time... you're in the wrong <i>space</i>. Who on this planet, on <i>my</i> planet, is going to care? As long as that collar is on you, you'll do whatever I want. And maybe, just maybe, I'll ship you home once the ratings drop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean bit her bottom lip, holding back tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or kill you. However sweeps season works out.\" </span></div></div>",

Some kind of prodigy. Professor Cyclops, Professor Kitty, Ms. Frost and her stupid little cuckoo not-daughters, everyone couldn't shut up about how great she was supposed to be. What's worse, she could <i>hear</i> them talk about how great she's supposed to be. Constantly. All the time, their thoughts just poured into her head like water into a pitcher. Professor Kitty had been doing her best to teach her how to work her psychic powers to stop things like that, and for the most part it had been steadily improving. But even when she wasn't trying to, Jean could still hear the thoughts of other people. She didn't like it (usually), and neither did anyone else (usually).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she would have given anything to be able to hear the thoughts again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was painfully still, the only sounds to be heard were the click-clacking of the six-armed woman's heels as she guided Jean to a large uncomfortable-looking chair that stood under the otherwise pitch-black room's sole light. She sat Jean down and held her with two sets of arms while the latter two fastened her in. The restraints were uncomfortably tight as they cut into her wrists. Once her hands were secured, the woman went to work on her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the helmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a weird thing. Not really a \"helmet\" per se, but some kind of headband-wire contraption. Jean's captor strapped it around her long red locks, pulling it until it squeezed her head obstructively, and then started fiddling with the wires. She placed one above each eyelid and stretched another around for the lower lids, the reeled them back in until Jean couldn't blink. Her green eyes, dialated by fear, shot across the room. Back and forth, unable to discern anything that could have potentially helped her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do to me?!\" Jean yelped as the strain on her lids caused her eyes to water, \"Wh-What <i>is</i> this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too tight?\" the woman asked nonchalantly, her voice a sultry purr, \"Can't have that. You'll miss the show if your precious little eyelids rip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strain on her eyes did lighten slightly as her captor loosened the wires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-Thank you...\" did she just thank the woman who attacked her team? The one who'd slapped this awful collar on her and held her captive for... God, how long had she been here? \"What's going on?! What the hell even <i>is</i> this place?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Mojoworld. That was Mojo. I'm Spiral. And you're the biggest thing to hit Mojoworld since Deadpool.\" the woman stated matter-of-factly, \"You'll probably get the gist of this, but I work for Mojo. And now, so do you. You're going to star in a new lighter-and-softer TV show that'll air after some documentary about a bunch of kids killing each other to keep things balanced out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What...?\" Jean stared stupidly in front of her, the power-dampening collar restricting her neck movements<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't heard of it? Strange. It was filmed on your Earth. It had that girl. The Angel's new girlfriend--Little Wolverine.\" Spiral said idly as she fiddled with some remote, \"X-23, that's it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you <i>watch</i> that kind of stuff?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean wasn't there in Murderworld (a little before her time) but she had some vague idea of what went down inside it. Laura--X-23--had some nasty memories of what happened there. Ones that stood out against her already particularly nasty memories. People... <i>teenagers</i>, some no older than herself, died in horrible, awful ways. What kind of time--what kind of <i>world</i> was she on where people watched that kind of thing for fun?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not yet. I have it set to record.\" Spiral shrugged as the lights dimmed, \"Normally I try not to watch too much Mojovision. Rots the brain. But I make an occasional exception for programs that... <i>interest</i> me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jean's unblinking eyes, a television screen appeared as if from nowhere. Back where she came from, in her time, an eighteen inch was considered big. This was a theatre-grade monstrosity, bigger than Jean could have really fathomed. And it suddenly just came to life with a big flash of white light. She couldn't look away--everywhere her eyes could go, some portion of the screen remained visible. She was going to be forced to watch... something. Something awful, judging by the look on Spiral's face before she turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Mojoworld, Precious.\" Spiral snorted, \"<i>This</i> is what those fat slobs call entertainment. Better buckle up.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It had to be something different. Something terrible and awful, but something different surely. Giant robots taller than skyscrapers, stomping out cities wreathed in fire and bathed in blood. Mutant blood. The blood of her people splattered across their giant purple feet like they were nothing but bugs to be stepped on. And humans too--kidnapping, torturing, raping, and killing mutants just for the sake of being born differently. Born with an X-Gene. Hours of footage, all rolled into one and set to a laugh track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt couldn't be right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Spiral laughing the entire time like some kind of inhuman monster at all the worst possible parts. How could anyone take so much pleasure in the suffering of so many people? How could anyone, mutant or not, laugh while people are burned alive by fire? Or melted by a giant robot's laser vision? How was this even a thing? Screw the giant robots, had people become so calloused that they just... didn't care? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean stared into the floating blue eye of the video camera that had been following her around ever since she'd been shoved into her room. It was just... there. Getting different shots of her, probably waiting for her to do something interesting. But she wasn't, and probably wouldn't be doing anything interesting for some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMojo had given her a pretty nice room. Nothing like the prison cell she was expecting. A lot better than the actual prison cell she had back at the New Xavier School, and somehow even moreso than her room back at the Jean Grey School. It was supposed to be \"modern\", but the word had kind of lost meaning to the time-displaced teenager. Big bed, big TV, big silver fridge and those hanging square lights over the window, nice view of the city skyline. It was sleek and fancy like all the magazines in this time seemed to like. Actually, knowing how much these freaks liked Earth Culture, Mojo probably based it around the same magazine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just laying there, on her bed, in her uniform. The white and green onesie that Professor Magick had conjured up for her a while back, and sadly enough the last little bit of \"home\" she had left. And not even her real home. Some twisted alternate future timeline where she was dead. Her bright red hair was spread out on the bed, flared as she lay motionless. Her hands folded across her stomach, trying to ignore the thick gurgling groans of hunger that rumbled deep within. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could they expect her to just... snap back from all of that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little silver ball floating over her head watched her expectantly, capturing even the littlest twitch in its quest for daytime TV gold. The blue lense adjusted visibly, its pupil dialated slightly before contracting in the light. Probably another close-up shot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jean?\" the ball suddenly projected a familiar voice, \"Jean, can you hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" her face curled into one of disgust, \"Now shut up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jean, you're not... <i>doing</i> anything.\" Mojo said from the other end of the line, his voice distorted by the speaker, \"Do something interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a freak.\" Jean snarled, \"How could you <i>show</i> me all of that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll do a lot worse than show you some reruns if you don't get moving!\" Mojo hollered from behind his little camera, \"We've got a <i>show</i> to shoot, and you're our lead star!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Reruns</i>?!\" Jean shot up on her bed, \"You showed me <i>genocide</i>! You showed me my people being massacred!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your people from a few expendeable alternate realities and simulations, rest assured!\" Mojo laugh-lied his way through his placating attitude, \"We had to show you what you're up against. You need to be cute (as cute as you can be with that ugly human... <i>thing</i> you've got going on, anyway) and quirky and hilarious if you want to keep their interest. People are <i>tired</i> of the whole brutal killing and raping and pillaging, at least the 14-18 female crowd is. They want something... new. Something unique!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're showing a Battle Royale ripoff with my friend in it.\" Jean said flatly, \"I've read her mind. There was nothing cute or quirky in that Arena.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a demographic thing!\" Mojo corrected her gently before his tone took a sharp turn, \"Now. Get. Up. Jean. You have a pilot to shoot and we need something <i>good</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if I wanted to entertain you and your gross yellow blob-on-spider people, which I seriously don't want to do, you took away the one thing that was interesting about me.\" she pointed to her collar, \"My powers. You kind of neutered me. But if you want to stick around until my team gets back--which, newsflash, will be any second now--you and your freaks will get to see a whole lot of X-Gene getting thrown around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! Why are you making this so difficult for me? For <i>us</i>? All we want to do is make you a star, Jeannie.\" Mojo cried through the speaker, \"Your powers aren't your only defining feature, you know! You're fiery. You're smart. You charm the pants off of all the little twerps in your group--do <i>that</i>! Make some of <i>that</i> happen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With who?\" Jean stood, putting her hands on her hips defiantly, \"You? Through a talking eyeball camera? Yeah, that'll be good for ratings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D'oooh... you're a snarky little human, aren't you?\" Mojo's voice sounded angry, but the unphased and unblinking eyeball camera held no such emotion, \"Fine. We'll... work something out. Just... watch some Mojovision and we'll work something out. In the meantime, just be as interesting as possible. But not too interesting-- we need to save something for the holiday break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll try to do that.\" Jean rolled her eyes as she collapsed back on the bed, her arms spread-eagled as she lay, staring up at the cieling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go watch the Mojovision.\" Mojo commanded again from the camera as it followed her, \"It's good for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bite me.\" Jean spat at the lens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go. Watch. The. Mojovision.\" the speaker sadid slowly and throutgh (what she assumed were) gritted teeth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sharp jolt of electricity caught Jean off-guard, causing her to flounder and roll off of the bed, where she seized for a bit more before it stopped. She looked around wildly, unable to discern the source of her sudden shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have our ways.\" Mojo said proudly, \"Your collar doesn't just nullify your psychic powers--it is also equipped with a remote electrical charge. It's light. But it's also adjustable. Just in case you try anything unsavory like, say, trying to remove your collar, I have a handy dandy cattle prod to help <i>coerce</i> you back into my control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're missing Maury.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All the time. Like, the worst of the worst. Jerry Springer and Maury Pauvich and Steve Wilkos. Fashion Police. Court shows confusingly enough. It was just... daytime television. On every channel. And when it wasn't that, it was recordings of superhero fights. Spider-Man versus some creepy vampire guy, the \"replacement\" Fantastic Four versus the Mole Man, something about Captain America on a distant planet? Some other alternate future? None of this made sense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe windows in her room were unbreakable. And even if they weren't, she was up really high. If she had her powers, she could float herself down nice and easy. But as she stood now, all she'd manage to accomplish is making herself a redheaded road pizza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis world... Mojoworld, whatever... it just wasn't right. There were giant floating televisions showcasing the violent acts from her world. Skyscrapers pierced the horizon, and the sky was a sick purple even this late at night. Below her, even this high up from her penthouse, Jean could see the people of this world--the Spineless Ones--skittering around on those awful metal harnesses. Jean had seen a lot of shit in the past few months. Even before coming to the future, she'd seen a bit of the ugliness humanity had to offer towards the mutants. But this... this was scary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince coming to the future, there wasn't much time to think about the Professor they'd left back in their time. They had really just gotten to know each other before Old Hank took them away to help with Old Scott's \"mutant genocide\", but it was times like these that she really wished he were here right now to keep her calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the insane laughter from the television was hardly going to do much of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean reached for the remote, and posed herself to turn it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a flash of light from behind her as she heard the sound of footsteps encroaching. She whipped around, dropping the remote, to see a conspicuous spiral smack-dab in the middle of the penthouse. Instinctively, she posed her two fingers against her temple, preparing her psychic powers. But the uncomfortable weight of her collar reminded her that she was powerless--helpless against whomever might be coming. The footsteps continued as a distinctly humanoid shape became sillouhetted in the light...</span></div></div>",

This was hardly a surprise considering the packed schedule of mental and physical exertion that composed her days at the Jean Grey School, but this morning in particular seemed different. Most mornings she could get by on a bowl of cereal and maybe one or two pieces of fresh fruit, but the rumble in her stomach was calling for the full treatment of waffles, bacon and eggs, all coated in lashings of maple syrup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed a little odd to her, and it certainly drew the attention of her friends as they sat around the cafeteria table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez Megan, that's enough food for three people.\" Cessily said as she put down her tray. There might have been a hint of jealously in her voice, as her unique physiology of living mercury meant she was unable to eat food like a normal person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It certainly is more than you would normally have.\" Soorya agreed from behind her veil, though with slightly more tact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNori, who's electricity based powers had earned her the codename Surge, only shrugged. \"If you're hungry, you're hungry.\" She may have had more sympathy due to the fact that her elevated metabolism meant she tended to eat bigger meals than the other girls. However even she was finished for a good ten minutes before Pixie finally put down her fork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy that time she was feeling uncomfortably full, her stomach bulging out visibly beneath the mandatory blouse and blazer which were a constant source of irritation to the more long-standing junior members of the X-Men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just saying, Wolverine's put in charge and no one bats an eye when his first decision is to dress us all up like some schoolgirl fantasy?\" Mercury said, treading a well worn argument. Both Surge and Dust agreed, even though the latter had been exempted from exchanging her burka for the much despised uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPixie was glad the conversation had been directed away from her unusual gluttony, and concentrated on walking without jostling her swollen stomach, deciding against flying to class as she usually did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first lesson was thankfully a less intensive one, Mutant Culture with Ms. Guthrie, who usually just talked through whatever lecture she had prepared while the class ignored her. Pixie used this time to rest her head on her desk and run her bloated belly, promising herself that she would never eat that much again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At first, the Sentinels did exactly that, and managed to bring down many mutants, which brought them into fights with both the Brotherhood and the X-Men. Things were controlled, but not for long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the year 2033 the Sentinels realized the mutant race evolved from regular humans, so to truly eliminate the mutant race, the humans must also be controlled. So the Sentinels launched a massive attack across the planet, eliminating most life on Earth, including superhuman teams such as the Avengers, Fantastic Four, and most of the X-Men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sentinels did not kill everybody though, and a small group of resistance fighters survived, though scarred, beaten, and starved of food. The resistance included May Parker, the daughter of Spider-Man and Mary Jane Watson; Morgan Stark, the daughter of Iron Man; an aging Wanda Maximoff, better known as the Scarlet Witch; James Hudson, the son of Wolverine; the head of Deadpool; and a middle aged Kitty Pryde, now called Kate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate did not look good, at fifty three years old and after fighting a decade long war, nobody could come out looking good. She looked very frail, having not eaten anything substantial in years. She had trouble phasing she was so weak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe future was dire, but the resistance had one final plan. After a raid on a Sentinel facility, the group came into possession of power enhancers, and planned to use them on Wanda to Kate back in time to prevent the future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMs. Pryde, remember your mission. 2019 was the year the Sentinels gained sentience. Wanda will send your consciousness into your pasts selfs body. As soon as you get to the past, you need to warn the X-Men and tell them to destroy the Trask facility.\u201d May said as Wanda was injected with the power enhancers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, I\u2019m not going to mess this up, we\u2019ve waited over ten years for this.\u201d Kate said as she laid down on the table in front of Wanda. Wanda blasted her, as her mind we\u2019re blasted thirty years in the past. Kate woke up in her twenty three year old, slightly thick but still thin body. But she was still absolutely starving. She was in the Danger Room, and noticed a machine that she remembered. Beast created it a mutant who constantly lost weight, and it kept him stocked up on a paste-like food. Kate\u2019s stomach growled, and she looked at the machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a little bit of food couldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d Kate said as she walked to the machine...</span></div></div>",

Kate flicked the switch to turn the machine on and the thick paste started going down her throat. She was astounded by the taste, having only eaten scraps for over a decade, this tasted like real food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paste was continuously pumping food down her throat with no signs of stopping, not that Kate was complaining. She was loving the food, so much in fact that the straining of her tight X-Men uniform didn\u2019t even bother her. She didn\u2019t notice how tight it was getting as a coat of fat was beginning to form, and even if she did, she probably wouldn\u2019t even care. Her guy was beginning to push forward, and every inch of muscle in her body was quickly being replaced by fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate has no concept for how long she was hooked up to that machine, but she was so focused on how good the food tasted and how good it felt to eat a lot of food again, that she didn\u2019t even hear Beast and Cyclops shutting the machine off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKitty! What the hell were you doing? What the hell did you do?\u201d Kate snapped back to reality when Cyclops yelled that, as she looked at him and Beast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was just a little bit of food, what\u2019s the big deal?\u201d Kate said, but as she said that she noticed a thick layer of something beneath her chin. She then went to stand up, but she couldn\u2019t. She felt slower, and much heavier than before. It all made sense when Kate looked down at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate was now immense, weighing in at an astonishing five hundred and twenty pounds. She resembled a large beanbag chair, with her gut being pushed out multiple feet from where it once was. Her breasts were also much bigger than before, as was her butt which now sagged off the sides of the chair she was sitting in. Her arms and legs were extremely bloated, with her thigh gap being forever closed. Her cheeks were extremely full, and her neck was replaced by multiple chins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God! I didn\u2019t know I was getting this fat. Why would you make that paste so fattening?\u201d Kate yelled, thinking of the ramifications this had for her future body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe machine was designed for a mutant whose body weight kept dissipating. He had to get extremely fattening food to keep him alive until Forge built a cure. What made you so hungry anyway?\u201d Beast asked as Kate remembered her mission. She had to warn the X-Men of the Sentinels. But she also wanted more of that paste...</span></div></div>",

On the Blackbird on the way back to the mansion, Kate felt herself starting to slip away, as her future no longer came to pass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy time here is over. Thank you guys, you prevented a tragedy the world could never recover from.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI\u2019m fucking huge!\u201d Kitty screamed at the top of her lungs, still trying to stand but constantly failing. The last thing she remembered before she blacked out  she was in the Danger Room getting some training in before her date later that night. And now when she awoke she was now on the Blackbird in a five hundred twenty pound body stuffed in an X-Men uniform the Blob would feel snug in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight off the bat, Kitty was feeling the impact of her increased mass. The new gravity weighing down on her was immense, as her new flab was sagging off of her in all directions. Kitty noticed her breathing was different, heavier and slower breaths for her newer, bigger body. Her uniform was extremely tight, and any slight movement caused a straining sound that was a clear indication that her costume was gonna break. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKitten, just try to relax.\u201d Storm said, reaching her arms out to comfort her teammate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah kid just take it easy.\u201d Wolverine said, hoping to calm down his student. Kitty backed away from the rest of her team, heading toward the back of the jet. Kitty had tears rolling down her fattened cheeks as she began to rant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I\u2019m not gonna calm down! My life is ruined! I\u2019m a god damn whale now! And you said my future self did this?! The whole \u201cfuture self in my body\u201c thing already happened to me when I was thirteen, like ten years ago. Now it happens again and I wind up like this! I have a date tonight with Peter! I can\u2019t let him see me like this, he\u2019ll freak out! Do you know how long it\u2019s gonna take to work this weight off!\u201d Kitty screamed at her friends, tears rolling down her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell technically the paste was designed to be lasting, as the mutant we designed it for\u2019s metabolism broke it down so quickly. An average metabolism would probably take decades to work off that much weight.\u201d Beast chimed in, as Rogue gave him an elbow as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore tears began to rapidly fall down the obese woman\u2019s face as she opened the door to the Blackbirds bathroom, as she waddled inside. Unfortunately, her new hips got stuck on the door, so Kitty used her powers to phase herself through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the ride was very quiet for the X-Men, as Kitty didn\u2019t leave the bathroom the entire ride back to the mansion. When the X-Men arrived back to the mansion, Storm knocked on the door to the bathroom on the jet, and found it to be unlocked. Storm opened the door and no one was in there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty has phased through the floor once the X-Men arrived back to the mansion, and slowly waddled to her room. She found it to be a struggle, reaching the elevator alone felt like running a marathon. By the time she reached the elevator, her face was bright red, with heavy sweat running down her face, and her breaths felt as though she was having an asthma attack. She made it to the second floor and waddled to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty phased through the door, as she waddled over to her bed and crashed on it, giant gut first. Once the massively overweight girl landed so suddenly on the bed, it crashed under her immense weight, only adding to her depression. Between the sweat and her tears, her entire pillow was drenched. The tears stopped, however when she heard her phone buzz. Kitty raised her massive body up and checked her phone to see the text message she had just received. It read \u201cI\u2019m here\u201d and it was from Peter, Kitty\u2019s date for the night! Kitty ran over and looked out her window, and saw her supposed date for the evening. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Peter Parker stood outside Xavier\u2019s School For Gifted Youngsters, checking his phone to see if his date for the evening had responded to his message. Kitty Pryde and Peter Parker met during one of the times the X-Men had to work with Peter\u2019s superhero alter ego, the Amazing Spider-Man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Peter and Kitty met both were in relationships, Peter with Mary Jane Watson and Kitty with fellow X-Man Piotr Rasputin, but both were going through there different relationship issues. Mary Jane broke up with Peter because she felt that Peter didn\u2019t let her take care of herself while reporting. Kitty and Piotr however had been having issues ever since Colossus came back from an intergalactic war were Piotr developed feelings for an alien healer. So Peter called Kitty and asked her out, which Kitty accepted. But that was before Kitty\u2019s sudden change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty looked down from her window, and almost had a panic attack. She was really hoping this date was gonna go well, but now that she was a five hundred and twenty pound blob, all hope of that was practically gone. Kitty was panicking, as she had literally no idea what she was going to do. She didn\u2019t want to turn Peter down or lie to him, but she also didn\u2019t want him to see her like this. Kitty collapsed on her already destroyed bed, as she heard a knock on her bedroom door, as Storm opened it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKitten, the rest of the team are in debriefing with the Professor, but I felt it was best to come check up on you.\u201d Storm walked over to Kitty, sitting down next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy date is here Ororo. And I\u2019m disgustingly obese and I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Kitty said, as Ororo hugged her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKitten, you are not disgusting. You are a bright, gorgeous young woman no matter how much you may weigh. If this boy can\u2019t see that, he\u2019s obviously not worthy of you.\u201d Storm said, making Kitty feel a lot better. Kitty shifted her immense body up forward, as she wrapped her massive arms around her close friend for a hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Ororo, you really did make me feel better. But I\u2019m really not in a date mood. I kind of just want to shower, get into some clothes that fit, and go to sleep.\u201d Kitty said, as Ororo chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI completely understand Kitten. I will send Logan to deal with Mr. Parker, while I\u2019ll send Kurt to get you some knew clothes. You just get in the shower.\u201d Ororo said as she got up and left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty slowly rose from her bed and went into the bathroom, phasing out of her skintight uniform as opposed to trying to peel it off. Kitty looked into her full body mirror for the first time, seeing her new body in the nude for the first time. It honestly looked very similar to her body wearing her costume, as it was skin tight anyways. She saw the clear stretch marks on her skin, as well as the dimples all over her humongous butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty grabbed a beach towel and wrapped it around her body, even though her massive stomach covered her private parts anyway. As she waddled along, she saw her new clothes. Kitty had a couple new outfits, but she chose to wear massive yoga pants, and a bright pink t-shirt, along with a massive adjustable bra and huge parties. Kitty slowly put on her clothes, covering her giant stomach with her new pants. Kitty looked out the window and saw Peter had left. Kitty chuckled, causing a jiggle in her face fat. Logan must have taken care of him. Kitty climbed into her bed, and covered herself with her bed sheets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe tomorrow will be better.\u201d Kitty said hopefully, but unfortunately she completely forgot about her prior commitments. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kitty awoke from her slumber, as she was truly hoping the terrible experience from the night before was just a dream. Kitty had been dreaming of gluttony and food all night, and the scary part was that she found herself enjoying those dreams. Unfortunately, the reality of Kitty\u2019s situation was firmly established as she felt the gravity weighing down on her as soon as she opened her eyes. Just to be sure, Kitty lifted her covers up, and she was met with a massive pair of breasts and her gigantic, round stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, definitely still fat.\u201d Kitty said to herself, as she got out of bed and began waddling downstairs. Today was Sunday, and for Kitty Pryde that meant training in the Danger Room with her mentor, Wolverine. Kitty had no idea what to expect, but she was sure it was not going to be fun. Kitty got to her locker in the X-Men\u2019s subbasement, where she was met with a brand new, much bigger uniform. The Professor must have had Forge, the resident team mechanic, make one for her. She put it on, and while it was still skin tight and hugged her roles, it was a lot more flexible and didn\u2019t feel as though it was going to tear apart. So it was already a big improvement over the last one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty entered the Danger Room, where Wolverine stood, dressed in his orange and brown uniform. Scattered around him were many robots, all slashed to bits with distinct claw markings through them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry I\u2019m late Logan.\u201d Kitty said, as Wolverine sheathed his claws and turned around to face his super sized student. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook kid, I have no idea how to teach you to fight given your current, predicament. There is a way, and I will figure it out. But for right now, I can\u2019t train you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Wolverine said, very heartfelt. He truly did care about his student, and it broke his heart that he didn\u2019t know how to teacher her anymore. Kitty tried to hide her clear sadness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay Logan. I know you\u2019ll figure it out. This change just requires some adjustment is all.\u201d Kitty replied, as Logan nodded in agreement. Wolverine called off the training session, as Kitty changed back into her civilian clothes and went back upstairs, clearly upset. She waddled to the kitchen and grabbed a large tub of ice cream from the freezer, and she began shoving bites into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kitty sat alone in the kitchen, her teammates Rogue walked into the kitchen, dressed in her gothic civilian clothes. She saw Kitty clearly upset, and wanted to make her feel better, as Rogue considered Kitty her best friend on the team. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Kitty, ah was wondering if you wanted to go to the mall with me. I would really like the company.\u201d Rogue asked Kitty, reaching out to her friend. Kitty took note of that and appreciated it, as Rogue didn\u2019t like hanging out with anyone, so it showed she did care about Kitty after all. Kitty wasn\u2019t completely comfortable going out in public yet, but maybe actually going out would be good for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I would love to. Logan called off training and Kurt only got me a couple outfits anyways so I should probably go.\u201d Kitty and Rogue both got ready and headed to the Westchester Mall. They took the X-Van, with one woman much more squished in there than the other one. Once the two reached the mall, they began shopping immediately, with Kitty buying a few new outfits and Rogue buying new makeup for herself. The two were gossiping about their teammates and having a really good time. Sure the obese woman and her goth friend got stares but neither really cared. Kitty was having fun, and her mind was off her weight for the first time since she gained it; despite the slow pace, heavy breathing, her thighs brushing against each other and her stomach smacking her legs with each massive step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stopped at a food court, where Kitty ordered five hotdogs while Rogue stuck to one. The two girls sat in a booth seat, so Kitty\u2019s immense body could fit and she didn\u2019t have to worry about breaking a chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for taking me out Rogue. I really did need this.\u201d Kitty said, with hotdog bits flying out of her mouth. Rogue took a second to respond however, as she was astonished with how much food Kitty was consuming. Before the gain, it was a struggle to get Kitty to eat one hotdog, let alone five. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem sugah. After all, what are friends for?\u201d Rogue replied, as the two women continued talking, until the heard a loud explosion at the front of the mall. The two women looked to see who their attacker was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Avalanche, Pyro, Blob, and Toad all stood in the destroyed entrance of the Westchester Mall. Seeing the homo sapiens running in fear brought smiles to all of their faces. Magneto would have been very proud of them, if he wasn\u2019t ruling over Genosha of course. Still if anything, they could cause a little havoc and get a good laugh out of it. Of course, they weren\u2019t the only mutants in the mall, as Rogue and Kitty Pryde were monitoring the situation from the second floor food court. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStay calm, we\u2019ll see what they do next and plan our next move after that.\u201d Rogue told Kitty, as she swallowed her last bite of hotdog, sweat beating down her head and on to her jowls. Avalanche and Pyro created a large rock structure in the middle of the mall with a huge wall blocking them off, as Toad was on look out and Blob moved to the second floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna take care of Toad, while you handle Blob. Then we\u2019ll knock down that fortress and teach those two idiots a lesson.\u201d Kitty said, still as heroic as ever despite her massive size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good, just be careful.\u201d Rogue replied, worried about how her big friend would handle herself in a combat situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty crouched and waddled as quietly as she could over toward where Toad was. Kitty kept going until she was directly above where Toad was, the only thing separating them was the floor. Kitty looked down at her fattened body and got an idea that made her smile. She phased through the floor and let herself fall. All Toad saw was a massive butt coming directly at him, and before he could leap away, he was completely crushed underneath the massive weight. Toad was incapacitated, as Kitty now had the struggle of getting up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile up on the second floor, Blob approached the food court, where Rogue was still sitting. While most people ran away, Rogue sat completely still, un phased by the five hundred and ten pound giant approaching her. Blob broke through the counter just by walking through it, not even stopping. Rogue knew she had to get through Avalanche\u2019s barrier eventually, and she had to take down Blob. Maybe she could still two birds with one stone. Rogue got up and silently sneaked yo behind Blob. She than removed her glove and leaped on him, absorbing his powers and knocking him out. Rogue immediately felt a change coming...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty had finally managed to get up off of the unconscious Toad, and slowly made her way over to the fortress. Kitty was sweating bad, and she didn\u2019t know how much longer she could keep going. But, she knew the Brotherhood had to be stopped. So Kitty waddle-ran up to the fortress, and phased through the massive wall. When she arrived on the other side, she was met by Avalanche and Pyro on the top of their massive structure. Pyro was the first to see the huge hero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO\u00ed Avalanche! Check it out. The X-Chumps got themselves a Blob now too!\u201d Pyro said, as he and Avalanche both began laughing. Kitty felt terrible, between the negative comments and the general feeling of being out of shape, Kitty really doubted if she could take these two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot just one Blob, sugah! Now you got two to deal with!\u201d A voice rang throughout the mall, as a giant hole was knocked into the stone wall. What Kitty saw next was unbelievable. Rogue was the cause of the hole, and she now weighed as much as Blob. After touching him, Rogue absorbed his powers, and by extension his massive weight. Rogue was huge; with ginormous breasts bigger than her head, a giant stomach with multiple folds and rolls under her breasts, giant sagging thighs that hung off her legs, a huge plumped face, and a gigantic butt. She had obliterated her clothes, with her old shirt riding up on her breasts and her leggings had massive holes in them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty was shocked, but she would have to worry about that later, as Rogue and her had bad guys to deal with now. Pyro armed his flamethrowers and Avalanche jumped down to face the two morbidly obese women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRogue, throw me up there!\u201d Kitty said as Rogue picked up Kitty effortlessly thanks to her new strength, and threw her friend toward Pyro. Kitty flew through the air like a big soft wrecking ball. Pyro tried blasting her with his flamethrowers, but Kitty phased through them, until the five hundred twenty pound mutant collided with him, knocking him unconscious. Rogue approached Avalanche knocking through any structure he made, until she got close enough and punched him clean in the face, knocking him out. Kitty phased back down through the structure arriving next to Rogue and the two obese women caught their breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was exhausting, the other X-Men should be here soon though.\u201d Kitty said, face bright read, her hands on her massive, soft knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah your tellin\u2019 me. You want to grab something to eat while we wait?\u201d Rogue replied, her new stomach feeling very empty. Kitty nodded as the two mutants went back upstairs to the food court. When the X-Men arrived, Rogue and Kitty had almost finished an entire stores food stock. Both had crumbs and food bits all over them, but they were both very happy. The two women went on the Blackbird, as the MRD came and took the Brotherhood to prison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the X-Men arrived back to the mansion, Kitty was summoned to Cerebro, where someone wanted to talk to her. </span></div></div>",

Beast (who was piloting the jet) stayed behind to unload the X-Van, as the ramp lowered from the jet. The two obese mutants waddled down the ramp, causing a loud creaking on the poor ramp. Kitty was holding multiple corn dogs in her hands, shoving them into her mouth one by one. Rogue had a whole bucket of fried chicken, and she was continuously eating chicken pieces the whole ride home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Rogue. I had a really great time.\u201d Kitty said, mustard dripping down her lips. Rogue looked over while chewing on a drumstick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s really no problem. I never knew being big and pigging out could be this much fun. Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t gonna last that much longer for me, so I\u2019m heading up to my room to enjoy the last few minutes of gluttony.\u201d Rogue said, waving Kitty goodbye as she headed up to her room. Kitty continued eating her corn dogs until she was suddenly interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKatherine, I would like to speak with you in Cerebro please.\u201d Kitty recognized that voice from anywhere, that voice belonging to the the leader and founder of the X-Men, Charles Xavier. Kitty waddled down through the subbasement, still shoving in corn dogs, until she reached Cerebro. Cerebro is what the X-Men use to track and find mutants all across the world, and Professor Xavier was in the middle of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wanted to see me Professor?\u201d Kitty said, holding the sticks to her corn dogs in her plump hands. The Professor removed his helmet, and placed it on the platform in front of him. He then turned his wheelchair around and looked at his obese student. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just wanted to congratulate you on your victory at the mall. Taking down the Brotherhood was no small feat, and I was very impressed by your resourcefulness given your current state.\u201d Professor X congratulated his student, much to Kitty\u2019s shock. It really had just set in that her and Rogue took down the entire Brotherhood by themselves. She would have never been able to do that before, maybe the extra bulk helped her a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Professor, but Rogue helped a lot.\u201d Kitty said, not believing she deserved all the credit for the victory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes but you lead her Kitty. In most cases being your size would cripple anyone else but you fought through it and beat the Brotherhood. It seems as though Rogue even took a page from your textbook during the fight and the two of you did amazingly. Keep up the good work.\u201d Charles said, as he excused Kitty from their meeting and went back to Cerebro. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty left the chamber with a large grin spread across her round face, as she took the elevator back up to the first floor of the mansion. Kitty waddled to the kitchen, grabbed a soda and brought it into the empty living room, where she sunk into the couch and turned on the television. As Kitty began chugging the drink, Rogue also entered the living room, however she looked a lot different than she last did. Blob\u2019s powers had worn off, so Rogue lost all of her additional weight. She was back to her one hundred twenty pound self. She had changed out of her destroyed clothes and took a seat on the chair next to Kitty\u2019s seat, as her girth engulfed the entire surface of the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh had such a good time at the mall.\u201d Rogue said as Kitty stopped chugging and nodded in agreement. Rogue was eyeing Kitty up and down, she seemed enamored with Kitty\u2019s expanded body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeing that big was so liberating, and ah really miss it already.\u201d Rogue continued now shifting her focus to her own thin body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just wanted to say thank you again. Between the mall and you being so cool, I feel a lot more comfortable in all this fat.\u201d Kitty replied, thankful she had such a good friend. The two girls watched television for a little while longer, until later that night. </span></div></div>",

She moved her massive body forward, gut smacking against her legs and her massive hips swayed from side to side in an almost hypnotic fashion. She waddled along, her mind set on her goal, and at that size, nothing could even hope to stop her. Kitty was ready to complete her goal, her stomach was full and her mind was in the right place. The main point was that Kitty Pryde was determined, and she was gonna get what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty reached the girls locker room, and phased out of her civilian clothes. The massive five hundred and twenty pound girl was now only wearing her giant bra and panties, as she opened her locker and took out her new and improved uniform. She put it on and fitted it the outfit looked just like her old uniform, with the yellow stripe going down her now extremely ginormous stomach and the uniform hugging her roles beautifully. Even her gloves and boots were bigger, to accommodate for her sausage like fingers and cankles. Kitty exited the locker room with a confident grin spread over her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty waddled to the Danger Room, and the door opened and she was met with a familiar site. Wolverine standing in the middle of the Room, robots shredded all around him. Kitty slowly made her way to Logan, and the two mutants met eye-to-eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard about your big showdown with the Brotherhood. From what I heard you did a good job. Maybe you don\u2019t need any guidance.\u201d Logan said nonchalantly, as Kitty almost geeked out. Wolverine just gave her a compliment. But she kept her cool and presented her idea to Logan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I need to completely change my combat style. I can\u2019t be stealthy anymore so I think brute force could serve me very well. My ninja-style of fighting is also a little outdated given my new body, so I was thinking more sumo wrestling.\u201d Kitty said to Logan. She had put a lot of thought into her new weight and how she would operate differently in combat. Wolverine chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt sounds like you got it all figured out kid. A warrior who knows there faults and can adapt to situations is a great warrior in my opinion. You\u2019ve done well Kitty, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything else I need to teach you.\u201d Logan said, as he bowed to his student. Kitty bowed back, with her stomach getting in the way but the point still remained. Her training was complete, and all it took was ten years and four hundred pounds. Kitty exited the Danger Room with a serious face, but as soon as the doors closed a huge smile appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d Kitty exclaimed, pumping her fist in the air, arm fat jiggling to and fro. If she wasn\u2019t so heavy Kitty would have jumped, but she settled for the fist pump. Of course Wolverine heard her, but that just brought a grin to the mutants face as more robots appeared and he unsheathed his claws. Kitty waddled away from the Danger Room, clearly happy, as she embraced what this new weight had done for her life. She got changed in the locker room and went up to the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty rode elevator all the way to the second floor and waddled to her room. The first thing Kitty noticed was all her clothes were there, and she had a new re-enforced bed, most likely thanks to Forge. She took her regular clothes off and got into the shower. She embraced her fatness, she unlike last night she wasn\u2019t grossed out by it. Kitty left the shower and climbed into her new super-sized pajamas, as she peeled back the covers and climbed into her new bed. Kitty went from a state of almost depression to a state of pure happiness in less than twenty four hours. She wondered what tomorrow would bring as she shut her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKitty! Kitty wake up!\u201d The obese woman opened her eyes and was met with a familiar face. Rogue was next to her, on her knees and looking at Kitty. She looked off, like she hadn\u2019t slept. Kitty also got a view of the alarm clock, noting that it was two o\u2019clock in the morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRogue what are you doing here?\u201d Kitty asked, still groggy from being woke up in the middle of the night. </span></div></div>",

What's up?\" Kitty asked, more awake now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, earlier when we fought the Brotherhood at the mall and I was as big as Blob, I realized I enjoy bein' fat. I want to be large again like you.\" Rogue confessed as she slowly picked at Kitty's blankets. Kitty was quiet for a moment as she processed her friend's confession. \"Okay. So why did you wake me up?\" she finally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cause I figured you might be able to help me get that large again.\" Rogue explained shyly. Kitty thought it over for a few minutes. Rogue was a good friend and teammate of hers. True, Kitty had been uneasy with Rogue joining the X-Men ten years ago when she left the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants after accidently putting Ms. Marvel in a coma during a fight, giving Rogue Carol's flight, super strength and other powers in the process, but now they were close friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I'll help you Rogue.\" Kitty smiled at her friend and teammate. Rogue smiled in delight. \"Thanks Kit. Um... do you mind if I sleep with you for tonight?\" She replied, blushing slightly. Kitty seemed equally shy upon receiving the request. \"Sure.\" She finally decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue slowly climbed in beside Kitty and snuggled beside her obese teammate and friend. Kitty laid down and sighed in contentment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Kitty.\" Rogue smiled as she closed her eyes and drifted off to sleep, putting an arm over Kitty's wide belly. Kitty blushed at this and smiled at her softly snoring friend. \"Night Rogue.\" she whispered as her eyelids drooped shut and she began softly snoring alongside Rogue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two X-Ladies slept soundly all night long while dreaming. Rogue dreamed of being big and fat alongside Kitty while Kitty dreamed of her and Rogue's fat selves dancing on a date. As the dream wore on, Kitty's face broke out into a goofy, horny grin as she imagined Rogue's full lips making contact with hers.</span></div></div>",

And ah know ah shouldn\u2019t and ah know how tough it\u2019s been on you, but ah really want to be fat again.\u201d Rogue said, tears starting to form. Something had awakened in Rogue in the previous two days, a curiosity with fat sparked by Kitty\u2019s body. And perhaps when Rogue touched Blob and gained all that weight, she found something deep inside of her. She enjoyed pigging out and being huge, no matter how much she tried to deny it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Rogue. It sounds like you want to get fat again, and honestly, I say go for it. It was a really tough adjustment in the first day, but afterward I really started to enjoy myself and it started benefiting me a lot. Plus I miss my eating buddy. The machine my future self used is downstairs. Give me a sec and I\u2019ll get up and show you.\u201d Kitty said, as she began the struggle of motioning her body upward. Rogue looked sad again however. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe machines a no go. Ah already checked there and Hank and Forge deactivated it after you got fat. Ah know ah can gain the weight naturally but that would take years to get as big as ah was.\u201d Rogue said depressed. She was destined to want a body she could never have. Kitty was lost in thought, she wanted to help her friend as she did for her. Kitty suddenly had an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRogue, if you touch someone long enough you gain there powers permanently right. So why don\u2019t we just sneak inside the MRD holding facility, and you can grab Blob. You\u2019ll be big and fat forever!\u201d Kitty said excitedly, jiggling as she spoke. A smile came across Rogues face as she hugged her fat friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat could work. And would you really help me with this?\u201d Rogue asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. After all, what are friends for?\u201d Kitty replied, as the two mutants continued to hug. The X-Men went down to the subbasement and got dressed in there uniforms, and then piled into the X-Van and drove toward the MRD. They parked the van a few blocks away, and slowly made there way toward the facility so Kitty didn\u2019t lose her breath. A guard stood outside the massive prison, and Rogue removed her glove and leapt on him, grabbing his face. This both knocked him out and gave Rogue his memories. Including telling her where Blob was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe isn\u2019t that deep into the facility. Most inmates are sleeping right now. If we do a straight shot through the walls right there we\u2019ll come up to him.\u201d Rogue said, pointing at a wall to the right. The two women approached the spot Rogue marked, and Kitty extended her flabby arm out to her. She grabbed Rogue\u2019s shoulder, and the two girls began stealthily walking or waddling through the cells. Kitty had to slow down her breathing, as any heavy breath could wake up the inmates. Eventually after a numerous amount of cells, they found Blob sleeping on his giant bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ready?\u201d Kitty asked Rogue, but she already knew the answer. Rogue removed her glove and slowly approached Blob, and she grabbed his face. Blob\u2019s eyes shot open, but quickly closed again, as he was knocked unconscious. Rogue held onto Blob for a solid couple minutes, and then let go. Blob was still alive somehow, and Rogue was lucky she didn\u2019t accidentally kill him. But the deal has been done, and Rogue knew it. As she began swelling up again, she knew this time was permanent. Rogue got much heavier than last time, now weighing in at six hundred and thirty pounds. It seems she had Blob\u2019s weight on top of her own. Her breasts were massive, twice the size of her head. Her massive gut swayed and rippled with each slight movement she made. Her ginormous legs were twice the size of her entire previous body, and were pushed away from each other by the mass amount of fat. Every inch of her was covered in soft fat again. Her back rolls were immense, and led down to her bean bag sized butt. Rogue no longer had a neck, instead replaced by a giant double chin, and a big smile pronounced her chipmunk cheeks and jowls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt feels good to be be back sugah! Thank you Kitty! I couldn\u2019t have done it without you.\u201d Rogue hugged Kitty, there flab colliding with each other, and Kitty found it weird to finally be hugging someone bigger than her. The two girls embrace was cut short by a loud alarm though...</span></div></div>",

Snorting softly, \"Hey, hun? Still listenin'?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty lifted her head from the fast food with a \"Hrm?\". Crumbs fell from her bloated cheeks, and down her chins. The bloated mutant shifted her weight once again, this car that Rogue kept in case was far from being built for someone in her current state, before this trip, it was definitely a task just getting Kitty in through the door, Rogue could've sworn it's steel frame bent a bit, not to mention the way it titled when she managed to get her giant backside inside. But when she even tried to get the seat belt across her stomach, that was her breaking part, and the brunette was developing tears in her bloated face. Which was quickly fixed with Rogue stopping at drive thru restaurants for the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne giant swallow of her mouth full of fries, kitty turned her head, or didn't at all, and replied, \"Y'know we were too busy for shopping and all that, being X-Men and all. But..well..now..\".   \"You just gotta get used to that size, sugah! Sure you're the size of a church bell on a sunny Sunday, bu-\"  Kitty's lips started quivering once more, the small whimpers coming from the bloated girl, oh boy, Anne Marie. What did you do now?  \"Hey, hey, now. Just jokin'! You're beautiful at this size, Pryde!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat added a smile to Kitty's face, which didn't last long as her hand shoved in another handful of fries into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, and Rogue pulled up into the parking lot of the very populated Salem Center, not far from a giant hole being patched up from the latest super villain attack. Rogue pulled up into the closet parking place she could find, not wanting to watch Pryde become a fountain of sweat by the time they made it to the entrance, a scene just waiting to happen. Now all that needed to be done was pull Kitty out of this trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'MON NOW! JUST PHASE!\"<br>\r\nRogue grunted as she pulled out the 500 hundred pound mutant, making her life easier as the girl shifted her entire blubbery self through the door, which by her size, would've been caught in before, but what Rogue didn't expect was fat stumbling upon her as the two fell onto the asphalt floor with a thud. Kitty just chuckled nervously as she rolled off, waiting for Rogue to help her get off from the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that was done with, Rogue and Kitty walked down the aisle of cars, this amazingly buff beauty next to a staggering brunette was a sight to be seen, especially as shoppers went to place their eyes on the mutants, but you can guess which one got the more attention. The more she felt the eyes, the more Kitty wanted to return to her room, this was an absolute nightmare. Small beads of sweat started dripping from her forehead past her jowls, her breathing started to get shaky with every waddle and jiggle her frame made. Tears started to develop, but the brightness of the lights of the center hit her, she wiped them away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.. hun, where too first?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Both girls stared at it as it calmed down. Kitty blushed and turned to Rogue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food court it is then.\" she decided as Rogue laughed and nodded. The duo headed for the food court, which thankfully for Kitty, wasn't too far from where they were. It was fairly crowded since it was early in the evening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you wanna eat?\" Rogue asked Kitty after leading her to a large table. Kitty smiled. \"I'll take...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half hour later found Kitty rubbing her 500 pound tummy in delight, a massive collection of wrappers, takeout boxes, trays and other things littering the table. Kitty had eaten six large meals from six different booths, resulting in a total of 36 meals. Rogue was just staring at her sumo sized friend in disbelief. Sure she knew Kitty's appetite would likely grow due to her new girth, but she hadn't expected it to be so bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are ya full for now, hon?\" she asked Kitty, who was happily licking her fingers off loudly as she rubbed her belly with the other hand. Kitty smiled and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm stuffed.\" she grinned. \"Good. C'mere.\" Rogue said as she stood up and, with a slight struggle, managed to heave Kitty up onto her feet again. Then, Kitty felt a very deep rumble in her belly. \"Oh crap.\" she moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Rogue asked with concern. Kitty's cheeks slowly puffed up and it looked like she was gonna be sick. Rogue wasn't surprised at first since she thought this as well. But then, Kitty slowly opened her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!* Kitty let out a giant burp that shook the whole food court and filled it with a nasty combination of all the things she'd eaten just then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw geez, Kitty!\" Rogue yelped, pinching her nose and fanning the air in front of her. \"Excuse me.\" Kitty blushed sheepishly. She and Rogue then looked at each other and burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, Kitty. I don't think you've burped like that since 2010 when you were 14!\" Rogue giggled. \"Hey, I warned Cannonball and the other New Mutants I was the belching champion back in Deerfield Middle, but they didn't listen.\" Kitty giggled back as she proudly rubbed her giant belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where should we go first? I know you likely need new clothes cause of you size but you should also get a larger swim suit or bikini for when we hit the beach or pool.\" Rogue questioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty thought about it for a few minutes. \"I think we should hit the...\" </span></div></div>",

Being pampered 24/7 and having no where to excised cause her powerful arms to turn into an ordinary person arm. Lack of running was another thing missing over the past few weeks. Now a days Natalia just sits around on her ass all day as servants bring everything to her. Her firm backside was no more. Now in its place is a thick, juicy butt with a slight jiggle to every step. The part that the prince was pleased with the most was her stomach. No longer do dresses fit perfectly flat across her stomach.  They now stretch across her small pouch leaving a roundness to her midsection thanks to the layer of flab on her stomach. Luckily her face has escaped from much harm and her generous cleavage distracts most people from any signs of weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eating habits though began to draw unwanted attention. With a mouth full of pirozhki already she greedily tried to shovel a spoon full of cream into her mouth causing a large portion of it falling on her cleavage. Everyone at the table pretended to not notice, but one of Rassa friends couldn't let it go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hohoho enjoying your meal there lil miss.\" Caught off guard Natalia quickly used one hand to cover her mouth as she finish chewing, trying to think of an excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Upmfh. Yes of course. The food here is amazing, I never expect to have pirozhkis here. They taste better than the ones back home.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yes of course. Rassa gets only the best there is. You are a very lucky women to be with him.\" Rassa then left the table to make a phone call as he knew it was time for stage two of his plan to began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wanda Maximoff was a troubled soul.<br>\r\nSure, her abilities and courage had saved the world countless times (she had also rewritten reality once but that's not important) and had earned her the respect of her team mates through heroism.<br>\r\nSadly though, deeds alone did not ease the witch's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda was no Steve Rogers, built on courage and morality with an unyielding belief in justice.<br>\r\nShe wasn't a Peter Parker, a teenager innocent to the intricacies and cruelties of the world.<br>\r\nShe wasn't even a Tony Stark, full of ego and able to hide her true feelings behind one liners and financial flash.<br>\r\nDespite all these characters close to her, Wanda was built on her grief and the harsh realities that had surrounded her younger years and nothing could change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so the chaos witch thought...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*knock knock knock*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now\" muttered Wanda, her Serbian accent still as present as ever despite living state side for some time now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, words were not sufficient for her impromptu visitor though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Wanda, I just haven't seen you for days and I was...\" started Vision as he drifted through the door to Wanda's room, only to stop mid sentence as her caught a glimpse of his friend and ally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, just leave me in peace\" asserted Wanda again, blissfully unaware of Vision stopping or staring for that matter.<br>\r\nThe fact of the matter was, Wanda had nested herself in her room for quite some time and had managed to shut the outside world out completely.<br>\r\nHer time in solitude had also blinkered her to how she was handling her grief these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason or another that the witch could not quite recall, she had been turned onto what her friends frequently referred to as 'comfort food' and, with said food not tasting terrible, Wanda had taken quite a fancy to it.<br>\r\nIt also had the added bonus of cheering her up slightly when she was feeling particularly reflective or down.<br>\r\nFlash forward to the present and the results of Wanda's piqued interest in food had developed into the scene playing out before Vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerched on her bed, Wanda was nestled in between the array of plush pillows at the headboard where her back was rested, legs sprawled down the bed whilst a wide assortment of food and drink items lazily danced through the air, circling the upper most portion of the bed as they did with a faint cloud of red holding each item in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVision's keen synthezoid eyes glimpsed Wanda's fingers moving ever so slowly against the fluffy duvet she was currently laid on top of, a clear sign that she was using her powers to cause the food to float as it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before his eyes, a subtle flick of an index finger pulled a burger from the food formation, drawing it slowly towards Wanda's mouth which she deftly opened in a well practiced rhythm to recieve the bread encased meat before casually flicking it away again.<br>\r\nThe whole process was so refined that Wanda hadn't needed to move any more than the single finger controlling the burger which, upon returning the burger to its rightful place, had fallen back into line with the rest of her delicate hand movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just worried for you Wanda, nobody has seen you for days\" finished Vision, his concern clear in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine Vision, I did not want bothering.\"<br>\r\nAs she spoke, Wanda shot a brief look towards the synthezoid in her doorway as a quick flash of red coloured her eyes to indicate her annoyance, which also caused the food items to spin slightly faster for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glance was brief, but enough to tip Vision off that Wanda's reliance on food had started to have an effect on more than just her mental state.<br>\r\nThe slight turn of her body had made it clear that the Serbian's middle had started to soften just enough to be picked up by the synthezoid, mostly due to the subtle roll forming around her waist caused by the awkward twist she put herself through so as to glare at Vision.<br>\r\nMaintaining his composure, Vision continued to air his concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are all your friends here and we only want the best for you\" insisted Vision, daring to step closer to the woman on the bed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am fine\" returned the witch as she pulled a large soda cup towards her, actually grabbing the cup mid air as it came towards her this time before posting the straw through her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalting his movement, Vision simply looked over his friend as she drank deeply from the cup before sending it back into the rotation around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget we are here for you Wanda\" finished Vision before turning to leave the room again, realising her was onto a losing battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door was about to close, the synthezoid felt a great deal of resistance stopping him from closing it fully and he turned to look back into the room.<br>\r\nWanda was looking at him now, the barely noticeable increase in concentration proving that she had stopped the door closing, as a single tear ran down her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" was all her silky Serbian voice uttered across the room but it was enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVision simply nodded before turning away again and closing the door with ease, not wishing to pressure the witch any more than he already had.<br>\r\nAs he rested against the door, making sure it had clicked behind him, a familiar face walked past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is she Vision?\" called the confident yet concerned voice of Steve Rogers as he passed the now closed room of Wanda Maximoff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine Captain\" lied Vision, avoiding eye contact \"Just fine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain America simply nodded before grasping Vision's shoulder gently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're all a family here, she knows that deep down\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words rang through Vision's synthetic ears long after Cap had walked off but he knew what he had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We're all family, and family look out for one another'</span></div></div>",

Wow...\" breathed Janet, suddenly feeling her concerns spike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, and even then she was not happy\" finished Vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you suggest that we do then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not entirely sure\" admitted Vision, his own concerns feeling ever more prominent \"I do know that when I saw her she seems to have taken quite a likening to 'fast food'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...strange\" mused Janet, furrowing her brow in contemplation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought so too\" replied Vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet stood up and began pacing in front of Vision.<br>\r\nShe wished she was wearing her suit at this point, shrinking and growing was far more relaxing than pacing.<br>\r\nAs the two heroes pondered the situation with Janet still pacing, a sudden thought struck the stood woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on, so Wanda has been unhappy and ordering food in a lot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite, it was very out of character\" responded Vision, elbows on knees with his fingers pressed together in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For her maybe, but it is very typi...shit! what was that?\" exclaimed Janet as she suddenly found herself on the ground with a scalding sting radiating around her right cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may be so blunt it appears that you have been hit with a...cheeseburger Miss\" answered Vision, literally as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A cheesebur...what?\" asked the confused Janet as she clambered back to her feet.<br>\r\nHoping to find a more logical answer, Janet wiped her cheek to find a great smear of blood running down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ketchup\" nodded Vision to the substance Janet had thought was her own blood now coating her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why on earth would there be...\"<br>\r\nJanet felt her words stop as a strange sensation ran through her hair, a feeling of being dragged but the rest of her wasn't moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be the rest of the burger\" answered Vision again as strings of cheese and meat dragged themselves out of Janet's hair surrounded by an all too familiar red mist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow that burger Vision, we've got to talk to her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it\" declared Janet triumphantly as the mangled food remnants made the last turn into the corridor leading to Wanda's room.<br>\r\nAs successful as the trail had been though, the situation took a dramatic turn as in a motion almost unnoticeable, Wanda's door flew open and snapped back shut to allow the burger into the dark room behind and nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVision and Janet came to a grinding halt before the door, a faint smell of grease permeating from behind into the corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanda, we have got to talk\" called out Janet with a gentle knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Wanda, we only want to help you\" pleaded Vision, hoping for some success where had found it a few weeks before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the love of god Wanda, open this door!\" screamed Janet, not wanting to miss out so close to her goal now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hit me in the head with a cheeseburger Wanda, the least you can do is open this damn door!\"<br>\r\nJanet could feel the situation getting away from her as the silence continued to grow around her and Vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, screw this!\" shouted the Pym particle powered woman \"open this damn door RIGHT NOW Maximoff or I'm shrinking myself through the keyhole!\"<br>\r\nJanet hated how motherly she sounded at that point.<br>\r\nShe also hated that she was screaming at an obviously hurting woman through her bedroom door.<br>\r\nHaving burger grease matted into her hair didn't mark high on her list of happy moments though so something had to be done about this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a heavy sigh, Janet turned her back on the door.<br>\r\n\"Come on Vision, she doesn't want our help\"<br>\r\nNot wanting to give up on his friend, Vision lingered a moment longer but, eventually, he too turned away.<br>\r\nNaturally, that was when the door clicked open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good grief Wanda, what is going on that has got you holed up in her for weeks on end?\" asked Janet, all anger melting away instantly and being replaced by the concern she had originally harboured.<br>\r\nHer concern was kicked up a notch as she laid eyes on the woman who had caused her so much grief that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaid on her bed just like how Vision had found her last time he had been granted entry was Wanda but, unlike that time, there was a little bit more of Wanda than either of them expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on, what do you want?\" hissed Wanda, her accent adding a layer of aggression more than was maybe intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're worried about you Wanda\" started Janet, not wanting to cross any boundaries too early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, ask Vision\" retorted Wanda between mouthfuls of food that came to meet her crimson lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sensors indicate that Miss Maximoff has gained approximately 83.6 pounds since her last physical examination putting her at nearly 205 pounds total body mass\" Vision plainly delivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't sound fine Wanda, you need help\" pleaded Janet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft, I am happy when I'm eating\" announced Wanda and, as if to make a point, summoned a pan of cheesecake from above her head before enchanting a fork to feed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're gaining weight at an alarming rate\" said Vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? My magic can take the brunt of it\" declared the witch, refusing to back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, fair enough\" nodded Janet, realising that was a fight that could not be won \"we are finding you someone to talk to though, because you can not be alone any more\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want anyone\" forced Wanda, a flare of red shrouding her slightly as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well tough, you're getting them\" defied Janet before turning on her heels and storming out, leaving Vision with Wanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will help you in the long run Wanda\" added Vision, hoping his word may add weight to the argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda simply ignored him, returning her full attention to the cheesecake disappearing between her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She will not be changed on this one Wanda, she wants the best for you\" finished Vision before gliding from the room, closing the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for Vision to catch up his accomplice for the day who was busy looking exasperated whilst leaning against a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the plan then Janet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a few people in mind\" she responded quite coldly, more from personal pain than anything.<br>\r\nIt was difficult to see a friend look like that but not all was lost.<br>\r\nThey had a plan after all.</span></div></div>",

Jennifer apparently had cases stacked as high as she stood tall, and Janet wasn\u2019t about to challenge her on that. Both Jessicas, of the spider-y and investigative varieties, had obligations with their kids. Nat wasn\u2019t exactly the \u201ctalk it out\u201d kind of person\u2014and no one was really gunning to compare trauma conga lines with <i>that</i> one. Was Jean Grey alive again? She might have worked? No, the X-guys had enough of their own problems to work through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she couldn\u2019t just pair Wanda off with someone younger than her\u2014someone who hadn\u2019t been in this game for as long as everyone else had\u2014in hopes that their idealism would rub off on her. The younger generation had it rough in their own ways, but Wanda had literally been in a group called the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. Superheroics had come a long way and it had left a lot of scars on a lot of Avengers over the years in ways that girls like Ms. Marvel or Clint\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 couldn\u2019t even begin to understand. Even still, there was no way that she could let any of the male Avengers sticking their spoons in this pot. Tony would slap a band-aid on it and wonder why she was still comfort food-ing on floating ice cream three days later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real issue with all of this was that everyone <i>knew</i> what Wanda was going through. They were Avengers, and that pretty much meant constantly mucking things up until they got it right. Wanda had gone through a lot\u2014<i>a lot</i>\u2014over the course of her career, and nobody knew what that kind of stress could do to a person better than someone who used to be married to Hank Pym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, without any further options\u2026 that left none other than the Wasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, they\u2019d both been Avengers longer than almost everybody else\u2014why should it have been anyone else but her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet found herself on the other side of Wanda\u2019s door yet again. This time she was flying solo. She felt that it was better to approach Wanda one on one without the Vision. She didn\u2019t want her friend to feel like they were ganging up on her, after all. Plus, with <i>that</i> messy history, Viz\u2019s presence might have hindered her a lot more than helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even knock yet!\u201d Janet whined, \u201cCome on Wanda, let me in!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d she said flatly, through the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasp rolled her eyes let out a groan quiet enough to not be heard through the tower walls. She definitely wasn\u2019t making this easy\u2014which sucked, because she seemed to be the only one willing to lift a hand here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-kay, guess I\u2019ll just be off then!\u201d Janet said loudly, \u201cSince you don\u2019t want my help!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started stomping in place, gradually taking quieter and quieter steps without ever leaving her spot before stopping altogether. She waited a moment, held her ear to the door, and readied her hand at the doorknob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you\u2019re still out there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDAMMIT WANDA.\u201d Janet broke her silence, \u201cHow did you know?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can still see your feet from the bottom of the door.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet let out a groan, pressing her head against the wall to Wanda\u2019s room. This was so frustrating! All she was trying to do was help her friend before things got out of hand. More out of hand than they already were, really. Wanda had already put on a lot of weight since she started eating her feelings away and being known as the \u201cFat Avenger\u201d wouldn\u2019t exactly do wonders for her self-esteem right about now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, look, if you won\u2019t let me in, I\u2019m <i>coming</i> in.\u201d Janet cracked her fingers, \u201cI\u2019ll shrink right down and slip under the door. Through the keyhole. The air-vents. I\u2019ve got <i>all day</i> Witchy-poo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, on the other side of the door, silence. Janet held her breath as she waited to hear the tell-tale footsteps of her roommate coming towards the door. As soon as she heard feet hit the floor, Janet knew that she\u2019d gotten her. Finally she was getting somewhere\u2014all without invading her privacy via Pym Particles!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door slid down, revealing her friend and longtime teammate had obviously not been expecting company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just as big as she\u2019d been two days ago the last time she\u2019d seen her, with the added girth of what had been an especially big lunch. Food floated behind her, casting an eerie red glow as her powers kept her meals easy to access and afloat. She\u2019d dressed herself in pajamas\u2014a large I\u2019M NOT DAREDEVIL t-shirt that distorted along the curve of her prominent belly and chest. Her gray sweatpants were filled tightly with her ample hips and thighs. Her long brown hair, usually elegant and pristinely kept, was left in a bedheady disarray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d Wanda hissed, her round cheeks creasing at the frown, \u201cFor weeks now you have been pestering me\u2014telling me not to eat what I want, not to use my powers, threatening to break into my room now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWant to tell me how to live my life?\u201d Wanda poked Janet in her bony chest, \u201cWant to tell me to stop eating? Well I <i>like</i> to eat. It makes me feel good. I can control it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWanda, I just\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Wanda said, throwing her thick arms around, \u201cYou pester me like the annoying little bug you\u2019re named after. You don\u2019t leave me alone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWanda\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just fine in my room until you and that stupid robot decided to\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>WANDA</i>.\u201d Janet said sternly, putting a hand on her friend\u2019s surprisingly meaty shoulder, \u201cI didn\u2019t come here for that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda exhaled, her proud features hardening as she put her hands on her chunky hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell.\u201d She mumbled, embarrassed, \u201cWhat <i>did</i> you come here for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI figured we could go get some lunch.\u201d Janet said a little softly, but not placatingly, \u201cSo we could eat together. Like friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked behind her fellow Avenger to see the food still floating in place around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith our hands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda\u2019s thin lips tightened. She took a deep breath that swelled her bigger bosom and slowly let it out as she visibly contemplated the pro\u2019s and con\u2019s of her friend\u2019s suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d she relented, \u201cI am hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really don\u2019t see how, but okay.\u201d Janet joked, \u201cWe\u2019ll both change into some civ\u2019s and meet in the lobby. I know a <i>great</i> place.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jan...Miss van Dyne?!\" cried the hostess upon realising who she was speaking to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet chuckled, not to say she was vain but it always brought a smile to her face when she was recognised outside of her superhero get up.<br>\r\n\"Janet will be fine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great, follow me...Janet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women followed the host as she meandered between tables of people already dining, or at least waiting to dine, with little disruption and it didn't take them long before finding themselves by a discreet booth to one side of the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a little more out of the way so you'll be able to dine in peace today\" smiled the hostess as she beckoned the two women to their seats \"would you like a moment to browse the menu?\"<br>\r\nThe two women sat down and instinctively reached for a menu, particularly Wanda who couldn't seem to reach hers fast enough, which was odd given that she had had to disintegrate her last hot dog wrapper with her powers as they walked through the restaurant doors.<br>\r\nThat was when their host spotted Wanda for the first time properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my goodness, you're Scarlet Witch aren't you, like, THE Scarlet Witch!\" squealed the girl, even more excited than when she had indentified Janet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh great' groaned Wanda internally, feeling no patience for fan girls today of all days.<br>\r\nShe never had the patience for them come to think of it but today was low on the list when it came to her tolerance levels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I just say that you are my absolute favourite Avenger and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take the foot long BLT, a half pound steak burger, a double portion of the macaroni chilli cheese, fries with all three and an onion loaf\"<br>\r\nPatience well and truly tested, Wanda had cut the poor girl off mid speech as her hunger gnawed away inside her.<br>\r\n\"Please\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem, let me just write that down\" acknowledged their host, basking in the mere presence of her favourite superhero \"and for you Janet van Dyne?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm, this looks great\" purred Janet as her chicken Cesar salad was placed before her along with the stream of plates been placed before Wanda.<br>\r\nPleasant acknowledgment wasn't on the larger woman's mind though as she dove straight into her meal.<br>\r\nConsiderably more refined than her friend, however, Janet proceeded to delicately spear a selection of greens through a piece of chicken and gently pop it into her mouth.<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, that tastes really good too\" cooed Janet, continuing to attack her salad with her usual delicate grace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda, meanwhile, was far from delicate, tearing large mouthfuls from the sandwiches she had ordered whilst magically controlling a spoon to handle her macaroni for her so as not to delay its creamy deliciousness.<br>\r\nIt crossed Janet's mind to play mother and insist that Wanda didn't use her magic to eat in public but the prospect of annoying the woman opposite her when there was a chance to help her halted that thought.<br>\r\n'Let her be Jan, let her be' she thought to herself as she continued to work through her salad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy, I am stuffed\" declared Janet as she delicately placed her fork down onto her plate, feeling a pleasant warmth inside after her meal.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Wanda was still devouring the remnants of her order along with the replenished macaroni she had ordered after.<br>\r\n'My that girl can eat' thought Janet, watching over her friend as the last morsels of burger disappeared between her crimson lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, was your lunch good too?\" asked Janet genuinely, seeing an opening<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was pretty good\" pondered Wanda with an air of pleasantness to her that Janet had not seen on her recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get you anything else today?\"<br>\r\nThe hostess had returned again, looking a little flustered having still not gotten over the fact that she was serving her idol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I think we're done now\" responded Janet, taking a moment to inhale some air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could go for some dessert\" chimed up Wanda<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely\" smiled their waitress, producing her notepad \"what can I get you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could we get a cheesecake for the table please?\" purred Wanda, an almost sultry aspect sneaking into her voice as she ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly, coming right up\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the waitress disappeared from the table, Janet could only stare at Wanda in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no way you're still hungry after all that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I've been eating none stop for weeks now, this is nothing\" purred Wanda again \"besides, you know you want a piece now\"<br>\r\nWanda wasn't wrong, although you wouldn't need a telepath to tell you that Janet was a sucker for sweet desserts.<br>\r\n\"Besides, with me asking we'll probably get it for free seeing as this girl is crazy about me\" smirked Wanda, taking a gentle sip from her glass.<br>\r\nJanet laughed.<br>\r\nThe day had certainly taken a turn beyond what she expected but seeing Wanda actually interacting with her was fantastic.<br>\r\nA slice of cheesecake was a worthwhile sacrifice for that cause surely.</span></div></div>",

Turgid and round, and with her weight gain, there was no doubt in Jan\u2019s mind that the tabloids would have a field day dreaming up some pregnancy scandal to put in the papers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully for all of them, Wanda was just pregnant with one heck of a food baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was nice, huh?\u201d Janet offered pleasantly, \u201cYou have fun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe lunch was very good.\u201d Wanda burped softly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut did you have <i>fun</i>?\u201d Wanda craned her neck expectantly, \u201cLike, did you <i>enjoy</i> getting out of the Tower?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was\u2026\u201d Janet could see the beginnings of a smile tugging at Wanda\u2019s lips, \u201c\u2026enjoyable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, I\u2019m glad you enjoyed yourself.\u201d Janet fought the urge to pump her arms and gloat about getting her out of the house, \u201cWell, we can do this any time you want, Wanda. I\u2019m always here for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI may take you up on that offer.\u201d Wanda said with a pleased pat at the top of her stomach, \u201cI\u2019ll admit that I have missed\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, just as soon as Janet was sure Wanda was going to say \u201cI have missed being around people\u201d, there was a loud explosion off in the horizon. The two of them paused as the ground shook slightly, the citizens around them looking up to see yet another attack on the constantly recovering NYC.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate New York.\u201d Janet huffed, shrinking down. Her clothes fell into a neat little pile below her\u2014the now tiny woman hovering at eye-level with her lunchmate, \u201cYou coming?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose.\u201d Wanda huffed, taking a logy step forward, \u201cOogh\u2026 better fly there too\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe source of the commotion was another eatery, not too far away from where they\u2019d just eaten lunch. It was an old-timey burger joint that Cap and some of the other Avengers liked to go to after especially big missions to cool off. Janet had been here once or twice\u2014usually when someplace a little more cosmopolitan wasn\u2019t open. She wasn\u2019t much of a burger girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, money in the bag!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody but Spider-Man was really sure what happened to the original Electro. During the time he switched bodies with Doctor Octopus, he had his powers taken away by a Parker Industries lab. Or was it after? Whatever, something something cloning, something something no powers, something something ex-girlfriend. That guy couldn\u2019t write a mission report to save his life. To everyone who wasn\u2019t in on the Clone Conspiracy, that old hokey villain Electro had just been replaced by a new one\u2014Francine Frye\u2014who took the name and the powers for herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, not to be catty, but Janet couldn\u2019t help but feel like she filled out her green spandex better when she had first gotten the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine Frye was holding up a burger joint for cash. How quaint! These new villains sure liked to get in their grunt work, that much was for sure. But as Wanda and Janet got closer, they could tell that this had been the most exercise that Francine had gotten in <i>quite</i> a while. She\u2019d gone and gotten a little plump since the last time her mugshot was uploaded into the Avengers database\u2014carrying some heft around her middle in a glorious green muffin-top and starter belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously, robbing a restaurant?\u201d Janet snorted, crossing her arms and fluttering next to her partner, \u201c<i>Clich\u00e9</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo excuse the hell outta me for not having been around when superheroing was <i>invented</i> you hag.\u201d Electro rolled her eyes and shot a bolt of lightning across the room, \u201cA girl\u2019s gotta eat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut do you have to eat <i>so much</i>?\u201d Janet zipped out of the way while Wanda absorbed the bolt with a bright red shield of energy, \u201cSeriously, you look like you\u2019ve had enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet looked back to Wanda, who shot her a dirty look. Looks like Wanda was a bit more sensitive about her weight than she\u2019d been letting on, and didn\u2019t appreciate the jabs that the Wasp had been making. It was a look petulant enough to distract Janet into getting fried by a stray zap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRude!\u201d Francine growled, \u201cAnd <i>I\u2019m</i> the bad guy when you\u2019re over there body-shaming me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are robbing a restaurant!\u201d Wanda said, shooting the lightning back with a fresh red glow, \u201cYou are still very much the bad guy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBUT NOW MY FEELINGS ARE HURT.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElectro roared as she pulled the electricity from the lights, kitchen equipment, and even from people\u2019s cell phones to power up a sudden doming charge of power. It was enough to shock plenty of the patrons and knock Wanda onto her well-padded rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet stayed close to the ground, her muscles tensed by the lightning coursing throughout her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do not have time for this.\u201d Wanda grunted as she struggled to stand, \u201cYou are making a very pleasant day into a very tedious one, Electra!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIT\u2019S ELEC<i>TRO</i>!\u201d Francine barked, shooting another bolt of lightning at the rising witch, \u201cWHY IS THAT SO HARD FOR EVERYBODY?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda absorbed the bolt and fired back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJ-Just because you weigh as much as the old Electro did in muscle, doesn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet received another shock<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want us to treat you like the real thing?\u201d Wanda asked, her eyes glowing red as she lifted slightly into the air, \u201cHere is an old trick that has never failed someone <i>without</i> magic powers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her Hex magic, Wanda made the pipes beneath the restaurant groan in agony as a sudden deluge filled the place. The sprinkler systems activated, the floors flooded, and Francine Frye shorted out like a toaster in a bathtub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the customers and wait staff slowly realized the battle was done, they came to the heroes\u2019 side. Soggy and wet, their food ruined, they were happy just happy that the day was saved. Or that they got to see a real-life superhero fight. Either way, fun story for them to tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, thank you.\u201d Wanda said in a bored tone of voice as she picked up the Wasp\u2014absolutely drenched and her outfit ruined\u2014\u201cWe will be happy to be on our way now and, um\u2026 someone should probably call the police.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the infirmary at the Tower, Wanda slowly sat up from her reclined position, a little woozy but no worse for wear from the scuffle that they\u2019d both endured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat I said back there, about Electro\u2026\u201d Wanda looked away shyly, \u201cYou know I was just trying to get under her skin, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you and the Spider-Man are wont to do.\u201d Wanda huffed, \u201cFor all of your talk about wanting to help me and accepting me, you were very quick to make Fat Jokes back there. Words hurt, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, trust me, electricity isn\u2019t a walk in the park either.\u201d Wasp grimaced, \u201cBut even still. I\u2019m sorry if I hurt your feelings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda made a face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll is forgiven.\u201d She said with a small smile, \u201cOnce you are all taken care of, we should get lunch another time. It wasn\u2019t\u2026 too bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like that\u2014\u201d Janet smiled, \u201cOne superhero team-up, hold the punches.\u201d</span></div></div>",

It was undeniable that Wanda's chest had also benefited from her constant eating but it would take a much different media outlet to draw attention to that than the Bugle distributed roast splattered across the pages before the two superheroines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Jess, don't be so mean\" defended Janet as she tried to grab the paper back to prevent Jessica from reading more than she already had \"she's going through a rough time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I can see that!\" chuckled Jessica \"must be real difficult getting those jeans on before going and stuffing her face\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you guys talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question caught both women off guard but they knew it had come from behind and, Janet at the least, knew who it had come from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Wanda!\" forced Janet, turning to face her friend in an attempt to avoid her discovering the derogatory article \"how are you feeling today? You want to go and grab some lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica giggled uncontrollably as the words came from Janet's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe\" replied Wanda, opting to ignore the childish fit going on on the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let me know and I'll book somewhere\" smiled Janet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's laughter only intensified as she made a pathetic attempt to muffle the noise, stomping her foot slightly on the sofa cushion beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh is that today's paper?\" asked Wanda, noticing the pages crumpled up between her colleagues \"I've not had chance to read it yet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is\" rushed Janet \"but its a real slow news day, nothing interesting at all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That actually sounds nice, I wouldn't mind a moment of mundane\" purred Wanda as she lent over the sofa.<br>\r\nThe angle did wonders for her chest as it sat heavily on the back of the sofa which, in turn, caused her woefully undersized tshirt to expose the small of her back and her hips.<br>\r\nUnable to stop what was about to happen, Janet simply sighed and allowed it as Jessica bit her lip sheepishly, trying to hold back more laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding straight again and straightening the paper, Wanda glanced over the front page.<br>\r\nFor a moment she looked oddly peaceful and Janet foolishly hoped that Wanda had reached a place of peace with the situation so as not to be affected by such a low blow.<br>\r\nJanet was wrong.<br>\r\nAlthough calm reigned at first, it was brief, and Wanda's face slowly but surely twisted into a much more fierce expression.<br>\r\nAs her grip tightened on the edges of the paper, her lips curled tightly against her teeth and the faintest glimmer of red burst across her brown eyes as they slowly lowered down the page.<br>\r\nThe glow only intensified as Wanda read the article and her hair began to float around her before, in a sudden red burst, the paper disappeared between her hands as a few scraps of paper floated to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely lost for what to say, Janet and Jessica watched as Wanda quietly seethed, maintaining her posture as if the paper hadn't just been vapourised with her face screwed up viciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanda, I...I'm...\" started Janet, hoping her intended comforting message would form itself if she started it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to go\" murmured Wanda before turning on her heels, her anger still apparent in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, silence washed over the two women as the stared at the space that Wanda had occupied just seconds before.<br>\r\nGlancing at each other in their confusion, it took an unexpected comment to snap the pair out of their trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, erm...does she know she's still wearing pyjamas or?...\" asked Peter, having never left his seat on the other side of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up Parker\" snapped Jessica with a half glance over her shoulder, still transfixed on the same spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I know that Maximoff isn't our usual front pager and all but I just couldn't resist after that photo was mailed in\" mused Miriam Birchwood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't give a rats ass what you couldn't resist Miriam, you're the god damn GOSSIP WRITER!\" screamed J. Jonah Jameson through his smoldering cigar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that boss but you should see the response it's getting, Spidey hasn't had this kind of response on the front page in weeks\" defended Miriam, knowing how to handle Jameson's moods after years of working at the Bugle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you out of your god damn mind, we're...there's a response?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, lots of interest, people might act all prim and proper but everybody loves a good bitch, especially when it comes to celebrities\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJameson pondered this with a good chomp on his cigar before sliding back into his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what Miriam, I want you on this 24/7. Maximoff leaves that tower and I want you on her faster than she can eat doughnuts, y'hear?\" demanded Jameson as he looked over the front page of that morning's paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir\" chirped Miriam with a wry smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and keep an eye out for if any more of these freaks start to make like Thanksgiving turkeys, you got that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir\" smiled the office gossip as she made to leave her senior's office, only to walk straight into Wanda Maximoff herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of my way\" growled the brunette as she shoved Miriam into an office chair before striding into Jameson's office with a box of doughnuts in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in god's name, call security!\" screamed Jameson as he stood from his desk to square up to the marauding witch but, with a flick of her finger, Wanda had closed and barred the door before Miriam could leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You crazy woman, what the hell are you doing?!\" demanded Jameson as Wanda came within an inch of her tormentor for the day, not even pausing as she allowed a doughnut to glide into her mouth from the box behind \"and why the hell are you stealing the doughnuts I buy for my reporters?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda swallowed before wiping her mouth on the back of her hand politely, exuding a lot of confidence (or intimidation at the least) for a woman wearing short pyjamas that were too small for her growing figure.<br>\r\n\"You weren't very nice about me in your paper today\" purred Wanda, leaning into the bearded man before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what? I'm here to report news and your fat ass made the news this morning!\" shouted Jameson directly into the witch's face, spraying her with spittle from one side of his cigar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda smiled before wiping her face which, as her hand came away, had changed.<br>\r\nThe change hadn't gone unnoticed by Jameson who only realised what it meant far too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one well practiced move Wanda launched herself and Jameson into the air with her powers, pinning the journalist against his office window, a faint cracking sound radiating from behind as a razor thin line shot past his ear.<br>\r\nTaking a probably inappropriate time to bite into another doughnut, Wanda slowly floated towards Jameson, pressing herself against him as she chewed slowly and increasing the pressure just enough to cause more cracks to spread across the window.<br>\r\nAll manner of decorum lost, Wanda readdressed him with a mouthful of pastry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me fat again in your paper and I won't stop you before going through the glass next time\" purred Wanda, continuing to indulge in her doughnuts whilst pressing her weight ever so slightly more against the angered newspaper owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright! Get off of me you crazy woman!\" screamed Jameson, feeling uncomfortably squashed against Wanda's bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda smirked before floating herself down to the floor and striding for the door.<br>\r\n\"Hey! Let me down!\" bellowed Jameson again, veins pulsing in his forehead.<br>\r\nWith a moment's hesitation Wanda flicked her wrist causing Jameson to come crashing down onto his office floor and a torrent of expletives followed her into the lift.</span></div></div>",

Even if you were made the subject of an entire article, that kind of thing didn\u2019t fly\u2014just ask Spider-Man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how much ol\u2019 Brush-Head had it coming, pretty much everyone agreed that Wanda had taken a step too far. The minute that one of them\u2014an Avenger, Defender, X-Man, what have you\u2014could go in and demand a retraction and forcefully discourage having their name in an (admittedly trashy) gossip column was the minute that they needed to take a step back and reevaulate why they were in the business of saving people\u2019s lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCap had been against it the most\u2014First Amendment, Freedom of the Press, Bill of Rights and all that. Taking Wanda\u2019s heavy-handed approach to censorship into account with her already strange behavior, he was the first to suggest that it was time for her to take a leave of absence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust until she can work through whatever\u2019s been bothering her.\u201d His sternness softened a bit, \u201cWanda\u2019s a good woman.

They all did, each and every one of them. Wanda may not have been there at the beginning, but she was a second wave Avenger\u2014one of their first choices for expanding the team. All of them had known her for years, and seeing her act so strangely, so suddenly, was more than a little troubling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially given the aforementioned history that she had whenever things got sour for her mental space. Reality altering powers were a great thing when they were fighting on the side of good, but when the wielder of those powers sunk a little too far off the deep end, for one reason or another, things could get messy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain America, Banner, and herself had been the only ones to make it in person. Tony\u2019s hologram flickered alongside one of Hawkeye\u2014busy in South America\u2014while Thor and Quicksilver had been unable to respond. Two wieners out of the pack didn\u2019t make this any less of a sausage fest though. They were all about band-aiding this problem. Janet and Wanda were the only girls on the \u201coriginal\u201d team, and it was times like this that she was reminded of that little fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe could always study her brain chemistry?\u201d Bruce suggested helpfully (or rather, what he thought was helpful), \u201cI\u2019ve been working on a new Gamma-based radiation experiment that, in theory should\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are <i>not</i> going green on Wanda\u2019s brain.\u201d Janet said firmly, \u201cSeriously, do you hear yourself when you talk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was just a suggestion.\u201d Bruce shrunk back into his seat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJanet, I appreciate how passionate you are about this situation\u2014but Wanda is a dear friend to all of us.\u201d Cap said with a gesture to the remaining roster, \u201cWe\u2019re all concerned, and you have shot down every one of our suggestions as to how to contain her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to <i>contain</i> her, we need to <i>talk</i> to her.\u201d Janet scowled, \u201cWe don\u2019t need to lock her up, and we don\u2019t need to kick her off the team, and we <i>super</i> don\u2019t need to microwave her brain!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s her\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>I swear to God Clint, if you even suggest that it\u2019s her time of the month, I will wasp sting the depth-perception part of your brain.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe holographic Hawkeye slowly put his hand down like a child, rejected in class by an irate teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Wasp, you have the floor.\u201d Tony sighed, \u201cWhat do you suggest that we do about Wanda?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to find a place in New York that offered a modicum of privacy from the superheroing community, and one that also wasn\u2019t overrun with super villains, was almost impossible. Since they\u2019d carved it up like a Thanksgiving turkey, all of the best spots were taken. Spider-Man had Queens, Luke Cage had Harlem, ol\u2019 Hornhead had Hell\u2019s Kitchen, Doc Strange had the Village, even that <i>new</i> Spider-Man had Brooklyn\u2014the list went on. New York was a big place, but with new superheroes cropping out of the woodwork, it was getting harder and harder to find neighborhoods that were \u201cunclaimed\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe object here was to find a place that was relatively devoid of superheroics\u2014a place where Wanda could de-stress, but still be on-call if they needed her. Or if she went off the deep end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, where else was a girl to go? SoHo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind\u2014it\u2019s a little cramped.\u201d Janet wiped the sweat from her brow as she plopped an especially heavy box of junk onto the floor, \u201cWell, for you I mean. Whole size-changing thing means that just about anywhere I want can be as roomy as I need it to be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda had opted to float her boxes, and herself, up the fire escape rather than brave the elevator. Her sizable shape had grown even moreso since her little incident at the Daily Bugle, as she\u2019d grown increasingly comfortable with her heft hovering. She\u2019d developed a wide, wide set of hips that blossomed into thick legs and an improbably plump rear. Her large stomach had begun to sink lower into a blobby white belly apron, thickening around the middle as it folded into two distinct tiers. Wanda\u2019s round face looked especially rosy with the scarlet aura of her magical abilities, keeping her load weightless as she slowly came to settle everything on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI used to sleep in the back of a vardo.\u201d Wanda snorted, settling everything with a quiet <i>oof</i>, \u201cAnd even if I had not, your apartment is bigger than most people\u2019s homes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? I always thought this place was a little small\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet had owned this place for a while now\u2014well, her father\u2019s company had owned it. It was a place to stay for off-site business partners to stay while they were in town. But, seeing as how it hadn\u2019t been used since before Janet and Hank were married (and that was a long, <i>long</i> time ago) she figured that there wouldn\u2019t be any harm in allocating it for a little official Avengers business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet had managed to talk Tony and Steve into letting her and Wanda live here, as a sort of compromise between their two ideas. Wanda wouldn\u2019t be kicked off of the team, she\u2019d just be put on the bench for a while until she could get things figured out. But she wouldn\u2019t be doing it alone, because Wanda had graciously offered to be her sponsor. And more importantly, she\u2019d agreed to be her friend in this time of need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2014room on the right\u2019s yours, room on the left\u2019s mine.\u201d Janet  brushed her hands together triumphantly, \u201cWhat do you say we break in the joint?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWonderful, I am <i>starved</i>.\u201d the Rubenesque Romani said in a husky voice as she waddled towards the couch, \u201cMoving is exhausting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing herself down with all her weight, Scarlet Witch let out a grunt. Her whole body wobbled at the meteoric impact of her ass to the big leather couch. Floating the remote over to her, bathing the little device in a bright red glow, Wanda sank comfortably into the sofa as she flicked the TV on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was thinking more like a little champagne, but\u2026\u201d Janet grimaced<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can have champagne.\u201d Wanda conceded graciously, \u201cAnd Chinese food. I have had such a craving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet could only laugh. She was getting passed the point of being worried by Wanda's appetite. If anything, it was a sign that her friend was feeling up to things. The fact that they'd gotten her to agree to move in here, away from the Tower at all, had been a small miracle. With how well she'd been taking it so far, what was the harm in a little takeout?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust the two of them, OG Avengers gals, rooming together? This might actually be kind of fun! </span></div></div>",

She\u2019d shifted in size, her insectoid wings coming through, and buzzed her way out of the open skylight (a necessity for those flying superheroics!) before returning to full size on the street in her civvies. She knew just the place to get the best wine for the occasion, and she wasn\u2019t about to let her first night in her new apartment go without a proper toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be right back, Wanda!\u201d she had said cordially, shrinking down into her alter-ego, \u201cOrder us something for lunch\u2014make sure it\u2019s <i>light</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to say that Wanda had gone overboard would have been an understatement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time that Janet had returned, from her trip, wine bottle in hand, she had only been gone about an hour. She\u2019d had to take the elevator up since she couldn\u2019t shrink the champagne with her, which added another five\u2026 <i>maybe</i> ten minutes to her commute upstairs. An insufficient amount of time to explain just <i>how</i> Wanda had managed to order all of this food and have it arrive in just seventy short minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Wanda</i>!\u201d Janet nearly dropped the champagne, \u201cI told you to order something light!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you?\u201d the Scarlet Witch sniffed, one container into her Chinese food, \u201cYou must have been tiny\u2014I would have heard you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda had ordered something from every corner of the city. Wieners, subs, pizza from the good places and the bad, and enough Chinese food to feed Wakanda. All of it was placed in an array, on the coffee table in front of the gigantic television in a tightly grouped bunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, whatever wasn\u2019t floating around Wanda anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJesus Christ, you would have thought we were having the Hulks over.\u201d The Wasp gasped at the sight of it all\u2014the thick smell of greasy takeout lingering heavy in the air, \u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you, girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am just hungry.\u201d Wanda non-answered, slurping from her noodle box, \u201cMoving is exhausting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah, if only you moved</i>, Janet grumbled to herself as she took her seat on the couch. Her fellow Avenger hadn\u2019t so much as moved a muscle since she set foot in their apartment! All she\u2019d done is float her share of the boxes up with her, herself included. Which half of that equation weighed more was becoming less and less of a clear question\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you like what I have done with the place?\u201d Wanda gestured vaguely with her thickening arms around the apartment, \u201cThe only boxes left are yours. They are in the corner.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe what now?\u201d Janet asked as she picked a box of Chinese food at random from the pile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter looking around, Janet was impressed to find that, yes, Wanda <i>had</i> done something other than cram their apartment with enough food to feed the entire line of Avengers\u2014Mighty, New, and Young. All of their stuff had been put up! Pictures with old teammates hung up on the wall, knick-knacks and souvenirs placed in the cabinets\u2026 the cabinet had been assembled\u2026 everything was already moved in! She\u2019d even managed to get <i>plants</i> from somewhere\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Wanda.\u201d Janet whistled, popping open her takeout box, \u201cI thought Pietro was supposed to be the speedster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was nothing\u2014I was bored.\u201d Wanda grunted, elevating one of many drinks straw-first to her plump pink lips, \u201cDid you get the wine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right\u2014\u201cJanet held it up, \u201cBest champagne in town!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, I would like something bubbly to settle my stomach.\u201d Wanda floated two glasses over from the cabinet, \u201cLet us do the Cheers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet leaned back into the sofa, her tiny belly taut and fit to burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn\u2019t eaten this much since her newly divorced days. Those nights comfort-eating Hagendaas hadn\u2019t been fun, but even they had left her feeling less like crap than what she\u2019d just done to herself. For such a small woman (no pun intended) Janet had always thought that she could pack away more than her fair share of food when the time called for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut today? Woof\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to finish that?\u201d Wanda asked thickly from her side of the couch<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod no, take it away\u2026\u201d Janet whimpered as her half a sub sandwich began to glow red and float away, \u201cI\u2019m so full\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the Scarlet Witch had heard her, she hadn\u2019t cared to respond. She was far too engrossed in what had to have been her bajillionth hot dog. As Janet\u2019s sandwich hovered over, the blimping brunette barely took her eyes off of the chili-cheese dog as she opened her mouth. Her piggish sounds of mastication played under the superhero documentary playing on the television as she lazily fed herself via telekinesis. As her stomach bulged and rose, slowly filling up with more food than any one woman had any right to eat in one sitting, she rested her hands on its doming circumference. Occasionally she\u2019d pat it approvingly, stroking it as she filled it more and more to its capacity\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeez Wanda, it\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d Janet grumbled, \u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s going to fly away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda, preoccupied with her flying food, barely responded. She breathed in shallow breaths, her mind foggy as indulgence overcame her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Janet asked, \u201cYou sound like you\u2019re about to give birth to a litter over there\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d Wanda grunted, her hands traveling down the slope of her stomach, \u201cLemme just\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a great sigh of relief, Wanda unfastened the button on her pants and berthed her beastly belly onto her lap. Her expression hazy and dumb with relief, Wanda\u2019s indulgence resumed once more with gusto. She began eating\u2014<i>gorging</i> her way through the various meals that she\u2019d ordered to the apartment more than two hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was still going strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMuch better.\u201d She said happily, her hands resting pleasantly on her growing gut as she reclined deeper into her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Wanda go was nauseating. How a woman could eat that much, shove <i>that much</i> past her lips, was astounding. But it was like a train wreck, Janet couldn\u2019t look away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no wonder Wanda\u2019s weight was getting out of hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her friend\u2026 was it Janet\u2019s job to say something?</span></div></div>",

They had just moved in and with a talk like that, all of Janet\u2019s hard work would have been undone. She would have floated off to God knows where and would have been left to sit and stew all by her lonesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd historically, that was never the best option to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReality would thank Janet for withholding her feelings later, for sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, the woman was totally overcome with consuming everything in front of her. Like a big red goldfish. She <i>had</i> to eat it all. Her heavy grunts and her fatty sounds of piggish enjoyment were all that Janet could hear, even under the Disney+ queue! And with every bite, she just seemed to sink deeper into the couch, deeper into her hedonism, as her hands began to rub deep concentric circles into her doming stomach\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt definitely made Janet feel better about pigging out on two boxes of chicken fried rice and a half a sub sandwich, that much was for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m, uh\u2026 gonna go sleep this off.\u201d Janet offered an explanation to unhearing ears, \u201cYou gonna pause that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda grunted dumbly in response as she deep-throated a burrito<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, her legs noodly, Janet did her best to drone out the sights and sounds of one of her oldest friends making a pig out of herself as she made her way to her room. She hadn\u2019t been exaggerating about needing to sleep this off\u2014all the moving, plus all the eating really had left her exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she collapsed into her mattress, Janet could still hear the sounds of her new roommate gorging and the TV blaring. Reaching into her coat pocket, she pulled out a tiny disk with a stylized FF logo on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReed Richards, you\u2019re the most useless man in the universe.\u201d Janet sighed before activating her White Noise machine, \u201cExcept for this, and only this moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the sound outside of the room came to a standstill as Janet was finally left alone with her thoughts. That thing would drown out any noise from outside and muffle any noise from inside the radius of her room. It would be useful for giving reports back to Steve about Wanda\u2019s progress, but it also apparently worked as a great noise barrier from her noisy roommate. The less she had to think about food, the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me I\u2019m doing the right thing, here.\u201d Janet groaned skyward, \u201cI\u2019m a good friend, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo answer. Obviously. The one God in the universe that she wanted to talk to, and he wasn\u2019t one of the ones that she had on speed-dial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I thought as much.\u201d Janet groaned, rolling off of her bed, \u201cI\u2019m gonna put on my PJs\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Janet woke up the next morning, none of the food was left from the night before. None of the mess, either. But the loud snoring from the boulder-sized Scarlet Witch as she struggled to digest her epic feast suggested that it had been one battle that Wanda hadn\u2019t won so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet <i>really</i> had her work cut out for her with this one\u2026</span></div></div>",

Back at the Tower, slumming it at the old Mansion, Wasp was pretty much a full-time superhero. Not like some of the other part-timers these days\u2014the ones who managed to have personal lives. The world always threatened to pull itself apart the minute anyone got any peace and quiet, and somehow the Wasp had always managed to put personal time as an aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda\u2019s bench warming days were a blessing for the wonderful Wasp, because it finally allowed her some downtime. Time to be spent at normal size, out of uniform, and not having to zap bad guys. Time just being a regular New Yorker\u2014well, at least as normal as you could get with a life like Janet VanDyne\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spent her time doing everything she wished she could do when she was on active duty. She saw plays, she went to see movies, she went downtown, tried new restaurants. Would you believe that she even had a few dates? Short of having an actual job outside of spandex and looking over her shoulder for the next crisis that forced all the teams to cross over (or fight against each other), Janet did her best to spend her time like she\u2019d always wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda used her free time to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the better part of two months Janet had been on Wanda-Vision, trying to get her friend to work through her funk. Coaxing her out of the apartment every once in a while, taking her to nice clothing stores that catered to women of her *ahem* <i>particular</i> size, and generally just trying to be a supportive friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut most days, whether Janet was home or not, Wanda spent her time cooped up in apartment. She would spend all day dressed down getting cozy as she waited on herself hand and foot. Anything and everything in the living room was up to glow red as soon as Wanda decided she needed it\u2014she\u2019d levitate her phone over to the couch with an outstretched chubby palm, her remote with a stubborn look. But with anything edible, it just sort of gravitated towards her. Janet had come home for about the billionth time to a lazy river of takeout circling Wanda\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had certainly gotten bigger\u2014no arguments about that. Janet had done her best to stay supportive, but there was no denying that this was getting out of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWanda?\u201d Janet asked as the door shut behind her, \u201cYou okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMrmph.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Scarlet Witch\u2019s neck had further receded underneath the rounding slope of her second chin as it hung from her neck. Chubby ivory cheeks reflected the crimson glow of her abilities, specks and splashes of her previous courses evident on her face while her tongue lolled out excitedly. Her hands resting lazily on her bulging stomach as it sloped and rolled towards the edge of their couch, she drummed her fingers happily as a burrito forced about a third of itself into her awaiting mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d Janet piqued, hanging her coat up on the catch, \u201cBecause you were there when I left. This morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust having a little dinner.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda answered in a nonplussed, dismissive sort of way as her brown eyes flashed greedily. She had grown hoggishly fat since this whole debacle started, her stunning superhero looks having been padded and expanded to an almost unrecognizable degree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she wanted to do was eat\u2014Wanda had made that very clear. That\u2019s all she did. Janet couldn\u2019t bring her anywhere without stopping at various food stands or restaurants, both of which she had a nasty tendency to empty. The woman had a one-track mind these days, and it led straight into that giant gut of hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the couch, Wanda\u2019s stomach rolled over both of her mile-wide thighs. It was a constantly stuffed mountain, growing ever bigger and rounder with each passing meal. Her atrophied arms were distressingly round and useless. She\u2019d barely used them since she moved into this new apartment. Or at least, Janet hadn\u2019t seen her do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s your diet going?\u201d Janet asked hopefully, \u201cYou know, we talked about this\u2014cutting out some extra calories might do you some good!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda didn\u2019t even look at Janet as she said the words\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Growing wasn\u2019t her forte\u2014so accessing the strength that came with super-size without ruining a perfectly good coat was difficult. She managed to roll the weighty witch to her feet with an incredible amount of effort. No doubt that, had Janet VanDyne been a normal svelte New Yorker without superpowers, Wanda would still be pinned down on that couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOof!\u201d she grunted, \u201c<i>God</i> you\u2019re heavy\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda could only burp in response. Without the support of the couch beneath it, Wanda\u2019s stomach sagged worryingly low underneath the weight of everything she\u2019d eaten. Her great jiggling mass was like battling an avalanche of pizza dough in a brown wig. Janet could barely get a grip on her to force her one way or the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarch, missy!\u201d Janet grunted, shoving her sizable friend towards her bedroom, \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about this in the morning after you sleep off everything that you\u2019ve eaten tonight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJaneeet!\u201d Wanda whined, \u201cI don\u2019t want to\u2026 to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden churning in her stomach, audible even to the Wasp, gave Wanda a great discomfort. Her whole face squinched, she began clutching at whatever she could reach of her stomach with both hands. She doubled over as far as her taxed knees would let her, groaning in a low voice as a sudden and sharp pain overcame her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I suppose some bedrest could help.\u201d Wanda relented, \u201cI\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAm not going anywhere, or doing anything, that does not involve that bedroom.\u201d Janet used her best field-commander voice, \u201cI have been nice, I have been helpful, and I have done my best to be supportive, but you have <i>got</i> to get yourself in control.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 I <i>am</i> in control\u2026\u201d Wanda\u2019s dinner plate face turned red and sweaty, \u201cJanet, I\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will talk about this in the morning.\u201d Janet pointed into Wanda\u2019s bedroom, \u201cNow get in there and go to bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda\u2014far too stuffed and tired to argue\u2014simply sighed dejectedly, waddling towards the door. Janet winced as she watched her friend\u2019s gigantic ass wobble behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd change your pajamas.\u201d The Wasp added, \u201cThose are all\u2026 sweaty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet had had to order takeout. Wanda had eaten literally everything in the apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pizza guy knew their apartment off the top of his head now, which was embarrassing. He was almost surprised when it was Janet who had answered the door and not a three-hundred pound brunette or a red light. The last time there had been one lone, solitary pizza in this apartment was anyone\u2019s guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Wanda slept off her gut-busting meal, Janet went to work cleaning out anything and everything unhealthy that had somehow escaped Wanda\u2019s rampage. Cookies, chips, microwave food, anything that was unhealthy had all gone into the trash. Now, she was vacuuming. Fixing the apartment after Wanda\u2019s binges was going to be a thing of the past, whether she liked it or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda wouldn\u2019t be happy about it, but clearly babying her wasn\u2019t getting her anywhere but Extra Large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had a real breakthrough with Wanda today, Tony.\u201d Wanda said into the earpiece, \u201cI sat her down and told her what was what.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 good news?\u201d Iron Man asked with an audible wince, \u201cDid she\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, she was a little\u2026 um\u2026 under the weather when it all happened.\u201d Janet had wisely chosen to hide the finer details from her fellow Avengers, \u201cBut when she sees I\u2019m serious, I think we\u2019ll have things back on track with her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Wanda\u2019s room, the lights dark, as Wanda\u2019s spherical shape hovered a whole foot off of the bed. Her slumbering size loomed ominously beneath the blanket as it draped off of her enormous belly, still domed high in the air. Her thick limbs slumped uselessly, bathed in a soft red glow. She was sound asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No more diets</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup, I think we\u2019re going to see a whole new Wanda after all this is said and done.\u201d Janet said confidently, \u201cJust you wait.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As part of her agreement in taking Wanda away from Avengers Tower to handle her problems, Janet had agreed to regular updates on the situation.<br>\r\nThus far they had all occurred over comms but on this particular occasion her presence had been demanded to report in on how the rogue Witch was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully, it was less than simple...<br>\r\nWanda had curtailed her eating since their conversation weeks back, even if 'curtail' was a loose term as the witch still gorged like a woman possessed but Janet's words had had some impact and, at least on a noticeable level, her weight had slowed its constant uphill climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite not being a total success though, Janet saw the situation as a win and was more than happy to report in person on how things were going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Janet paced towards the shimmering glass doors and into Avengers HQ, her usual style radiating outward in a long jacket and boots, she couldn't help but smile at her perceived praise on how the Wanda situation had panned out.<br>\r\nWith any luck she would be able to bring Wanda back into the fold and get back to work seeing as, as much as she was enjoying her 'me time', Janet found herself in some serious ass-whooping need.<br>\r\nLost in her own thoughts though, Janet was abruptly torn from her dreaming as she crashed into someone crossing the foyer from inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh jeez, I'm so sorry, I...Janet?\" asked the soft voice of Pepper Potts, awkwardly shuffling the folders clasped in her arms that had dislodged from their collision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Pepp, its so good to see you again!\" beamed Janet as she helped nudge a folder back into the redhead's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too! How is Wanda doing?\" asked Pepper, finally finding control of her pesky paperwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet took a moment to recollect her positive thoughts on the situation.<br>\r\n\"You know what, she is actually doing really well\" nodded Janet, finding the answer perfectly satisfactory and within the realms of truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so great to hear, will you send on my wishes?\" smiled Miss Potts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will\" returned Janet as she cautiously glanced at the large wall clock behind her conversationalist \"unfortunately though, I've gotta run, big meeting upstairs\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, don't let me slow you down!\" mused Pepper, side stepping slightly to allow Janet through \"maybe I'll swing by and see you girls some time soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds great\" smiled Janet as she slowly stepped past the redhead towards the building lifts.<br>\r\nWithout hesitation Janet pressed the floor button she needed and stepped into the lift that was still there no doubt from when Pepper had come down, before turning round to see her friend off out of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gaze was quickly drawn down though as she watched the administrator saunter out of the building, a rather padded rear stretching her skirt taut around her curving hips.<br>\r\nThe sight shouldn't have been much of a shock to Janet, Pepper had always been a sharp dresser, but she certainly didn't remember the fiery haired woman being so...wide.<br>\r\nCome to think of it, Pepper had looked noticeably chubbier in the face as well but, before more thought could be paid to the situation, the lift doors closed and started the ascent up the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAssuming her memories were less than accurate, Janet stepped out of the lift at her destination and took off across the glossy floor, boot heels clicking as she went.<br>\r\nIt felt good to be home again, walking the halls she was so used to walking, and couldn't wait to deliver her mission report on the Wanda situation, hope peeking just a little more that she would be able to come back to the tower and rejoin the rest of her friends and colleagues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well, if it isn't The Wasp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet's lips curled in a small smile as the voice beckoned to her from behind, familiar even if the last it spoke to her was largely mockery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come to apologise have you Jess?\" called back Janet as she turned slowly on her heels to face Spider-Woman for the first time in weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft, I haven't got anything to apologise for\" smirked Jessica Drew \"I thought you were the pizza guy so you basically owe me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Pizza guy?' thought Janet, her mind running just a little faster than her eyes as she glanced over her friend.<br>\r\nIt seemed like the past few weeks had been...interesting for Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast time they had seen each other, Jessica was as obsessed with the gym as ever and ever critical of Wanda's situation but now the female web slinger was looking like a smaller version of her target.<br>\r\nClad in a vest top and scant booty shorts, Jessica had a soft tummy bulge escaping the tight dark material of her top and an indented belly button was visible through the material.<br>\r\nHer thighs were also looking thicker in a not muscular way and were putting her shorts under some stress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hurry up, Danvers is back and she's got some tales just for a change\" cooed Jessica as she waddled off, expecting Janet to follow.<br>\r\nFirst Pepper had looked positively plump and now Jess didn't appear to have even seen the gym since they last spoke...<br>\r\nThings were getting a little bit weird now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So get this, I'm off world-obviously-and this Kree chick gets well up in my face thinking she can take on Captain Marvel so naturally I've got to take this girl on\" preached Carol Danvers to her audience, blonde locks and arms flailing around equally as she spoke, the appearance of Jess and Janet doing little to stem her flow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What they didn't tell me though is that they have this new trial by combat thing going on where a challenge between two women is basically a massive eating contest to see who lasts the longest\" mused Carol, appearing to lick her lips slightly as she recalled the so-called challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously I beat this chick no problem, but then everybody wanted a slice and well, things got a bit crazy...\"<br>\r\nBreaking from talking, Danvers opted to go for a more visual display and, in one swift motion, unzipped her flight suit causing an unexpectedly large pale belly to bulge out of the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping her face didn't betray her shock, Janet was even more surprised to hear cheers from the surrounding girls whilst Carol smugly posed with her pillowy belly squeezing free of the skin tight material held up by her shoulders, hands proudly placed on her thick hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to filter the noise, and avoid staring at Carol's exposed figure, Janet caught a few familiar faces.<br>\r\nAlongside Drew, Jessica Jones was also in the room, lounging on a large sofa, with Hellcat occupying the other end.<br>\r\nJennifer Walters aka She-Hulk was perched on the floor ploughing through a rather large pizza as the tale was told before her although her concentration didn't seem to break from her food.<br>\r\nThe X-Men even had representation in the form of Jean Grey and Emma Frost who, although on opposite sides of the room to each other, both seemed to be enjoying Carol's tale equally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of her eye, Janet also caught a glimpse of food rising from a side table and could only assume that Susan Storm was also in the room although her powers rendered her invisible despite her eating betraying her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all though, the sight was quite odd as every single woman in the room was packing more pounds than Janet ever remembered any of them having and she couldn't fathom why, at least, for all apart from Carol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I challenge any one of you here to beat me in this new-and awesome-trial, if any of you ladies dare!\" sneered Carol playfully as she slumped down into a high backed chair, her belly filling her lap with her chest perched on top of the pale dome, still squeezing through the opening in the front of her suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sentiment was met with laughter and cheers as every woman, including the spider variety who had now seated herself, dove into some food item or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis whole thing didn't seem right to Janet and, quietly, she snuck back out of the room and headed for the elevator to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could reach the doors though, they slid open to reveal another familiar, albeit younger, face in the form of Mary Jane Watson who had made a habit of coming by to visit Parker on occassion.<br>\r\nOn closer look though, she had not been left out of the apparent fattening party that had swarmed the tower in Janet's absence as the redhead waddled down the corridor with a full pot belly stretching her shirt and a ripened rear to match behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Miss VanDyne!\" chirped the redhead, a hint of breathlessness punctuating her voice \"is Peter in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned at seeing the previously svelte girl so plumped up, Janet could only shake her head and mutter her lack of knowledge on the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope he is, I'm starving\" groaned the girl, placing a hand on her softened middle as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet could only weakly nod before beelining for the lift and hammering the ground floor key.<br>\r\nSomething was seriously wrong.</span></div></div>",

It was easier to stay put and keep an eye on the Scarlet Witch\u2014better yet, make sure that she didn\u2019t stuff herself like a Thanksgiving turkey. The fact that everyone seemed to be acting so strangely lately only reinforced her sort of quasi-isolation. The Wonderful Wasp didn\u2019t need to worry about her coworkers\u2019 weights\u2026 well, except for one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since they\u2019d had their little \u201ctalk\u201d, Janet had been doing double time at their apartment in SoHo. Wanda was in a delicate place right now with her diet and needed a lot of support\u2014which she certainly wouldn\u2019t find at the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dHow is the ol\u2019 double wide witch these days?\u201d Jessica Drew snorted, leaning forward to grab another two slices of pizza<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, I know <u>I\u2019ve</u> let myself go a little\u2026\u201d Jessica Jones tugged the hem of her new leather jacket fruitlessly to the curvature of her belly, \u201cBut I had a baby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, like two years ago.\u201d She-Hulk laughed, \u201cTell you what Jan, if Wanda suddenly wants to change her name to the White and Purple Prestidigitator, she can have some of my old outfits. I\u2019m, um\u2026 gonna have to size up.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet wasn\u2019t quite sure what was going on with everyone, but the thought of them all making fun of Wanda like that was enough to get her blood boiling. How could they all treat her like yesterday\u2019s news when they\u2019d been on a team together for so long? Janet would have liked to see any of them squeeze into last year\u2019s costumes these days\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJanet?\u201d Wanda asked with a furrowed brow, \u201cIs everything alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Wanda.\u201d Janet snapped back to reality, \u201cJust, uh\u2026 brooding.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh.\u201d Wanda raised her head knowingly, \u201cHell\u2019s Kitchen is that way, darling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf either one of them could have cooked, minding Wanda\u2019s weight would have been a lot easier. Janet had never had to master the art herself (but she <i>could</i> spark a fire if your igniter was broken!) and Wanda had never been particularly enthralled by the subject. Magic had a way of giving you a penchant for instant gratification that didn\u2019t lend itself well to standing in front of an oven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was, takeout was their best option. Healthy(ish) takeout, but still takeout. And it was hard to justify not ordering a little extra since you were already having it delivered to your place\u2014what even was the <i>normal</i> amount of food to order to your apartment for a superhero anymore? Living with Wanda had certainly put a new spin on Janet\u2019s perception of portion sizes\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of filling their apartment with food from all over New York, Janet had done her best to keep Wanda\u2019s requests maintained. Nothing too greasy, nothing too fatty. Sandwiches, some Mexican food, and that new sushi place that opened up. Three courses of takeout was still a lot, mind you, but it was a good compromise between their two philosophies about the concept. If it were up to Janet, Wanda would have had a sandwich and some water\u2014but pushing Wanda was something that had to be handled delicately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, she\u2019d already made some progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmall steps were important, but Janet felt like she was trying to box in the Juggernaut when it came to curtailing Wanda\u2019s weight. The woman just couldn\u2019t stop herself\u2014every time Janet turned around, she was snacking on <i>something</i>. Where these endless trains of hot dogs and pizza slices came from was anyone\u2019s best guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure this is going to be enough?\u201d Wanda made a face as she hovered a piece of sushi into her mouth, \u201cYou won\u2019t be hungry afterwards?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet chuckled\u2014Wanda was so transparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, <i>I\u2019ll</i> be fine.\u201d She held her chopsticks artfully and plopped a fried roll past her lips, \u201cAnd so will <i>you</i>, Wanda.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda\u2019s disappointment was palpable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am not a child, you know\u2014I can manage what I eat on my own.\u201d She said in a huff, eating a bit faster, \u201cI am merely suggesting\u2026 perhaps ordering more for later?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Wanda, don\u2019t be like that.\u201d Janet corrected mildly, \u201cBesides, you\u2019ve made so much progress! Three pounds in two weeks\u2014those are good numbers!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose\u2026\u201d Wanda ran one fat hand along the drum-tight blouse that caged her blobby stomach, \u201cBut we will be ordering dinner, yes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god yes, Wanda, we\u2019re gonna order dinner.\u201d Janet laughed a little harder, dropping her next piece, \u201cI\u2019m not gonna <i>starve</i> you\u2014you\u2019re just on a diet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of the dreaded d-word, the scarlet aura of Wanda\u2019s magic intensified. The food that she had been hovering shook dramatically in the air, their orbit around her quickening slightly. Her proud Romani features curled in anger, her brow furrowing in distaste. It wasn\u2019t enough to make the apartment shake or anything, but Janet tried her best to keep Wanda happy about all of this. The minute she started to feel discouraged was the minute she started to head towards the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDiets.\u201d Wanda snarled, gnashing on her food, \u201cSuch a foolish concept.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Janet nodded placatingly, touching Wanda\u2019s mile-wide thigh in a friendly way, \u201cBut a <i>necessary</i> one\u2014you want to get back out in the field, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I <i>want</i> a pizza.\u201d Wanda growled, her hair drifting upwards, \u201cI want <i>cookies</i> and <i>chili dogs</i> and <i>steaks</i> and <i>burgers</i>\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, okay, okay, calm down there Witchy-poo.\u201d Janet intervened just as Wanda\u2019s eyes began to flash red, \u201cI tell you what\u2014when we get you back down to two-eighty, we\u2019ll go have a big dinner. Anything you want. Sound fair?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda paused, her powers dampening as she turned to her friend, roommate, fellow Avenger, and now dietician.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we get ice cream after lunch?\u201d she asked with that same serious voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 sure?\u201d Janet offered helpfully, \u201cOne cheat day won\u2019t wreck your diet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda came back to reality, sinking back into the couch deeply. Her edible orbit resumed its normal pace, popping bites in and out of her mouth. She still seemed a bit upset, but Janet seemed to have mitigated the worst of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still hate diets.\u201d Wanda grumbled like a child, \u201cI wish we lived in a world without them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, same.\u201d Janet laughed, \u201cBut if you want to live in a world without diets, I should just send you back to Avengers Tower.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026pardon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet paused\u2014where had that come from? She had done her best not to mention the Tower ever since they\u2019d started rooming together, but the thought of barbing at her friends like that had been too good to pass up!

After all, they had all been teammates for years now, and they <i>all</i> knew how hard it was to hide extra pounds and inches in spandex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut on the other hand, none of them had been especially helpful when it came to watching Wanda\u2019s weight. None of them had even offered to check in on her!

The weighty witch still had more than a few hundred pounds on some of those women in the papers. And the fact that she spent almost as much time eating ice cream as she did laughing, her large belly wobbling and her cheeks rippling at the expense of her fellow Avengers, it was enough to remind Janet that they couldn\u2019t afford to have too many nights like this in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot unless Wanda wanted to be the next headline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, that\u2019s enough of that.\u201d Janet rolled to her feet, belly full of ice cream and wine, \u201cI\u2019m headed to bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Wanda asked quickly, \u201cI think there is still some ice cream in the freezer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Wanda, I think I\u2019ve had enough.\u201d Janet burped, \u201cBesides, it\u2019s getting late.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I\u2019m having so much fun!\u201d Wanda whined, \u201cJust a little longer, please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s passed midnight.\u201d Janet winced<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd this will impede with your nine-to-five job in the morning.\u201d Wanda raised an eyebrow, \u201cWe are effectively on vacation, yes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026yes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen come and sit\u2014just for a little longer.\u201d Wanda paused before adding a particularly poignant \u201cPlease?\u201d</span></div></div>",

A glass of the stuff had been enough to give Janet the giggles before she had been sweet-talked into staying up for \u201ca little longer\u201d, but with a half a bottle inside of her, the Wasp was officially off her rocker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand how you\u2019re still drinking!\u201d Janet hollered uproariously, laying at a one-eighty on their couch, \u201cWanda you\u2019re gonna <i>diiiiie</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time in far too long, Wanda had been holding something with her hands. With her chubby fingers wrapped around the neck, she chugged the spicy Inhuman wine like it was nothing. The Wasp\u2019s smaller stature meant that she couldn\u2019t handle the majority of a bottle that had been left after her glass. Wanda had been happy to oblige\u2014the other \u00be of the previous wine run already nestled deep inside her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy belly will absorb <i>all</i> of it.\u201d Wanda said with a slurred smile, patting her big apron of belly flesh appreciatively \u201cShe is a good girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour stomach is a she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am a she.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda ran her hands up the monstrous bottom roll of her belly as it rolled over her thighs and touched the leather couch cushions. Her milky-white mass dolloped on the couch, covering her impossibly thick thighs as they spread like sour cream across her seat. With her wobbling arms, Wanda hefted a portion of her prodigious paunch up, and let it crash down proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA big she.\u201d Janet said woozily, \u201cOof. Wanda\u2026 you\u2019re fat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am very fat.\u201d Wanda said almost mournfully, her hands running in and out along the circumference of her corpulence, \u201cI am the fattest Avenger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNooooo\u2026.\u201d Janet sloshed over to hug her huge friend\u2019s shoulder, \u201cHoney don\u2019t talk like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf Hulk can be the strongest, I can be the fattest.\u201d Wanda bounced her hands playfully on the gelatinous surface of her stomach, \u201cI am okay with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet winced\u2014in her drunken state, she was much less equipped to hide her distaste for Wanda\u2019s figure. How could anyone be happy being so big? Being so round and jiggly? She was as big around as the Hulk\u2019s chest, with none of the muscle. How could anyone have been happy being \u201cthe Fat Avenger\u201d?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, you do you girl.\u201d Janet poked her friend in the belly, losing her finger knuckle-deep in ivory-white pudge, \u201cI mean, I\u2019ll support you no matter what\u2014but I don\u2019t think I could do what you do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat I do?\u201d Wanda pulled away from her belly play in curiosity<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSit around and eat junk all day.\u201d Janet wretched, \u201cI feel like I\u2019m gonna bust as-is!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little woman grabbed at her stomach, rock-hard from her lazy day with Wanda. Letting the Scarlet Witch have her way was dangerous\u2014all that woman wanted to do was eat! And Janet might have been good about it so far, but she\u2019d never eaten two quarts of ice cream in one sitting before. On top of sushi. And a sandwich. And half a bottle of wine. While also having barely moved from the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh stop.\u201d Wanda dismissed in a heady daze, \u201cYou had fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMebbe a little.

She was dead asleep pretty much as soon as her head hit the pillow\u2014three in the morning wine nights weren\u2019t exactly in the superhero\u2019s handbook. Exhausted, sleepy, and more than a little drunk, Janet whisked herself off into a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely unaware of what she had set in motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDiets <i>are</i> dumb\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Scarlet Witch sat on the couch, pinned by her fluffy white stomach. She drummed her belly thoughtfully as her secret snack stash began to flow from the top cabinet in the kitchen. It glowed a bright red as it hovered over\u2014chips, cookies, and small candies beginning their orbit around Wanda\u2019s planetary body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Wanda\u2019s hedonism took hold, enjoying a midnight snack before bed, she couldn\u2019t help but picture a world where they <i>could</i> do this more often. A world where nobody had to diet. A world where she could eat whatever she wanted. A world where she could just eat and eat and eat\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands began to rub sleepy concentric circles into the sides of her stomach. A low, breathy moan escaped her as her pillowy thighs clenched together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer last thought before drifting off to sleep was<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No More Diets</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Beginning your career in the \u201cBrotherhood of Evil Mutants\u201d would do that to a girl. On top of the fact that she could manipulate reality, had a supervillain for a father, and had one of the wackiest family trees this side of the Summers tumbleweed, Wanda\u2019s insistence on keeping people at an arm\u2019s length could be frustrating to a more outgoing people-person like Janet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo imagine her surprise when Wanda had begun to warm up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelieve it or not, it was true! Wanda Maximoff had slowly come around to Janet\u2019s small, but ultimately meaningful acts of friendship. The somewhat cold, distant Romani woman (buried underneath a couple hundred extra pounds of flab) had finally come to see the value in having Janet around. The introvert had finally accepted the extrovert\u2019s presence and, above all things, now wanted to share that friendship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just that now, thanks to a peculiar shift in personality, Wanda\u2019s idea of sharing friendship was food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been doing so well in maintaining what counted for a diet to a compulsive-eating superhero! Janet had put her foot down and done her best to make sure that none of that junk she liked to stuff herself with would stay long in <i>her</i> apartment. Wanda had slowly, reluctantly, but surely realized that Janet only had her best interest at heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was then that Janet\u2019s willpower began to crumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the sudden, out of the blue, she became barraged with intrusive thoughts that urged her towards indulgence. Cookies, cakes, pies, everything that the Id inside of her cried out for was suddenly becoming harder to ignore! Fine foods, delicious dining, and everything she wanted flashed behind her eyelids while she slept at night. The call to indulge was so loud, so strong, and so <i>persuasive</i>\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJanet!\u201d Wanda cried jovially, waddled with some difficulty across the hardwood floors of their SoHo apartment, \u201cI am thinking about ordering some lunch. What are you in the mood for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Everything</i> was the first thing that flashed behind Janet\u2019s mind. That pizza place on 51st sounded wonderful. The sushi joint in Midtown was great. Lobster bisque with great big slabs of butter made her mouth melt at the mere thought! The poor size-shifting superhero could only buckle before the great barrage of mental images and smells pouring down her psyche as she quietly said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe a pizza or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA pizza? <i>Janet VanDyne</i> ordering a <i>pizza</i>?\u201d Wanda mocked with a rich belly laugh, one that sent her great dollop of stomach rolling with mirth, \u201cAre you sure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Janet bit her bottom lip, \u201cWith, um\u2026 with extra cheese? And maybe\u2026 ooh, and maybe some anchovies. I don\u2019t know why, I\u2019ve just got such a <i>craving</i>\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet\u2019s mind flashed with pictures of greasy, cheesy triangles. Lowering them into her awaiting maw. Loosening the belt on her costume. Bellies bulging. She needed more, <i>more</i>\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d she hesitated, \u201cI\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Another pie, for starters, so that they didn\u2019t have to worry about not getting enough. Then breadsticks. Sauce. Garlic butter. Then another order of breadsticks. Then two pies, for leftovers (didn\u2019t want to have to worry about cooking for dinner!) and somehow\u2026 <i>somehow</i>\u2026 this happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe apartment was filled with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom all over New York, as if Wanda herself had been in charge of the food run, all of the best places in town had been rung up and pilfered from their finest stock of fast food. Pizzas, subs, Chinese, the whole works was wrapped up tight in Wanda and the Wasp\u2019s apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are sure that you are okay with this?\u201d Wanda asked, a proud Romani eyebrow fishhooked in suspicion at her friend\u2019s behavior, \u201cThis seems a little excessive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019m <i>not</i>.\u201d Janet\u2019s big blue eyes couldn\u2019t stop staring at the sheer size of the haul that they\u2019d brought in together, \u201cBut, I mean\u2026 what\u2019s <i>one</i> cheat day between friends?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as much as she hated herself for it, Janet couldn\u2019t help but enjoy herself. Why shouldn\u2019t she? She was on vacation! This was her reward for years of Avenger-ing! All the long, long years she\u2019d put in as the Wasp, dealing with things like psycho ex-husbands, stupid squabbles between teams, Tony\u2019s alcoholism and whatever the hell Silver Cyclone was doing with his crush with her these days. Skrull/Kree invasions\u2014all of it was ridiculous! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this, tonight (and only tonight, she promised!) would be her reward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer delicious, delicious reward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet deserved this. The Wasp deserved this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as she ate, piggish sounds of enjoyment and arousal filling the apartment as she and Wanda indulged themselves, that thought kept playing in the back of her mind. As if on a loop. She deserved it. She deserved it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou deserve this, you know.\u201d Wanda said breathlessly, coming up for air after having dived into her Chinese food for God knows how long, \u201cPutting up with me as you have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 I don\u2019t know about that.\u201d Janet said modestly, her belly bulging underneath her pajama top, \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m just being a good friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA great friend.\u201d Wanda added meaningfully, \u201cHelping get me under control must have been a lot of work for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet\u2019s chest swelled with undeserved pride.

She raised on hand heroically and pat the rippling surface of her exposed, enormous stomach. She chuckled huskily, happily, as its great weight shifted slightly in her lap. She could feel the vibrations travelling up her arm and out into the widest regions of her girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know exactly where I put it all\u2014\u201c she said in a short, shallow laugh, \u201cRight here, for safe-keeping.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheer <i>amount</i> of food that Wanda had eaten thus far acted as a mild deterrent for leaning forward, back into the fattening fray that was their lunch. After an hours-long breakfast, capped off by a comparatively modest takeout brunch, Janet and Wanda had taken every minute of their two-hour siesta to make as much room as possible for what would ultimately prove to be a rather impressive lunch in and of itself\u2014one that left even Wanda a bit hesitant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach acting as a great doughy sandbag, pinning her down to the couch under the weight of her copious excess flesh, the bottom-heavy mutant was very apprehensive about straining herself to lean forward for even more. Even with her telepathy, Wanda felt that she needed a bit of a breather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point during the meal\u2014<i>probably</i> before the button on her last pair of jeans shot off\u2014Wanda\u2019s stomach had swollen out from underneath the red sweater she\u2019d struggled to pull down over her heaving heft. As she\u2019d eaten herself to capacity, her belly had puffed up and up throughout the day until it was this angry white blob, pinning her down on the couch. Her fat, atrophied legs kicked to the side of her gullet as it distended outwards (having slowly pushed the zipper down to reveal her deep, cavernous belly button) Wanda was beginning to feel a <i>bit</i> full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re living the dream.\u201d Janet scarfed down her pitiful attempt at keeping up (the second of three foot-long chili dogs for the evening) and phrased her complaint between bites, \u201cI totally get it now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the two weeks that Janet had suddenly (almost <i>violently</i>) become attuned to Wanda\u2019s wavelength as far as remorseless gluttony went, she\u2019d already looked to have gotten softer. The formerly svelte (aside from the fairly recent addition of a pot-belly) super hero already looked to be adding pounds and inches in a few key places. It wasn\u2019t imperceptible, as of now, but Wanda didn\u2019t doubt that if she continued as she had been, her roommate would become quite round in the near future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the more concerning\u2014in these brief moments of clarity for her\u2014considering that up until two weeks ago, Janet had been her most stalwart champion of dieting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do?\u201d Wanda raised a proud eyebrow, skeptical of Janet\u2019s claim, \u201cEnlighten me\u2014<i>why</i> are we eating so much?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause this whole superhero, tight costume, media coverage thing\u2026 it\u2019s so <i>stressful</i>!\u201d Janet declared confidently, kicking her feet up and rolling back into the sofa with a happy smirk as she chomped on the rest of her chili dog, \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to just <i>indulge</i> yourself\u2014you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda did know\u2014all of what Janet had been saying was true. But that was <i>not</i> why she\u2019d been overeating. Truth be told (long string of misfortunes that she called her autobiography aside) even <i>Wanda</i> wasn\u2019t entirely sure what had turned the foremost member of the scantily-clad bathing-suit spandex club into \u201cthe Fat Avenger\u201d. She\u2019d simply gotten fat, she\u2019d supposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in another lifetime (perhaps, in one of the many alternate universes and futures) she might have simply accepted Janet\u2019s answer as one different from her own reason to indulge. A reason to let go\u2014far be it from her to suggest that there was only <i>one</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut something about this\u2026 didn\u2019t seem quite right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuite, yes.\u201d Wanda\u2019s mind percolated on something other than food for the first time in far too long, those deductive skills that formed the superheroine\u2019s most powerful tool in-costume having gotten rusty since she\u2019d effectively gone into retirement, \u201cJanet\u2014what would you say if I said that I needed some air?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d say I wouldn\u2019t be surprised.\u201d The Wasp snorted, \u201cYou\u2019ve barely left the couch since we moved in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda winced. The fact that Janet had been holding back in her commentary about Wanda\u2019s weight hadn\u2019t become more apparent until Janet herself began to \u201clet go\u201d. The more time they spent together, the more time she got comfortable and identified with Wanda\u2019s new outlook, the more Janet seemed to put her foot in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf that was a position she could even do anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, well\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda\u2019s body glowed red as she used her Hex magic to propel herself to a standing position (her knees wobbled horribly\u2014the added weight of her epic meal had thrown her off balance) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m heading out for a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuit yourself!\u201d Janet chirped happily from her (soon to be) permanent position on the couch, \u201cThink about what you want for dinner, okay? I know you like that Chinese place in Hell\u2019s Kitching. What\u2019s say we order out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds\u2026\u201d Wanda\u2019s stomach grumbled, having been conditioned to groan wantingly at the mere mention of food, \u201c\u2026excellent, honestly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling towards the door (far too fat to use the skylight, she\u2019d quickly outgrown it once they\u2019d move in) Wanda huffed and puffed her way towards the elevator that led down to the lobby. As the door shut magically behind her, Janet could only lick her lips\u2014a crimson glow flashing in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore for me.\u201d She said with a greedily lick of her lips, opening her mouth wide to christen her third chili dog\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now though, whilst enjoying the air conditioning with her hands full of her own belly, Wanda heard familiar voices behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWanda? Is that you?\u201d called out Sharon Carter, a glimmer of excitability in her voice in contrast to her fellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were allowed back yet, Maximoff\u201d sneered Maria Hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly cutting her belly rub short and forcefully tugging on her still unbuttoned jeans with a faint red mist, Wanda addressed the two women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I just wanted to drop by, see how everyone is doing\u201d purred the brunette as she composed herself before turning to face her colleagues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s so good to see you\u201d smiled Sharon \u201cand you look so good!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon wasn\u2019t usually the bitchy type, Wanda recalled, but the comment about her appearance threw her.<br>\r\nThat was before she caught a proper glimpse of the two agents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlongside Sharon\u2019s usual characteristic pleasantness, Wanda also recalled both women being classically svelte.<br>\r\nThat wasn\u2019t the case now though.<br>\r\nAlthough both sported taut pot bellies under their formal office attire, the similarities split from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a much sunnier personality, Sharon had a bounce in her step, or at least her ass, as great flaring hips accented her lower half and were accompanied by wobbling thighs and a heavily padded rear.<br>\r\nHer face also looked rounder as her flowing blonde locks framed plump cheeks resembling her thinner self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHill, on the other hand, possessed an all-round largeness that outweighed her colleague noticeably.<br>\r\nAlthough also bottom heavy like Sharon, Maria was heavier downstairs with an escaping bulge of belly fat rolling out of her button shirt and against her meaty thighs.<br>\r\nA full chest dominated her shirt, pulling it tighter than she cared to admit, and only accentuated the parting triangles down her belly.<br>\r\nIn typical Maria Hill style though, the high ranked agent was stony faced even through the flushed look bathing her cheeks from walking and the tightness of her outfit suggested denial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf we\u2019d have known you were coming you could have come to lunch with us\u201d chirped Sharon, carefully placing a hand across the curve of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria went to protest but found herself having to stifle a belch with a clenched fist instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe next time\u201d smiled Wanda, feeling an almost warm sensation inside that felt similar to the friendship she had spawned with Janet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a date, call us!\u201d nodded Sharon before waddling towards the building lift \u201cgoing up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes actually\u201d smiled Wanda as she slowly followed the two women in her own laboured waddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*PING*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, this is our stop\u201d announced Sharon \u201csome of the girls are in the gym on this floor if you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda considered this.<br>\r\nAlthough talking to a more senior member of the team may be better, getting some first hand info seemed just as helpful in seeing if there was any more concerning problems afoot with Janet\u2019s sudden hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a plan\u201d mused Wanda, adjusting her jeans again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst left, big double doors ahead\u201d grunted Maria apparently more occupied with rubbing her own distended belly that she now had on full display with her shirt pulled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks\u201d replied Wanda, still bemused at the size of the two women who had joined her in the lift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a casual glance back, Wanda noticed just how much Sharon and Maria we\u2019re packing in the back.<br>\r\nWith her skirt straining to keep hold of her bloated rear, Sharon certainly had some movement with each step but Agent Hill was definitely the bigger woman as her pants looked fit to burst with strangling panty lines clear as day against the tailored material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda had no time to linger on that thought though, as loud cheering was echoing down the corridor towards her in the direction she was meant to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Sounds promising\u2019 thought Wanda as she pounded down the hall in search of the voices.<br>\r\nThey didn\u2019t provide what the witch had expected though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the word \u2018gymnasium\u2019 still stood proud over the double doors of the room, the women inside were doing less than intense workouts as Wanda approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWanda!\u201d squealed the familiar voice of Jessica Drew who, after a stream of grunts and groans, came running at Wanda and swallowed her in a hug.<br>\r\nRun was an over-generous term for the arachnid hero as her bulging belly had dragged her towards Wanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s been so long and you look amazing!\u201d cooed Drew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks?\u201d replied a confused Wanda.<br>\r\n\u2018This definitely isn\u2019t right\u2019 thought Wanda, recalling the weeks of teasing that Jessica Drew of all people had thrown her way for her weight gain.<br>\r\nNow though, the same woman looked pregnant and then some again with a face coated in chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, you\u2019ve got to eat with us!\u201d shouted Drew as she waddled back from where she had come from, belly bouncing wildly with each step.<br>\r\nWanda followed slowly with a feeling of unease as she looked over the other women before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrew had just dumped herself back into a seated position allowing her belly to pool in her lap with a starved look in her eyes.<br>\r\nJessica Jones, although equally fattened around her middle, possessed the largest chest Wanda had seen heavily resting on her stomach, stretching her T-shirt.<br>\r\nThe emerald skinned beauty that was She-Hulk was quite a sight, silently inhaling food by the fist full into her ballooning hourglass figure with no sign of muscle on her thickened frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn unexpected face to one side of the crowd was Romanoff who, with a rapidly disappearing cheesecake in hand, looked like a swollen shadow of her former self, spherical and soft stomach perched on rounded thighs in a shockingly short vest top and panties betraying her decent into engorged gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the other girls began to lift various food items to Wanda as she passed, her powers slowly scooping them up and bringing them to her mouth as they had done for weeks, an unexpected saviour announced itself over the Tower announcement system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould the Wicked Witch of the Red please come to Lord Stark\u2019s office, please\u201d came the smooth tones of Tony Stark, quipping as usual in his summons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww damn it\u201d groaned Jessica Drew through a mouthful of nachos \u201ccome back here once you\u2019re done yeah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh\u201d nodded Wanda, opting to float herself back out of the room rather than turn her great pale mass manually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Should have floated here\u2019 complained Wanda in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Wanda, I\u2019ve got a problem and I hope you can help\u201d called out Stark as Wanda entered his office, catching her protruding belly with the door as she closed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope so, I have a problem of my own\u201d replied Wanda, finding a chair that groaned under her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure we can help each other\u201d smiled Tony honestly \u201canyway, I\u2019d dare say you are a fan of Chinese food right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?...\u201d<br>\r\nWanda was nervous as to what Stark wanted now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Pepper has got an insane craving for it lately and I wanted your advise\u201d<br>\r\nWith a few delicate swipes on his personal hologram, the billionaire brought up numerous shop fronts before flicking it into the space between himself and Wanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich of these takeouts would be the best investment if I was to buy it?\u201d asked Stark, leaning back in his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question knocked Wanda back, she certainly hadn\u2019t expected to be asked for an opinion given how she was hardly on active duty, even if the subject was in conflict with her original reason for coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you ask me Chang\u2019s is always a good bet, failing that Golden Wing is a personal favourite\u201d mused Wanda whilst biting her plump lip softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I never would have guessed those\u201d mused Tony, eyes flicking with mental calculations.<br>\r\n\u201cOk well that\u2019s great, thanks a lot Wanda\u201d smiled Stark warmly \u201cwhat can I help you with today then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s a bit tricky really, I...\u201d<br>\r\nWanda found herself cut off by the sound of Tony\u2019s phone buzzing.<br>\r\nInstinctively, he swiped it up and read the received message quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, erm...you don\u2019t happen to know a good Mexican as well do you?\u201d asked the billionaire sincerely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda sighed before a deep seated stomach rumble disturbed her.<br>\r\nThe sound didn\u2019t go unnoticed by Stark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about you, me and Pepper go get some lunch and we can do some proper research, yeah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Wanda could properly consider the question though, Tony was already ushering her out of his office and organising the collection of Pepper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018What is going on with people lately?!\u2019 questioned Wanda, none the wiser to her original problem.</span></div></div>",

Hey there girl!\u201d<br>\r\nWanda had to smile a little as the waitress addressed her, after all, she\u2019d been there enough times to get friendly with the staff.<br>\r\n\u201cYour usual table then?\u201d smiled the chubbIER hostess as she rounded the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018She\u2019s put on weight too?!\u2019 thought Wanda, taking a glance around the parlour and realising that every female customer also looked larger then she recalled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually no\u201d interjected Tony \u201cwe\u2019re meeting Pepper Potts here\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTony?\u201d called out a familiar voice, the sound of which immediately elevated Tony\u2019s mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey hon\u201d smiled Tony as he closed the gap between them immediately, embracing Pepper tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cburp...ooph, hey\u201d purred Pepper with a radiant half smile \u201ccould I get a refill please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing Potts\u201d responded Tony with a wink as he parted from his partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Wanda, how are you?\u201d asked Pepper with a slight turn towards the bulbous brunette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood thanks, you?\u201d returned Wanda politely, sensing she knew the answer already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m well\u201d smiled Pepper with an almost coy laughter following.<br>\r\nShe certainly looked well in one form or another anyway and she apparently knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll her usual decorum was set to one side it seemed and, in lieu of her usually sophisticated formal attire and suits, Pepper was dressed like any girl struggling to fit in clothes with a clinging long sleeve T-shirt and sweat pants to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Janet could testify to from her visit weeks before, Pepper was definitely a little bottom heavy. Now though, she was less \u2018little\u2019 and more \u2018heavy\u2019 as, even in her sweats, the plumpness of her ass was clear in size and shape. Her thighs even looked to be doing their best to fill her sweats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as ill fitting clothes choices went though, her shirt was definitely behind the curve, looking painted on to her thick double belly with every inch betrayed by tightness.<br>\r\nA bulging muffin top crowned her hips looking ready to pour out over her waistband whilst a larger chest was betrayed by clear cup lines across her front and cutting strap lines around her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou hungry then Wanda coz I am starving\u201d purred Pepper, cradling her belly as an angry growl escaped indicating her hungry status despite already tackling any number of desserts before her company had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda knew deep down there were bigger things at play, but this place was her kryptonite, and she wasn\u2019t footing the bill for once...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know I\u2019m a billionaire and all that but I\u2019m kinda glad I only have to keep one of you girls fed\u201d mused Tony as another empty tray was taken from the table in time for another to replace it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you\u2019re fine sweetie\u201d purred Pepper, grabbing a large sundae dish of gelato and a dinner plate sized brownie piled with ice cream \u201cI do your accounts remember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony nodded with a smirk, of course she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the table sat Wanda who, despite best intentions, had eaten her fair share and, like her red headed accomplice, didn\u2019t appear to be slowing down any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Tony for all this\u201d smiled Wanda with ice cream splattered across her full lips, the characteristic food swarm swirling her brunette locks and periodically flying to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are most welcome Wanda, any time\u201d replied Tony without any hesitation \u201cit\u2019s good to see you\u2019re doing better now\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Better\u2019 seemed a strange term with her doming belly on show but she could accept the compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if you want, I can have a word with the powers that be and see if we can get you reinstated at the tower\u201d suggested Tony almost in passing, only with eyes for Pepper as she glutted down more and more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda stopped still, food included at the revelation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, really?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah totally, everyone is happy to see you and your mood is improving drastically so I don\u2019t see why not\u201d announced Stark \u201cI can but try anyway\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u201d muttered Wanda to herself \u201cthat would be pretty great\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd we can do this way more often!\u201d beamed Pepper after swallowing a large bite of brownie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat WOULD be great\u201d smiled Wanda, resuming her own eating at that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell leave it with me and I\u2019ll see what I can do\u201d asserted Tony \u201cnow, do you ladies want some dessert?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been eating dessert for the past hour Tony\u201d glowered Pepper with her trademark stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, never mind then\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNono, i\u2019ll go for some more\u201d pleaded Pepper, stifling a burp as she leaned against Tony, her fuller belly rolling out from under her overtaxed shirt for the first time and resting against Tony\u2019s leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you insist\u201d teased Tony before standing \u201cWanda?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch pondered for a moment, almost reluctant given how much she had already eaten.<br>\r\nThat said, she really couldn\u2019t resist even if she tried.<br>\r\nNot that she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, if that\u2019s ok\u201d purred Wanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony just nodded before heading off to order again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Tony walk off, Pepper straightened herself in her seat with a warm smile placing both hands on her middle and softly squeezed her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeels good doesn\u2019t it?\u201d cooed Pepper, biting her lip a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm?\u201d grunted Wanda, mouth full of ice cream again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeing full, feels good doesn\u2019t it?\u201d repeated Pepper, a touch more sultry tone in her voice the second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda hadn\u2019t really thought about it before, despite spending weeks on end being full, but now given the chance to think about it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...yeah it does\u201d returned Wanda with her own smile.</span></div></div>",

To be social and talk with her fellow Avengers, to hobknob with the other superheroes between crises that threatened to tear reality apart? To take a load off and decompress after the stressful life of a superhero had taken its toll? In all honesty, Wanda was more surprised than anyone that she found herself socializing with the super circle after she\u2019d slipped so precariously close to the deep end (yet again) with nothing in the way of repercussions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead of her getting back on the same page as everyone else\u2014as her hiatus from heroism was meant to do\u2014it had done quite the opposite. Instead, it seemed like the world had aligned itself with Wanda since she\u2019d been gone! Tummies bulged and spandex squealed as the figures of femme fatales around the globe seemed to swell and swell at an uncontrollable pace. Appetites grew in line with the bellies that filled them as figures widened and BMI\u2019s soared! Wanda\u2019s hunt for answers would take her to every corner of the marvelous universe if it had to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProvided that there were lunch breaks, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you up and around again, Wanda.\u201d Sue Richards\u2019s chubby cheeks bunched, her blue eyes shining as she skewered a piece of sushi with her chopsticks, \u201cI\u2019d heard that you weren\u2019t doing so hot from the grapevine and, well\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI assure you, Mrs. Richards, I am feeling wonderful.\u201d Wanda fumbled with the chopsticks a bit<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe extra-dimensional cuisine made from ingredients that could only be found in the labs of one Dr. Reed Richards had seen to improving Wanda\u2019s mood tremendously. Leave it to Mr. Fantastic himself to find the most wonderful ingredients in the universe. Or the next. Or the space <i>between</i> universes\u2026 Sue was one <i>lucky</i> woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good\u2014Reed was certain that there was a chance of you\u2026 <i>altering reality</i> or something.\u201d Sue scoffed, her chipmunk cheeks rolling against her double chin, \u201cHonestly, he\u2019s such a worrywart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue grunted as she leaned into her stomach, her pretty face creasing in mild frustration as she struggled against her incredible bulk. Frowning all the way down into what looked like a third chin, Sue began to sweat as her hammy arms trembled under their own atrophy and weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>allow me, mrs. richards.</i>\u201d said one of the many flying drones that buzzed about their dining area<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you H.E.R.B.I.E.\u201d Sue puffed weakly, settling back into her Thing-sized dining chair with a husky grunt, \u201cWanda, can I get you anything?\u201d:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo thank you\u2014I can get it myself.\u201d Wanda smiled, coating the Negative Zone\u2019s finest sushi in a bright red glow and hovering it over to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you change your mind, just talk to one of Reed\u2019s robots.\u201d Sue took one hand from her meal and gestured to the veritable swarm of H.E.R.B.I.E. drones piddling about the room\u2014mostly providing seconds for what was already looking to be a rather promising meal\u2014\u201cI dare say they\u2019re even better hosts than I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue laughed and rested a hand on her gigantic stomach as it poured towards the floor, rubbing an acre of it affectionately as she resumed her dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn hindsight, the fact that she\u2019d come to Sue Richards to ask whether or not she\u2019d noticed anything strange about the other women on the Avengers roster seemed pretty silly. Looking at her, she was perhaps one of the most changed women of all! All belly, practically pinned to her seat and treated like a queen by hovering robots, dining on the finest cuisine that any universe had to offer\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda didn\u2019t know if she was more confused or jealous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father might not have liked the idea of his daughter dining with the X-Men\u2014truth be told, she never really much cared for the lot of them. Any time she got involved in X-business, it never ended well for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose we <i>have</i> gotten a bit lax with our training regime.\u201d Ororo said with a pointed little grumble as she ran her hand up her swollen belly, \u201cBut I assure you\u2014nothing is any stranger in here than it is out there, Wanda.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that she was saying this, wedged in the doorway to Headmistress Pryde\u2019s office, caught by the swell of her monstrous hips, did little to instill Wanda with hope. She had done plenty of business with the weather witch in both of their long, long careers, and she had always been a pillar of self control! But seeing her like this\u2026 sporting a set of thunder thighs loud enough to make Thor blush\u2026 it was concerning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will be happy to let you out\u2026 so that we may begin our\u2026\u201d Storm squeezed futilely at the brown bulge of her blubber as it poured over either side of the doorway, \u201c<i>Luncheon</i>!

The thick bootied mutant felt her chunky legs settle back into place with a quick, unsightly waddle that left her face burning in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Well. Thank you.\u201d Storm sputtered, \u201cPerhaps now we might get a bite to eat? I\u2019d we make haste\u2014for some reason, Rogue has been unable to shake the Blob\u2019s infernal appetite for some time now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Quill, turn the krutakin\u2019 music down\u2014\u201c the talking Raccoon said off-screen, \u201c\u2014<i>Have we noticed anything weird in space?</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeird is a subjective term.\u201d A gruff, buff-looking man in the corner said to his knives, \u201cFor instance\u2014there is a large woman in a red tiara on our communications feed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not so weird.\u201d The raccoon shrugged<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two, shut your pieholes.\u201d Said their captain (and the only person Wanda recognized and was less weirded out by), \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Avengers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda grimaced\u2014her dimples making her round face look that much chubbier.

and I wanted...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I get you ladies anything else today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda\u2019s thought process was cut off by the sudden appearance of Stacey, their regular Sugar and Ice waitress, and the beckoning grumble of Pepper\u2019s hungry stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust in time Stacey\u201d purred Pepper, subconsciously licking her lips \u201ccould I get three dozen muffin tops, two quarts of triple chocolate fudge, one of cookie dough and one salted caramel please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely\u201d smiled Stacey before looking to Wanda \u201canything for you Wanda?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Wanda had chance to respond, Pepper cut in for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s definitely ready for doughnuts and I would bet she\u2019d go for another cheesecake, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda desperately wanted to say no having already devoured a huge amount of food but she was hardly in control of her cravings at the best of times, never mind in Sugar and Ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComing right up!\u201d chirped Stacey before heading off to gather their order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that\u201d insisted Wanda as she looked to her eating buddy.<br>\r\nEven though she and Janet hadn\u2019t moved back to Avengers Tower, Wanda had maintained regular visits with Pepper, in part to sample restaurants for Tony to hoover up but also they found they enjoyed each other\u2019s company.<br>\r\nA company that was proving fatal to their respective waistlines...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was true wherever Wanda seemed to go these days though, and she only saw more as she tried to dig deeper into her investigation of everyone\u2019s sudden weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane Foster and destroyed a bench under her vast bulk when Wanda had gone to find answers from her, given her Asgardian connection, only to discover that Lady Sif had been appointed the Goddess of Feasting with the Valkyrie warrior caste falling in line as her followers, gluttony and all.<br>\r\nWanda couldn\u2019t help herself from thinking that Foster seemed to have fallen in line with such a deity as she had left the good doctor glutting herself without restraint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slight change of tact, Wanda had opted to visit Doctor Strange and, although he proved to be as normal as any other man these days, he also reported that all women bound to a sanctum was gaining weight across the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Stacey who, to the best of Wanda\u2019s knowledge, possessed no superhuman abilities, was gaining weight quite spectacularly with a thick roll of belly fat on display today and a blossoming chest stretching her work shirt to its limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it\u201d purred Pepper in response to Wanda\u2019s pitiful dismissal of food \u201cthe stuff here is too good to miss out on, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018She wasn\u2019t wrong\u2019 thought Wanda, hungrily licking her own lips without realising as their food approached in the arms of their fattened waitress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I tell her, whoever pops the least targets pays for lunch\u201d explains Sharon Carter whilst two-handing a thick burger into her mouth, grease glistening on her lips and cheeks \u201cand that\u2019s how big shot Agent Hill over there came to pay for my lunch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde\u2019s goading tease fell by the wayside though as Maria Hill was far too concentrated on stuffing her own face like she\u2019d never eaten before even with both women sat as a clear testament to the exact opposite of that sentiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn keeping with her early gains, Carter\u2019s face had continued to fill out unlike most women that Wanda had come into contact with, and was deep in double chin territory with plump flushed cheeks to match.<br>\r\nHer arms were thicker as well as her waist, which was rapidly disappearing under layers of fat, but was most noticeably bottom heavy with great bulges of hip and ass fat squeezing out of the gaps to the sides of her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving started with a sizeable set of hips, Hill\u2019s dimensions had ballooned immensely and, along with her exploding appetite, her whole figure had grown outwards.<br>\r\nCompletely unashamed, or just lacking care entirely, Maria sat with her shirt unbuttoned and cast down her vast sides allowing her spherical belly to bulge out and rest against the table the three women shared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lacy black bra was barely containing her swollen breasts atop her gut whilst her skirt showed signs of tearing up each thickened thigh.<br>\r\nMaria\u2019s rear spread unrestricted, having realised she was too big for the chairs that Sharon currently occupied and opting for a more open bench, showing just how wide the senior agent was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, what did you want Wanda?\u201d asked Sharon politely as she rotated onto a huge steak piled high with chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda had to think, her own eating almost slowing as she considered why she had called this lunch meeting with the two agents before her.<br>\r\nShe knew it had been important but all she could think about was how delicious all this food had been and how much fun she was having with her present company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could catch herself, Wanda found herself answering in a way that seemed more honest then she realised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just wanted to have lunch with you guys\u201d smiled Wanda as she returned with gusto to her own plateful of sliders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon smiled her own plump smile whilst Maria continued to pig out, all manner of ladylike behaviour lost as the dark haired agent brought a plate of pasta to her waiting mouth and poured it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda had to honestly admit that she was actually really enjoying her life at the moment, more so than she ever recalled before.<br>\r\nEven if she was spending her days eating to her hearts content whilst all her friends (because they truly were her friends these days) did the same, Wanda found she didn\u2019t care as the happiness far outweighed that concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough a great number of people had helped her come to this conclusion, there really was only one person who Wanda could be truly grateful to and that was her roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*click*<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m home Janet\u201d called out Wanda as she stepped into the SoHo apartment that she shared with The Wasp.<br>\r\nAlthough it could never compare to the swaths of technology back at Avengers Tower, or even the luxury they had there, the apartment had become home and Wanda wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d shouted the familiar hyperactive voice of Janet van Dyne from the living room the pair shared \u201chave you got the food?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda laughed, it still knocked her sideways slightly hearing Janet\u2019s enthusiasm being pointed at food so distinctly even after all this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have some of it yes, the rest will be up in a moment\u201d mused Wanda as she opened a nearby window ready to allow the rest of the first wave of food into the apartment as she floated it up the side of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank god because I am starving\u201d cheered Janet.<br>\r\nWanda would have found it easier to believe if Janet hadn\u2019t clearly been speaking through a mouthful of food at that moment.<br>\r\nAs a hero known for her ability to shrink, Janet was also a ways off being a starvation risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter weeks convincing Wanda to drop some weight and her then sudden change in attitude that has sparked Wanda\u2019s now waiting investigation, Janet had become one of Wanda\u2019s biggest bad influences with her electric charisma and sudden gluttony bundled up into one huge pear shaped bombshell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver fashion conscious, Janet was clad in an outfit that wouldn\u2019t have gone amiss in a gym comprising of three quarter length leggings and a cropped workout top, not that she had seen a gym any time recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she awkwardly twisted her vast hips to avoid getting caught in the kitchen door, Janet waddled towards the sofa with each step causing a great ripple of fat to roll through her enormous arse cheeks as the tight grey material was unable to hold her in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer exposed belly, spilling over her waistband, also jiggled wildly with a deep belly button situated in the middle of two wobbling rolls making up her thickened trunk, although they were no match for the width of her hips despite swallowing her former tiny self without question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet carelessly dropped herself heavily onto one of the degrading sofas in the living room with a resounding scream from the springs as the hem of her top disappeared under her growing chest whilst she glamorously kicked her chubby toes onto the other seat.<br>\r\nThe action allowed her to recline heavily into the full length of the couch with her sides bunching into rolls of fat whilst her wobbling rear spread gently off the open side of the sofa much to Janet\u2019s internal pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs hunger washed over her, Janet messily tied her hair back into a pony tail that slid between her shoulder blades, the motion giving Wanda an eyeful of her friends arm fat wobbling away as she formed the hairstyle whilst the witch deposited boxes of food into her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBest roommate ever!\u201d declared Janet before diving into the food before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda laughed, depositing herself on her own couch as she also tucked in.<br>\r\nThis really was the life she had craved for, even if it was much fatter than she had anticipated.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For all the irony that it\u2019s worth, Wanda had long considered herself the unluckiest woman on Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven her powerset of probability manipulation, one would have thought that it would have been just the opposite. But despite all of the misfortune that seemed to follow her around\u2014the same misfortune that had sent her spiraling in and out of deep depressions over the course of her life and career as a superhero\u2014the Scarlet Witch had found herself feeling contented for the first time in a long time since she\u2019d donned her shiny red tiara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time spent with her fellow, former, and frequently feasting friends would do well to dull the slowly softening voice in the back of her mind that told her something wasn\u2019t quite right. The way things were now, through the influential lenses of a collective appetite and laziness, slowly became the new normal. As Wanda dipped her chubby toes into the swelling social circle of softening superheroines, she found that she rather liked how things had changed while she was away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she had a nice apartment, a wonderful roommate, and plenty of friends to hang out with. She hardly had to worry about keeping the world\u2026 or even New York safe anymore! She was free to do whatever she wanted, without any of the stress or judgement that used to weigh so heavily on her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the life she wanted\u2014no, the life she <i>deserved</i> all along!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after she\u2019d put her suspicions to bed, she found herself having a <i>much</i> better time\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFloat me!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet VanDyne held her mouth open, double chin creasing deeply along her swiftly vanishing neck. Her plump lips parted and shone red as Wanda\u2019s magic worked a slice of pizza towards the wonderfully weighty Wasp as she lay on the couch. As the greasy, cheesy triangle from 51st made its way past her lips, she took the smallest lean forward and took a heaving bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou like?\u201d Wanda asked, easily juggling an entire buffet orbiting across the room, \u201cDo you now understand why I use my powers in such a way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour powers are so fucking broken it\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d Janet huffed, scarfing down her slice in record time as another took its place, \u201cReed\u2019s been working on a power sampler\u2014don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d be interested in shrinking down to less than an inch tall?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot on your life.\u201d Wanda tittered, cheeks jiggling, \u201cNow open up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet laid back and let her body run on autopilot\u2014it knew what to do. Admittedly, it felt strange to not have to move her arms. As they hung uselessly at her side, Janet found her chubby little hands cradling her stomach as a lazy river of greasy New York takeout found its way into her belly\u2026She could understand Wanda\u2019s newfound habit of resting her hands on the top of her belly. It felt so natural\u2014so right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore.\u201d Janet grunted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I fed you any faster, you\u2019d explode.\u201d Wanda sniffed, \u201cUse your hands, you lazy little bug.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on, you said you\u2019d feed me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I did\u2014you\u2019re just a little piggy.\u201d Wanda stuck out her tongue<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWanda!\u201d Janet whined, \u201cI\u2019m hungry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda ignored her roommates pleas, shifting heavily on the groaning couch beneath her. She leaned on one of her elephantine hips, struggling to wriggle her way to a more comfortable position. She grunted, heaving like a hog in heat as she struggled against the weight of her own sandbag stomach. Even using her magic, it was hard to find a comfortable angle. Her belly started to sag off of the couch no matter how she sat now, and it could get a little unpleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressed in a pair of gray sweatpants and a large red t-shirt (the Avengers logo distorted to fit the curvature of her colossal left boob) Wanda couldn\u2019t have looked more lazy. Her thick brown hair up, Wanda\u2019s face was crowned with a thick hanging double chin that met along the crest of her cheeks. Her proud, prominent Romani features were buried under ample amounts of pale ivory chub\u2014her superior, haughty nose and the pinkness of her chipmunk cheeks made her look that much more like the pig she\u2019d become through and through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as she reclined on her couch\u2014stomach sagging low, and drooping off of the side, she reclined like royalty as her probability powers pampered her in every way that she deserved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou pig.\u201d Janet huffed as her jetstream of calories died down, \u201cCouldn\u2019t you at least <i>try</i> to pretend you want to share?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, fine.\u201d Wanda waved a useless, chubby hand as the orbit around Janet increased, \u201cAre you happy yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet couldn\u2019t speak, she was too busy alternating bites from this meal and that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Wanda took her throaty moans of pleasure as a resounding \u201cyes\u2014more please!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went on, it became clear to even the most skeptical of superheroines (if there had been any left) that the mysterious expansion that had gripping them all wouldn\u2019t vanish as quickly as it had occurred. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Wanda and Janet\u2019s apartment especially, there was a constant and steady influx of food. There was an almost constant influx of food going into one stomach or the other, in the most literal fashion that such a sentence could be expressed. Between Janet\u2019s habit of sleep-eating and Wanda\u2019s habit of sleep snack-pilfering from the world down below, some days were a literal constant barrage of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo globular cheeks stretched a pair of black and yellow sweatpants thin, shiftling slowly and uncontrollably beneath their thick padding. Janet\u2019s back rolls wobbled with every thudding step as she lumbered around the apartment. Her fat belly poured out from over the waistband of the biggest pair of sweatpants the fashionista had ever owned, rolling in a pale roll of blubber that bobbed with every heaving step. Her hair was up, and her makeup was off\u2014a sure sign of another \u201cgirl\u2019s day\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand came to rest tenderly beneath her belly\u2014she hefted a sizable portion of it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No more diets</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt rang over and over again in her head, echoing in the back of her mind. Janet had just loved the idea of giving in and letting loose. It had been so much fun. She needed it. She deserved it! Every pound, every inch, she had earned them all through years of tireless Avenging and saving the universe. Being the Wasp was hard work after all\u2014it was only right that she get to <i>reward</i> herself\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll order a little something <i>extra</i> for myself\u2026\u201d Janet drooled as she fumbled with her phone\u2014fat fingers pushing incorrect buttons\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After all... it's not like I'm on a <i>diet</i> or anything...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Reality is often a strange thing\u2014Wanda, being who she was, had learned to accept that from a young age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven the probability manipulation powers that had been bestowed upon her, she had seen some pretty strange things over the course of her life. So much so that, when things were often at their strangest, she hardly felt phased. Perhaps, even when she should have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Wanda\u2019s deeply buried senses of logic, reason, and moderation, the sensation of having her hips brush against the doorway to her apartment had failed to register as unusual to her. In this new world of indulgence, gluttony, and appetites run amok, the only thing that she felt was slightly uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGee Wanda\u2014we\u2019re gonna have to have you cut back!\u201d Janet said playfully as she watched her roommate struggle in the doorway, \u201cYou\u2019re getting kinda porky!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she\u2019d said this while wrist-deep in a bucket of takeout fried chicken. The idea that anyone in this world that Wanda had (inadvertently) created would even consider a diet was laughable. Janet was only teasing in a way filtered by Wanda\u2019s wreckless need to indulge would allow her to. She grabbed a palmful of Wanda\u2019s billowing belly blubber as it sagged towards the floor, and gave it a good shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Wanda\u2014bottomless as she\u2019d allow herself to become\u2014took it in great stride. A simple wiggle of her fingers, and the doorway was widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy hadn\u2019t she been using her powers of probability in such a way before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as if, all of the sudden, all of Wanda\u2019s problems had melted away. As soon as she\u2019d accepted the strangeness that was her newfound reality (and given the strangeness of her <i>old</i> reality, that was really saying something!) things seemed so much clearer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy struggle?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy work hard?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy not <i>indulge</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything that she\u2019d ever wanted in life was coming true. She was happy, she was content, she had circles of friends that invited her out every hour of every day. More importantly, she was <i>hungry</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda\u2019s subconscious was running rampant, synapses firing in the presence of all this immediate gratification. Her pleasure centers were out of control entirely as she worked her magic (literally and figuratively) on every bite of food she could get her grubby little grabbers on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No more\u2026</i> she\u2019d whisper to herself, hovering barely an inch over her bed, <i>No more diets\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every casting the spell grew more and more intense, further changing the world around her until it better matched with what she subconsciously desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very concept of diets faded from the minds of women world-over, until all that was left was a desire to indulge mindlessly, shamelessly, and endlessly. The world changed to suit her needs, the world changed to the dancing steps of her chubby little fingertips, twitching as she slept hanging heavily in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No more diets</i> she repeated endlessly, food floating around her, <i>No more diets no more diets no more diets\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the madness mantra left her lips, Wanda\u2019s eyes rolled. A familiar sensation overcame her, deep within her pillowy thighs. Electricity spiked, traveling up her spine as her breathing became shallow and hoarse. Her tongue lolled out as her thighs clenched tightly together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026\u201d she panted, as her base desires shaped her mental frame, <i>\u201dYes</i>\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms far too short (or rather, her belly far too big) for her to appease herself <i>traditionally</i>, Wanda\u2019s edible orbit began to take flight into her mouth. Still sound asleep, she began to change the world once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo more diets\u2026\u201d she mumbled through bite upon bite of gratification, her spherical shape doming in the eye of an edible storm as her subconscious desires took hold\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Be a sweetie and bring me some more burritos would you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe faintly robotic response came from behind the projection making it muffled but Pepper\u2019s smile indicated the response was positive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, is Wanda there?\u201d asked Pepper, patting her vast two tiered stomach as she continued to inhale burritos interspersed with whole slices of chocolate cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe should be through, the smell is enough if she\u2019s gone deaf since I last spoke to her\u201d smiled Janet as she heard movement in the kitchen \u201cand here she comes\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all that Janet had sped through dress sizes, Wanda was a whole different entity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst Janet are in her sleep, Wanda had taken to gorging constantly, particularly after her epiphany in her bedroom and things had been quite extensive from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough her powers would certainly allow it, Wanda took some delight in walking around when she could, and the small trip from the kitchen to the living room was one such trip for the greatly engorged witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith great puffed cheeks, Wanda\u2019s fuller but recognisable face appeared in the doorway, her hair actually done in an almost reminiscent style of bouncing curls, it was apparent just how much of an impact her epiphany had had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, Wanda was practically spherical aside from a sizeable indent around her waist where remnants of figure could be argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs was to be expected with Janet as a roommate, fashion had changed for Wanda and, after a great deal of searching, Janet had acquired a huge pair of sweats that were hiked up over Wanda\u2019s great belly hang almost to her hips, concealing her belly button and restraining the great mass of belly leading her walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsurprisingly, her thighs had thickened to great proportions due to staying on her ass for weeks on end, but her calves had also become fatter, merging into ankles and equally fat feet which heavily trudged forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Wanda, I am starving!\u201d groaned Janet as she resisted reaching into the nearest bag barely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know Jan, I\u2019m coming...hey Pepp\u201d grunted Wanda as she felt her momentum halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey hun, you look so good!\u201d cooed Pepper with a hint of yearning whilst cramming more food into her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me Potts, she eats so much more than me\u201d complained Janet with a faux tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery...funny...\u201d grunted Wanda again, suddenly aware of a great pressure around her hips and noticed the doorway had once again halted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww no, you stuck again babes?\u201d purred Janet with a wry smile as she eyed her roommate pawing at the doorframe whilst her huge gut bulged against the door and her sweats in great fat rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna leave you girls to it, need all your concentration getting a woman THAT big out of a hole that small\u201d announced Pepper before closing off the call just as Jocasta appeared on the edge of the screen, laden with a mountain of fried Mexican food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTut tut Wanda, I think we really are going to have to start cutting you off just a little\u201d teased Janet as she sashayed towards Wanda, snatching up a bucket of chicken as she passed the pile of food in the middle of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt you could if you tried\u201d groaned Wanda, pushing against the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue\u201d spoke Janet, her mouth full of greasy chicken \u201cwouldn\u2019t mind trying though\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure\u201d retorted Wanda with a touch of bite, still stuck but hungrier than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m gonna start eating if it\u2019s all the same to you\u201d purred Janet, tossing her now empty bucket to one side and sweeping another and a large pizza to replace it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u201d grunted Wanda as her eyes flickered red, a half dozen cartons of Chinese food popping open allowing it to float towards the trapped witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo fair!\u201d complained Janet through a mouthful of cheesy bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda smirked as she opened her mouth lazily, chewing on the torrent of noodles swimming into her mouth.<br>\r\nJanet looked to her friend as the flow of food passed her lips and she couldn\u2019t help but notice the way Wanda\u2019s belly dominated the doorframe she was stuck in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrazy how...HUGE you are Wanda\u201d mused Janet and, without thinking, she grabbed Wanda\u2019s belly with both hands and kneaded the doughy mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda instinctively moaned at the touch and her food stream sped up as her eyes rolled back slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you like that huh?\u201d cooed Janet playfully as she squeezed more fat in her own chubby fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda\u2019s moaning only intensified with her food stream whilst, unexpectedly, a second followed close behind, circling Janet\u2019s head and delivered itself between The Wasp\u2019s full lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoph Wanda\u201d cooed Janet, not relenting in her grouping of her roommates belly \u201cyou\u2019ll make us BOTH fat doing this\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda\u2019s eyes rolled back more at the comment which only seemed to increase the pace of food pouring into Janet\u2019s mouth, silencing her in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs both women mindlessly ate the food floating into their mouths, one groping the other as she was trapped in the doorframe, silence fell over the flat aside from the sounds of eating.<br>\r\nWhilst Janet gorged in food euphoria, Wanda was on a whole different level of enjoyment which made the moment the doorframe snapped open a few more inches enough to allow Wanda through even more surprising for both as Wanda came crashing down on top of Janet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChewing, winded and squashed together, things could only go one way...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Probability, and the manipulation thereof, is a strange thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImagine, if you will, a deck of cards. Every time you draw a card, you remove one out of fifty-two possibilities from the stacked odds. This is probability, and Wanda\u2019s powerset means that she is in all but complete control of what card rises to the top when the need arises. What\u2019s more, with a little application of her uncanny abilities, she can remove any and all cards from the deck that don\u2019t suit her needs. So, to put it plainly anyone with Wanda\u2019s abilities as the Scarlet Witch would have the ability to, for all intents and purposes, play blackjack with the deck face-up, and to be able to remove any cards that they didn\u2019t want in play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since this dietary travesty had begun, Wanda had been slowly pulling two\u2019s and three\u2019s from the deck in play. Getting rid of things that didn\u2019t suit her, like restraint and willpower. Soon the four\u2019s and five\u2019s came in the form of judgment, were removed from play, followed by the fives and sixes, until all that she was left with was a royal family in every suite and an ace to match\u2014in essence, Wanda had slowly but surely been stacking the deck so that the universe around her catered to the pleasure centers of the brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now that immediate gratification had all but encompassed the increasingly strong impulses of her mind\u2014food, fat, and the female form were all fair game. Her complicated feelings towards her own rapidly expanding, increasingly (and exceedingly) spherical shape meant that Wanda was just as ready to appreciate the softness of Janet VanDyne\u2019s lips as she was the softness of her hips. Or of her belly. Of her arms. Her inner thighs\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe long and short of it was, what Wanda wanted, Wanda got\u2014and that meant that she and Janet had just kissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling had been long building within Wanda\u2019s subconscious. The conflicted feelings towards her own fat, combined with her piggish desire to eat and continue to eat with reckless abandon, had manifested themselves as some complicated feelings towards her own rapidly and outrageously expanding body. Her innate desire to feed meant that she would only continue to grow, and soon that had been enough. With every bite, every pound, her subconscious self equated her girth with beauty. And so, too, had everyone else. As the world expanded around Wanda, she came to feel far more at home with the super-sized superheroines than she had with their skinny minny counterparts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Wanda\u2026 well, it had been a <i>long</i> time since she and Hank had divorced. She was due a little action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God.\u201d She panted, \u201cWanda, I\u2026 I am so sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, just\u2026\u201d the Scarlet Witch gasped, out of breath as her mind worked faster than it had since this whole debacle began, \u201cI\u2026 I want to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two fat women proceeded to lock lips once more. Wanda pressed herself as hard against the smaller woman as she could manage. Their collective weight left Janet\u2014who\u2019d been squished by the weighty witch\u2014breathless until Wanda decided to roll onto the hardwood floors of their SoHo apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was a confusing, but satisfying affair between the two \u201cretired\u201d superheroines. Hands traced ludicrously fat forms, rubbing acres of flab and squeezing handfuls of jiggling jelly as they came to terms with what was occurring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wasp and the Scarlet Witch were making out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo incredibly out of shape, more or less unrecognizable versions of them, but the point still remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026. You\u2019re a very good kisser.\u201d Wanda said finally, parting from Janet\u2019s plump pink lips breathing heavy, \u201cI\u2026 I am surprised that you\u2026 find me attractive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an audible pause. Wanda lifted one heavy arm to jiggle a handful of her stomach as it poured over Janet\u2019s less sizable (but no less elephantine) shape<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike this.\u201d She added with a self-hating grimace<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know\u2026 me too.\u201d Janet concluded with a little nod, wrapping her arms around Wanda\u2019s neck and bringing her close, \u201cBut\u2026 I\u2019m not saying no.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them would continue their little love fest on the floor for a good ten minutes. Before long, Wanda\u2019s magic was well at play in hoisting the two of them up without a hint of effort, making it all the more easy for either of the weighty duo to waddle behind closed doors to act on their sudden, instinctive attraction to one another\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to make us both too fat to be superheroes.\u201d Janet panted, her turgid stomach rising high into the air<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are already too fat to save anybody.\u201d Wanda rubbed her roommate\u2019s stellar stomach as it struck high into the air, \u201cWithout stopping to catch our breath a few times, at least.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood thing we\u2019re retired.\u201d Janet burped as a hoagie floated dangerously close to her mouth, coated in red Hex magic, \u201cOr else Cap would make us run laps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOof. I can\u2019t imagine.\u201d Wanda purred, running her hands up and down her own stuffed stomach, \u201cPerhaps you can\u2014imagine me all hot and sweaty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPanting, out of breath.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWanda, this is\u2026\u201d Janet bit her plump bottom lip ,\u201dUnfair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am simply too <i>fat</i> to do anything.\u201d Wanda whined, \u201cI can practically <i>feel</i> myself getting thinner by the minute!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet laughed, jiggling her most recent sexual conquest by the swollen stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRidiculously hungry.\u201d Wanda laughed emptily, her cell-phone floating over to the bedside table, \u201cWhat\u2019s say I order us a little\u2026 <i>celebratory</i> snack?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To see Asgard so indulgent was quite a sight, even by their own standards, but after four days of constant feasting there were signs of tiring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat piles of discarded feast ware and expanses of exposed flesh were indicators enough but that did little to halt the merriment amongst the women of Asgard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look a tad full, oh feasted one\u201d came the gentle voice of Brunnhilde, head of the Valkyrie\u2019s and, amongst other things, Sif\u2019s current lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSif laughed at the comment as she cradled her engorged belly.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not the only one\u201d she teased, planting a light swat against the blonde Asgardian\u2019s exposed thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue\u201d murmured Brunnhilde as she stifled a burp \u201cyou have made your people happy\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese aren\u2019t my people Brun, I only ensure they eat in these fattening times\u201d glared Sif as she tore into a great bird\u2019s leg with juices dripping down her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrunnhilde glossed over the correction as she watched her lover devour the meat, biting her lip as she did.<br>\r\n\u201cThen allow me to ensure you eat in these fattening times\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSif glanced with a much more affectionate look this time as she watched the bulging blonde clamber on top of the table before her, heavily dropping her arse on the golden surface so as to face Sif herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow just relax m\u2019lady\u201d purred Brunnhilde, flicking her blonde plaits over her shoulder before delicately taking an entire serving tray of hog from the table in one arm and feeding Sif with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmph, you are so dutiful\u201d groaned Sif as she pulled apart her robes to expose her great belly, a sight that spurred Brunnhilde on in her doting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything for you\u201d cooed Brunnhilde, using her Asgardian strength to drag Sif\u2019s great chair closer until her belly rested between the blonde\u2019s fattened thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen allow me to return the favour\u201d cooed Sif in return and, with slightly glazed eyes, heaved herself to her feet causing her great belly to sit mostly in Brunnhilde\u2019s lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I am the follower...\u201d protested the blonde and Sif pushed against her, allowing her weight to force the smaller woman down onto her back as she awkwardly climbed on top of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen be quiet and allow the gift of a Goddess to indulge you\u201d responded Sif mockingly as she pressed her weight into Brunnhilde before forcing a great fistful of meat into the blonde\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to speak, the warrior turned acolyte simply tugged at her own robe to expose her engorged hourglass shape, allowing the two lovers to touch skin to skin in their moment of intertwined gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere these less gluttonous times, such a display at the head table of a feast may have caused a scene, but with everyone preoccupied in their own food or romantic twists, no one cared for the two obese women frolicking so publicly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould we not go elsewhere?\u201d panted Brunnhilde, a stickler for decorum at the best of time as she continued to swallow food presented to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u201d announced Sif, allowing herself a heaping handful of food as she spoke we are right where we need to be\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Brunnhilde awkwardly wiggled her hips slightly with an alluring smile as she allowed the moment to just happen to her as the night continued to roll on by.</span></div></div>",

he rose from the elegant seat at the back of the room and began to cross towards his military lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman nodded curtly as she lent awkwardly on her spear whilst hooking a wedgie out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nT\u2019challa, meanwhile, couldn\u2019t help but smirk at the sight<br>\r\n\u201cJust don\u2019t\u201d glared Okoye as she straightened herself and turned, beginning a slow trudge into the corridor outside the throne room.<br>\r\n\u201cOh I wouldn\u2019t dare\u201d teased the African king as he drew level with and then, with some playful force, punched Okoye in the meaty ham like arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former general grumbled under her breath as her thick arm wobbled from the punch, much like the great wobble coursing through her thighs, rear and heavily hanging belly as the pair made their way through the palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI notice you have been enjoying the new food\u201d continued T\u2019challa on his teasing nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut it\u201d grunted the huge woman, far past her prime of wielding a spear at this point \u201cI can still run you through\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I am sure\u201d smirked the king \u201cyou know, my sister would be able to get you measured up for a...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkoye knew exactly where this was going.<br>\r\n\u201cI will NOT ride one of those mobility scooters your sister has invented!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you are more than welcome to one if you change your mind\u201d teased T\u2019challa again as two women approached donning badly fitting Dora Milaje uniforms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeneral, the morning feast is prepared\u201d purred Ayo with a coy chew of her lip to the unanimous sound of three hungry bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlready?\u201d grunted Okoye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, isn\u2019t it...delicious?\u201d smiled Ayo again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrgh, fine\u201d relented Okoye with a glance to T\u2019challa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine Okoye, do not starve on my account\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkoye rolled her eyes before meeting with her soldiers, one either side of the superior as the threesome waddled away to indulge again.<br>\r\nAs lacking decorum as it may have been, Okoye had to admit her enjoyment as Aneka, the third soldier in the group, took to kneading a handful of belly fat escaping the general\u2019s uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, with a playful smirk plastered across his face, T\u2019challa pushed the grand double doors open before him to greet his queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, my love\u201d proclaimed T\u2019challa as he crossed the room to the chorus of gluttonous chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhm, gu\u2019mor...*burp* guuth m...BEEEELCH...mhm\u201d<br>\r\nSince arriving in Wakanda and becoming betrothed, Ororo Munroe really had come on in both appetite and girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the weather mutant gorged on the vast mountain of food within flabby arms reach of her own larger throne, T\u2019challa relished in the gluttony before him.<br>\r\nWith her bulbous arse squeezed between and bulging over the arms of her seat, Storm was oblivious as her luscious brown belly hung between vast cellulite covered thighs.<br>\r\nBulging breasts perched on her belly struggling within the confines of an overstretched white dress that parted down her front, leaving all BUT her chest exposed to the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nT\u2019challa was in heaven as he ogled his queen stuffing herself senseless again, chins and figure jiggling with every slob inspired bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry up sis, I am WASTING AWAY!\u201d shouted Medusa as she hunkered into a nest of her own crimson hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt that VERY much\u201d teased Crystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that\u201d grumbled Medusa as she rubbed her angered stomach, a prominent roll of fat bulging out past her pyjama shorts and top as the Inhuman queen fondled the pale skin in her chubby fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I\u2019m coming\u201d sighed Crystal as heavy thudding steps indicated her return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh thank god\u201d salivated Medusa as she wiggled in her \u2018hair nest\u2019, moving slightly and spreading the extent to allow for her sister to climb in beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a peach\u201d smiled Crystal as she managed to seat herself, great hips taking up more space than Medusa had anticipated causing her to will her hair even further than she expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do I always have to get the food anyway?\u201d asked Crystal as she divided up the spoils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause you have the power to keep it all just at the right temperature and...*munch*...you know I can\u2019t be trusted on collecting with THIS hair\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal had to laugh at that one.<br>\r\nOn the first (and only) occasion that Medusa had collected food not a single morsel had made it back to Crystal, with only crumb tangled strands of hair to explain where their entire evening\u2019s plans had gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly though, both girls were guilty of such gluttony, even if they weren\u2019t to blame.<br>\r\nInhumans have incredibly powerful metabolisms after all.<br>\r\nNot that that seemed to be slowing anything down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all the girth around her hips, Crystal wasn\u2019t without some weight above the waist making an impressively full hourglass figure.<br>\r\nFull being the operative term for the strawberry blonde\u2019s great rear peach and eye watering sweater stretchers.<br>\r\nHer waist was rapidly expanding into thick love handles as a squashed two-tier belly was inching out day by day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternatively, Medusa fell into a category of a much more belly dominant persuasion.<br>\r\nWith the majority of her weight settling around her waist and bulging over any waistbands the crimson haired queen managed to squeeze into, Medusa was apple shaped with an apparently genetic rear to rival her sister.<br>\r\nEven with a belly making downward motions to her dimpled knees, the red headed sister possessed little volume upstairs (beside her hair of course) but after some sisterly squabbles she\u2019d learn to live with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the plan tonight sis?\u201d cooed Medusa as she curled her feet into her backside, hair curling away so as to avoid tangles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn answer was far from forthcoming though as Crystal was far too busy tilting a great tub of ice cream to her lips, adding enough elemental energy into the chocolate flavoured dairy to melt it into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa chuckled.<br>\r\n\u201cI like your style sis\u201d crooned Medusa as she grabbed for a huge mixing bowl of just cooked enough cookie dough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that is what a I call a meal...BUUUUURPt\u201d purred Felicia, voice dripping in arousal at her own mighty belch as she massaged her engorged belly, the tidal wave of stretch mark riddled flab surging out of her black cat onesie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I hope you\u2019ve all enjoyed watching me devour the entire menu from Alfonzo\u2019s tonight, because I\u2019ve certainly enjoyed doing it...\u201d<br>\r\nFelicia\u2019s mind wandered as she reminisced on what she had literally just done, licking her plump lips in euphoria, massaging her belly even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...mhm, anyway, don\u2019t forget to tune in in 3 hours when I\u2019ll be seeing how much cheesecake I can pack in here\u201d<br>\r\nAs she spoke, Felicia clumsily used the open flaps of her onesie to lift her belly and heavily dumped it on the desk where her camera was mounted, causing the whole setup to shake violently as her belly spread on the surface.<br>\r\n\u201cStay fat kitty cats!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enormous white haired streamer closed off by flicking up her onesie hood, showing off her cat ears with locks of hair billowing out around her plump cheeks as she slowly blew a kiss to the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrgh, Felicia Hardy is fricking hot\u201d came one lazily excited voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah she is a bit...\u201d came the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there any pizza left MJ?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane Watson awkwardly looked around to no success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah Gwen, you ploughed through that ages ago\u201d replied the redhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamnit\u201d grunted Gwen Stacey as she propped herself against the sofa from her place on the floor \u201cgood job we ordered more like 20 minutes ago huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll say\u201d smirked MJ \u201cyou trying to eat as much as Felicia tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPfft, I wish\u201d retorted Gwen hungrily, daydreaming as she drummed on her own stomach as it bulged over the top of her denim shorts with a line of drool shining her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGwen? Gwen! The pizza\u2019s here!\u201d shouted MJ, breaking through to the blonde next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFood babe, go get\u201d shortened MJ, her own hunger gnawing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, on it\u201d replied Gwen as she pulled herself to her feet causing a ripple of fat to shake through her bloating body.<br>\r\nMJ watched as her friend sauntered to the door, fattened hips swaying, rolls of back fat creasing, cleavage bouncing...<br>\r\n\u2018She would look good as big as Felicia...\u2019 thought MJ as the smell of pizza wafted in towards her \u2018mind you...\u2019<br>\r\nNostrils flaring, MJ groped her own ballooning midsection as she imagined her own engorged figure with her widened booty the only thing outmeasuring her belly<br>\r\n\u2018...I\u2019d look pretty hot that size too\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut yourself down hun otherwise I\u2019ll eat all this myself\u201d grunted Gwen through a greasy mouthful of pizza, sides bunched in sweaty rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm? Oh yeah\u201d purred MJ, sliding a box her way and placing the hot delight in her lap, about to bite in when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*PING*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScore!\u201d screeched Gwen as she grabbed her belly as it poured onto her thick thighs \u201cbutton popped!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Damn...\u2019 thought MJ, biting her lip rather than her pizza<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t we have an ep of van Dyne\u2019s vlog to watch?\u201d asked Gwen, filling her cheeks with pizza again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think so\u201d replied MJ, reaching for the tv remote<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome, keep us going til \u2018Fat Cat\u2019 tonight and Janet is pretty fit too\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure is\u201d nodded MJ as she clenched her fat thighs together at the thought.</span></div></div>",

the door.<br>\r\nWanda\u2019s threat was hollow at best, the girls got a constant stream of food delivered to the apartment, but it was enough of a threat to get the pear shaped women to move at a reasonable pace for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoph...I\u2019m he...*pant*...here babe\u201d panted Janet with her cheeks flushing red as she entered the living room, hips barely clearing the magically widened door as her vast arse cheeks wobbled wildly within the leggings containing them as each chubby foot heavily stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout time\u201d huffed Wanda, swallowing heavily before flicking her wrist and sending a small mountain of food hurtling towards the sofa that Janet would eventually seat herself on...once she\u2019d made her way there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww no magic feeding?\u201d mused Janet as she lumbered one wobbling thigh past the other, causing more ripples of fat to surge through her enormous bottom half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda didn\u2019t reply, opting instead to flick her wrist again causing a huge cheesecake to fly through the air and rest gently in front of Janet\u2019s face, her nose dipping in the cream cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrgh, you are the be...\u201d started Janet as Wanda applied a smidge of magical pressure to the flying dessert, causing it to squeeze in on itself and slowly pour into Janet\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\nA second glow snaked itself around Janet\u2019s bulbous arse and lifted her just enough off the floor to allow her to glide to the sofa, thick bulges of ass fat hanging over the invisible shelf pushing her along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Wanda\u2019s powers lowered Janet into her seat, the springs and frame groaned loudly under the brunettes great bulk.<br>\r\nSeated in the middle, the furniture began to bend slightly under Janet\u2019s arse as the fashionista obliviously sucked in the cheesecake still pouring itself between her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda smiled as she watched her roommate come lover begin her next blind gorge, rapidly pushing the remaining cake into Janet\u2019s mouth and watched with glee as her cheeks puffed out to accommodate the calories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the witch had barely eased her own pace as a line of doughnuts and waffles rode into her mouth on a stream of chocolate and syrup.<br>\r\nHaving a girlfriend in the fashion industry certainly had its perks and, for the first time in a while, Wanda was able to be fully clothed which she enjoyed immensely even if her wardrobes didn\u2019t last long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a red thick strapped vest top barely covering her belly button and a pair of tracksuit shorts tightening around her expanding thighs, Wanda was content to continue pouring food into her gut every moment of the day.<br>\r\nIt certainly helped having Janet ogle her between bites as her spherical belly poured over the edge of her own sofa as her vest top failed to contain her to the sound of suffering furniture even more strained than the one that Janet was currently crushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how is the factory going?\u201d asked Wanda, feeling the need to check in on Janet\u2019s endeavours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet swallowed before replying.<br>\r\n\u201cReally well actually, which you should know given how things have changed around here\u201d teased Janet before attacking her next fat jammed victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda nodded, the wardrobe changes had helped after an awkward moment between the girls and an unexpected Vision who had come to check in, only to be met by the two enormous women sweaty from eating and naked as the day they were born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut seriously, it\u2019s come together SOO easy, I can hardly remember how it all started\u201d continued Janet, finding herself a box of ribs to demolish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh\u201d<br>\r\nWanda found herself unexpectedly nervous at that comment.<br>\r\nThe Romani witch would have been lying if she said she hadn\u2019t helped a little in so much as changing reality just a little to give Janet the infrastructure she needed to set up and implanted false memories in everyone\u2019s mind...<br>\r\nBut why should she not make use of her powers to help the one she loved where possible.<br>\r\nStark did it all the time, it wasn\u2019t Wanda\u2019s fault that his super power was money...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...besides, I\u2019m gonna need some more clothes before long\u201d announced Janet teasingly as she rolled her leggings down, allowing her already fuller belly to escape and settle on her lap with bulging love handles oozing over her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really?\u201d replied Wanda with a hooked eyebrow as she slowly twirled her fattened fingers, causing all the food in the room to rise around both women.<br>\r\n\u201cOpen up Waspy\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoph, I am...BUUUURP...urgh\u201d groaned Janet as she cradled her ballooned belly in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that? I can\u2019t hear you\u201d cooed Wanda as she used her magic to tilt Janet\u2019s head over the back of the sofa and started to pour food into her mouth again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhhhm...\u201d<br>\r\nJanet wanted to stop as the force of food pressing in her belly was beyond uncomfortable but at the same time she really wanted to keep eating.<br>\r\nAs Wanda watched Janet inhaling everything she sent her way, it became apparent that she was so full her belly was swelling outwards by the moment as her strained shirt rolled higher on its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWanda I...\u201d tried Janet, a mix of arousal and discomfort in her voice before being silenced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhh, just keep...going...\u201d purred Wanda as she increased her own feeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet groaned sexually as she watched Wanda pigging out, the witch\u2019s own bloated stomach getting tighter by the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst Wanda maintained food, Janet simply sat back and indulged.<br>\r\nThe room was filled with muffled grunts and groans as both girls got hot and bothered as the situation developed, calories flying through the air between the two expanding women, clothes shrinking, bellies swelling, emotions souring...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CRAAAACK*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, Wanda? What was...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CRASH!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWanda! Are you ok?!\u201d shouted Janet, trying to look over to where Wanda was, too weighed down by her latest binge to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWanda?...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of laughter rose from the floor and, with an awkward flop onto her side, Janet managed to catch a glimpse of Wanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, are you ok?\u201d asked Janet, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBusy laughing, Wanda was unable to explain that her binge had proven fatal to the sofa she was on, causing the seat to collapse leaving the witch\u2019s massive belly resting on the floor whilst she remained on the cushions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is so hot\u201d whispered Janet as she looked over her girlfriend, her belly pooling on the floor and jiggling as she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment passed with Wanda\u2019s laughter before Janet found her lips being parted around a foot long hot dog at the front of a long line of other dogs.<br>\r\n\u201cMhmph, oh yeah\u201d groaned Janet, limply massaging her exposed belly as her bra joined the open air.</span></div></div>",

if you can find a team willing to participate I can get you to Earth-616 safely\u201d continued Dr Weying with a proud smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoss took a moment to consider what had been said.<br>\r\nScience was not his forte as often as it came up in his work but the thought of risking 616\u2019s problems breaking through into his universe...<br>\r\nRoss did not need a new Nick Fury turning up and making his job difficult but he certainly wouldn\u2019t mind rubbing the bastard\u2019s eye patch in having saved his arse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be in touch doc, make sure it\u2019s safe!\u201d declared Ross as he went to leave, Hit-Monkey happily in quick succession behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne said nothing as the agents left, turning instead to her equipment again and closing the portal down.<br>\r\nAs the symbiote dripped closed and slunk back into its container, Anne put her third chocolate bar down with no inclination to pick it up again despite only a couple of bites remaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I have got to get to the gym once this is all over, we\u2019ve got a bit plush on this experiment Annie\u2019 pondered Dr Weying to herself as she patted her new chubby middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is insane Ross, you\u2019re suggesting putting some of our best people through a symbiote portal that may or may not work, all for a different universe that we owe nothing to\u201d grumbled Hit-Monkey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter Monkey, if it gets in here then we\u2019re all in trouble\u201d replied Ross begrudgingly \u201cbesides, I think we might just stand a chance with this team\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmmm, still don\u2019t see why I have to go as well\u201d grunted Hit-Monkey as he looked over the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn defence of Ross\u2019s plan, he had assembled a pretty impressive team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking leadership of the team was Roberta \u2018Bobbie\u2019 Mendez aka Captain America.<br>\r\nSubjected to super soldier serum and morally pristine, Roberta was everything that Earth-616\u2019s Cap was, not to mention a formidable field leader to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFielding intelligence and espionage, Ronin.<br>\r\nClint Barton had a much more...challenging life on Earth-21213 leaving him to fully adopt the persona of Ronin the assassin completely.<br>\r\nFollowing a nasty streak of vengeance and nearly losing himself completely, Clint had freely submitted himself for rehabilitation on The Raft and, now, was one of Ross\u2019s most trusted secret agents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs already suggested with a great deal of begrudging attitude, Hit-Monkey\u2019s specialism has been employed *cough* forced *cough* onto the team, even if a chance in the field was very much to the primate assassin\u2019s taste.<br>\r\nCleaning his affects to settle his nerves, the monkey was perfect for such an obscure mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a bad looking team...Dad\u201d came a teasing voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll get the job done I\u2019m sure\u201d grunted Ross as his daughter drew beside him, thick red biceps pulsing as she crossed her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood job you\u2019ve put so much muscle on the team\u201d teased Betty as she strode past her father to join the line up, giving Roberta an air cracking fist bump as she took her place next to the blonde.<br>\r\nAfter the failed experiment that had killed her boyfriend Bruce Banner, Betty Ross had been left permanently hulk-ified without the need for anger to fuel her powers.<br>\r\nDespite her reddened physique she found acceptance amongst the superhero community and had earned the respect of her father, even if all the chairs had to be reinforced to support her vast muscular frame when she visited home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you all know why we are here and what the mission entails\u201d began Ross, rolling into his briefing for the team in typical army fashion.<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what you\u2019ll be getting into but we do know that it could be dangerous over there and that means...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\u201dHey guys, whatcha doing?

Her breathing was shaky, head pounding, nothing was feeling right at all. Finally up to her feet, the yellow sparks of venom blasts erupting from her tips, raising her arm to a certain silhouette, covered from the smoke that trailed from a nearby crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch yourself, Drew.\u201d She said, stepping out from the smoke, clad in green leather, and dark green hair. Viper, raising a gun like weapon towards the spider, wrapping her finger around the trigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI said, watch yourself.\u201d Viper demanded, as she pulled the trigger.<br>\r\n                                        --------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrew woke up with a groan, after her fight with Viper and the rest of Hydra, she immediately returned to her apartment. The fight must've drained her, as Jess woke up with empty wrappers and bags all around her. Shifting her body, she sat up on her couch, letting the empty Oreo container slide off her shirt, with 'Avengers' written across her chest. \u201cChrist..\u201d She muttered, looking down to see the food baby that poke out from under her shirt, placing a hand on the soft bump where her abs were supposed to be. Knowing it'll go away eventually, Drew forced herself up, stepping over the mess her binge left behind, making her way straight to her fridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost empty, which she wasn't suprising at all.  Reaching in, Jess grabbed hold of the last beer can from her supply. Popping it open, she raised the can to her lips and started downing it. Her alcohol immunity did nothing, meaning she could drink gallons upon gallons of beer, wine, whatever had alcohol in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, wiping her lips when a bare arm and crushing the can in her hands, barely making the trash can as she tossed it. Walking back, her stomach began groaning, almost bubbling, stopping in her tracks, Drew clutched at her noisy stomach. \u201cWhat..did.. Viper do to me.\u201d She mumbled, before cocking her head to the side to let a deep, rumbly beer belch escape from her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b></b></i> \u201c..BHUUUUURPPPP!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust gas I hope.\u201d She sighed,t hat was a relief, at least in her own point of view, she thought. Drew snorted a bit, giving a pat to her gut. Wincing a bit as her stomach was stiffed and bloated from her latest consumption. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally returning to take a seat on her couch, sinking into it, a hand resting on her gut, rubbing it softly as her free hand pulled out her phone. A growl disturbed the peace, Jess already knowing her metabolism went through everything she's ate all day, and started wanting seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right, all right, I'll order some pizza.\u201d Drew huffed, sounding defeated, dialing up the nearest restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I order three large meat lovers?

It was a quality that one would either deeply appreciate or be irked by, with really no in-between. For Jessica Drew, it was currently a small price to pay for being able to see her best friend again after her three-month stint in space with the Guardians of the Galaxy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Carol said. \"Still, Hydra's no joke, and you usually recover faster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two had met for lunch at their favorite burger place within walking distance of their respective apartments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The important thing is that I stopped whatever it is they were planning,\" Jessica said with a shrug. \"At least for a while.\" She hungrily reached for her burger and took a generous, famished bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt'd been about three days since Jessica's rough-and-tumble brawl through Viper's facility. She'd spent the intervening time laying low and recovering \u2014 which also involved more visits to this particular establishment than she'd perhaps care to admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think they'll be back?\" Carol asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*MMF* \"Probably,\" Jessica said through a mouthful of beef. \"Viper's in the wind, and she's probably regrouping as we speak.\" Jessica took another chomp from her and moaned. \"I love this burger, it's so delicious...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol gave her friend an incredulous look. \"That's your third burger today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Jessica said, washing her meal down with a draught of milkshake. \"Girl's gotta eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA meal like this normally would've left Jessica feeling stuffed to the brim. But, much like she found herself feeling after consuming three large meat lover's pizzas on top of God knows what else, Jessica didn't feel \"full\" so much as \"not as unbearably hungry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Carol suddenly became bashful. \"I, uh, didn't want to say anything, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since that night after Hydra, Jessica's appetite had surged to unparalleled heights. At this point, Jessica couldn't actually remember the last time she felt satisfied. As she finished her burger, she strongly considered ordering a fourth, despite the round little food belly bulging from her core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich brought up the issue that had been tugging Carol's mind since reuniting with her best friend:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're getting kinda... pudgy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't as though Jessica had put on a ton of weight. She just seemed a little softer overall, with less muscle tone and a bit more roundness to her overall figure. Carol estimated Jessica had put on about 10 or 15 pounds, with her belly in particular having taken a generous portion of the gain, not quite being contained by Jessica's top. Carol figured it was really only noticeable to her since they hadn't seen each other in so long. What Carol didn't know was that just a few days ago, Jessica had been as fit and built as ever, and eating far less gluttonously than she was right now. Perhaps 10 or 15 pounds gained over three months would be understandable, but three days was a completely different story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven still, Jessica was indignant nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My <i>potentially </i> gaining weight has nothing to do with me still being hungry,\" Jessica said. \"Besides...\"</span></div></div>",

Her stint with the Guardians of the Galaxy had left her exposed to all kinds of dishes from the stars that she'd never dreamed of. Some of them had been good. Others, not so much. But she'd never know until she'd tried them. Three months later and this was the result. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, she wasn't fat by any means, just softer. Her pants were a little more snug than they used to be and her hard cut physique had softened ever so slightly. One could hardly noticed and given Carol's level of strength, it most certainly hadn't effected her physical performance. Yet, if you had known her before her recent acquisition of adipose, like Jessica, you'd would have seen the differences in the Captain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so.\" Jessica shrugged, smiling a little in victory before taking another generous bite of her burger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol gave a defeated huff before doing the same and digging into her own food with gusto.

Neither of them was ready to acknowledge the flabby starter guts they were growing, nor were they going to point them out to the other, so there was no reason to continue along that thread. There was a little voice in the back of Jessica's head that was concerned how Carol had noticed any sort of change, but that voice was easily drowned out by the deluge of delectable desserts Jessica began devouring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what a deluge it was. While Jessica didn't end up ordering that fourth burger after all, it had less to do with her hunger being sated so much as her cravings skewing more sweet than savory. Finishing her milkshake left her feeling like she wanted another, which got her thinking about getting some ice cream, and y'know, a brownie or two would go great with all of that, plus this restaurant had a deal where you could get a free cookie if you got a combo, and ooh, it'd been a while since she's had a slice of pie from this place...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDessert was a veritable feast in and of itself with an order like that, and Jessica would've eaten all of it by herself had it not been for one factor: Carol Danvers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol, for her part, wasn't as hungry as Jessica. And though she hadn't gained a lot of weight, she did still need to get back in shape. Even still, three months was a long time to be away from home, and the pie here was really good. Surely, a slice couldn't hurt. And, ooh, that ice cream looks really good, and, hey, what's a better combo with pie than a scoop of vanilla? That brownie might be pushing it, but it looks really tasty. Maybe just a bite. Or two...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so on and so forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two friends barely exchanged a word as they ate, other than Carol occasionally asking if she could try something. Their bellies grew fuller and rounder, stretching to accommodate the sheer volume of their desire, until at last, the dishes had ended and their cravings had waned. Jessica and Carol hugged each other goodbye, careful to make room for their engorged and sensitive midriffs, before heading back to their respective homes, their thoughts drifting to the pleasures of the meal they just had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night...</span></div></div>",

Jessica had never really pigged out before. Too many things going on in life what with HYDRA, S.H.I.E.l.D., the Avengers, you name it. Honestly, the tightrope that was her life had given her little in the way of...letting go? Relaxing? It was an odd sensation, freeing in a way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...But I can't keep doing this.\" Jessica said to herself, as if stating out loud would have some effect. She prodded her stomach with a finger, feeling its taunt surface. \"I was recovering, I was taking a break. If keep doing this, I might as well start calling myself Pig-Woman...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hit her. Like a ton of bricks. Jessica other hand flew to her belly as it gave an audible rumble before clenching! Jessica gasped at the pain. It felt like her stomach was trying to tear into itself. Like...like...like she was still hungry?! But that wasn't possible, she'd eaten a small feast fit for a family earlier. So why would she be feeling like this? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was that moment that it came to her. She'd eaten a lot of desserts. Yes, she had also a good deal of burgers as well but maybe, she had needed more? Jessica was aware that some people experience cramps or stomachaches if they tried to substitute real food with junk if they were hungry. That had to be what happening now. It was the only that made sense to her at the moment. In reality, a small part of Jessica's mind knew that this was an excuse. She'd eaten more than enough to satisfy any hunger she may have been experiencing. Yet this more reasonable, rational part of her mind was drowned out by the larger part that simply wanted to excuse Jessica's newly developing bad habit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, it was not surprising when Jessica reached for her phone and quickly dialed the number to an inexpensive yet decent Chinese place that she was still open, her earlier resolve forgotten just like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'd like to order General Tso's chicken, egg foo young, and three cup basil fish, all with white rice and side of egg rolls and pork dumplings...Actually, double that...Yes, for delivery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===(With Carol)=== <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol gave a relieved sigh as she finished up a report. All in all, she considered this a good day. She and Jess had gotten to hang out, even if that had turned into an impromptu binge. Heck, she could still taste the food on her lips. But if Carol was being honest, while the burgers, fries and the desserts had been nice, she could have really gone for a pizza. A nice, big pepperoni deep dish pizza. That sounded...<i>delicious</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew she really shouldn't, but who was gonna know? Besides, it wasn't like she wasn't super strong. She'd just work it off later, like she already vowed to. Her stomach gave a small rumble in agreement and that was the push Carol needed. Before she knew it, she was ordering online. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Extra large pepperoni, come to mama!</i>' Carol grinned.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The mighty Avenger could always look forward to encountering a diverse and rich medley of cultures, and this latest stint had been a rather delicious example thereof. It had also made her quite homesick for the delicacies of home. Absence, after all, makes the heart grow fonder, and the fastest way to Carol's heart was through her stomach. And so, having now regained easy access to all of her hometown favorites, Carol's first week back home quickly turned into one of nigh unrestrained indulgence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndulgence, however, has a way of catching up with you. Carol's time with the Guardians had already left a lasting impression on her figure, and despite her promises to \"work it off later,\" Carol really didn't intend to do anything her first week back other than get comfortable. Late-night deep dish pizza went from a one-night treat to a dinnertime staple, often joined by a few beer or a pint of ice cream -- sometimes both. Carol had even taken to ordering seconds with the rest of her food, such was the scope of her hunger. Typically, \"seconds\" would just mean a second pizza, but lately Carol had taken the opportunity to sample the takeout menus of the various restaurants located in the heart of NYC.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt shouldn't come as a surprise that Carol was currently having difficulty fitting into her clothes this morning. As her culinary palette expanded, so to did the softness that had accumulated around her waistline. Not a whole lot, to be sure, but enough where her wardrobe was starting to highlight the changes to her figure. For instance, when she was finally able to get her jeans buttoned up, a little sliver of belly pudge now oozed above her waistband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw it,\" she said, stripping off her jeans, \"I'll just wear some sweats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross town, Jessica Drew was having similar issues. The primary difference was that her weight gain was far more noticeable and far more rapid than Carol's.

She was used to seeing all these people, after being in a bunker for years in her life. And being a part of the spider-verse, it all seemed stressful, but Cindy managed. There were her fellow spiders, friends, and nothing seemed to get in her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept the growling that erupted from her stomach. \"I did skip breakfast today.\" She mumbled to herself, scanning the sidewalk for any cheap, cheap and horribly unhealthy food stands on the corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo.\" She quickly made her way over towards a stand, letting the different cooked foods make their way towards her. Their seemed to be a lot of choices, there wasn't even a hint of greens anywhere, which she really didn't mind. Ordering herself a sandwich, packed with cheese, meats, condiments, and who knows what type of bread it was made of, Cindy took a large bites out of it. Letting the different flavors make their way into her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm..\" She gave a relaxed sigh, taking was last big bite as she continued her walk. \"Wait.\" she panicked as she pulled out her phone, checking the time. \"Oh, crap! Late! I'm late oh god, she'll let it slide, right?! Oh, cra--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cindy? You okay, girl?\" A voice called out, a familiar voice, full of snarky sarcasm and British. Jessica Drew walked out of a cafe with a coffee in her hand, wearing a red jacket and a simple T-shirt. Taking a sip, she raised a brow. \"No hug?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sorry!\" Cindy walked up to the elder spider, giving her a quick hug, as Jessica hugged the girl back. Cindy's eyes squinted, as she looked down slightly and noticed the new belly Jess had that touched her flat middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it her like a truck, Jessica was! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You going to finish that?\" Jess asked, pointing at the sandwich. Cindy gave a quick nod, passing over the sandwich to the garbage disposal of a spider, immediately sinking her teeth into the meaty sandwich. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy's head filled with thoughts and questions, as well as she grew hungry again, knowing she won't get her sandwich back. Belly bulge? Cravings? Horrible sense of fashion?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She must be.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wisconsin hadn't had an honest-to-goodness superhero sighting since that time Squirrel Girl came to the Dells to ride the ducks.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Ed!\" Martha cried.  \"Isn't that the, the, the who's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She-Hulk!\" Edgar yelled back, eyes fixed on the massive green woman charging down the street.  \"Musta got sight of one of them Doctor Dooms and such what they've got here.

MJ never had a cat, or did she? In fact, now that she thought of it, she did remember a cat - her own and only <i>constant </i>companion... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Wait, that sound even more wrong - now MJ finally opened her eyes and sat up - or tried to. Her body felt too heavy and foreign for some reason, and her vision felt somewhat restricted, even half-blind and blurry...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a rush of panic coming upon her, MJ flailed around (feeling like a beached whale for some reason) until she finally found her glasses and put them on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the-?\" the first thing that MJ saw was her hand and arm, hugely bloated with fat, toppled with five sausage-like fingers. Her heart sinking in her chest, MJ looked at her other arm - same thing. And that was not all - her neck felt rather stiff, and her breasts... were huge, EEEEE cups, protruding forwards like a cupboard shelf, nesting comfortably on a massive gut that clearly obscured her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery, very slowly - never before had MJ felt so heavy and out of shape - the redhead stood up, feeling exhausted just by that simple action... and for good reason. She was huge. Her hands and arms were only the tip of the iceberg, as for her 5E breasts, terminating in cookie-sized niples. Everything beyond and below them was a simple masss of fat flesh - MJ basically didn't had a waistline, her stomach grew right at the torso and dropped, apron-like, around the knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knees, for their part, were located in a pair of tree-trunk legs, which, just like the arms, were covered in slabs of pale skin and flesh that smoothly became cellulite on the buttocks. The buttocks, just like the backside, stretched far out and provided a sufficient counterweight for MJ's oversized gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the redhead's face too was filled with fat: multiple chins and jowls obscured her neck to a point where her head looked like an egg positioned on a bed of fat, with a pair of eyes that were almost slit-like in their shape (the spectacles positioned on MJ's nose didn't help any either). Really, the only thing that remained from the old Mary Jane was her shoulder-length red hair, and even that had a somewhat faded look, now that MJ took a good look at it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a wave of fatigue came over the redhead, as she teetered and almost fell face first onto the dressing table next to the mirror (into which she was looking for the past 5 minutes or so).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Watson?\" Still feeling weak, Mary Jane heard the sound of a door opening behind her. \"Are you all right?\"</span></div></div>",

The giant figure quickly waddled over to MJ, wobbling and shaking the entire way over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God, Mary Jane are you okay, what happened?\u201d the figure said nervously as she helped MJ get back to her feet. Mary Jane took notice of the familiarity of the figures voice, and prayed that it was not who she believed it was. Unfortunately, her suspicions were confirmed when she was face to face with a morbidly obese version of Felicia Hardy, also known as the Black Cat, a (usually skinny) thief that had tried to split her and Peter up many times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia looked even larger than Mary Jane, and that was really saying something. Her fat gut reached her knees, and pushed her nightgown out to the point of absurdity. Her arms were massive, and her thighs were absolutely titanic. Felicia\u2019s butt was also huge, and pushed the nightgown outward immensely. Felicia\u2019s famous cleavage also remained, putting MJ\u2019s to shame, as her breasts went out much further than her immense stomach. Her pure white hair remained, and did not cover her face at all, which was packed to the brim with fat. Her chipmunk-like cheeks and three chins did not cover the feeling of genuine concern for the also newly massive Mary Jane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI fell, but can you really blame me? What the hell did you do to us? Why are we so fat?\u201d Mary Jane exclaimed, back on her feet and leaning on a creaking table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean the dinner I made us last night? I thought you had a good time, especially based on how we broke the bed afterwards.\u201d Felicia replied, both somewhat kidding but more so confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean dinner? I ate dinner with Peter last night. And I really don\u2019t think I would ever do anything like that with you.\u201d Mary Jane replied, but as she tried to think, she could hardly remember who Peter was. And she did remember spending some dinners with Felicia...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you did, and as for why you\u2019re so fat, you put the food in your mouth for your demeaning job, at the rate your going your going to be heavier than me!\u201d Felicia yelled before exiting the room very angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane looked down at herself, and began to wonder how much she really weighed. She exited her room and found a bathroom to the right. She then found a scale, and nervously stepped on.</span></div></div>",

Or maybe this is all a dream. If I could remember who the hell this Peter guy was maybe I could figure this out.\u201d Mary Jane muttered to herself as she slowly lumbered out of the bathroom. She decided that Felicia was her best bet at getting any information about this situation, so she went downstairs to find her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs MJ reached the bottom of the steps she found the kitchen littered with breakfast foods of all kinds.

She knew she was a model, so maybe she\u2019s just freaking out and has been a plus size model this whole time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut somethings were still nagging at her. She never remembered having a cat or needing glasses, and she definitely did not remember being fat or in a relationship with an also fat Black Cat. And she still couldn\u2019t figure out who Peter was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring breakfast, Mary Jane decided to try asking Felicia if she knew a Peter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I\u2019ve never met a Peter. But you need to go, a big girl like you needs all the time she can get waddling to work. Leave your breakfast and go get ready.\u201d Felicia replied genuinely. It was at that moment that MJ realized that whatever was happening to her, Felicia either knew nothing about it, or was an extremely talented actress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane slowly rose off her seat and went to her room, where she stripped off all over clothes, leaving her gargantuan body completely exposed. She than got dressed in jeans that were slightly to small and a massive button up shirt that she had to leave a few open. She than kissed Felicia goodbye and started heading toward 12th, because she had nowhere else to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mary Jane waddled along the streets of Manhattan she took notice of several billboards that were across the building.

Everything he knows could be wrong, and that\u2019s a lot to take in for a person, even a superhero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn this other world, are we, close?\u201d Peter asked, looking Mary Jane in the eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know.

Iron Man had gold and red armor, with an arc reactor in the shape of a square that flowed green in the center of his chest. Bumblebee didn\u2019t wear a mask, so MJ knew it was fashion designer Janet Van Dyne, and she wore a skintight blue and red jumpsuit, and she was still thin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpider-Man, what happened back there?

MJ decided to stay seated, not wanting to struggle to make her massive body stand up on a roof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIron Man looked at her and scanned her, checking her vitals and heartbeat.

The X-Woman looked to be around five hundred and fifty pounds in weight, with her gut being her biggest feature. She looked like a human beanbag chair, with her gut taking up her entire lap when she was sitting. Her butt was also very big, as were her breasts. Her face was also very round, with three chins and massive cheeks. Kitty wore a much larger version of her classic costume. Kitty looked up at MJ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I know you. You\u2019re Spider-Man\u2019s wife, aren\u2019t you? I thought you were a supermodel. But maybe I\u2019m really crazy.\u201d Kitty sulked into her large seat, as a large creaking noise emanated throughout the room. Mary Jane sat down across from her, her jeans straining as she sat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re crazy. I remember a different world where we are both thin, I am a supermodel and have a relationship with Spider-Man, and you are a member of the X-Men.\u201d Mary Jane replied, while adjusting her glasses once again. Kitty practically leapt out of her seat, much faster than any woman her size should be able to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou remember that I\u2019m an X-Men too? Thank God! I\u2019m not crazy!\u201d Kitty cheered as a glow of excitement radiated from her. She was dancing across the room, with her entire body jiggling and wobbling as the whole room shook. In the excitement MJ got up and hugged, as the two morbidly obese women started cheering, with more than one button flying off of MJ\u2019s tight shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty and MJ sat back down, extremely tired and sweaty, clearly their new bodies weren\u2019t used too that much physical activity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you remember how the world changed? How did it get so messed up?\u201d Mary Jane asked, once again fixing her glasses and struggling to hold her shirt together.

The last time they fought, Kang brought a whole army with him, so the Avengers asked for help. The X-Men, Fantastic Four, even the Defenders were called in.

Stark had a look of disbelief on his face, but he also knew, deep down that the fat girls were right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you said the name Kang, it triggered a memory from the battle.

And everything will go back to normal.\u201d Mary Jane said, with Kitty nodding in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple. Colonel America claims that the people of this changed reality are what we should be thinking about, what\u2019s done is done.\u201d Tony replied, still thinking as Kitty and MJ sank in their seats.

They landed their jet by in a parking lot and exited the jet, as Tony was now suited up in his armor and MJ and Kitty waddled behind him. They were walking down the dark street, as it was pitch black night. They approached a house with an odd window that seemed to be emanating a glow. Tony went to knock on the door, but the three were instantaneously transported inside, and were face to face with the Sorcerer Supreme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Strange was practically the exact same in this timeline than the one Kitty and MJ remembered, and Strange looked at both of them with confusion. The eye necklace that dangled from his neck, opened and flowed purple. It than quickly closed as Strange chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two are definitely not from around here.\u201d Strange said, as MJ and Kitty nodded in agreement, causing the fat on their faces to shake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you wish to put the world back the way it was. Excellent, I will transport the three of you two the past immediately.\u201d Strange said before doing weird hand motions, as sparks flew everywhere. Just as he was really getting going, a shield was flung at Strange, and ricocheted off him and hit Iron Man, before flying back to Colonel America. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to your world is a tragedy. But I cannot let you destroy this world.\u201d Colonel America said, as the rest of the Avengers gathered around Colonel America, including Spider-Man. Stark got back up and fired up his repulsors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStrange finish the portal! I\u2019ll deal with my team.\u201d Stark said before blasting Thor and Wolverine with his lasers, as he flew and slammed into Spider-Man and Colonel America. Steve grabbed Stark and started hitting him, as Thor quickly recovered and went after Stark as well. Bumblebee flew toward Kitty and MJ and started blasting her stings, but Kitty grabbed MJ and phased the blasts through them, before swatting Bumblebee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange got the portal ready, and went to go join Iron Man. Strange handed MJ a scroll, as he fired up a light magic sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve fixed everything, read that incantation to be sent to the present. Good luck girls.\u201d Strange said before swinging his sword at Wolverine. Kitty jumped into the portal, but MJ was blocked by Spider-Man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeter, you know I\u2019m right.

It's also being treated as an interdimensional nexus to avoid plot holes between this story and <i>The Fat-tastic Four</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" Carol groaned, pushing away her plate and leaning in her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said,\" replied Jessica, following suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Avengers were having lunch at a new restaurant that opened: The Superhero's Repast. Customers who dressed up as a superhero received a 20% discount on all food. Actual superheroes ate for free. Intrigued by the promises of the restaurant, Carol Danvers and Jessica Drew\u2014in their respective identities of Captain Marvel and Spider-Woman\u2014decided to have lunch there today. The result? Two very stuffed superheroines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>might</i> have gone a bit overboard with the fried chicken,\" Carol said, burping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica chuckled. \"A little?\" she teased, pointing at her friend's swollen belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol cocked an eyebrow. \"Oh, like you're one to talk,\" Carol replied, eying Jessica's own food baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica smiled, placing a gloved hand over the food-filled bulge. \"What can I say? I do love deep-dish pizza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpider-Man walked up to there table. Or, rather, a waiter dressed as Spider-Man. \"Will that be all, ladies?\" he asked, pulling out a notepad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol stifled another burp. \"Ohhh\u2026 I don't think I can eat another bite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica nodded in agreement. Just as the two made to leave, the waiter played his trump card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I tempt you with dessert?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol and Jessica stopped. Normally, the two would have politely declined and left. They would also, normally, not stuff themselves, and yet here they were, midriffs burgeoning with food. The two heroes looked at each other, then sat back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you have?\" asked Jessica, desire dripping from every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for our Avengers,\" the waiter replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica and Carol looked at one another, then smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll have chocolate cake. And keep it coming,\" Carol requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter nodded, and returned a few minutes later with a cart loaded with a dozen small chocolate cakes. Setting them down on the table in a ring, the waiter asked, \"Will that be all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol and Jessica licked their lips. \"Yes. Thank you,\" they answered in unison, before digging in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Avengers ate with reckless abandon, shoving bite after bite of chocolate cake into their mouths and down into their gullets. Carol soon disposed of her spoon and began to just eat by the handful. Jessica tried to stay civilized, but she, too, followed Carol's example.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the ordeal, the waiter would replace an empty plate of cake with a new one with more cake. He did this twelve times before the two motioned for him to stop. After about half of an hour, Carol and Jessica had each consumed 12 cakes. Carol moaned, loosening the sash around her hip to make room for her bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Carol?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We keep eating like this, they'll need the Hulk to get us out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica laughed, a hiccup stopping the sound. \"More like both of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol laughed. \"Let's agree, right now,before that happens\u2014this'll only be a monthly thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica nodded. \"Agreed. But I will miss that cake\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaboriously, the two friends rose from their seats. Wrapping their arms around one another for support, Carol and Jessica staggered out of the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Jessica said, pointing to another table. \"Is that Sue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol looked to where Jessica was pointing. \"I think so. And I think I see Jen, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Medusa and Crystal are there, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They seem\u2026 different, though. I can't quite place my finger on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, the two continued on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait\u2026 isn't Sue in space?\"</span></div></div>",

Strangely, they had been unable to lose all of the weight from their last sojourn into the Superhero's Repast. It wasn't much\u2014just five pounds, give or take\u2014but considering the energy required of being an Avenger, it was quite odd. Then again, it had been a quiet week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strangest part was that Carol and Jessica decided to break their agreement at the same time. Their cravings finally got the better of them, and so they both set out to dine at the Superhero's Repast without telling the other. Sure enough, Captain Marvel and Spider-Woman found each other, face-to-face, standing at the entrance of the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, too?\" Carol asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica  shrugged, smiling sheepishly. \"I just wanted some cake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol returned. \"Let's not go overboard this time, though, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the two walked into the restaurant, knowing full well that they would only add another broken promise to the list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did start with a cake. It was a chocolate cake\u2014one for each of them\u2014with chocolate frosting and chocolate buttercream. It was also a very large, five-layer cake, meant more for a large wedding than a superheroine. It made no difference. Their bellies desired cake, and they desired a lot of cake. The two dug in with a voracity never before experienced by either of them. The first layer left them full.  The second layer left them stuffed. Bellies began bulging after the first few bites of the third layer. The two began to slow down in their eating, barely trudging on through their cakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I can eat another bite,\" Carol said in between bites. \"But it's <b>so</b> good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel you,\" replied Jessica, cramming another spoonful into her mouth. \"Part of me wants to stop, but the other part could eat this cake all day\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea suddenly crossed Carol's minding, causing her to smile. \"Bet I can finish mine before you finish yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica looked at Carol, grabbed her spoon, and licked her lips. \"Bring it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, with renewed gusto and vigor, the two Avengers resumed eating their cakes. In the end, it was Jessica who finished first, collapsing back in her seat triumphantly. \"Victory!\" she exclaimed, pleased with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol finished the last of her cake and loosened her sash. \"Beginner's luck,\" she replied, sarcastically but bemusedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spider-Man waiter from last week walked up to their table. \"Will that be all for today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol and Jessica were about to leave when, oddly enough, their stomachs rumbled hungrily. Carol looked at Jessica and smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Round two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica sat back down. \"You're on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot one of them noticed that the cakes were already on the table.</span></div></div>",

Which, in a certain sense, they were, but not in the traditional three-dimensional sense. The room the two men occupied had been constructed inside of a pocket dimension, allowing them to watch the two Avengers from a close distance but not be in-sync enough with the rest of the universe to cause an obstruction or be detected. Behind them, the sounds of chefs cooking could be heard\u2014pots and pans clamoring together, foods and oils sizzling on ovens, orders being volleyed from chef to chef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're making good progress,\" the suited man said to his seated companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seated man folded his hands together. \"Yes, they are,\" he replied casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Especially Captain Marvel\u2014she has an appetite fit for four men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't discount Spider-Woman just yet,\" the seated man observed. \"She's showing a very gluttonous side of herself that has yet to be fully unlocked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suited man tilted his head, observing on Jessica with greater scrutiny. \"She certainly has gusto. But I believe the Captain shows greater promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it doesn't matter in the long run. Both of them will be sporting potbellies by the end of the month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I suppose it doesn't. But it certainly makes this more fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seated man smiled. \"A wager, then. By the end of this month, Spider-Woman will have fattened up the most.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While I say Captain Marvel will be sporting more pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"$200,000?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe we deserve a prize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what do you propose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suited man smiled. \"If I win, the Captain gets a cake made by you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I win?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then Spider-Woman gets a cake baked by me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seated man stuck out his hand. \"Then it's settled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suited man shook it. \"Perhaps we should check on that other universal cluster at this point?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's,\" the seated man said, pushing a button on his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe view changed. Where once was a scene of a Captain Marvel and a Spider-Woman feasting competitively on cake inside the restaurant now showed a Susan Richards standing outside the entrance of the Superheroes' Repast. She wore a large sunhat, concealing aviators, a Spider-Man T-shirt, and black jeans. In her hand, she held a bowl of shaved ice. The difference between this Susan Richards and the Susan Richards from last week, though, was that this one had already put on some weight, most of it centering in a potbelly that was almost completely concealed by her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A gaining superheroine,\" the seated man stated. \"My favorite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do hope the other Susan from last week returns, though,\" the suited man said. \"She seemed like she would make for a very fat Invisible Woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seated man nodded. \"But this Susan seems to have more potential. And, better still\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rumbling sound resonated through the room. Susan looked down at her belly, giving it a rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026 She's hungry.\"</span></div></div>",

They were too consumed in their competition to pay attention to the minutia. To them, there was only cake that needed eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was during the sixth round that the nature of the contest changed. The score was 2-3, with Jessica in the lead. Carol, desperate to not be outdone, crammed the final slice of her sixth cake into her mouth, chewing it for a bit than swallowing it, and then immediately began her seventh cake. Jessica followed suit. No words were exchanged, but, from then on, it was an unspoken agreement that the contest had become a battle of who could eat the most cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol began to slow down towards the end. Ten cakes left her quite full and very bloated. With a groan, Carol reached for her eleventh cake, her only volition being the delicious nature of the cake. Slowly spooning off a mouthful, Carol took a bite, moaning blissfully as the cake's gentle but rich flavor flooded her taste buds. It was enough to make her ignore the pain in her very bloated stomach, which looked to be in its final trimester,  bulging against the fabric of her costume. However, halfway through the cake, it soon became too much to bear, and Carol finally pushed back her chair, coming in at 10.5 cakes eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica, though, was an eating machine. Upon seeing that Carol had slowed down, she became relentless, increasing her score to 12, 13, 14\u2026 all the way to 16 cakes. While she felt like she was going to explode, Jessica was determined to eat one more dish\u2014Carol's unfinished cake. Reaching over the table, Jessica pulled the plate towards herself, grabbed her spoon, and dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it was a bit juvenile, but Jessica wanted to make a show of eating the cake, to further emphasize the fact that Carol lost. Her spoonfuls were long and drawn out, and she never broke eye contact with Carol, who sat in her seat, massaging her bloated belly, eyebrow cocked in a bemused expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hitting a bit below the belt, aren't we, Jess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry? I can't hear you over the sound of my victory,\" Jessica teased, eating another spoonful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few minutes, but, eventually, Jessica finished the cake. With a mighty belch, Jessica leaned back in her chair. Her belly formed a large, burgeoning dome on her otherwise slender form, stretching the red-and-yellow fabric of her costume to the limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was rather unladylike,\" Carol said sardonically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just mad because I won, and you lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I let you win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sixteen-and-a-half cakes beg to disagree with you,\" Jess responded, patting her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the gravity of what they had done dawn on the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sixteen-and-a-half\u2026\" Jess whispered in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ten-and-a-half cakes!?\" Carol exclaimed. \"Holy #@$%! Whose bright idea was this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wasn't it yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you let me go through with it!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica shrugged. \"It was good cake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026 Well, yeah, that's true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spider-Man waiter walked up to their table. \"Anything else today, ladies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Carol and Jess shouted together in horror, startling the waiter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Jessica said. \"No, we're fine. The food was wonderful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, on behalf of the Superhero's Repast, I thank you for coming here this fine afternoon,\" the waiter said, bowing. And with that, he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwkwardly, Carol and Jessica rose from their seats, using one another to support each other as they walked to the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we went a bit overboard after all, huh?\" Carol remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will never get over how that waiter dresses up as Peter,\" Jessica replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol chuckled. \"It is a bit weird, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon exiting the restaurant, Carol and Jessica collapsed on the brick perimeter of a tree near the Repast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to come back to haunt us; I just know it.\"</span></div></div>",

Three armed guards were surrounding the exit, with all their guns pointed strait at the chair at the center of the room, or more accurately, the deadly assassin tied down to the chair. She had blood red, long, strait hair, wore a tight black cat-suit with a red hourglass on the belt. She was fit, but still extremely beautiful with large breasts and a toned butt. Her weapons, including two pistols and her wrist mounted gadgets were laid across the table at the far end of the room. Natasha Romanoff did not enjoy being caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnown across the world as the Black Widow, Natasha was an Avenger and a current agent of SHIELD. She was assigned to an undercover job at a supposed Hydra science facility, as a member of the janitorial department. Unfortunately her adventures with the Avengers conveniently happening whenever her cover was gone drew suspicion. One raid and investigation later, and she was promptly tied to a chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha did not like being caught. And her least favorite part was the waiting. An interrogation can go both ways, and she usually spun it in her favor. But waiting for the guy to come to her was so tedious Natasha felt the need to break out and kill everyone anyway. But she knew Nick and even Steve would be pissed. So she sat and waited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door swung open and two people walked in. One was the commander in chief, General Kowalski, a mean looking man who intimidated anyone he came across, besides Natasha. The other was a scientist that Natasha did not recognize. They both walked over to her, the scientist clearly nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMs. Romanoff, or do you prefer Black Widow? Did you think you wouldn\u2019t get caught?\u201d Kowalski asked, as Natasha smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just didn\u2019t think it would be you who caught me, considering how little work you actually do around here.\u201d Natasha replied, and the general surprisingly smiled instead of getting angry. He motioned toward the scientist, and the scientist quickly whipped out a large needle full of a blue substance and stabbed Natasha with it, and then he injected the substance into her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha began struggling, as she felt her suit tightening. She felt herself getting larger and larger, as her stomach grew into a muffin too. She also felt the muscles begin to gradually disappear, and be replaced by fat. By the end of the growth, Natasha now weighed five hundred and sixty pounds, a far cry from the one hundred and thirty one pounds she weighed but five minutes ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha was absolutely massive, with an hourglass like shape, though not to discredit her extremely big gut. Her gut was pushed back by her belt, but it was bursting past it both over and under the belt. Her thighs were massive, and were pressed together at all times. Her massive butt was overflowing the chair, as tears in the seems began to form in her suit. Her already large breasts were now bigger than her head, and practically were completely showing despite her suit. Natasha no longer possessed a neck, instead having three chins and full cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do to me!?\u201d Natasha screamed, horrified at her new massive body General Kowalski began to laugh, covering the creaking noise of the chair, until it snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha was free from her binds, but in a new body and outgunned. Normally this would be easily, but can the new fat Black Widow defeat the guards? </span></div></div>",

Natasha punched the scientist square in the face. Though she would never admit it, it felt very good to punch with all of that new weight behind her. Her entire body jiggled when she threw the punch, her boobs almost falling out completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha then waddled back to the table which her gear was on, and grabbed a smoke pellet. She dropped, as the room filled with smoke. Natasha grabbed her gas mask from her utility belt and put it on as she grabbed the barely conscious scientist while the guards and Kowalski were coughing up a storm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell did you do to me!? How do I change back? How do I get my body back?\u201d Natasha yelled. She was so angry her jowls were visibly shaking. The scientist looked at her and laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, why would I ever destroy such a perfect creation like you turned out to be? You will be stuck like this for the rest of your life.\u201d The scientist said, before laughing hysterically. Natasha punched him again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just going to work off the weight. It may take a little while, but you\u2019ve been nothing except a minor inconvenience.\u201d Natasha said, as the scientist began laughing again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou physically can\u2019t work off the weight. Your body may be slow and heavy and fat, but it doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s anything over your original weight. Your body will shut down if you attempt weight loss. If anything, you\u2019re better off gaining weight.\u201d The scientist said before continuing to laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha punched him yet again, and then knocked him out. She than attempted to stand up, but found it very difficult due to her huge weight. Before she could get her footing, she was tackled by two men, and she landed with a loud bang. Natasha managed to kick one of the guards off, but the other remained. He attempted choking her, but couldn\u2019t get past her neck fat. Natasha threw him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this left Natasha very tired. She was sweating profusely, and was panting like a dog. She felt as if she was going to pass out, and the last guard held his rifle right to her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, *huh* I never *huh* thought I would *die* as a *ugh* massive fat ass.\u201d Natasha said through broken breath, as the man turned the safety off. Right when he was about to pull the trigger, the wall to their right busted down, and Natasha was face to face with her backup. </span></div></div>",

After all, one of her favorite superheroine characters was none other than Ashley Crawford (who had now legally changed her name to \"Bertha Crawford\"), better known as the remarkably obese female superhero \"Big Bertha\". However, over time, Gwenpool began to develop affectionate feelings toward the now plus-sized superheroine, willing to do whatever it takes to win Big Bertha's heart. But when she finds out that Bertha happens to be attracted to women with some meat and adipose on their bones, will Gwen Poole be willing to pack on the pounds to gain her idol's affection? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory #2: All Fat, No Play<br>\r\nWorking the beat as a mercenary for hire, Gwenpool has recently accepted a contract to steal a magical artifact from a Haitian cult that enhances the wearer's strength and durability when worn. However, little does she know, that the artifact also happens to fatten up the wearer, especially if they are female. Can Gwenpool find a way to return to normal size, or will become accustomed to her newfound girth?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, what do you think?</span></div></div>",

After all, they just got back from defeating an immensely blobby Doctor Nod and his rotund Bod Squad, who planned on selling an experimental pill supplement that allowed its user to alter their weight at will for approximately 24 hours, which was created from some of Big Bertha's Mutant genes and Mutant Growth Hormones. Suffice to say, they basically had to give the horrifically transformed Doctor Nod a heart attack to stop him from destroying the rest of Detroit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean \"We're Fired\"?\" Flat-Man asked, greatly confused as to how this transpired in the first place. Of course, knowing Deadpool, he was always somewhat a major pain in the ass for most individuals in the superhero community, hence why his moniker was \"The Merc With A Mouth\", where he casually flapped his irritating gums as he--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"HEY!! ...I know where you live, Vocal.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Well excuse me, \"Wade\", but I'm trying to write a goddamn story here. In other words: NO. BREAKING. THE. FOURTH. WALL! Especially from you casually backlashing me, Mr. Merc With A Mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"...Fine! Don't blame me when your views on Writing.com start divebombing.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Ahem* Anyway... Knowing Deadpool, he was always somewhat a major pain in the ass for most individuals in the superhero community, hence why his moniker was \"The Merc With A Mouth\", where he casually flapped his irritating gums as he bluntly explained, \"The Great Lakes Avengers. You can drop the \"Avengers\" part. You're off the team. Finished. Turns out your legal claim to the name doesn't hold up in court.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Deadpool raised his arms a little in a \"Don't shoot me\" gesture whilst he continued speaking and said, \"But Hey! Don't shoot the messenger! Or do. I don't care. I'm immune to bullets.\" \"So soon, though? We were just getting started...\" Mr. Immortal replied, feeling quite disappointed from such a revelation, especially since they just defeated Doctor Nod and the Bod Squad hours ago. Although he could sometimes be a bit of a jackass at times, Deadpool somewhat emphasized with the now disbanded Great Lakes Avengers, as he spoke toward them and answered, \"Hey, it wasn't easy for me to come here and tell you guys this. I had to promise to clean up Hulk's room for a month!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, despite Deadpool's wisecracks, Big Bertha and the other members of the GLA remained silent, taking in what Wade Wilson just told them, as well as coming to terms with the disbanding of the Great Lakes Avengers, as Deadpool spoke once more and said, \"*sigh* ...Look, what are you gonna do? Its not personal or anything. People just...don't like you, that's all.Maybe we'll try this again in a few years. Who knows?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd almost like a drop of the hat, Deadpool's tone switched from empathetic to snarky and chipper in nanoseconds, as he spoke toward Big Bertha and the others as he said, \"Anyway, in the meantime, I'm off to have multiple adventures a month! Smell ya later!\" And just like that, Deadpool exited out of the room and casually proceeded toward the exit, all whilst humming the song \"Shoop\" by Salt 'n Pepa. In turn, this left with Big Bertha, Flat-Man, and the rest of the Great Lakes Avengers all pondering the same question: \"Now that they're no longer Avengers, what was going to happen to them next?\"</span></div></div>",

Better known by her trademark moniker, \"The Unbelievable Gwenpool\", or simply \"Gwenpool\" for short. Now, many in the Marvel Universe, whether they be superhero, villain, or civilian, would most likely think that Gwenpool was simply just a female pink and white knockoff of Deadpool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"But hey! As they say in Transformers: \"I'm more than meets the eye!\" :)\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Anyway, like Gwenpool herself said: \"There was more to her than meets the eye\". In reality, she was never originally from the Marvel Universe at all. Apparently, she is from another Earth--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"Earth-TRN565, to be precise...I think.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you, Gwenpool. *ahem* Anyway, as I was saying... Apparently, she originated from another Earth, where the Marvel Universe and it's numerous array of characters only existed in comic books. And yet, through a set of bizarre circumstances, she was able to transport herself into the main Marvel Universe, Earth-616. During her stay, Gwendolyn took up her iconic alias, \"Gwenpool\". And yet, despite not having any actual superpowers--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"Umm... Excuse me, can we get back to the story here, Mr. Vocal?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Well, we have to do a little recap on a bit of your history first, Ms. Gwenpool. After all, there might be some people here who aren't familiar with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"...Hmm! Fair enough, I suppose.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Well, anyway, getting back on topic... Despite not having any actual superpowers such as Super Strength or Flight, Gwenpool's vast extensive knowledge of the Marvel Universe has allowed her to perform some impressive feats, such as taking down Black Cat's criminal empire, stopping Thor from attacking her, and even going toe-to-toe with MODOK Superior and his Mercenary Organization Dedicated Only to Killing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"So yeah, I've got a damn good resume for someone who doesn't have superpowers like Miles Morales or Amadeus Cho. Hell, I was even taught by Batroc The Leaper at one point!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, like Deadpool, Gwenpool mostly resorted to more... \"violent\" means when it came to fighting criminals and other super-powered individuals, using lethal weapons to take down any enemies. However, due to such lethal force, this made her inadvertently butt heads with a handful of heroes, including Miles Morales AKA Spider-Man, and the group of fellow young superheroes, the Champions, which caused her to be kicked out of the group as a whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"Thanks, Vocal. But I'll take it from here. Anyway, a few days after Miles, Kamala Khan, and the others kicked me out of the Champions, Laura Kinney AKA X-23 AKA The All-New Wolverine, wanted to invite me to join, drum roll please... THE AVENGERS!! Isn't that awesome?! Basically, she said that I could join any of the Avengers teams of my choosing. And you guessed it, I decided to join the Great Lakes Avengers here in Detroit!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, was there any particular reason why you decided to join the GLA, Gwenpool? You do realize that they're not as popular as Iron Man or Spider-Man, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"Well, duh! I'm well-aware that they're not as popular as those two. But hey, I'm pretty popular right now, so maybe it'll rub off onto them! Now, if you'll excuse me, Vocal: I've got an Avengers team to join!\"</span></span></div></div>",

Obviously a little too excited from finally joining the superhero equivalent of the big leagues, Gwenpool inhaled and exhaled a few deep breaths whilst she thought, \"Calm down, Gwen. It's no big deal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"No big deal?! YOU'RE JOINING THE FREAKING AVENGERS!!\" </span> Her inner thoughts exclaimed, which didn't exactly with settling down the butterflies in her stomach. Of course, Gwenpool eventually regained her casual composure and said to herself, \" *sigh* Alright, girl. Here goes nothing.\" From there, Gwenpool approached the main entrance to the facility, with a duffle bag full of her usual weapons of choice slung over her left shoulder. Once she was through the front entrance and inside the factory interior, Gwenpool noticed that the place felt a little...vacant? No, more like \"almost empty\" would be the right context. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in an attempt to see if this was the right address and if the place was truly abandoned, Gwenpool spoke aloud and said, \"Hello? Is anyone here? Is this the headquarters of the Great Lakes Avengers? Hellooooo?\" Of course, the only thing that responded back was the echoes of her voice bouncing around the large interior, causing her to shrug a little as she spoke to herself and said, \"That's...weird. Why isn't there anybody here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"Maybe they got possessed and turned into Deadites like in Evil Dead.\"</span> Her inner thoughts remarked, which made Gwenpool roll her eyes in a \"whatever\" gesture. Fortunately, after a few minutes of wandering around the spacious derelict factory interior, she looked up and noticed some lights coming out of a lit room upstairs on the 2nd floor. Upon discovering this, Gwenpool couldn't help but display a hopeful smirk on her masked face as she thought, \"Aha! I knew this place wasn't abandoned.\" From there, shortly after discovering that there were potential signs of civilization inside the manufacturing plant, Gwenpool casually ascended up flight of stairs until she was on the same floor as the lit room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was just outside the room, she slowly approached the window pane, peeking inside to see none other than the Great Lakes Avengers! Mr. Immortal, Flatman, Doorman, Goodness Silva AKA Good Boy, and last but not least, Bertha Crawford AKA \"Big Bertha\". Back on Earth-TRN565, Gwenpool had always considered Big Bertha as her favorite hero and idol, as well as having a, um... \"crush\" on the plus-sized superheroine. And yet, there they were, The Great Lakes Avengers, the obscure underdogs of the Marvel Universe, sitting at the circular table, conversing about...something, with their Defense Attorney, a woman named Connie Ferrari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, despite being unable to read lips, Gwenpool could easily tell that by judging from the looks on each of their faces, something in the blonde heroine's gut told her that things weren't exactly looking... \"positive\" for the Great Lakes Avengers as a whole. In fact, they look like they just absolutely lost a big battle against a lesser-known supervillain. \"Damn. They look so bummed out. What the hell happened?\" Gwenpool thought to herself, wondering if now was a good time to come back at a later date or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"Aww! Come on, Gwen! You didn't just traveled across a quarter to 1/3rd of the country only to have second thoughts! You wanted to join the GLA? Then get your leotard-clad ass in there right now!\"</span> Her inner thoughts assertively exclaimed, which forced Gwenpool to do as her inner thoughts demanded as she retorted, \"Alright, alright! Jeez, my inner thoughts be such a pain.\" From there, still wanting to join the Great Lakes Avengers, Gwenpool casually trotted over toward the double mahogany doors, then administered a few firm knocks on the doors, which snapped Connie Ferrari and the Great Lakes Avengers out of their conversation, as they all instinctively turned their heads towards the source of the noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Wonder who that could be?\" Good Boy asked, as she stood up from her seat at the table and began to approach the double doors. However, Big Bertha, still wearing the yellow one-piece swimsuit when she fought against Doctor Nod and his morbidly obese Bod Squad, soon stood up from her chair, placing a somewhat plump but firm hand on Goodness's shoulder as she said, \"Hold on a sec, Goodness! It might be Dick Snerd behind those doors.\" Obviously, Bertha knew that there was a bit of a possibility that Councilman Dick Snerd, who also happens to be the vigilante turned supervillain known as \"Nein Rouge\", might have returned hellbent on revenge against the GLA for what happened to him when they interrogated him for evidence of his criminal activities.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Of course, knowing that there was a chance that Councilman Snerd might be just outside their door with possibly a dozen goons to back him up, Goodness Silva heeded Big Bertha's potential warning, as she slowly and cautiously approached the double doors, making sure not to physically announce their presence to Snerd or whoever was behind the doors. From there, Goodness slowly crept up to the door, and peeked through the door's peephole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, instead of seeing Councilman Snerd and a dozen of his cronies waiting outside their door, the bluenette girl saw quite an... \"unusual\" and unexpected visitor, who looked like a pink and white female version of Deadpool, carrying a fully loaded duffle bag. \"...Well, Goodness? Who is it?\" Flatman asked, as he and the others were a bit tense, where Good Boy then spoke toward them and answered, \"Actually, guys... It's not Snerd and his thugs.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to Goodness's words, Flatman, Connie Ferrari, and the rest of the Great Lakes Avengers (...Okay, Ex-Avengers) exhaled a sigh of relief from such a revelation. However, Mr. Immortal then spoke up and said, \"Alright, but...who the hell's at the door then?\" From there, Goodness looked through the peephole once again, just as Gwenpool began knocking on the door a few times as she said, \"Helloooo? Anybody home? I'm here to join the Great Lakes Avengers!\" A short moment or two later, Goodness peered away from the peephole, looking back at Flatman and the others as she explained, \"...Well, um... This might sound weird, guys, but... She looks a little like Deadpool, only her costume's white and pink. Why? Does that sound familiar?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A white and pink female Deadpool...\" Doorman thought to himself, recollecting his thoughts about who and where he's met this person before. However, after a short moment or two, Doorman eventually recognized who Goodness Silva was describing, where he then spoke toward his fellow Ex-Avengers and said, \"Hold on for a moment, guys.\" From there, Doorman began to press his hands against a nearby wall, peeling open a Darkforce portal to traverse through, just as Flatman and the rest of the group noticed what he was doing, prompting Big Bertha to speak toward him, where she placed her somewhat plump hands on her plus-sized hips and asked, \"And where do you think you're going, DeMarr?\" \"Me? I'm going to personally see who's at our doorstep, Bertha. After all, from what Goodness here described our visitor, she might be someone I am familiar with.\" Doorman answered, as he then entered through the Darkforce portal he created, which led him just outside the GLA's apartment, only a few yards above Gwenpool's current position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Doorman easily recognized who their visitor was, as he then spoke aloud and said, \"...Gwenpool? Is that you?\" In response to what Doorman had just said, Gwenpool quickly looked up whilst pulling out and aiming her handguns upwards, only to lower them upon recognizing DeMarr Davis AKA Doorman. Then, she casually waved a friendly hand at Doorman, greeting the Darkforce user as she said, \"Oh hey, Doorman! Long time, no see!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Doorman dismounted himself from the self-made Darkforce portal with relative ease, where he then landed just a few feet away from Gwenpool, as he then spoke toward her and replied, \"Yeah, it kinda has been a long time, GP. Haven't seen you since we beat up that Ghost Rider knockoff, Vengeance, six months ago. So... How's life treating you?\" Of course, looking back at the adventures she has endured over the past six months, one would say that she went through a lot of sh*t. So, in response to Doorman's question, Gwenpool rubbed the back of her masked head a little and answered, \"...Well, you could say a lot of sh*t went down that I got involved with, \"D-Man\". I mean, I tried joining up with the Champions, buuuut... It wasn't exactly my cup of Joe, if you know what I mean.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*chuckle* Well, it sounds like you were certainly keeping yourself busy. So, what brings you here all the way to Detroit, Michigan, GP?\" Doorman asked, calling Gwenpool by the initials \"GP\", along with asking why she was here in Detroit in the first place. \"Oh, that's easy, D-Man: I'm here to join you and Great Lakes Avengers! ...Why? You got some villain problems that need to be sorted out?\" Gwenpool answered, pounding her right gloved fist into her left gloved hand a few times upon mentioning said \"villain problems\"  with a sense of eager anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F*ck! She doesn't know that me and the GLA just got fired!\" Doorman thought to himself, realizing that Gwenpool might have not gotten the memo regarding the now disbanded Great Lakes Avengers. So, hoping that he didn't have to be the one to tell her the truth, Doorman cleared his voice a little and replied, \"Oh, um... Yeah, we kinda have some \"villain problems\" that we're kinda dealing with before you got here, GP. Its just that it's a little more...complicated than we previously thought. Anyway, I'll let the others know you're okay to enter. Just give me a minute.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Gwenpool watched as Doorman became intangible, allowing him to seamlessly phase through the double doors with ease. Once he fully phased through the doors, Doorman spoke toward his superpowered peers, reassuring them as he explained, \"Don't worry, guys. She's a friend of mine. Definitely doesn't work for that a$$hole Snerd.\"</span></div></div>",
