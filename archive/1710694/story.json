Stewie threw a tantrum as he went through his mind, thinking about the latest attempt he made to kill Lois. He had it all perfectly set up. A gun in the cupboard and the trigger connected to the door by a string. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was simple, yet brilliant.\" he thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept that their was one fatal flaw. The gun jammed due to Stewies' sloppy loading of a gun. Lois screamed at the sight of the gun, but she quickly shook it off thinking it was just one of Peter's pranks. Lois just stashed the gun into the gun safe they kept in their bedroom and continued with her daily chores. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rupert! That woman just keeps ruining my plans\" he yelled. \"Stewie! Take your nap!\" Lois hollered. Stewie seethed and growled more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will I ever stop that damnable woman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStewie paced around the room as Rupert replied with his usual response of silence. Stewie flips through his music collection to find something to calm his nerves when he found the answer to his problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it Rupert!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStewie held up the Kurt Cobian CD. The obese musician took up a generous portion of the album cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Lois is too fat to move she will be easier to kill\" Stewie said in delight. He imagined it now. Lois slowly waddling away as Stewie put a bullet in her head or Lois being too fat to move as Stewie submerges her in 1,000 foot deep water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStewie runs into his lab and creates a....</span></div></div>",

The housewife pushed the covers away and walked towards the bathroom to start a new day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois did the usual wash her face, brush her teeth, and etc. But wait! Something was different this morning. \"Oh what the hell?\" she mumbled as Lois tried to button the last two slots of her teal green blouse. Eventually Lois gave up on it.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to last nights binge and the mysterious spray that hit Lois it appears that our hero housewife has gained a few in the midsection. \"Can't believe I gained this belly in one night!\" she said poking her mid-sized potbelly. Soon as expected by the reader her stomach grumbled for food. \"Well it's time to start my diet with a healthy breakfast!\" she said with \u00a0motivation. Lois walked down stairs annoyed by her new belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the kitchen Lois was met with a sudden fright! \"Oh my God! Did I do all this?\" She exclaimed looking at the kitchen in it's current form. Bits and pieces of food all over the ground. Chairs on the floor, the fridge wide open with nothing inside, and stuff smeared on the walls.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow I must have been hungry last night.\" she said blushing. Lois's belly grumbled with hunger again. Lois clutched her hungry self not able to sustain it. \"Oh maybe I should go out for breakfast for something to eat and then I'll come back to clean this up.\" Said Lois picking up her cars keys and locking the front door before she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriving into town was harder than Lois thought it would be. It was hard keeping focus on the road when every ad and billboard made her head turn and her mouth water showing off the food they had. \"Darn! So many choices!\" she said. Unable to control her hunger Lois sped into a McBurgertown parking lot. \"Finally some food!\" she growled.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois grabbed all the cash she had in her purse and ran inside. Lois's mouth had watered even more when she could smell the heavenly scent of fried foods and grease. Waiting in line behind 3 people Lois's hunger got strong. \"Just be Patient. Just be Patient\" Lois chanted to herself.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the front if the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe greasy sickly teen had a 'I don't Care' look on his face but Lois did care... About her food! The orange haired housewife slammed the stack of cash on the counter. \"Get me the whole menu! Everything! And MegaSize me!\" she said. The cashier fiddled with register and handed her the receipt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois had a long wait of one hour. During her wait Lois's metabolism changed so that anything she ate would go to straight fat. This would mean a big gain. So the spray had done it's job onto Lois and released itself in a form of a burp, flying right into the exhaust vent up above.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois taped the table in front of her waiting for the meal she was about to have. Then a bunch of workers come out holding trays of food towards her and laid them out on the table. And without a work retreated back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Lois ate. And ate and ate and ate and ate.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lois rubbed her belly in satisfaction of the new found freedom. Lois piled more and more cakes and pies onto her plate. \"Ugh this will be sooooo good\" Lois drooled. She turned around and headed back to her seat with Bonnie. Bonnie also couldn't believe every earthquake like ripple appeared on Lois with every step that she took. Especially were Lois' big boobs jiggled alot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting her plate full of delectable sweets onto the table Lois began to sit down until she heard a loud rip coming from behind her.

And i kinda like it!\" Bonnie thought with a smile growing wider.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois shoved the last spoonful of pie down her gullet and laid back on her chair with a loud yawn. \"Ugh! I think I ate a little 'burp' too much.\" Lois said rubbing her aching belly. \"Maybe it's time to go.\" Bonnie inquired. Lois agreed and stood up with no trouble except having her pants rip off entirely. Lois blushed beet red \"Let's hit the clothing store first before we go anywhere else.\" Lois said as Bonnie stared at Lois' big butt in stretched out Panties as she walked out the double doors leaving the greeter in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Confusion washed across her face as she looked up at the now plumper Meg who had a smirk on her face and the fat ray gun in her hand. \"Meg, you didn't... You did?\" The tingling in her body subsequently turned into sharp pain as Lois doubled over in agony. \"What's happening to me?\" Meg sadistically watched her former Miss Teen Rhode Island mother clench her gut and cringe as it pushed against her teal blouse, straining the bottom two buttons and eventually causing them to pop. Lois' newfound belly then proceeded to fill in her pants to the point where the button across the room and into Meg's flabby midsection and the zipper broke and slid all the way down, leaving her growing pudge to sag over the edge of her now ruined pants. Lois' eyes were squeezed shut as the unbearable pain slowly made it's way around her ballooning body. Her once perfectly shaped hips turned into love handles that caused her thighs to follow suit as they became globular and ripped the seams on both sides of her pants. Her calves were next to expand as they became soft and dough like, forming canopies and causing her feet to swell and grow slightly larger. As her lower portion's expansion finally subsided, Lois felt her breasts grow sore and expand causing the final two buttons of her favorite blouse to give way and snap. Her bra tried to keep up with the once petite breasts it contained, but eventually gave up as it too snapped in the back and became stuck in between her breasts, which had gone from a B cup all the way up to a DD, and her now oversized stomach that now resembled Peter's. She cried out for help as her shoulders and arms filled out with fat that crept its way all the way down her arms into her chubby hands, and outwards to her fingers which grew to where they resembled sausages. Lois was now crying as her neck turned into a turkey gizzard, she developed an obvious double chin, and lastly, her face that was now streaked In tears grew rounder and her cheeks puffed out as if she were playing chubby bunny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the pain finally subsided, what was left of the once healthy Lois had deteriorated into a 250 pound blob lying on the kitchen floor. Lois immediately noticed she was no longer in pain and opened her eyes to survey the damage the ray gun had done to her. It didn't even take seeing her flabbiy arms to make Lois scream and grunt as she had a hard time using the kitchen table to help support her massive form as she stood up, ripping the seat of her pants in the process. Meg walked over to her panicked mother and prodded her enourmous belly, causing the flab to quiver and giving Lois a sensations he had never felt before. Lois realized that she was once again fat, and so far, she was baton every second of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well mom, maybe next time you'll think before you take your anger out on others.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meg, look at me! I'm huge! I can't be seen like this! What will everyone else think of me? It's all because of this stupid gun. Wait a second, this gun... Didn't I take it from Stewie? I've got to get to the bottom of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeg watched as her mammoth mother did her best to waddle out of the kitchen, her new layer of padding shaking violently with every step Lois took.

Now Lois I've got a surprise for you and might I add its quite delightful.\" said Stewie as he pulled out a medical waste bag. \"Now lets see Lois do you remember when you got liposuction from overeating?\" \"What do you got there Stewie is it a new toy?\" again Lois totally unaware of the situation. \"A new toy!? no you moronic cow! this is the fat you got sucked out of you and guess what I'm going do with it Lois\" Stewie said attaching a hose to it. \"Stewie do you have a surprise for me?\" \"Indeed I do\" said Stewie as he shoved the hose in Lois's mouth pumping all the fat Lois previously had removed back into her. Lois struggled but to no avail, fat was filling her body, her already 250 pound body was growing even fatter. Her green shirt began popping buttons off one by one as the fat in her boobs overflowed out of her bra. Her pants ripped right in half as her ass widened and thighs became smothered in fat. As the bag containing Lois's fat emptied its last bit of fat into Lois's fat face, Lois now weighed over 500 pounds. Lois now too fat to move was now totally under Stewie's control. \"Splendid now I have you where I want you. You'll never leave here again but don't worry about the family they won't even notice your gone.\" Then a robot Lois came out (thin) and went to go replace Lois.

The only noteworthy item was Meg's long lost collection of frozen hotdogs that were now spoiled and smelling worse than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, Rupert. I don't think I can find a subject in the house...wait what's that?\" Stewie leaned closer to Rupert, \"In the fat man's closet? Janet Jameson? Oh, that's right! Janet Jameson! Rupert, your'e a genius!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStewie dashed off to the master bedroom where he dove into the closet to find it much larger than anticipated, \"What the-What the hell?

Come on, Rupert this would be a lot easier if you'd just co-operate for once, \"Janet!\" A muffled cry came from behind one of the piles, \"See isn't that much easier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoving his way through the piles of miscellaneous stuff, Stewie finally found Janet Jameson still clad in the red dress and tied to a chair, \"Thank God!

Just a little experimentation. Although it could use room for improvement. HA! Room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet continued to swell until the ropes fully tore from her sides and the chair broke under her increasing weight. Stewie chuckled as Janet's body jiggled upon impact. Janet continued to grow while the floor boards screamed. Janet's belly exploded through her dress while he breasts destroyed her bra. The sides of Janet's clothing split while the sides of the thighs ripped as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh!\" Janet and Stewie said in unison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all that eating, Lois had come up to 198 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really hasn't found the time to buy more fitting clothes. And it was obvious, given to her strained button up shirt with tears in the love handles, and her pants hugged her lower half all too tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois sucked the ketchup and grease from her pudgy fingers, \"More food, Ms. Griffin?\" Lois greedily licked her lips and nodded, \"It'll be out in just a minute.....make that several minutes\".

Her sports bra was stretching over the expanded bust and her ass was huge now that it did the same on her shorts but it was either this or running in the nude.

Her body may be in pain but she sure was hungry. Her stomach growled loudly even though she had only eaten recently. \"I'M HUNGRY AGAIN! What is... wrong with me?\" Lois patted her bloated stomach. She was frightened and on the verge of tears. She believed her growth may be some kind of allergic reaction or something and she hoped the growth was only temporary and it would disappear if she worked hard. The determined housewife picked herself back up a minute later and started running once more, she was still out of breath but there was a fire burning inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter would usually break into some kind of comedic act but on this occasion, he was concerned for his wife. Her cell phone rang and he picked it up but there were only sounds of laughter on the other phone, then Joyce whispered: \"...soon!\". \"Huh, must be a prank caller\" He hung up the phone and he proceeded to support his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute passed and Lois once again collapsed.

Neither were the counselors wanted to help me. the camp stop being about weight loss a while ago. so I continue to try to do something. however, I started to get lazier myself. it was from eating all of the camp food. it was very delicious and highly fattening. there was nothing I can do but eat it. not only that but my overall diet has change as well. I am hunger more offend and I feel happy when I eat. so that is why I got...well, so fat!\" once she was finish talking, she gave stomach a big slap. upon impact with her hand, her belly shook violently. Meg was stunned by this. she walked up to her mother and felt her stomach. to make sure she was not dreaming. sure enough, she was not dreaming. \" yeah, you got really fat. well there is nothing I can but did they fire you?\" Lois, with her half finish sandwich said,\" no, I got out of that place without anyone looking. I will call tomorrow that I have lose interest with the place.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeg nodded her head in agreement. \"well it is late and I want to good back into bed. we can figure out what to do in the mourning.\" Lois just finished her meal and got up from her chair. \" what do you mean by just us? the whole family is going to know so why not bring them in.\" Meg now headed out of the kitchen and yawned.\"oh...yeah...you do not know that Peter took everyone but me camping.\" Lois followed her out of the kitchen. \"what!? well that changes everything then. I still have time to undue my mistake. how come you did not join them?\" Meg turn back to her mother and said,\" do I look like a camping person to you.\" \"well, I guess you are right. at least you understand and I can count on you. maybe I can count on you helping me get some bigger clothes for the time being.\" Both Lois and Meg when to there rooms.

Any pounds that the kids lost were regain within a weeks time. So it was not a lost cause, well not yet at least. In the mean time, she will need to get back to her thin self. If that is even possible in a place like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, the kids were free to do what ever they wanted to do. Lois had some time for her self, good to do a workout. She was in the cabin were her group of kids stayed in. It was also where she slept in the camp. She had a room to her self where she changed into her workout clothes. Due to her increased size, her clothes barely fit her anymore. Her soft belly poked out of her shirt and the pants were skin tight on her legs. Yet Lois did not care, it will not bother her once she is working out. She entered the living room area of the cabin. It had enough space for a workout.       <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment when a group of kids came in. They were some of the boys that Lois took care of. As they entered, the boys notice Lois in her work out clothes. \"Hey Mrs. Griffin, those clothes do not fit you any more\" said a nerdy looking  black kid. \"Yes that is true but they will soon fit me again once I start working out. I was actually going to workout right now. It is a free day today so I want to keep myself busy. Do you kids care to join me in a bit of an exercise?\" Even if Lois is more focus on losing her fatty weight. She did not forget her previous mission of making these kids healthy. Plus she did not mind company while she worked out.\" Ah no thanks...we just came in to play some video games in our room. We will leave you alone\" said a white kid. \"Well I am not going to force you but it is our day off. Beside you guys are not the only ones who need to lose weight.\" Lois slapped her fatty belly to show off her new girth. \"It's okay beside we are still sore from jogging yesterday\" spoke the nerdy black kid. The group walked pass their supervisor into their room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then one of the camp counselors walk in. It was an obese young man in his early 20s. \"Ah Lois there you are. I was meaning to ask you some things. How are you liking your stay here?\" Lois wonder why he would asked that from her. \" I am enjoying it so far. better than stuck at home I can tell you that much for sure.\" \"Well okay than. It seems that some of our campers have complaints. They have been telling me that you push them harder when playing sports. Some have even told me that you want them to lose weight. Now I have told you before that this camp is not a weight loss camp. You should have looked into that before joining. However you are still one of the supervisors here and a part of the team. So you can stick with us, it is still early summer and we need all the help we can get. If you do want to keep your job, I suggest that you change some things around. Beside it seems that your body has grown to love it here.\" Lois was aware that she needs to stop eating the food at this camp. \"Well I was about to exercise before you came in.\" \"As I said before, the kids are the ones who should not lose weight. If they lose weight, we will lose money and the camp will close. We do not mind if you want to be thin again.So it is up to you on how your summer will go. With us or at your house.\" Lois nodded to the counselor. \"Also before I leave, their will be brand new kids coming from out of state to join us. You might take care of a few yourself so we will be extra busy this summer. Enjoy your day off, Mrs. Griffin.\"        <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the camp counselor left, Lois thought about what the counselor said.While she did that she was working out for a hour. From push-ups to sit-ups, she got tried quick. This is something that Lois will have to get used to. Being obese has it setbacks. Even if you was once Obese before. When she was done, she sat on the couch and ponder on what to do next. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thinking on what the counselor said, she started to think that the kids hated her. She was the only camp counselor that was going against what this place is for. She felt a little bit bad for pushing the kids so hard. Plus she decided that she will spend the rest of her summer at this camp. Lois notice that she has not even weigh herself yet to much her horror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois went to her room and closed the door be hide her. She changed her clothes to her counselors clothes. Under her bed, there was a personal scale just for her. She stepped on it and waited to see what it will say. With a beep, Lois saw in horror what the numbers are.<i> Over 300 pounds!</i> Lois really felt her body shake as she thought about those numbers. She could not believe that she has grown that fat. There is no turning back now. She will have to live with it and get used to it while working here. By the end of summer, she will have to get back to her thin self. There is no way she can come back to Quahog like this. Her family and friends will be shock to see her. On the other hand, Peter would not mind it. Regardless of that, it will be hard to explain how she gained all that weight. Too much to explain and too surreal to even believe. The lardy counselor stepped off the scale and put it back in its place.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Lois was done with that, she exited her room. As she was walking past the boy's room, heard that the campers were playing their video games. She decided to check on the boys. Lois entered the room and notice the four boys near a TV at the end of the room. They were too focus on their video game that they did not hear Lois come in. The two boys that talked to Lois earlier in the day were playing while the other fat kids cheered on. Lois surveyed the room and remember finding snacks and candy all over the room. She wondered if the kids have already hid more snacks in the cabin. The boys were having fun and Lois did not want to bother them but was glad that they are okay.       <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois returned to the leaving room and so that it was past noon. There are is still time to do a lot of things in the day. It was lunch time and Lois has not eaten anything yet. However she was worried that she might gain more pounds eating the food here. She can still exercise but not doing her normal workout. Outside the cabin, she saw many of the counselors and campers enjoying the lake near by. Swimming was an excellent way to exercise and a perfect way to cool off from the heat. The red hair lady pondered on what to do next.    </span></div></div>",

It did not care were the food came from. A walk away was the camp cafeteria were overweight kids eat peacefully. That can be her there with them right now. She can also hop into her car and drive out of the camp to the nearest town. Problem is that it is about an hour away. Lois can no longer wait, she will have lunch onsite. Before she left, she remembers about her group. She entered their room and approach them. \"It's lunch time and I want you guys to eat something.\" The boys turned off the game console and rushed out of the room. Lois followed them to the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamp Putdowndafork was a big place.Which is understandable due to the new mission that this camp has set out to accomplish. The place was shaped like a horse shoe surrounding a small lake. It was always like this since its inception. The camp still resemble liked its previous self. Some of the buildings still had weight loss posters up. Each building had signs that reenforced healthy eating. With all of this to still change, it does explain why the counselors really need the help here. Overall, the place was going through some growing pains as it welcomes its new look. As if the counselors decided to change the camp's image over night. In due time, the camp will be completely changed. It was a nice observation that Lois thought of as she waddle towards the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois approach the cafeteria counter. The four kids were ahead of her already picking and choosing what to eat. She took a tray as wide as her body is now. This tray could fit just about anything the cafeteria can make. From what the boys are piling on to their tray, this seems to be true. Lois scanned the counter for what was being served today. She saw that the main section of the counter had pizzas, hot dogs, and french fries. There was a salad bar at the end of the counter but Lois was overtaken by the wonderful smells coming from the main section. She knows that she should focus on the salad bar however her stomach said other wise. Lois was grabbing slices of pizza and rearranging them so she can fit the rest of what she will put. The jumbo sized french fries covered the pizza. Sitting on top of the french fries were the foot long hot dogs. Her tray was still not filled up yet. Lois glance over and saw a dessert section on the counter. Brownies, doughnuts, and cookies of all kinds lay across the counter. Lois lick her lips as she took some of the treats off the counter. She took a small bite out of a doughnut and was pleased that she took some more. Her tray had become completely filled up. Lois was ready to sink her teeth into this meal she had made for her self.Her group were gather together toward the exit of the cafeteria. \"What are you all doing standing around here, find a place to sit down. There is plenty of room to...sit...\" Lois did not realize that the cafeteria was packed. Not a single seat was wasted in this room. \"Hmm...I guess we can not eat here. Oh I know, lets take our meals back with us to our cabin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids arrived at the cabin before Lois did.She was always amazed at how much energy the kids had. the moment food is involved, the boys make a mad dash for it. Lois found it kind of cute. She unlocked the cabin and let the boys sit down in the living room. Lois sat her big butt opposite the boys. The cabin's living room was equipped with three couches, enough room for all of them. Once they all found a place to sit, they dug into their meals. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After they have finished their lunch,they lay back patting their big bellies. The group was stuff to the brim. Lois was the first to speak. \"Ah, that was a good meal! This camp food is so damn good. I have to really thank those cooks who make this.\" Even if all the food was junk food, it was the best junk food that she ever had. The Black nerdy kid named Lewis sat closest to Lois. He gave out a loud burp. \"I do not know what they put into the food that they make but it was tasty.\" As he said that he gave out another burp. Lois and the rest of the kids laugh at Lewis noisy response. \"I have been thinking that I have been really harsh on all of you. So I decided that I will no longer push you to lose weight.\" The kids faces beamed with excitement upon hearing these words. \"That being said, I still don't want you kids hiding sacks all over this cabin,that stays outside. You can play video games once in a while but I want you kids having more fun outside. Plus what is the real reason you all came to this camp. Do you really want to gain weight?\" Blank expressions was all that Lois saw. The kids stared at one and other, waiting to see who would go first. A white kid named Jimmy broke the silence.\" I did not come here to gain weight, I do not mind it though. I like going camping but the last camp that I went to people always made fun of my weight. Not here because everyone is fat.\" The rest of the kids nodded in agreement. Lewis spoke next, \" yeah I always get picked on because I am fat and like star wars.\" Lois heard this and thought of something to say. \"Forget about all that, here we stick together in camp putdownthefork, unless they change the name. You are correct, Jimmy, we are all fat. Even if I was thin a week ago, I am still in the same place as you all are. After all, I am your friend here and I care about you.\" The campers before her cheered in unison. It was nice that the kids have accepted Lois as their counselor. \"So just curious, how was your week her in camp?\" The group continued to talk about recent events that they did in camp. The two kids that followed Lois's campers said their goodbyes and departed to their cabins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a hour had past, Lois felt not so full anymore. All she could think at the moment was that if she gain more pounds. Her camp clothes were tight on her already. With a few more pounds, she will ruin them. Love handles were clearly visible, pressing against her shirt. By now, mostly all her clothes that she packed no longer fit her. Luckily, the camp clothes come in bigger sizes for both campers and supervisors. However, the fact that she may continue to grow disturbed her. She no longer wanted to focus on that and focus on something else. The lardy red head glance towards the boys. She over heard them talking about recent activates that they part took in the past week. It dawn on her that today was Sunday. Every Sunday the supervisor that is assign to a cabin, Lois was assign to cabin #2, was to report on their campers. These reports focus on the overall group that were on her care. How they are getting along with others and the camp itself. Most of all, how is the camper's weight. This was something that Lois has not done yet. she stud up and said, \"before I forget I have to record and measure each of you. So sit tight while I go and get my things ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving returned with scale and measuring tape in hand, Lois told the kids to line up. she place the scale on the floor and opened a desk near by. this was her personal desk that had many of the papers that belong to her including the reports. The report themselves were blank but she will fill them up with information in no time. The first in line was Lewis.\"Alright boys, take your shoes off and step on. If I remembered correctly, your starting weight was about 235. You lost 10 pounds but than regain it.\" The nerdy lad step on the scale and waited for the results.\" 240, five whole pounds gained.Ah...good for you, Lewis. You are following this camp's example.\" Lois was still getting used to the idea that these kids will end up fatter by summer's end. Next up was Jimmy and by far one of the fattest kids under Lois's care. \"Ah, Jimmy, your starting and current weight is 250. So that means that your new weight is....257! Boy, you sure like to eat.\" The third to step on was Tomas, the thinnest of the bunch. Unlike the rest, he was overweight, However that is not going to last very long. \"okay Tomas, you came to camp as 200 but I think that has changed a bit. The number is 205...no...210! Wow, you actually gain the most so far. This camp will make you obese in no time.\" Lois wrote down the number that she was present to her. The fact that there was no way of escaping the camp's fattening powers gave Lois a shiver. Last in line was Jacob, The largest kid in Lois's group. He weighed 275 before stepping on the scale. \"Now Jacob, let's see how much you weigh. Oh...just two pounds gained. I guess you are slow to put on girth. Wish that were to happen to me.\" The fat supervisor plug in the number into her report and set them a side. She told them to line up again but this time to be measured. what she will focus on will be their waists, arms, and legs. To see where all that weight when to. Just as Lois had thought, they all gain several inches everywhere. she did run into an interesting problem though. \"Jacob, Could you please stop moving around so much. It makes my job hard to see this numbers on the tape with you giggling around like that.\" what Lois failed to realize was that Jacob was really ticklish on the side of his belly. The rest of the boys found it funny. Jacob just exposed himself to his weak spot. \"There...finish! let me just complete the rest of the reports and I will be done may duties.\" Before she left, she grab one of Jacob's rolls and gave it a shake. The poor kid burst out laughing at the unsuspecting gesture. \"why are you so ticklish? it is rather amusing.\" Lois grin as she released the kid from her grip. The rest of the group snickered among themselves. \"oh don't be too ashamed of that. I think it is rather cute myself.\" Jacob blush a bit upon hearing those words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFat Lois really liked bonding with her group. It is as if she is getting to know them.It might have taken a weeks time to do so. However, better late than never and she does not want to change that. The boys were having a blast and she wants to continue that. Lois is just like the boys, she does not want a boring summer. This is the reason why the boys came to this camp. To have an experience that their mundane life can not provide. Sure Lois's body has change since she got here and the campers will end up heavier once they leave. In the end, it was for the better and nothing is permanent after all. Once summer ends, it is back to their normal lives. That is still months away and a lot of things can happen. It has been will over an hour and lunch has ended. Lois knew that it was a perfect time to invite the kids to an activity. She told the kids... </span></div></div>",

She had two big rolls on her belly the lowest one being a huge muffintop and the biggest kept Lois from being able to button up her shirt. \"Suck it in!\" she told herself. She was able to fasten the first three buttons. \"Good now for the other five.\" she had button the next 3 but couldn't go past her breasts. \"These things really grew\" trying to tighten her pink bra. The last buttons fastened. \"Ok now for pants\" grabbing her favorite pair she tried to slip them on but the motion stopped at her thighs. Lois went to the bathroom to look at herself. Chipmunk cheeks, double chin, puffy arms, big stomach, bigger boobs, wide waist, big butt, thick thighs, and cankles. \"I need to lose weight.....next week though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh for gods sake!\" she swore trying to lift the pants higher. Nothing. Embarrassed Lois grabbing a larger pair of pants from the closet and they fit. \"Huh I just got these as a joke for Peter last year.\" whined Lois.

If you spread word about this restaurant to more than 30 people you get free pizza for a year!\" he exclaimed. \"For a year.....\" Lois repeated.

An organized crime syndicate out of Springfield (Whatever-state) was paying six thousand dollars per mile of road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeg and a few friends from jail had jacked road buildling equptment and were delivering a mile of road per month to the crime syndicate. What they were doing with that road, Meg could care less. It was a low profile crime that had almost no police attention. they were hitting several states but never Rhode Island or the neighboring states. Her job was to drive the trucks to the destination; no heavy lifting for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Urrrrrp!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeg let out a blech, causing her large, full belly to shake like jelly. She wiped her mouth with a napkin  and resumed her fifth burger at McBurgertown. Great thing about the town of Quahog, salads cost ten bucks but you could get a burger for two, It wasn't like she was watching her waist or anything; at three hundred pounds she was definitely looking like her father's daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeg still had a lot of anger over her bad childhood and upbringing. Hence the eating; it was a way to deal with her problems. Stealing roads was fun and all but she still had unresolved issues. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meg!\" shouted a voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, Meg went for the gun at her immense waiste when she saw that it was only her mother. Then it was only the public nature of her place that was keeping her from blowing away Lois Griffin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois's jaw had dropped at the sight of her estranged only daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeg stood up, light glancing over her fattened body. The tank top she wore exposed well her prison tattoos, now on fattened arms with bingo wings. A large belly hung over her belt and under the tanktop too small; her belly split in two around the belly button. Just on the crest of her obese gut was a tattoo that read \"Chub life.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"you've got three seconds before I clock you, Lois.\" Meg warned in a dangerous voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois lowered her gaze at Meg's intense anger. Normally she would have made a smart remark at Meg's weight, but Meg didn't look like she was in the forgiving mood. \"Look, I'll buy your dinner, Meg.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeg nodded as her belly rumbled again; damn hunger. \"yeah, Alright.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois gasped for breath at the all you can eat buffet she'd taken Meg to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe price was affordable enough but Meg had forced Lois to match her appetite. Already the buttons on Lois's shirt were nearly popping off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeg though was looking like a work of art, she'd undone her belt and jeans long ago and now her ass pushed out of her jeans and belly pushed forward. She was like the Venus Willendorf out of jail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeg belched once more and patted her large belly, \"Meet me same time next week, match what I eat and pick up the tab.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know where Lois's guilt was coming from but she was going to milk it for all it was worth.</span></div></div>",

Welcome to McBurgertown. How may I serve you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie Swanson, wife to Joe Swanson, stuck her head out of the window, \u201cI\u2019ll have a small chicken salad and a medium cup of water.\u201d She said retreating into the car biting her lip. The teenager on the other side repeated the order for clarity and as polite as it was, he just had to ask, \u201cIs that all?\u201d Bonnie, of course, knew it damn well wasn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have a two number nines. A number nine large. A number six with extra dip. A number seven. Two number forty fives, one with cheese\u2026and a large soda\u2026and another large diet soda.\u201d She drew herself back into the car with an exasperated sigh. Bonnie drove up to the drive thru window and collected her once reasonable order now feast for a family of five and put it into the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne employee stepped by the drive-thru window, \u201cDid she do that order again?\u201d The other stood by, \u201cYeah.\u201d Another moment, \u201cDid she not pay again?\u201d Again, \u201cNope.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, corporate does not give a fuck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaper bags crinkled loudly from Bonnie\u2019s hands ruffling around for any type of greasy nourishment. She consumed with messy abandon, leaving condiment splatters remain on her puffy face and crumbs tumbling down onto her billowing cleavage. Bonnie took the top bun from a burger and piled on as many fries and onion rings onto it as possible then pressing the bun on to once more to eat the self made combination, \u201cAh! So good!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Bonnie eats, an explanation for her sudden growth in appetite is in order. Bonnie, during her pregnancy, used to be able to control her appetite. Aerobic class combined with a low carb diet kept her figure in check while carrying her his cooking skills and positive attitude. <br>\r\nYet, as most failed crash diets would have it. Bonnie partook in a slice of cheese cake while attending a party thrown by the Griffins. She carelessly enjoyed it. She enjoyed it with much ecstasy. It was the first tasteful sin she\u2019s had in a long time! That one measely slip-up on her diet flung her down a slippery slope of odd cravings and never satisfying appetite. Late night fast food trips and as many deserts as she could get her hands on changed her figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, a little ten pounds found its home around her hips and breasts. Bonnie didn\u2019t mind the extra wiggle and bounce in her stride. Joe seemed to like it more than she did. Then came the massive cravings for carbs. Beef-dipped sandwiches, double battered fries, dozens of donuts all for a simple snack after nothing for hours. Bonnie\u2019s little ten pound gain blew up into a fourty-five pound weight gain she had a while ago. Her trademark purple dress had clung tightly around her body like saran wrap. <br>\r\nAt this point, house chores became tiring and taxing on Bonnie. Her dress would become drenched in sweat by the time she had finished dusting the house. Yet, after every little chore she rewarded herself with a feast of pizza. The pizza came from Joe who had a pizza overlord delivery man in custody yet released him for the code for unlimited pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was concern about the unlimited pizza and Bonnie\u2019s weight. Yet, as stated by Joe Swanson, \u201cMy wife gets what she wants. And if she wants a man with working legs then I\u2019m pretty much screwed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis when Bonnie\u2019s weight had ballooned from the forty five pound gain to one hundred and ten. Making her tip the scales at two hundred and thirty five pounds. Sure, it would\u2019ve been a wakeup call having to climb up several dress sizes in a short amount of time, but nobody seemed to mind. Bonnie wasn\u2019t disturbed by the questions from her friends and Joe\u2019s never ending love kept her happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe know meet back with Bonnie, who is reclining in her car after scarfing down that incredible fast food feast. Her hands rub all over her distended, yet well fed stomach to ease the digestion. \u201cHuff. I gotta start going easy on those onion ring poppers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as her eyes nearly met to put her to slumber, a loud \u201cHURRAY\u201d came from somewhere close, \u201cHuh? What was that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie looks outside to see\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She waddled her big, heavy pregnant body outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got out there, there were a lot of people gathered around the tables. She signed up for the contest. $10 to get into the contest and if you win, you get $200. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the contest started there were 20 people including Bonnie, mostly bigger guys. The contest started and Bonnie grabbed multiple hot dogs at time time and shoveled them into her massive pregnant belly. She didn\u2019t even need to use water, she just grabbed the hot dogs and ate them. Her dress was already tight from all of her gorging, so she just took it off to give her belly room to grow. She was in a bikini now, and everyone in the crowd was drooling over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8 minutes was the time limit and after 8 minutes Bonnie had eaten 85 hot dogs, she slumped back in her chair and rubbed her large, distended belly. She had won the contest and the $200. She took the money, her dress and a few more hot dogs for the road, and she waddled her large pregnant self back home and shoveled the hot dogs down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowered herself into her recliner and chowed down on some more snacks and pizza. Her belly was obstructing some of her view. She was only in a bra and panties since her dress didn\u2019t really fit over her growing body. Her breasts were larger, her waist was bigger, her butt was bigger and her thighs had thickened. She sat there in her recliner, ate a ton of food, watched TV and rubbed her enormous belly.</span></div></div>",

She thought him being out of the house would be a good thing but with the lack of... anything to do, not even hate, left her bored. Though today's boredom was short lived as a knock came from the door. She got up and opened the door, revealing a fat Lois. \"Lois? Is that you?\" Bonnie asked, looking at her plump friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's me.\" Lois replied, her mouth sounding full. Bonnie took a moment to take Lois's new frame in. Her teal blouse only had one button fastened, with her newly enlarged DDD-cup cleavage taking up the top half and her distended, 6-inch belly taking up the bottom half. Her pants didn't fare much better. Bonnie noticed that the pants were left unbuttoned, revealing a bit of her neighbor's pink panties. She looked behind her neighbor for a quick second, seeing how her new ass strained the pants that held it, leaving large tears. Every other part of her just had a thin layer of fat on it, nothing special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but, um, why are you here?\" Bonnie asked, eyes fixed on her friends cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to invite ya over.\" Lois replied with a nonchalant wave of her hand. \"Maybe grab somethin' ta eat.\" Bonnie thought this over. She knew Lois was always the one to go overboard with something, and she often dragged others into it. But at the same time she had nothing better to do. She looked Lois dead in the eye and said...</span></div></div>",

Although, Jillian had failed to take note that most businesses around town would open up at 9 o' clock. It's currently 8 AM. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...wait a minute!\" Jillian, for once, had formed a good idea, \"What if I show up early? Then they'll have to give me a job on how <i>punctational</i> I am!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian made her way for the center of town were she passed Goldman's Pharmacy, the Drunken Clam, and Cleveland's Deli.

I'm making good time, but I can still show up earlier!\" The ditzy blonde cut across the street causing two cars to nearly crash and take the shortcut across the park. For someone reason, she didn't think about slowing down, taking a stroll, or thinking at all. Jillian just kept sprinting. That was until she darted through a bush and then, \"OOF! What the...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Jillian's eyes could spot were a shadow looking down upon her. The bright sunlight behind the person didn't help much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit!

I-I didn't see...Lois?\" Jillian stood upright and saw before her a much, much more adipose version of Lois whose breakfast consisting of egg, sausage, bacon, grease, bacon grease, and cheese biscuits were smeared all over her teal blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...Oh My Gosh! Lois! How did you get so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By eating a lot, dumbass. And by the looks of it, I won't be eating anything for breakfast.

She scratched her round plump belly still covered by her red dress which had multiple tears and rips at the seams from her growth last night. \"Ugh Damn those midgets\" she muttered. Misty stood up to step on the scale and see her weight but she heard a loud 'Snap' and fell backwards onto the couch. She rolled off the coach to see the she broke her highheel shoes. Seeing as her feet got fatter. She got up agian and waddled to the scale which was only 10ft away her legs were hard to move. Misty's thighs seemed to have gotten as thick as logs and her knees seemed to be covered by fat by the time she stood on it she was huffing and puffing. \"Ok *huff* lets see how much I weigh\" as she wiped sweat of her brow. She could hardly see past the three red lumps which were her to humongous and fatty breasts and her round bulging belly which were covered by her dress. Misty grabbed 2 mirrors. She pointed one towards the mirror and one towards her face. Misty gasped as she saw the scale read '349' pounds. \"Oh no\" gasped Misty. The clock read 1:59 and Misty was called to start delivering pizzas. The other employees just started as she passed by. Her red dress barely covered her ass and thighs. Throughtout her work hours she often found other men and woman staring at her breats. Her wide belly and hips made difficult to navigate around the place. Kids chanted \"Hey look at the fat lady she's so fat\" Even Peter said she was fat. She accidentaly knocked over a few kids running in front off her path which made them cry \"Mommy the big fat woman knocked me over\" \"Oh you should lose some weight you big blonde hippo\" said a bystander \"Yeah people like you dont belong in this place\" said the father of the crying child. As the day went on it started getting harder. Will Misty was carrying a pitcher of beer to a couple of fathers here for a childs birthday party. A kid knocked into her and knocked the beer over. Making the liquid spill on her clevage and dress making it slightly see through and weakened her bra. A couple of kids made a fake 500 dollar bill and placed it on the floor. She walked to it and smiled widly as she bent over her dress had small rips the back where her butt was then a couple of kids gave it a good smack and watched it jiggle. On Misty's 16 minute break misty sat down near the ball pit on a chair to small for her. While she was sleeping kids Poked her massive ass fat that spilled off of the chair. One kid was able to shove one whole ball from the bal pit into her round navel.

The fun part is, you choose how it happens and who it happens to. Just a few rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo male WG, it's called fWG for a reason<br>\r\nNo Sex at all, kissing and hugging is fine, but that's the limit.<br>\r\nNothing disgusting, we wouldn't want anyone to get grossed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDumdumdumdum, that's all. Gone on and write. Happy reading!<br>\r\n</td>",
