Muhahah laughed the creature giddy with anticipation of the thought of corrupting a wish. Now who is his new master? A twenty something year old young man who is a bit of a slacker. A husband and wife who are always fighting. A divorced wife with 3 kids that she never sees and is well past her prime. Or someone else. Who is the victim or victims?</span></div></div>",

Your name is Al Reed you are a stock boy at a local super store. Your always late hardly ever even work the only reason you got the job was cause the boss had a thing for your mom. Jessica Reed she was a widowed mother and managed to raise you on her own after your father passed. She was the vice president of a local restaurant chain which had appeared to take your local area by storm. She wonders to herself how her only son managed to turn out to be such a worthless kid even voicing said opinion to your face more then once. As you walk threw your cluthered room you noticed a statue which you had never seen before, and didn't remember buying. Where did you come from fella? Said Al to the statue as if it could answer him. As he picks it up a note drops from under it. Warning be very careful around the statue and what ever you do for the love of all things good do not make a wish near it. Is this a joke? Asked Al who was interrupted by a text from his boss who wanted Al to come in on his day off. Stupid asshat I don't know what his deal is I wish I had the power to make people like him do what ever I wanted them to do. Suddenly the statue started glowing and even speaking. That didn't take long it said. I thought that by making the note you would take longer to make a wish but you my boy are a grade a idiot. Al panicked and let go of the statue which started to float. Al then sees a flash and when he wakes up something is different.</span></div></div>",

Your mom was still the same and most your old friends became past flames even an old girlfriend or two from your past life. Seems Alice swings both ways the new Alice says to herself. Wait why am I accepting this so easy? She then spies a note on the counter. Congrats this is your new life. You wished for the power to control people now you have it. Your probably wondering why you are a female now. It's simple you want an easy way threw life with barely any work and plenty of fun so you are now a sexy bomb shell who has in the past used her body to sway things in her favor. All the details in your life are mostly the same as you noticed. I'll return in a week if you can convince me you learned a lesson I might change you back. Until then enjoy your new life Alice. So that creature made me this way. So now what she said until a familiar feeling in her new bladder. She walked over to the toilet and sat down. It was weird to Alice that this was both new and at the same time from her new memories familiar. After she finished Alice wipes her vagina only to accidentally brush against her clit. At that moment a rush of pleasure over came Alice and she had to have more Alice then starts to massage her new pussy already knowing what it liked and where it wanted to be touched and how it liked to be touched. After a few minutes an orgasm floods Alice's senses. Maybe I could get used to this she says. Alice then thinks maybe I could go to the mall get new sexy clothes not that what she had wasn't already sexy mind you. Maybe get me a lover or two test the other systems. Or maybe take it easy for a few days and adjust slowly.</span></div></div>",

What was that? You mom ask. Nothing I'm good mom thinking I was gonna take some of my saved up cash and get some more clothes and stuff. You really don't need any more clothes Alice, but hell nothing wrong with a girl looking good. Mind if I join you. Sure you say. This way we can ride in your car which has more trunk space. Haha smart girl you take after your mom. She says as she hugs you. You feel diffrent your mom in your old life thought you were a screw up here she thinks more of you. Would it be so bad if I stay you think to your self. Let's go I wanna get a new outfit that will drive everyone wild. I was thinking the same dear. It's been to long I'm getting back in the dating game. That's good you deserve to be happy. You say it but it feels odd. Before when she tried dating you did everything you could to ruin it. Alice however wants to help her mom move on. It seems Alice was the better person out of the two of us. Ok so before we leave where to first? Your mom ask bringing you back to reality. You think where first you would like to see the lingerie store and check out the talent pool. Or to the more girly store. Maybe the one for tom boys still be sexy but still kind of familiar.</span></div></div>",

You should be a model mom. Nah no one wants me to model at my age she says. You however should my darling. Well I have a few options which one do you think? You show your mom two diffrent sets. She picks the one in your left hand try that first. You go to the changing room. You notice the lingerie was a little big for you you wondered why your mom let you take it in. Thats when your body started to change to fit it. You then see another note on the seat. As a bonus I made it to where this week your body will adjust to any clothes you pick only you will notice. This ends after the week. So feel free to experiment. The creature did this well I don't need to change if I was sexy before I'm a bombshell now.

You ask. You want to find me a date don't you. I know your tricks dear. You go threw the memories of your new life and realize Alice has tried similar things to help her mother move on. Well not today you say I'm just hungry. However if that happens I won't be against it. You know that's why I love you so much dear your always thinking of me. While going threw your memories you learn everytime your mom dated someone new most her focus shifted to the new relationship. During which time Alice would do what ever she could. She even almost got a tattoo once. Hey mom. Yes my sweet Alice? Could I get a tattoo today? Ok as long as your paying for it. Sweet but food first. Yes so what to eat today. You stop to think when something in you said pizza. Pizza mother. I knew it well I know what you like how about I get the pizza and you wait here with my stuff. Sure you reply. This also gave you some time to think. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad to stay this way you think. In my old life my mom hated me here we get along. You were interrupted from your train of thought from a guy giving a how you doing sweat thing. You brush him off being both offended and intrigued. At how Alice was flattered by the attention. Realizing that this apparently happened all the time for Alice. Ok one strike in the negative column. Your mom returns with your pizza. You ok sweetie? I'm fine mom just some jerk of a guy came by. Thought I would fall for a cheesy pick up line. What an idiot. My daughter might get around but your anything but easy. Really you know about all that? Of course dear I'm your mother but I don't have any problem with it. Just remember to always use protection. But your ok with me sleeping around? And with both sexes sometimes both at once? Trust me dear I was the same way at your age. You look shocked. Don't be surprised I was just as if not more wild then you at your age. How do you think I landed your father? I thought he and you meet threw a mutual friend and fell in love. Kinda the mutual friend is true but more like we feel in lust then love. Hell I was pregnant with you before we ever walked down the aisle. But I think I told you enough looking at how red your face is so do you still want a tattoo?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Ok this is my first interactive story on here so please enjoy and add. Now ground rules you can make anything you want to but no killing unless approved by the characters creator and me, and even if it's your character you need my approval for death I don't want a bunch of senseless deaths. Next the wishes in your chapters can be twisted in anyway you want anything that does not violate the above no killing without permission rule is ok. Also please try and use decent spelling and grammar. I may not be the grammar police and I will go ahead and say mine isn't perfect but if no one can understand it no one can enjoy it. Next if you want to add images for your characters or environment I'm ok with that but please none of the creature I want everyone to be able to imagine their own version. That being said the creature can transform and disguise itself so if you use an image while it is disguised then that's ok. Also the creature can be any gender it wants so he she it or adjectives like that all are good. Now if you want to make the creature good or evil or somewhere in between is up to you. It's motivation isn't entirely known. Also please don't make people turn into like a tv character or something. I don't care how hot cool or iconic the character is I want people to create their own stuff now you can mention it in the background like maybe someone is watching a Star Wars movie and that's ok, but don't just turn your character into Asoka just cause you have a crush on her. Alright well that is the rules so unless anything changes I won't add anymore, but failure to follow the rules will force me to contact you via mail and if you still don't change it I will delete it. Thanks and review and if you have any questions comments or observations you know how to reach me.</td>",
