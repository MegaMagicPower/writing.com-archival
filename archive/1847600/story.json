His family had recently come into possession of a large estate, consisting of a great deal of land and the mansion that was on it. They said it was the summer home of an eccentric philanthropist, who made some bad investments and lost the property and everything in the house to the bank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis parents planned on selling the house and everything in it, but Kyle was able to convince them to let him and his friends have the house for the week as a graduation present. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they drove through the front gates, they were amazed by the sheer scale of everything. The driveway cut straight through a picturesque field of grass, and lead to a beautiful fountain. However, the house itself was beyond words, like something from a movie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey parked the car around the fountain. After getting out to stretch their legs, they marveled at where they were going to spend their weekend. For free, no less.</span></div></div>",

Wake up we hit the jackpot!\u201d he says, walking up the front steps leading to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was James, Kyle\u2019s best friend, \u201cHell yeah. When I heard you say foreclosed mansion, I thought you were taking us to a rundown dump\u201d he said, laughing as he followed Kyle up the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey come on man have a little faith,\u201d Kyle says smiling. \u201cThough to be honest, I\u2019m a little surprised myself.\u201d he then says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was Nick. \u201cHey guys are you sure were at the right place?\u201d he asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if we are, lets enjoy it for a moment before Mr. Burns releases the hounds on us\u201d Joey says laughing as he shuts the car door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you really doubt me there is only one way to find out\u201d Kyle says, holding up the key to the front door. He then puts the key in the hole and tries to turn it. However, he appears to struggle with the lock. Giving up, he then quickly turns around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, wrong house. Let's get back in the car. I think I kind of tripped the alarm\u2026\u201d he says, taking two steps as though to run down the stairs, causing the others to dash back to the car. However, as they turn around, the door appeared to open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust kidding\u201d Kyle says smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, you should of seen the look on your faces. If I had waited another second, it looked like you all were going to leave me\u201d he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you know I kind of like that idea\u201d James says, looking back at Nick and Joey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh come on guys. You know you it was funny. Now come on. Let\u2019s check this place out\u201d Kyle says <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the four of them walk inside they were all speechless, until Nick broke the silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow!\u201d he says, with Kyle saying the same in agreement. The place was beyond words. It was clean and comfortable, nothing at all like an empty house. It was fully furnished and the lights worked, as if anything it felt like a fancy hotel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Kyle, what is the story on this place again?\u201d James asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, my dad says that the previous owner was rich and this was one of his homes\u201d he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea we can tell, most of his stuff is still here.\u201d Joey says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, my mom says that he made some bad investments and the house was repossessed by the bank. House, land, and everything on it.\u201d Kyle says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously? So this plasma screen TV, and all this furniture and anything else we find in what I\u2019m guessing are the other room are yours too?\u201d Joey aks as he kicks back on the living room couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I guess so.\u201d Kyle says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd your parents are seriously giving us free reign over this place for the next week?\u201d James asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 all ours\u201d he says, smiling as he sits down in a living room chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were all silent for a moment to let the situation sink in. Then, they all bursted out in laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo really what\u2019s the catch? This place is haunted right?\u201d Nick asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that I know of\u201d Kyle says, still laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if so, we have a week to find out. I don\u2019t know about you all but I\u2019m going to go find the master bedroom\u201d Kyle says, jumping out of his chair and running to the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hell no!\u201d James says, jumping and chasing after him.

Once Nick sees Joey pause at the top of the stairs, he figures there are only two hallways and decides to look around down stairs, figuring that in a place like this all the rooms were awesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, it has to be around here somewhere\u201d Kyle says, opening another door. \u201cNo, linen closet\u201d and another, \u201cNo, regular bedroom\u201c he says. Then, he opens another, \u201cAh!! Another bedroom,\u201d he says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFound it!\u201d James exclaims from the far end of the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh you\u2019ve got to be kidding me\u201d Kyle says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know you probably should of started at the end of the hall and worked your way back like I did\u201d James says proudly\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you win. Now I guess I\u2019ve got to pick one of the other fifty rooms in this place\u201d Kyle says, while Joey walks up to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow I never stood a chance\u201d he says laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey where is Nick?\u201d Joey asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess he just gave up\u201d James said. The three of you then head back down stairs to find him. They all decide to split and search for him. As they search, they find that the house had a two-story library, a full-sized dining room, a sitting room at the back of the house which revealed a pool and hot tub in the back yard, along with a greenhouse surrounded by a garden and a kitchen with every appliance you can think of. However, there was no food in the fridge or the pantry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, when they all begin to think that he had mysteriously disappeared, they all converge on the game room, where they find Nick playing a game of pool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally, we should have known.\u201d Kyle says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but at least we got to check out the place right? So okay what has everyone found?\u201d James asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I found the kitchen, the pantry and the dining room, but no food so we need groceries for the week\u201d Kyle says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice, so fully furnished but no food. Okay what else we got?\u201d Nick asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI found a closed-in back porch, and this place comes with a pool and a hot tub\u201d he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweet, now we just need girls.\u201d Nicks says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, I just wish we had brought some of those with us, since none of us know any around here\u201d Joey says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we'll take care of that later\u201d Kyle says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright so let\u2019s put our stuff in our rooms and go get food.

All the buildings were either restored or fairly new, with all that you would expect from a standard city but it didn\u2019t seem as crowded. It looked like the perfect place for a vacation or getaway for someone who didn\u2019t needed to get away from the city but didn\u2019t want to be in the middle of nowhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey decide on a nice sports bar for dinner. Once inside they order and continue talking. \u201cOkay guys what is the plan?\u201d Nick says, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell let\u2019s see.\u201d James says pulling out his phone, \u201cWe already have a place to crash for the week, there is a beach about thirty minutes that way,\u201d he says pointing to his left, \u201cA lake about fifteen minutes that way,\u201d he says pointing backward, \u201cWow this is actually a college town.\u201d He says smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome, so we have plenty of options.\u201d Joey says, The waitress then brings their drinks to the table, \u201cOkay so I say we eat, then find a Wal-Mart to stock up on supplies and head back?\u201d Kyle says lifting his glass<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe all smile and raise their glasses in a toast. After they finished eating they easily found a Wal-Mart since it was easily within walking distance of the restaurant. They then proceeded to fill up a shopping cart with snack foods, and an assortment of other supplies for the coming week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got back to the house they stocked the fridge and pantry. Then they started drinking the beer they brought from home and watching enjoying the surround sound of the home entertainment center, until each crashing in their own beds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tina was soaking wet and defiantly wasn\u2019t wearing a rain coat, her clothes were all wet and basically see through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon noticing that his sister\u2019s clothes were see-through he quickly rushes to the nearest linen closet and grabs a towel, \u201cAh GUYS!\u201d you say covering her up, which breaks their concentration.

He was a little bit curious too, but he wasn't about to check out his new body in front of his friends. He grabbed the card from Tina's hand, and realized that he could now read it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt said:<br>\r\n\"The changes for you<br>\r\nWill broaden your horizons<br>\r\nBut leave you left out\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't really know what that card even meant as he let loose a barrage of profanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick interrupted him, \"Dude, we can't hear a word your saying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle looked puzzled. Nick's words were gibberish to him. He tried to communicate, but he quickly realized that he was now speaking Japanese. And he also realized that he could no longer speak English!

They then look to Tina to see that she was now wearing a thong bikini. Kyle was embarrassed and tried to cover up as much as possible, which the guys found very entertaining until Tina brought their attention to their clothes. James was still wearing his normal clothes but Joey was wearing swim trunks and a tropical button up shirts with a straw hat and Nick who had remained quiet so far was now wearing nothing but a loose fitting shirt.

Nick has orange, James has pink, Tina has Blue, Joey has white, and Kyle has red.
