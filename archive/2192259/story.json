The factory was built to give a rising amount of abandoned  babys who at the time couldn't stay in a government run orphan due to the fact the last mayor was stealing money from said project for his self about 5 years ago. The factory was designed to take care of the kids into they were adopted by loving homes or were get to the age of 18 were they can go into a other facility to started there lives. But it closeted when the new mayor made things right and secured the funds needed to open a orphan, after that the factory was shut down when the owners knew that kids would be safe and not have to grow up on the streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to get curious the <br>\r\nfactory never had any staff work there. So how did it work to take care of all those kids for 5 years with no staff. You saw a small opening where you could get in while walking around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting in you start to look around and see many rooms, as you try opening one of the doors it wont budge. You walk down the hall to what looks like the front of the building where there was chairs and tables whit a desk near the hallway where you just came from. You also see a stairway up to where you think is the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk upstairs you see the office was unlocked and started looking around. It look like the head office where all the paperwork was done and the keys where hanging on the wall. As you start looking through the papers you see that the owners made this whole place automated, From the dapper changers to the nurses (which were robots). Then you had the idea that you needed to see one of these robots up close. Grabbing the keys and heading back down stairs you see behind the front desk a small box. After what feels like 30 minutes the box came open and you saw it's a power box. You start to flip switches and the building comes to life as you closed the box and then you sat down and wait after reading the papers you know a nurse robot will come down here and man the front desk. As you hear a lot of sound coming from the hallway you got ready and pull out your phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then see a female looking android in a nurse outfit walk to the front desk and starts typing on the computer. As you take a picture you see she was well matined not much damage on the outside and it seems to be running very well. As you start to walk forward it doesn't paid any attention to you into you touch a screen whit a per fill out form and accidentally submitted the form and android stops typing and looks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get a little creeped out and started to walk away when the android starts to walk towards you. \"Come here little one. Welcome to you new home.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

You give a yelp, more in shock than pain, as the bot begins to carry you deeper into the factory.  \"Uh, hey! Stop! Let me go!\"  You protest trying to wiggle out of the grasp but the nurse droid simple makes shushing noises and shifts her grip to a more secure hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment you found yourself in a new part of the factory.  You looked around noticing that, with the exception of a large covered conveyer belt running down the center, the whole place looked like a big nursery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColorful rooms clearly build for children of very young age, where across the sides.  Some had toddler beds, but most held cribs.  A large room that seemed to double as a playroom and kitchen was at the very end of the section.  The smaller individual rooms were sparkly decorated, apparently only being used for sleep by the former inhabitants.  Each smaller room had small conveyer belts leading form them to the main belt which itself emptied into the playroom.  You realize what was happening when the nurse droid set you on the main belt.  \u201cNew subject is ready, commence caretaker procedure.\u201d  The nurse droid said as the factory seemed to whirl to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Wait! This isn\u2019t right!\u201d You cry sitting up and preparing to make a break for it.  \u201cSubject is attempting escape!\u201d  The nurse droid said moving to block your dash.  In your panicked and drunk state, you didn\u2019t swerve in time and instead ran head first into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe droid didn\u2019t even flinch.  You however were seeing stars and muttering incoherently.  Surprisingly it didn\u2019t hurt all that much. Probably from a combination of alcohol and adrenaline.  \u201cNaughty boy.\u201d  The nurse scolded picking you back up and setting you back onto the belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSubject in being naughty, commence restraining.\u201d  The nurse ordered.  Your head still ringing you were only vaguely aware of the cartoonish looking mechanical hands grabbed you and gently, but firmly arranging you on the belt and hold you down.  \u201cRestrains in place, commencing processing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head getting some senses back as the nurse droid hits some buttons and speaks some more as the rest of the factory roars to life.  You only catch bits and pieces but before the conveyer started to carry you towards the opening where you hear the nurse clearly say.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPreparations complete.  Processing commencing.  Prepare facilities for a new...\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
