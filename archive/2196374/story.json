He took off his uniform and decided today was as good a day as any to use his power. Something that he never mentioned to anyone in fear of being ridiculed, he actually had the power to will whatever he wanted into existence. Sometimes it was something helpful, but most of the time Marshall used it for his own pleasures. He remembered the day when he made a tiny city part of his paw pads, or the endless torment of tiny humans tasting sweat from them. He even played with a couple in his mouth for fun a few times. \u201cOh boy this\u2019ll be fun\u201d Marshall said going to a secluded spot where he could use his power.</span></div></div>",
