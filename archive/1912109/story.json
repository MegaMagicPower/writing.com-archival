            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nicole the lynx, friendly AI, Freedom Fighter, and constant companion to her closest friend, Princess Sally herself, flaoted aimlessly in the wide open digital realm which she called home. This was her mainframe, her only sanctuary from the outside world, and, as she had discovered a few weeks ago, even this place could still be accessed, when Sally had arrived with Sonic to free her from Iron Queen Regina Ferrum's evil mind control spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, Nicole was free now, but that didn't mean that her life was back on track. She had tagged along with Sonic and Sally, to a concert that Mina Mongoose had performed in the wake of the Freedom Fighters' victory over the Iron Dominion. However, when Mina had started to sing, the lyrics of her new song struck a chord with her. It didn't take a genius to work out that the song was about Nicole herself. And it wasn't saying good things about her. They spoke about stopping her, how she was a threat, too powerful, evil...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole had broken down that night, and had barely appeared since. It had gotten worse since then. People were agreeing with Mina, hurling abuse at Nicole whenever she passed them in the street. Some of the more violent ones would break nanite constructs, knowing that Nicole would feel the damage done to her nanites. She didn't understand it. She had provided them with a home, with shelter, with food, clothing and water. She had put a shield over their heads, to protect them, and made sure their homes were comfortable. Why were they rejecting her, just because she was brainwashed? And Mina herself was no better. She'd been brainwashed by Mogul, and he had used her to force Sonic to hand over the city's Chaos Emerald to him. She was nothing more than a hypocrite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole felt herself beginning to break down again, so snapped her fingers, causing a digital replica of Sally to appear in front of her. The fake squirrel embraced her, massaging her back, and allowing Nicole to relax and rest on her shoulder. Nicole loved Sally, she loved her dearly, and had done so, ever since her emotions had first surfaced. She kept this copy of her, so that she could imagine what it would be like to have a relationship with her, but alas, Sally was straight, and even know, torn between Sonic and Ken Khan. She didn't need the extra baggage of knowing that her best friend had a lesbian crush on her. That, and she was simply afraid of approaching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrritatingly, that brought the horrible song back to mind. It was called \"We won't be afraid.\" It was ironic. They feared her, but she was too fearful to even talk to her best friend. She couldn't go out. She'd tried disguising herself, but her glowing eyes always gave her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a different school of thought entered Nicole's mind. Of course they were afraid. THey should be afraid! She owned this city. It obeyed her and only her. Mina would not get rid of Nicole, nor the fear of her. The lynx would ensure that they did not take away from her that which was rightfully her's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had the tools. She controlled the city, after all. She would need allies, but with her fearsome telepathic abilities, she could make even the strongest mind bend to her will. Her nanites could be used to convert their bodies on a tiny scale, so she could make a force of strong, beautiful women, who would serve her every whim. And of course, it would have to be women. Controlling a man was boring, and it felt odd. Controlling a woman, though, made her feel warm inside, and more than a little naughty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe instantly dismissed the Sally replica, and started running through possible first targets. Of course, Sally was the first that came to mind. She would be the perfect second-in-command, the perfect lover, but Nicole didn't knw if she wanted to brainwash Sally. Still, that warm, naughty feeling only grew when she thought of the princess kneeling before her, stark naked, and pledging to serve her forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen of course, there was Sonic. He was fast, strong, and the hero of Mobius. Everyone loved Sonic. if she could capture him, he might be able to win people over, and help her that way. She could also use him to subtly nudge Sally towards becoming a lesbian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails would also be a huge help. He was smart, even smarter than her, and would make an ideal ally, as well as being able to design some kind of suit for the girls to wear as a uniform, which would also boost their strength, or something like that. He would be easy to catch as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also considered Fiona. While she wasn't as good at hunting for people or things as Rouge, she knew a lot more about subtlety- something that even their clothing showed, Fiona's black attire versus Rouge's heart-emblazoned suit. She was also connected to several other enemies of the Freedom Fighters, so she would be easily able to blame one of them and then escape to her Mistress's home.</span></div></div>",

A glance at the book told Scourge that he had turned both girls into devoted followers, that would worship him and serve his every desire. The downside of this was that they wouldn't be able to give him advice, but then he wasn't in the habit of heeding advice anyway, and their cultist-level obedience was extremely arousing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my little sluts, if you insist, I'll gladly take your throne.\" He shrugged, grinning. \"Now, let's have some fun with my new pets!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Master!\" The two of them got up, saluting him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole, you're gonna be doing a lot of turning everyone in my new kingdom into sexy sluts for me.

You know the sort of thing that I like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a snap of her fingers, both girls' outfits were stripped away be nanites, and reshaped. Now both wore entirely black outfits- Arm-length fingerless gloves, thigh-high boots, thongs, and extremely revealing tube-tops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will this please you, Master?\" They posed, embracing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, good stuff.\" He nodded. \"Now, who should be first...

She would explain all of this in private to her two new servants who seemed to be in total agreement of said plan (not like they would've said no). Nicole knew that if the plan did succeed in the long run it would be easier to breed new members of the population naturally rather than her causing several female's eggs to be fertilized by her nanites, using her abilities to control an entire population would be taxing enough without having to do that on top of it all so she decided there would be a select few (likely one person out of each group) that would be kept or changed into a male to better suit the population's needs. In this case Muttski would be kept as a male not only to make public appearances if needed but to help in breeding purposes in the future. <br>\r\nWith it all cleared out she needed to take care of her biggest threats next to world domination: Sonic the Hedgehog and Doctor Eggman, but who does she go after first?</span></div></div>",

As the fox soon took on a distinctly feminine form, the two grinned, scheming to continue some manner of revenge. But still, the new vixen had her own ideas, including revenge on a particular red vixen. However, the two of them soon agreed that both of their goals didn't have to be mutually exclusive. Yet there was still more Tails wanted to do. After some time in a different room spent... admiring her new body, the new vixen was grinning as she gripped onto a keyboard of some kind. Nicole tilted her head, obviously confused as to what Tails was doing. Despite her nanites, she didn't exactly have eyes literally everywhere, begging a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may ask...

Even as he did so, his eyes widened, his nose shrank to a cute button. His lips became thicker, and his eyelashes longer. His hair grew further down his back, as his spine cracked into an S-curve. Tails groaned with the somewhat unwanted pleasure, as his a pair of breasts surged out of his chest, forming a pair of C-cups. Then he screamed with delight as his penis inverted, and became her vagina, and she let loose her first orgasm as a woman.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All she did was make her slightly more submissive towards her own desires, and and out thoughts of her plan into her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Sally. Let's go somewhere a little more private.\" She said, leading Sally out of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Sally nodded, still somewhat dazed the from the hypnosis. Nicole headed down the street, going towards the building inwhich the mainframe was stored. LOoking at her friend, Sally had to admit that she was attractive. She was less well-developed than most teenage girls that Sally knew, but this, combined with her big, round eyes, just made her look adorable. She was nearly always smiling, and Sally could hear her purring, making no attempt to hide her delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they arrived at Nicole's home, and headed inside. Nicole shut the door, and locked it, as Sally sat herself down on the couch. Nicole sat next to her, still quite nervous, and wrapped an arm around her shoulder. Sally allowed herself to lean on Nicole's shoulder, causing the lynx's purring to grow louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Sally.\" Nicole whispered, and she began to gently stroke the princess' hair, causing her to blush. \"Thank you so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you're welcome, Nicole.\" Sally stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Sally. There;s something I've been wanting to do for a long time.\" Nicole whispered. \"Do you mind if I... kiss you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess it wouldn't matter too much...\" Sally shrugged, as Nicole pulled her into a deep, passionate kiss. At first, she resisted the urge, but soon, Sally gave in and allowed Nicole's tongue into her mouth. SOmewhere in all of this, She found herself underneath Nicole. THe lynx weighed a little more than her build suggested, thanks to her metal insides, but it wasn't enough to cause Sally pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the squirrel had to break off the embrace for air (Something which Nicole did not), and she let her body go limp, as she panted and blushed heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then his spine cracked into an S-curve, pushing out his rapidly-expanding chest and backside. His limbs slimmed down, losing their muscle mas, while his quills began to resemble hair. His now-dainty feet arched, as his shoes turned into a pair of open, stiletto-heeled pink shoes. His jacket sleeves separated and merged with his gloves, which lost their fingers, exposing his manicured pink nails, before turning pink themselves. The rest of his jacket formed a tube-top around his heaving G-cups, the nipples visible clearly through the material. His face softened becoming feminine and girlish, with puffy lips, permanently half-lidded eyes. His lips were covered in a thick coat of lipstick, while his eyes gained a heavy amount of eyeshadow, mascara, and eyeliner. A tattoo of an arrow appeared on the small of his back, pointing to his backside, while a similar one appeared on his belly, both with \"COCK HERE\" written above them in cursive. With that, his ears were pierced, and a pair of large fake-gold hoop earrings formed from them, as another piercing formed on his tongue (Which he now remembered loving to run down the shaft of someone during a blowjob). Finally, his stiffened member receded into his crotch, the void it left behind being covered by a pair of lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is done, Master.\" Nicole bowed.</span></div></div>",

Though, that powerful mallet could be a frightful weapon when put to the right use. Nicole paused for a second. She ponders a little more about Amy. Amy has a strange magic that came from the Ring of Acorn. She had wished to be older but that doesn't explain the hammer. Also, Amy's mental stability is a bit shaking these days. Nicole noticed if for some time now and she wonders why no ones is curious about Amy as well. Nicole looked at Amy's file one last time. The Ring of Acorn... If its the same as the other magic rings, it would be a problem if she could break her mind control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr not. Nicole still has many people to go after first to choose from. The thought, 'Knuckles is still in town' popped up in her servers out of no where. Hmmmm, Knuckles could be the most logical choice. When (if) she begins her global campaign, she would need a functioning power source. The Master Emerald. And, if this go well, Nicole could have Knuckles bring Julie-Su in her realm for a bit of... Fluid exchange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh that's right, Julie-Su. Now there's a girl that comes in second place to Sally. Julie-Su does have a hot body. She can be a bit grumpy at times but when she is not pissed, you can really notice how attractive her figure is. Though, Nicole prefers that 'hard to get' charm. Also, Julie-Su would be easier to control and see anything she sees outside Nanite City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole paced back and forth in her digital world in thought. There was someone who is equally hot to Julie-Su around here but who. Nocole walked a circle for a few seconds before remembering. Bunnie Rabbot! (She knows Bunnie got married but Nicole still likes to call her Rabbot.) There is a power house if Nicole ever seen one. She'd be the prefect knight in capturing the rest. Nicole moved her fingers to her digital vagina as she thought more on Bunnie's body. Those prefect, round, robot legs, Her soft, squishy, huge breasts, and she's a rabbit. Rabbits are know to be good at humping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole dug her finger in rapidly as her imagination ran wild. Though she herself is digital, her pussy is real and soft and wet to anyone. And of course she could make a real, soft body out of her nanites. The downside is that she wouldn't be able to get any girl she wants pregnant but that's is the only down side. With her fingers slipping in her dark, wet caverns and occionsly hitting her G-spot, Nicole tried to think of more people she would be able to fuc- mind control under her will.</span></div></div>",

She has total control over the city, the ability to psychically influence and control minds, and her nanites can do just about anything.  Her objective is to capture, brainwash, and in the case of males, transform everyone else, and not even her friends are safe this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there are some rules and guidelines:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole is the main character. This story is about her. Of course, there can be supporting characters, friends, allies, enemies, etc, but Nicole is the main focus here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's nanites are only accessible when she is inside New Mobotropolis. Outside, her powers are severely limited, because she lacks a body, since her's is made of nanites as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's personality has warped. She is now more seductive and malevolent. She is also in love with her best friend, Sally Acorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo OCs. They always derail the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Nicole loves Sally, this story is not a romantic tale about them. They can become a couple, but the story should not focus on their relationship more than it does on Nicole's mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole can lose control and be brainwashed herself, but remember to occasionally make it an option to have her regain her control. After all, she is resistant to mind control, and she has an Antivirus system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTG is mandatory for male victims. It does not have to be immediate, but it must happen eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo Sonic X or AoSTH characters. Sonic X brings nothing decent to the table, and AoSTH's characters are too insane for the setting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry to be detailed with the earlier transformations. Nicole's nanites aren't a TG beam, so it will take a while to change the victims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo vore, weight gain, inflation, regression, growth, or shrinking. They aren't relevant to the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinor amounts of BE (Increasing by a cup size or so), are allowed, but not to an insane extent. Robotization is allowed, as is age-progression, for example, aging Tails up to match the other victims during transformation. In fact, this is recommended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKilling is allowed, but ask before you kill an important character. Of course, Nicole isn't out to kill her victims, so it will rarely be needed anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSex is allowed, as is description of it, but putting a warning on a chapter that contains it is advisable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSex should be Hetero or Yuri. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry to provide more in the way of options than just 'Next' or 'Something else'. This story <i>i</i>s supposed to have some vein of choice in it, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reserve the right to edit or delete chapters that do not follow these rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, go nuts.<br>\r\n</td>",
