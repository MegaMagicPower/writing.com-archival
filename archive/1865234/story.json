Henry Matthews was sitting on his seat in the teacher's lounge and let out a deep sigh. It was really hard for him right now. He just moved into city, got this job as a mathmatics teacher and was now simply overwhelmed with learning all the new names of his students and fellow teachers. He had no time to catch a breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems like yesterday that I was back home and now all these new faces... This is just exhausting.\", he thought as he leaned back. Right now he looked more like a bored student than a teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry was 33 years old, recently divorced, had short, brown hair and glasses. Currently he was wearing a brown suit and a tie. He never felt comfortable with the casual look when teaching. It just made him feel as if he was just some guy in front of a class and not a teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're looking tired.\", said a voice suddenly from beside him. Henry nearly fell over because of surprise. He looked to where the voice came from and saw a beautiful looking hispanic woman. She had long, curly, black hair, C-Cups and was wearing a pink t-shirt and rather tight fitting jeans. Not as tight as those of some girls in the school. She was the youngest teacher with 29 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're... wait a minute... You're Manuela Sanchez, right?\", asked Henry slowly. She nodded and smiled at him. \"Yeah right.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least one name I have learned.\", he laughed and she joined his laughter. \"Yeah, that's nice.\", she replied. \"You're Henry, right? You look exhausted.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry nodded slowly. He was not sure if he should talk about his problems and decided not to. He did not want to bother her with his problems. \"Yeah... It's quite exhausting. Just moved in my new apartment and now have to learn all the names and faces of the students as well as the other teachers.\", he explained more than he really intended to. There was just something at her that made him want to tell her that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\", she replied and then stopped in thoughts only to ask him seconds later: \"Hey, me and some other teachers's we're going to play a game later. How about you join us? To relax.\", she suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry thought about it for a moment and then shrugged his shoulders. \"Why not? It might be fun. Also I'd get to know some of my collegues better. When and were going to meet?\", he asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After school here in the teacher's lounge. We're normally the only ones left here on a friday.\", she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry got through the day and was happy that it was over. The kids were really horrible to new teacher's and tried to tease him were ever they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just hope this will get better.\", he sighed when he arrived in the teacher's lounge. She really was telling the truth. The lounge was like a ghost town except for the four people who had rearranged the tables so everyone could sit on one table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Henry.\", smiled Manuela. \"You're the last one. Come here, sit down.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry nodded and walked slowly over to the table while looking at the other teachers and trying to remember their names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the left of Manuela was sitting a small man with brown-gray hair. He was chubby and wore a green vest, blue shirt and khaki jeans. His name was Theodore Anderson if Henry remembered it correctly. He was 42 years old and was teaching biology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Theodore's left sight was a red haired woman. She was 52 years old but still looked great. She had slightly sagging D-Cups. She was wearing a red floral-print dress. Henry could see that she had her nail painted in a matching red. Her hair was rather short, just covering her neck. Her name was Andrea Flemming if he remembered it correctly. She was teaching English.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside Andrea was a slim man with white hair. He was 53 years old. He was wearing a blue t-shirt and jeans. He looked skinny and his skin was crinkly. He was the husband of Andrea and called Edward. His subject was Physics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast but not least, there was a woman just beside Edward. She was tall, had blonde hair pulled back in a ponytail and looked very fit. She had B-cups. Henry remembered that she was the girl's coach. Signs of age were showing in her face with her age being 39 but she still looked like she could outrun most of the students easily. Her name was Erica Jameson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry then sat down and looked at the others. \"Soo...\", he began nervously. \"What are we going to play?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea looked at him and grinned broadly. \"Oh, something very special. You see we have these incredible cards. We play with them every week for 3 years or so.\", she explained and tried to make him curious. Edward meanwhile put a strange box on the table from which he got the cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, these cards are special...\", said Manuela and began explaining.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>The rules are as following.<br>\r\nYou play a normal round of poker but instead of betting money, you bet traits of yourself. The traits can be anything you can name. The traits are not equal in worth, some are more worth than others. A list can be found below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game will be played like a normal poker game, you bet and the one with the best hand wins. The winner can choose to either swap his traits with those in the pot or swap these with the other players. You can't swap back traits you had when you began the game. It is possible to win and lose other traits throughout the game. For example it is possible that Henry get's a vagina, loses it and wins the same again during the game. He can't swap his own penis back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwapping ages or genders does not change you physical. People just think of you that you're that old or the opposite gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't matter what you bet, it is possible that there are several of the same trait in the pot. It's not possible to swap a hand for a foot or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the start of every hand, two people have to place a pot. The person dealing has to give in traits worth 1 points, the person right to him/her has to give traits worth 2 point. That then circules clockwise the next hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen someone set bets, the other players have to bet equal or more points to continue playing, e.g. Andrea has a bets traits worth 4 points, then the other will have to bet traits worth 4 or more points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReality adjusts to the swaps. It is only possible to leave the game table in between hands not when the game is played.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll swaps can be reversed any time after three days when all players gather, put their hands on the card box and saying a magical formula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrait - Points<br>\r\nSmall body parts (e.g hands, feet, lips... etc) - 1 Point<br>\r\nSmall Possessions (e.g. jewelry, single books, single dvds) - 1 Point<br>\r\nOne clothing article - 1 Point<br>\r\nPersonal Infos (e.g. Age, name... etc) - 1 Point<br>\r\nLarger body parts (e.g. torso, legs, face... etc) - 2 Points<br>\r\n'Medium' Posessions (e.g. small personal library, DVD collections) - 2 points<br>\r\nSkills - 2 Points<br>\r\nMale/ Female body parts - 3 Points<br>\r\nMajor posessions (e.g. cars, houses) - 3 Points<br>\r\nGender - 3 Points<br>\r\nPersonality changes - 4 Points<br>\r\nWhole Outfit - 4 Points<br>\r\nLife - 5 Points</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\", mumbled Henry. It took him some time to understand what they had just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManuela smiled at him.\"I know it's hard to believe. I couldn't believe it myself when they told me this when I got here 2 years ago but it's real. Every teacher knows of the cards and we all occasionally play together. Normal we play on mondays and swap back on fridays. Sometimes we stay swapped over the weekend.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost too much for Henry. He could not believe what he heard. \"You're crazy, right?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea shook her head. \"No, we're telling the truth.\". Her husband nodded. \"Yup. I was the bride of my daughter's wedding.\", he laughed. Henry remembered that Andrea told him that they had a daughter a year younger than Manuela.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just try it out, ok?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry nodded and Manuela began dealing the cards. \"Since I'm dealing, I'll have to put traits worth 1 point in the pot. Since Theodore is sitting left to me and is clockwise the next one, he has to put two points in.\", she explained while dealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen everyone had their cards, the box was placed in the middle. \"Okay... Let's see...\", mumbled Manuela. \"I'll set my shoes.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly a hologram emerged from the box and it showed black boots with a 2-inch heel just like the ones Manuela was wearing. The hologram floated over to Manuela.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry gasped amazed. A second ago he thought these people were crazy but he was suddenly believing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others were unimpressed and Theodore was making his choice. \"I'll set my hair and my nose.\", he said and an image of hair which looked like Theodore's appeared as well as an image of a nose which resembled Theodore\u2019s greatly and floated over to the biology teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that everything was set, they started playing. Henry looked at his cards and smiled. \"Not bad.\", he thought. He looked over to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's start small...\", said Andrea. \"I'll set my dress.\", she said and an image of her dress was floating beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll fold.\", said Edward. \"This hand is just no good.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then. I'll raise. I'll set my face and my job.\", said Erica and an image of her face appeard floating beside her and a small holographic sheet of paper with \"girl's coach\" written on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry gulped. It was his turn to place a bet. \"Erm... I'll bet...\", he said. \"You now have to bet traits worth 3 points, remined Manuela.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... yeah... thanks...\", he stummered and looked at the points list. \"Let's see...\". </span></div></div>",

Another image began emerging from the box and then floating over to Henry. It showed the male symbol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued and it was Manuela\u2019s turn. \u201cI\u2019ll fold.\u201d, she said and put the cards away. Theodore did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs your hand that bad?\u201d, asked Andrea. \u201cNormally you don\u2019t fold, Theodore.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you know me very well.\u201d, laughed Theodore. \u201cAnd yeah, my hand is horrible. No point in playing and losing more than I would want.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll bet as well.\u201d, said Andrea smiling. \u201cI\u2019ll set my voice.\u201d. An image of a music note appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll check.\u201d, said Erica. Henry checked as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I want to see what you two got.\u201d, said Andrea when she showed her cards. The others showed them as well. The winner was Henry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won.\u201d, he said disbelievingly. \u201cBut what now? What do I have to do?\u201d. It was like the box or the cards or whatever it was what was doing all of this, could understand him. In front of Henry formed an holographic table and the images which were floating around the players flew towards the table. Small figures appeared around the table. They just looked like the people who were sitting on the real table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have to touch the trait and then drag and drop it on one of the players. Then the swaps will occur.\u201d, explained Manuela.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry did as he was told and touched the dress icon first. He looked at the small figures and dragged the dress over to the figure which looked like himself. He was overwhelmed with everything that was happening that he did not realize what would happen if he did this. The moment the dress touched the figure the swap occurred. Henry was suddenly wearing Andrea\u2019s red floral-print dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly!\u201d, exclaimed Henry. Manuela giggled at him. \u201cYou haven\u2019t thought about what would happen, right?\u201d, she asked him. \u201cThat happens to everyone.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026 yeah\u2026 I\u2019ll have to be more thoughtful\u2026\u201d, he said and looked amazed at his dress. He then looked back at the holograms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe touched the hair symbol and then dragged it over to Andrea. Andrea\u2019s red hair changed brown and grew short and Theodore\u2019s did the exact opposite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry continued, dragging the male symbol over to the Erica figure. Nothing happened. \u201cYou\u2019re considered a woman now.\u201d, explained Erica. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a man now. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to wear make-up or something. Your life is mostly the same except that everyone thinks you\u2019re a woman.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry nodded to show her that he understood and continued. He took the boots symbol and dragged it over to his own figure. His black shoes turned into the black boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess since I already have a dress\u2026\u201d, he said and continued. He took the nose symbol, the note symbol and drew it over to the Edward figure. Edward\u2019s nose changed to look like Theodore\u2019s. He did not say anything but Henry guessed that his voice was now that of Andrea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry took the face and the sheet of paper and dragged them over to Theodore. Theodore\u2019s face changed to that of Erica. \u201cGirl\u2019s coach again?\u201d, said Theodore and raised an eyebrow. I already was last week\u2026 Well, it\u2019s not written in stone yet.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that every swap was chosen and the game began from a new.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We'll put up the cards and swap back on Monday.\"  said Edward a little bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry chuckled at hearing Andrea's voice coming from Edward's mouth, \"Oh no, I'm all up for that, I was just curious.  I think I'm in for six rounds.\"  Henry said not wanting the others to think he couldn't take this or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And his name in Henry, Edward,\"  Manuela said on Henry's behalf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheodore grabbed the cards, \"That's a good sport.  I'm dealing and I'll put in my teeth.\"  An image of teeth appeared in front of him, \"I've got a dentist appointment this weekend and don't want to go in with these wooden teeth.\"  He said flashing his yellow/brownish teeth to the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, put those away.\"  Andrea said, \"I'll put up my pantyhose and my hands,\" and so her leggings and hands showed up from the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another crap hand.  I fold.\" Edward said.  Henry was still amazed to hear Andrea whenever Edward spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll put in my breasts.\" Erica said matter of factually and the image of her breasts floated before her.  Henry upon seeing the images we uncensored looked away.  A few people at the table chuckled.  \"Don't worry Henry, at some point you'll have them and at some point you'll be sick of them.  I appreciate your modesty, but we're all going to be some of your best and closest friends here.  Really, it's okay to not look away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, thanks.\"  Henry said still not looking in Erica's direction as he asked,  \"Does knowledge count as a skill?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed it does,\" Edward said, or at least his voice from Andrea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was wondering if I could wager knowledge on students.  Just so maybe this weekend I can take notes on special cases and try to learn about them a little bit quicker.\"  Before anyone could answer a blank sheet of paper entitled 'knowledge of students' appeared in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently so.\"  Manuela said looking at her cards, \"I'll fold this hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll check.\" said Check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to put the pot right, I'll add my lips.\" Theodore said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay everybody, show your cards.\"  Erica said.  This hand went to Theodore with a full house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that's good news for me and bad news for my dentists boat payment.\" Theodore said as he started to look at everybody and what had been bet.  \"Manuela, I think I'll take your pretty smile to the dentist.\"  He moved the proper pieces around, Henry looked to his left at Manuela as she smiled at him with Theodore's now lipstick coated lips, showing off her new stained teeth and then laughed at the sort of troubled look on Henry's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, there are no hurt feelings at this table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheodore continued his dealings with the bet placements.  \"We'll keep Andrea's hands and pantie-hose in the family.\"  He said as he gave Andre's bets to her husband Edward,  \"As for you Henry, Edward has been here the longest, so his knowledge of the students might be the best.\"  He put Henry's lack of knowledge onto Edward and suddenly Henry felt his mind expand with knowledge of hundreds of students and their hobbies, activities, grades, relationships, and just about everything a teacher could pick up.  \"That leaves Erica's bet.  I suspect you would prefer a flat chest so it's easier for you to exercise as usual right?\"  Erica nodded and Theodore let loose a smile. \"Alright, I say we give Henry a first hand look at those B cups so he doesn't feel as awkward at the table.  It'll do you some good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Henry could say \"What?\" he felt his chest balloon out into Andre's dress.  \"But, what?  huh?\"  Henry said while just starring at his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He doesn't seem to be embarrassed to look at them now.\"  Erica joked while doing some arm stretches across her flat chest giving the group a good laugh before the next hand.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She must have seen his surprise, \"Sorry, did you need more time to get used to your new additions?\"  Blushing Henry drew jerked his gaze away from his breasts that were now jiggled noticeably around in his new dress.  \"No.  No.\"  He just said embarrassed getting smiles from the rest of the table.  \"Don't worry Henry.  We've all been there.\"  Theodore said referencing himself and Edward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward seemed to be about so say something, but Andrea prevented him by saying, \"I'll start off with my eyebrows,\" and two lines appeared floating before her.  \"And I'll bet my legs.\"  Edward said taking his wife's cue to speed the game along.  Erica and Henry both folded.  Manuela said, \"I think I'll go with my face, I need something goes more along with the mouth and teeth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry was a little weirded out by the statement, he never thought he'd here a woman talking about (for lack of a better word) uglying herself up for fun.  <i>I guess knowing that everyone can swap back by next week will really let you be more daring with how you do some things in your life.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheodore was next up, \"I'll put up my job,\" and the sheet of paper with 'girl's coach' written on it reappeared.  \"I don't mind it, but I don't like to have the same anything for two sessions in a row.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of us prefer it that way,\" Manuela told Henry in a sidebar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea put some thought into evening out the pot but decided against it.  Everyone then showed their hands and Edward won with a three of a kind.  \"Come to papa.\" Edward said as he started to rearrange the bets.  \"Erica, since you will be working out more than usual this weekend, you might as well have some legs that you can do some good for.\"  Erica sighed as the swap took place, Henry sitting next to Erica looked as her once firm toned legs became flabby.  \"Honey, I think I'll give you Manuela's eyebrows.\"  So Andrea's eyebrows became a little more manicured looking while Manuela's looked a little more natural.  \"Manuela, you might as well have the face to match the teeth.\"  This change freaked Henry out a little more than the others.  Henry looked at Manuela and where once beside him had been a stunning face, was now a Hispanic and slightly more feminine version of Theodore.  Manuela just laughed at the look of uneasiness on Henry's face, \"Hey!  It's not that bad.\"  Theodore said.  \"Sorry,\" Henry quickly muttered while Theodore just laughed.  \"No offense taken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward didn't seemed to have noticed or cared too much as he was still concentrating on the pot.  \"Theodore, you want something different huh?  You haven't been a math teacher before.\"  And he put the 'girl's coach' paper onto Henry.  Andrea looked at her husband disapprovingly, \"Edward!  Henry is still trying to adjust and you change his job on him!  And to the girl's coach no less.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry sat there uncomfortably while Andrea continued to scold her husband for his 'insensitivity' but Henry spoke up to stop it.  \"Andrea it's really okay.  I'll have to do it sooner or later.  I guess this is a good way of jumping right in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly.\" Andrea said, \"Just put up the job for a bet later on and we'll switch you out of it.  Yes you'll probably do it later on, but you should not be doing something that you aren't comfortable doing only your second week on the job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry agreed with Andrea but not wanting to seem uneasy in front of everyone just said, \"No it's okay, maybe I will put it up later for a bet, but it's a part of the game and I knew that going in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you didn't.\" Manuela said.  \"You don't have to try and act okay with everything done here.  This is a fun game but I'm not going to lie there have been tricky times.  This isn't a bad one, but Edward still shouldn't have done that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward just sat there looking embarrassed, \"Yeah kidI mean, Henry.  They're right.  I wasn't thinking of the consequences when I did that.  I'll tell you what, I'll put my job up next round no matter the hand and swap with you.  Least I can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but physics really isn't my strongest subject.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And teenage girls are?\" Erica said getting a laugh from the room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201eOkay then\u2026\u201c, mumbled Edward as he dealt the cards. \u201eSince I\u2019ve kinda messed up\u2026 I\u2019ll bet my job.\u201c. Then a sheet on which \u201cphysics\u201d was written on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica was next putting something into the pot. \u201cOkay\u2026 I have to put in two points\u2026 Let\u2019s see\u2026 I\u2019ll bet my sports skill.\u201d. Another holographic sheet of paper appeared with the word \u2018sports\u2019 written on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen everyone looked at their cards and Henry began betting. His cards looked good, very good. \u201cOkay.\u201d, he said and tried to put on his best poker face. \u201cIf I bet something and I win, then I can decide to keep it, right?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManuela nodded. \u201cYeah. Only traits of losers have to be swapped.\u201d, she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that knowledge Henry began thinking of what he should bet and began betting. \u201cOookay. Let\u2019s see. I\u2019ll bet my underwear and my name.\u201d. An image of his boxershorts and a sheet with his name on it appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c2 points then\u2026\u201d, mumbled Manuela and thought what she should swap. \u201cI\u2019ll bet my life.\u201d, she said and everyone gasped. A small ball which looked like a ghost or soul appeared besides Manuela. \u201cIt\u2019s strange that it doesn\u2019t show a sheet with something written on it like in other cases but I guess it describes your soul which is integral to your life. Or something like that. Nobody understands the reason.\u201d, she explained to Henry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll fold.\u201d, was the immediate reaction of the following three players. They wanted to tell Henry that Manuela was normally rather timid and only bet much when she knew she would win. The teachers knew how the others were playing, no wonder considering that they played the game for years now. The three decided against telling Henry because where would be the fun in it if he knew it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManuela grinned dirtily at Henry. \u201cSo, what will you do?\u201d, she asked. She knew that the other teachers knew how she played and normally tried to cover it so that it\u2019s not that everybody folds but now she wanted to test Henry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d, said Henry confidently. He was sure that he would win. \u201cI\u2019ll bet my genitals.\u201d. An image of a penis appeared beside Henry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManuela thought for a moment if she should bet more and see how far he would go but decided against it. She did not want to scare Henry away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, show me your cards.\u201d, she said and showed him her own cards. She enjoyed the view when Henry\u2019s mouth fell open and he only showed his own cards unwillingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I won.\u201d, she said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t be too hard.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the objects she had to rearrange. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s see. Let\u2019s begin with Edward\u2019s job. I know you won\u2019t be comfortable with being girl\u2019s coach Henry, so here we go.\u201d. She dragged and dropped the physics sheet on the Henry figure. \u201cI think Physics will suit you better.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks\u2026\u201d, he said and was not sure if he could really \u2018endure\u2019 five days of teaching physics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext\u2026 I\u2019ll keep my life.\u201d, she moved the soul to her own figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince I guess you\u2019ll be girl\u2019s coach Edward, I\u2019ll give you Erica\u2019s sports skills. That way you can at least do a much better lesson.  Erica, you\u2019ll get Henry\u2019s name. You\u2019re already considered a man so that will fit. You\u2019ll also get Henry\u2019s underwear, since he already has your beasts. Last but not least, I\u2019ll get Henry\u2019s penis.\u201d. The last words formed a grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry was surprised when suddenly his boxershorts turned into soft panties and a bra formed around his chest. He felt empty between the legs when his penis had vanished and was replaced by Manuela\u2019s vagina. Henry could be mistaken for a woman if it had not been for his overall body structure minus his female anatomy.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Henry sat there amazed for a while as he put his hand over what was now his vagina, he was just so surprised by the flatness that was now his crotch.  This was apparently showing on his face as Manuela gave a little fake cough to get his attention.  Henry blushed and quickly put his arms on the table so nobody would get any ideas about what was going on.  \"Sorry,\" Henry said meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, we understand it's a new experience for you.\"  Andrea said in an almost motherly faction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't think it's too much to ask for you to show some decorum Erica.\" Edward said disapprovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  Oh yeah.  Okay.\"  Henry said still embarrassed about what had happened.  \"Guess I need to get used to responding to that name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you do, but if it will make you more comfortable and less confusing for you, while we are playing poker we'll call you Henry.  It also will probably help if you continue to just think of yourself as Henry,\"  Manuela said.  Henry was a little confused at this advice, but just assumed that it was based on experience and said, \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we've got that settled, it's my deal.\" Erica said and while dealing the cards she said, \"I'll go ahead and put in my hair.\"  As soon as all the cards were dealt a long pony tailed head of hair popped up in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um,\" Henry said trying to think of what to put in, \"I'll go with my arms I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked at their hands and Manuela and Theodore instantly folded.  Andrea however looked rather confident, \"I'll bet my life,\" she said as the soul figure appeared before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward folded and said, \"Well whoever wins just know that tonight is meatloaf night,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you think I'm betting?\" Andrea said getting a laugh from the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica looked intensely at Andrea and Henry before saying, \"I'll raise you my entire wardrobe,\" Erica said smiling and what looked like an open closet with a bunch of tiny articles of clothing hanging up.  Henry looked at his hand and folded not wanting to lose any more than he had to.  Andrea smiled at Erica before saying \"I'll call you with my vision,\" and a piece of paper that said 20/30 popped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two ladies showed their hands with Andrea turning out to be the victor with 3 kings beating Erica's 3 queens.  \"Alright, let's see what we've got here,\" Andrea said, \"I think I'll be keeping this,\" Andrea said referring to her eyesight and then went back to the board.  \"Well I was thinking of trying to be someone else for a week, but since it's meatloaf night I'll keep it in the family.\"  Andrea said as she swapped lives with her husband.  \"Guess I'll be going to that mother/daughter girls night this weekend.\" Edward said, \"You know you like those,\" Andrea said kissing her husband on the cheek.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just remember now you're the one who has to do the yard work,\" Edward said with a grin.  \"Darn, you're right.\" Andrea said, \"Well I think I know how to make that a little easier,\" Henry knew immediately what she meant, and so he looked down at his arms as they went from being fairly lean and muscular to very feminine and much softer.  <i>I'm never going to get used to this.</i> Henry thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you're going to be the mom this weekend, you might as well have the hair for it.\"  And so Edward's head of white hair became Erica's long blonde lochs.  Henry turned to Erica and laughed when he saw Edward's white hair on her head all put together in a rather silly faction with Erica's scrunchy.  Realizing how silly she looked she took it out and offered it to Edward which he politely refused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And last but not least, we have this,\" Andrea said while fiddling with the representation of Erica's wardrobe.  Smiling she said to Henry, \"It'd be such a shame for you have such a nice body only to go home to a bunch of boring old suits.\"  And before Henry could say something in his defense, she made the swap.  Henry had been expecting (and kind of hoping) that the dress he would wearing would be put on Erica and he'd get the sweat pants and t-shirt she had on but that wasn't the case.  Manuela saw his confusion and explained, \"Basically what that swap did was just change the cloths that are at home.  The cloths you bring to the game aren't affected by a wardrobe swap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Henry said wrapping his mind around what was going on, \"So the next time we play I'm going to have to come wearing this dress to school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheodore answered, \"Well it doesn't have to be next time we play.  You can bring that dress back whenever you feel like it.  We've all got cloths the belong to each other at home.  Maybe next time I'll wear the skirt I'd swapped with Manuela.  You may think it weird, but if you saw me showing of my legs in that thing you'd actually find it completely normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry was about to refute that claim, but after seeing the cards in action decided against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, with that cleared up it's time for the final hand of the evening, Henry.  You're up.\" Erica said sliding the cards over to him.</span></div></div>",

After he finished everyone was looking at him.  \"Oh yeah, sorry,\"  Henry said, \"I'll put in my socks I guess.\"  And Henry's socks popped up in front of him, he was even embarrassed to notice a hole in one of them.  \"And I'll put in my movie collection,\"  Manuela said before picking up her cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll raise you my house,\" Theodore said as a nice little house appeared.  Andrea folded and Edward put in the panty hose he'd 'won' from Andrea earlier and his cooking skills much to the delight of Andrea.  Erica seemed to like her hand and put in her male gender she got from Henry.  Henry looked down at his hand for the first time and knew he was losing so he folded.  Manuela next called Theodore's raise by putting in her hair color.  Everyone revealed their hands and groaned upon seeing Theodore had won again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I'm going out on top.\"  Theodore said while tinkering with the bets.  \"Let's see, I think I'll keep my house but I will take Manuela's movie collection, I think I'll be staying in this weekend.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just make sure you don't open anything still in the plastic.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know your rules Manuela, no problem.  And since I'm staying in I think I'll take Edward's cooking skills and make some of that famous meatloaf of yours.  Let's see, you know what, since I'm on a bit of a selfish streak I'll take Manuela's hair color.\"  With that Edward's graying hair became jet black while Manuela suddenly had some oddly stylish grey streaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, what's left.\"  Theodore said, \"You know what Henry, if you'll be wearing dresses or skirts your legs will be getting cold so...\" Theodore gave Henry Andrea's pantie hose and Henry suddenly felt a weird discomfort in his legs.  \"You might want to consider shaving your legs while you've got those.\" Erica said noticing Henry's discomfort.  \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And last but not least,\" Theodore said while looking at the male symbol in front of Erica and then gave a little smile, \"Erica gets to be a woman again,\" he said while swapping Erica's male gender with Manuela.  Henry noticed Manuela blushing while a few other people at the table chuckled.  \"What is it?\"  Henry asked.  \"It's nothing.\" Andrea said to the suspicious Henry.  \"Let's go ahead and head home.\"</span></div></div>",

Henry took notice to Manuela giving him a hug just before he left.  Henry couldn't help it, but he did blush a little at this, he tried to hide his face a little bit when he felt it flush up but he noticed her smiling at him and blush herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry made his way back to his car, (making sure to concentrate a little more with each step due to the small heel in his new boots) and got in to drive home.  Over the course of the ride home Henry really felt the changes to his body.  When he'd sat down, he'd noticed that he actually had to concentration a little bit about where his dress was so he didn't accidentally rip it or even 'reveal' himself.  He noticed that when turning the steering wheel he had to put more force into it than he normally did due to his slightly weaker arms.  But the thing he noticed the most were his breasts.  When he put on his seat-belt he couldn't help but feel the strap press against them, and then when he turned down one of the bumpier roads he really noticed there was a lot of bounce that he wasn't used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he got to his home.  He groaned at the sight of all the packed up boxes that he still hadn't even opened yet.  He'd been planning on trying to make a dent in it this weekend, but now with these changes it didn't really seem all that important anymore.  Interested to see what he had waiting for him he went to his bedroom and opened up his closet.  He had been expecting it, but Henry still stood in awe at all the new cloths that were stuffed into his tiny closet.  Since it was Erica's wardrobe Henry had been expecting alot of pants and sweats, but surprisingly there weren't many, she actually had a number of nice skirts, blouses, and dresses hanging up.  Henry dug in the closet for a while in slim hopes of finding some slacks or a button up shirt he'd feel comfortable wearing to school on Monday but alas he found none.  \"So on Monday I can either wear a skirt, athletic shorts, or sweatpants.  Fantastic.\"  Henry said to himself, \"Well I guess I'll worry about that later.\"  So Henry shut up the closet and made his way to his kitchen for a nice dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry poured himself a bowl of milk and cereal and just sat on the couch and turned on the tv.  There may have been alot of weird changes to his life the last few hours, but he saw that as no reason to change his normal routine.  After an hour or so the phone rang.  Henry jumped a little as it was actually the first time since he'd plugged the phone in that he'd gotten a call.  After getting over the slight surprise he went over and answered the phone.  \"This is Henry,\"  he said waiting for whoever was on the other line to reveal themselves.</span></div></div>",

Why are you saying your name is Henry?\", asked a voice that was all too familiar for Henry and he had hoped he would never hear this voice again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, er Megan.\", he stuttered and tried to come up with an answer. \"You see... There is this teacher at school, I er really get along very well with her. This is kind of an insider, she just thought I look like a Henriette... Short Henry. I thought she was on the phone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence. Henry's heart beat so loud, he thought the people on the other side of the world could hear it. He was not sure why he was so afraid but he was. The silence until Megan finally said something again was only around 4 seconds but for Henry it was like 4 hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... If you say so... Anyways.\", she began slowly and Henry was relieved that she bought his lie. \"I'm not calling to get to know what you're doing.\", she continued and Henry had to find out that her voice sounded more softly and nicer than the last he had spoken to her. \"I found some stuff of yours that you forgot when you left. I wanted to know if I should keep it until you can come and get it or if I should throw it away.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Henry was supried. He had no idea what he should say. The voice was clearly his ex-wife's voice but the way she spoke to him and that she asked him if she should keep his stuff until he can get it. That was so not like her. The two broke up and it was neither pleasant nor lovely for both of them. The last word she had said to him were \"Get off, you ass.\" although she said something not so nice like \"you ass\". But now she was calm and sounded sorry for breaking up with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please keep them, Megan. Okay? I'll come and get the next weekend, ok?\", he answered and you could hear that he was suprised but Megan thought it was something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, Erica?\", she asked and sounded like she really card. \"I know it must have been hard for you but it's just that I really don't love you anymore. I still like you, I really hope we can be friends but I'm just not into women anymore. Maybe I never was...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry was shocked and tried to figure out what she had just said. \"We were a lesbian married couple? Were we even married? Maybe that's why she is so much nicer to me. Since we're both women. If all lesbian coupled are like that? Nah, probably not. She's probably more friendly to women than to men.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine. I just have to... figure out what to do now. Don't worry about me. I just hope you're happy.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry could hear her breath out relieved. \"I'm glad you're saying this. I really hope we can be friends. I mean you're like my best friend.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er yeah. I also want that.\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway.\", she then continued. \"I gotta hang up. I'll call you tomorrow, okay? Then we can talk. I'm really interested what your life is like there.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, hear you tomorrow.\", he mumbled and hang up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our relationship really got stranger... Maybe better... I don't know...\". Henry then got back to his bed room. \"Well... I should worry about it tomorrow... Or some other day... Time to get some sleep...\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry began slipping off the dress and looked at his bra for the first time in all it's glory. It was a lacy, pink bra. \"I hadn't thought that the girl's coach would dress so girly like...\". Henry glanced over to his waderobe full of foreign women's clothing. \"Well, I should have known after I saw the waderobe.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then got into the bathroom, brushed his teeth and then got dressed in a purple nightgown he had found beside his shower, he normally left his pajamas there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry went to bed and slept like a baby. The day was really exhausting for him. At least tomorrow was saturday. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Henry woke up the next morning as he usually had done on Saturday since his divorce.  He just stayed there in bed for a while.  He just lay back and thought back on what had happened to him.  But this time instead of dwelling on the negatives in his life like his ex, he thought about his new life at his new job, and even his new friends.  No matter how old one gets, it's still a nice feeling to have new friends when you're feeling down.  After reflecting on this for a little while he felt his stomach grumble and finally got up to get breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry couldn't help but chuckle at himself and his new body as he made his way to his kitchen, me made sure to walk slowly to just really get a feel of himself.  Henry got his bowl and poured his usual bowl of cereal and poured his milk, only to find it was empty.  \"No problem.\"  Henry said to himself as he made his way back to the fridge, only to open it and find a half a stick of butter and baking soda.  \"Darn, guess there really isn't a way out of this,\" Henry said as he shut the refrigerator and made his way back to his room to get dressed for a quick trip to the grocery store.  He took off his house robe and grabbed the first set of thick and baggy sweat cloths he could find.  He was about to go out the door before he saw himself in the mirror.  What he saw actually disgusted himself to a degree.  Standing in front of him wasn't the handsome young man he thought of himself as.  What he saw was a  woman who happened to have his face just looking sad and disheveled.  He'd never bothered to care about appearances before, but with this body he was himself in a sort of new light and he didn't like what he saw.  \"Man, is this really how I've looked to people the last few months?\"  Henry thought out loud.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that pathetic image of himself seems to have been the spark Henry needed to get his life off and running again.  He quickly took off the sweat cloths and went back to the closet to find something that would make him look and feel good.  For a minute he thought about wearing one of Erica's dresses she had hanging up, after all he had worn a dress yesterday, but decided that he wanted to wear something Henry might wear as opposed to Erica.  He finally found a nice pair of blue jeans and a maroon blouse that didn't look too girly.  For the first time in a while Henry spent a good amount of time combing and styling his hair so that it would look darn good.  To top it off, just because he was now feeling a bit daring, Henry put on the pair of boots from yesterday with the heels in them rather than go a pair of sneakers he had on before.  Just before he tried to leave again he got another look at himself in the mirror, he smiled at the weird, but still good looking in it's own way image looking back at him.  He was ready to build his life up again, starting with a little trip to the grocery store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time in months Henry not only got milk, cereal, and some sodas from the store, he went all out with eggs, fruits, veggies, assorted meats, spices, the whole nine yards.  He was going to start treating himself and his body right.  He even felt as he was pushing the cart down the aisles that he had a new bounce to his step that had nothing to do with his breasts.  After filling up his cart he made his way to the checkout line where he recognized the clerk as one of his students.  \"Hello Rocky.\"  Henry said to the boy who, after his knowledge switch with Edward, he knew was a member of the football team and didn't pay much attention in class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi Ms. Mathews.  You getting groceries today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's why I'm at the grocery store Rocky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah\" Rocky said sounding a little embarrassed, \"Hey Ms. Mathews?  What chapters did you say we have to study for the physics test Monday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry didn't know the answer to the question, but had a good guess what the right answer was, \"The same chapters that we went over in class Rocky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah.  Thanks Ms. Mathews.\" Rocky said as he finished bagging Henry's groceries.  \"Would you like me to carry them to your car?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can handle it.\" Henry said but after he got out of the store had second thoughts.  <i>Maybe I should have let him do the work,</i> Henry thought as he pushed the heavy cart full of food products over the rocky parking lot.  He was practically exhausted by the time he back to his car, he actually had to stop for a breather.  Someone seemed to have noticed this and came over to ask Henry if he needed help.</span></div></div>",

Henry looked over to him. Principal Jackson was a tall, thin man around 60 years old and had was wearing a suit even on a saturday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, yeah. I though I should buy all this stuff now so I don't have to buy it during the week. Then I can concentrate on work.\", he explained and the principle nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a gentlemen would I be if I don't help a lady push such a heavy cart.\", he said and grabbed the cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you don't need to-\", began Henry but was stopped by a glance of the principle. Henry stayed silent and lead principle Jackson to his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\", said Henry when they had reached the car. Henry opened the trunk. The principle put the shoppings in there and then looked at Henry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Erica. You're settled in?\", he asked. Henry nodded and smiled. \"Yeah. The other teachers are really nice and I really feel at home.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe priniciple smiled. \"That's good to hear. I think of our college as a family and it's really important that everybody feels at home and comes to work with joy.\". All the shoppings were now in the trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also heard that you already got to know our little game.\". Henry suddenly had an uneasy look on his face. Principle Jackson grinned. \"Don't worry. We all play it and I won't ask you what has been swapped. It would be impossible to accept anyway. That's the wonderful thing with the cards. We don't have to worry about someone finding something out because nobody can believe any swap when he is not involve in the game. The only downside is that we're not able to believe any swaps have been occured.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\", Henry mumbled. \"I already heard that.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackson smiled broadly. \"Good to hear. The last time someone new joined us, they only told him half the stuff.\", he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... Anyways, it was nice to meet you again, principle Jackson. And thanks for helping me here.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, Erica.\", said the principle still smiling. \"Oh and please call me Simon.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry got into the car.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Henry drove home and thought about what the principle had told him. They were really like a family. Henry felt that how they reacted. He was sure they knew each other very well. No wonder, they lived each others live probably multiple times. \"I think I can have a happy life here.\", he thought when he got to the apartment building and got up to the floor where his apartment was. He only had taken out one of the shopping bags. He knew they were to heavy for him to carry them up all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry was surprised when he saw Manuela standing at his door and knocking at it. \"Manuela?\", asked Henry surprised and the spanish teacher turned around and lookd at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Henry.\", she smiled surprised. \"Good that you're here. I had feared you were away and I'd be here for nothing.\". She went over to him. \"I see you've been shopping.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry nodded. \"Yeah, I ran low on food.\", he explained and walked over to his door. \"Could you please hold this for a moment?\", he asked, handed her the shopping bag and opened the door. Henry took the bag back and went to the kitchen to place it there on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta get the other bags.\", he explained and left the apartment again. Manuela followed him. \"I'm gonna help you.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all shopping bags where in place, Henry looked at her and asked the question he wanted to ask her right away. \"What lead you here?\", he asked her curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManuela smiled at him. \"I just thought that your new to town and might want a tour. You're only three weeks here and probably had no time to see more than the school and the supermarket.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I really had no time to see the town. So you're volunteering to guide me around?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\", smiled Manuela excited. \"Come on. Let's go out.\", she grabbed his hand and lead him to the door but stopped when she heard the clicking of Henry's high heeled boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might want to reconsider your footwear. We're going to walk a lot. Maybe you should change into flats.\", she suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right. I really should listen to you when it comes to those things. You've been a woman for a longer time than me.\". Henry went back to his bedroom and changed out of the boots and into black ballet flats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay shall we?\", Henry asked Manuela when he came back. Both went out and Manuela guided him down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how are you getting along with the changes?\", she asked him and tried to do some small talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it seems that my ex-wife is now much nicer to me.\", he explained. \"I'm not sure if I'm going to be enjoying teaching physics but we'll see.\". Henry looked at Manuela. \"But tell me... How did you even find this game?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not quite sure myself. I heard that Edward found the box on a garage sale. Since then they're playing this game. I joined when I came to school just like you.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you play only among the teachers or do you get students on board?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally only the teachers play with us. Sometimes we get the kids of someone with us. I heard that they had the got the student representative to play with them once. I don't know if that's true.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry nodded while Manuela showed him a nice little restaurant. \"And I think Edward mentioned it. He was the bride on his daughters wedding.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\", asked Henry curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, his daughter knew she would get cold feet. Just like her soon-to-be-husband. So Andrea and Edward volunteered to do the wedding. Some of us teachers thought it would be funny if we attend the wedding as someone else. I was the flower girl. We swapped back after the ceremony so that the newly wedded couple could have their wedding night.\", she grinned at him when she told him the last thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... What are the capabilities of these cards?\", he asked. \"And what else can they do?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManuela smiled excited. \"Everything you can imagine. They also have another interesting function. You can relive memories. Like really relive. It's like you are living them in the moment but with every other swap that had been taken place. Except when you swapped memories with someone. Then you are still yourself but everybody in the memory will see you as the person.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry shrugged his shoulders. \"So what? I can remember my memories and I guess if I swap memories I can do that as well.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you could but because it's magic you can explore what would have happened. And in a better way than in your mind. Since it's magic the people will react like how they would really react no matter what you do. It's the best entertainment in my opinion. I think this function was originally intended to help us understand swapped memories or our changed life.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" </span></div></div>",

Especially when you say that it fits to reality. I wouldn't want to relive my life as a woman... for now. Maybe some time later.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManuela smiled warmly at him. \"As you wish.\", she replied like a djinn who was about to fullfil his masters wish. \"Then we'll continue this way. \"I guess the mall is nice for you to know. It's quite far from your home, when you walk, but it's not like you have anything else to do, right?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry agreed and the two walked side by side but exchanged not one word. Once in a while, Henry looked over to Manuela who still had Edward's bad teeth and therefore tried to avoid smiling with her teeth. Not that she would look any better with her teeth now that she possessed a feminine version of Theodore's face. Still, she looked pretty, he had to admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, just a quick thought.\", said Manuela suddenly. The mall was already in sight. \"I know you're not the youngest anymore, you're just divorced and currently considered a woman but how about we two go clubbing tonight? Not some club where you feel like you could be the father of three quarters of the girls there. I know a nice one where we could have fun.\". What she did not tell him was that she was curious to how he would react and she wanted to see him dressed in one of Erica's dresses. Maybe there was something else about it but she was not sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure, Manuela...\", Henry said hasitently. \"I'm interested but not sure. I mean, I'm a woman now, right? Then only man would hit on me... Or lesbians. What happens when I change back?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManuela smiled at him and forgot about her teeth. \"Don't worry. I'll watch out for you. You will be hit on but nobody will go out with you. Just don't tell them your name and everything else.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry thought about it. When the two had finally arrived the mall he had made his decision: </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After taking a few steps into the mall Henry finally decided, \"Why the hell not.  You only live once and I've got to get out of my funk.  Might as well dive in head first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\"  Manuela said excitedly, \"First things first we're going to have to get you dressed up for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa whoa!  What's wrong with what I'm wearing now?  I think I dressed myself up pretty well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you do look fantastic, especially considering it was your first time getting dress up after those changes, but girlfriend, trust me.  If you go to a club looking like that you'll stick out like a sore thumb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, I guess you know more about clubbing than I do so I'll take your word.  So I guess we'll go ahead and go back to my place to find something to wear.\"  Henry said turning around, but found Manuela was holding his feminine arm preventing him from leaving.  Henry looked at her and saw a yellow grin looking back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's on the whole other side of town, we're just got to the mall, might as well find something here, maybe grab a bite to eat, and just head to the club afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry looked at Manuela sceptically, \"You just want to see my try on dresses don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be so much fun.\"  Manuela said knowing she wasn't fooling anyone with her paper thin reasoning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry sighed, his initial instinct was to just say no.  But he did think about it for a second, this was certainly a unique experience he could partake in and his curious mind did take to that.  It would also let him spend some more time with Manuela who he had to admit, he found he really enjoyed spending time with.  Plus the idea seemed to make her happy.  Finally Henry shrugged his shoulders and said, \"I'm probably going to regret this, but let's do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic!\"  Manuela said while jumping a little bit, unable to contain her excitement.  She instantly regained some form of composer though upon seeing some looks she was getting from some passerby in the mall.  \"Oh yeah, I'm considered a guy, so stuff like that goes from being cute to creepy.  It's a real shame,\"  she said with a pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A quick tip.  Men don't usually pout either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I am going to make you pay for that.  Probably with lace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManuela was true to her word, as the two spent the next few hours going from store to store as Manuela encouraged Henry to try on racks of dress at a time it seemed.  It felt to Henry like each dress either got more girly, short, revealing, showy, and/or flashy.  But Henry was able to get through it by making fun of himself along the way and noticing how much Manuela was enjoying herself.  Henry even noticed that a few times when he looked in the mirror he found himself thinking that the girl who had his face and features actually was pretty nice looking.  Finally after hours had passed the two settled on a dark blue flowy dress with some very nice circular designs.  \"Alright, let's head to the food court and grab a bite.\"  Henry said feeling surprisingly exhausted after the days events.  \"Oh we're just half way done, we still have to find a new pair of shoes to go with it.\"  Henry groaned as Manuela almost literally dragged him into the nearest shoe store where after nearly a whole other hour Henry decided on a pair of dark blue 2 inch strapped heels.  Manuela didn't love the choice, she had her eyes on a pair with 4 inch heels but that's where Henry drew his line.  So after paying for the shoes the two hit the food court where they each had a nice greasy slice of pizza before they went to the club.</span></div></div>",

Are we visiting someone else from the poker game?\"  Henry asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite.\"  Manuela said not breaking her stride.  \"I figured I'd introduce you to a few friends of mine who I suspect will probably want to go with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait just a minute!  I barely feel ok just being like this,\" Henry said referencing his body, \"And now you just want to toss me to the wolves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down <i>Erica</i>, these friends of mine are not wolves, they're just some friends of mine.  I figured that you could do with making friends outside of the school staff.  You can't survive on just home and schoolwork, you need to go out and meet people and get on with living.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you're right, but can't I do that when I'm back to normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you could wait til then, but where's your sense of adventure.  Besides, it's not like you've changed on the inside, you are still you.  Only your body and a few...minor details have been changed about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like my gender.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManuela took a moment to stop and look Henry in the eyes, \"Gender schmender.  One thing I've experienced with the cards is that things like that are nice and all, but the breasts and the gender don't make the man, it's more than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'll go through with this thing with your friends, but I still don't feel right about meeting them like this.  It almost feels like I'm lying to them about who I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what, we'll go out like this, and next week when we're back to normal we'll go out again.  Same people, same club, everything.  You can then render final judgement then on your thoughts on this if you want to keep getting philosophical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry gave a light chuckle, \"Now that sounds like my kind of party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued on til Manuela stopped them at a run down looking home in the poorer part of town, \"Here we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we're here how about you tell me about who we're going out with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some former students of mine who just graduated last year, Owen and Chloe Davis.\"  As soon as Manuela said these names a rush of images and information about the two seemed to pop up in Henry's brain.  Henry suddenly saw images in his head of a young couple.  He was a really tall guy with an average build and a dirty blonde mop top, while she was a stunning petite girl with long blonde hair.  Henry also somehow knew that these two got married their senior year at school after years of dating after Chloe got pregnant and later gave birth to a baby girl who they named Ellie.  The two manged to graduate near the top of their class but each gave up promising careers that would have forced them to separate.  So now they live in a run down house while Owen works at a bank and Chloe works in an electronics store to make ends meet, but they seem to have love keeping them together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're a pair of former students who...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManuela looked confused for a second before Henry explained, \"Edwards knowledge of students, I guess it wasn't just for the students at school.  I know all about them and the baby and everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should have known,\" Manuela muttered to herself, \"Well just make sure you be careful and don't let them know that.  Even with the cards magic that would be a tricky one to explain considering you've never met them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManuela knocked on the door (the door bell seems to be broken) and a few seconds later Chloe answered the door.  Henry was a little surprised by what he saw.  He'd been expecting to see the beautiful blonde girl he'd seen in his mind's eye, but before him a still very pretty girl who seemed to have aged considerably in the short time since Edward's mental image of her.  She also had cut her hair short and colored it black.  \"Hey you!\" Chloe said while practically leaping into Manuela's arms for a hug.  \"Who is it Chloe?\"  a man's voice said in the background as Owen turned the corner.  He looked more or less like the image Henry had in his head, although he now had had a slightly larger cut and looked like he hadn't shaved the last few days.  \"Hey!  Good to see you bro!\"  Owen said giving Manuela a semi complex handshake.  \"Who's your cute friend.\"  Owen said upon seeing Henry only to receive a playful hit from his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the new physics teacher at the college, Erica Matthews.  I was just showing her around town and we were about to go to a club and I thought I could invite you two so you can have a good time and Erica can make some friends who aren't just fellow teachers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a good plan, you two just put your things down and I can go get ready while Owen calls his mom to babysit, she's been practically begging us to let her have alone time with her granddaughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or grandson.\"  Owen said, \"I don't suppose you have the cards on you?  It's ladies night at a few places and I wouldn't be against not having to pay a cover charge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owen!\"  Chloe said hitting her husband in a less playful way while giving a look to Manuela and Henry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry she already knows about the cards, and sorry but no I don't have them.\"  Manuela said relieving Chloe's fears.  Chloe breathed a sigh of relief and gave a quick smack to Owen again before going to get ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that Manuela, total brain fart on my part,\"  Owen said sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay.\"  Manuela said, but Henry was still a little confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you mean grandson?  Manuela told me that you had only had a daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we do, but if we had the cards we could play a quick hand and I could switch genders with little Ellie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why and how would that work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we'd simply just deal out a hand to everyone including Ellie.  Because she can't really do anything about it after a minute she automatically folds, then everyone but myself would fold and I'd bet my gender, I'd swap with Ellie and then I'd get into some clubs for free and get half off drinks.\"  Owen explained but upon seeing the semi horrified and disgusted look on Henry's face said, \"Hey! It's not like I do it every week, I've done that trick only one other time.  Hell, once Chloe took a week off of work and swapped occupations with Ellie just for the heck of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OWEN!\"  A yell from a disapproving Chloe bellowed through the small house while Manuela laughed and Henry just thought to himself <i>What have I gotten myself into.</i></span></div></div>",

Who would not, if they were a woman for nearly 24 hours and suddenly at a club in a town they barely knew. But, after a few drinks, Henry lightened up and really enjoyed it stay, even if the heels and the dress he had to wear were trying their best to tell him otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManuela really seemd to enjoy looking at him tattering around in the heels. She seemed to grin every time he stumbled. It looked like she could not take it anymore when Henry tried to dance, something he will never do again, unless he gets a 'dance in high heels skill' from someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the group looked for a nice quiet place where they sat down and talked. Owen and Chloe told Henry all about school, about pupils he should look out for and so on. It was tough for Henry to feign interest because he already knew everything but he managed it well. When they began talking about their lives, Henry could finally show some real interest because most things he did not know because Edward did not seem to know anything about them beyong school. The talk was only interrupted by the occasional dance the two did. Chloe really missed dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I buy you a drink?\", asked a voice behind Henry suddenly. Henry slowly looked around to see a man around 30 standing there. He did not look bad. \"No thanks.\", replied Henry and turned back around and thus symbolised the man to go away. That was just when Chloe and Owen came back from the dancing stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the fifth man you sent away.\", noticed Chloe surprised. \"You have a boyfriend, Erica?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry shook his head. \"No... Just an ex wife...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe nodded. \"I see... So you're in women... Well, then Manuela and you definitely fit together. He prefers men.\", she laughed and took a sip from her drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so.\", mumbled Henry and looked over to his colleague who was busy flirting with some guy. She really seemed to enjoy the situation she was in. Maybe he should try it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long since you've broken up?\", asked Owen. \"Maybe it would help if you try flirting a little like Manuela over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just recently...\". Henry looked to Manuela, then back to Owen. \"I don't know... It just does not feel right...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe smiled at him. \"Come on, Erica. You have to look out for another woman, eventually.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... But then I'd be a man again. On the other hand... Manuela seems to enjoy it. She said I should try to experience things I would never experience normally.\", he thought and looked back and forth between Manuela and Chloe. \"No harm in a flirt, right? It's not like I'm going to marry someone... It's just been a while since I flirted last time...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry then decided to...</span></div></div>",

Never the less, there were many antique things. Most of them were garbage but it did not hurt to look. The three had nothing else to do anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at that.\", said Steven and pointed out to a small figure of an owl, made out of wood. \"This looks creepy...\", shuddered Julie and turned away. \"It looks like it's going to attack me.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so? I think it looks kinda nice.\", replied Jason and took the figure in his hand. \"Look, it likes you.\", he said grinning and brought the figure near Julie's face who instantly stepped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JASON!\", she screamed. \"I really could punch you in the face sometimes!\". With these words she turned around and got over to Steven who already turned his attention to another item.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you looking at?\", she asked him curiously. He pointed to a box positioned on a table. \"This thing.\", he said. \"It looks strange... It makes me feel strange... I don't know... But I somehow get the feeling that it is calling out to me. Maybe I should be it?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie looked closer at the box. \"I can't see anything strange... Looks like a normal box with a creepy images on it. But it looks nicer than the owl figure over there.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven grinned at his friend. \"I don't think so. You only see it that way because you're afraid of owls.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie shook her head hysterically. \"Absolutely not! Owls are just horrible being which should all be killed!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven laughed. \"If you say so... Well, I guess I'll buy this box. Can't hurt to look in it later, right?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not open it now?\", asked Jason who had put the owl figure down and was now standing behind his two friends and looked at the box just as curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's locked, duh.\", replied Steven and pointed at a lock at the front of the box. \"And unless you want to break it open and get in trouble, I'll have to buy it.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Steven went to the old man who did the garage sale and bought the box for 5$ and got the key with which he could open the box. He looked strange at Steven but did not say anything. Steven thought nothing of it and left the garage sale with his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt home, the three friends were sitting on the ground and were looking at the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open it, Steven.\", said Jason impatiently. Julie nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven took the key, his breath got heavier. He had no idea why. Slowly he opened the box and the friends saw it's content. Cards.

They looked like normal cards you would normally use for poker games. \"That's it?\", he asked disappointed. \"So much secrecity just for some old cards? Are you kidding me?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason wanted to follow him in his disappointed when he noticed a piece of paper which was lying in the box. \"What this?\", he asked himself and got it out. \"Instructions? I thought this was something exciting.\". He nearly wanted to throw the paper away when he noticed what was written on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says you can swap traits through these cards.\", he explained his friends while he skimmed the instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right. Of cooouurse.\", replied Julie sarcastically. \"And it was probably designed by Santa Claus.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be stupid.\". Jason then began reading it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The game is played like a normal poker game until someone wins a hand. The winner is allowed to swap a trait with one of the losers just by saying the word \"I want to swap X with Y\". The swap will take place immediately. If the winner does not decide what he wants to swap after a period of 2 minutes, the cards will decide for him. There are four special joker's in the game. If someone wins with one of these in his hand, the winner decide what two losers may swap. Again, the winner has a time limit of 2 minutes and has to use the phrase \"I want that X swaps Y with Z\". It is allowed to get the jokers out of the card deck if you want to play without them. The swaps are permanent for a period of 48 hours. After that you can swap back traits you previously owned. It is not possible to get a trait you started with or you had during the game. It is possible to swap swapped traits with other losers. After 48 hours, the traits will be available for the person again. Reality will adjust, everyone who is not participating in the game when the swap took place will not notice anything strange even if confronted directly with the swap. People will also not believe that such swaps are able or that those cards exist. It is also impossible for someone to accept that a swap has taken place when he was not participating.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riiiiiiight.\", Julie said, still not believing it. \"Like something like that even exists.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shrugged his shoulders. \"We could at least try it out.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed. I suggest we try it out if it works.\", said Steven and began mixing the cards. \"In the improbably case it works, I'd suggest we gather some more friends. I guess this game is laid out for more than 3 players.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie just shook her head. She knew that the boys easily believed in magic and that stuff. She knew this would not work. \"Okay fine.\", she sighed. \"But don't be sad if it doesn't work.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven then gave everyone their cards.

Instead, her fingers are spreading like wildfire across her laptop's keyboard until she suddenly stops, grins, and flips the machine around. Jason screams in horror.

It's on a computer screen,\" Steven says, \"It really scares you enough to scream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of that was because I realized it was true, I have a new fear. The cards are magic.

I guess you can swap anything you can think of.\", explained Jason while he looked through the manual again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. So... I don't know... I want to swap voices with Jason.\", she said. It was the most ridiculous and impossible swap she could think of. She waited for a few moments and did not feel any different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you it would not wor-\", she began but stopped. Her voice had changed. It was deeper. It was familiar. You hear your own voice differently than the outside world but she could swear that the voice she had just heard coming from her mouth sounded like Jason's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gasped and was looking at her with his mouth wide open. \"I-it worked!\", he finally said disbelievingly. The voice coming out of his mouth sounded familiar for Julie as well. He sounded  just like her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven was just as amazed as his two friends were. \"This cards really work! I knew it!\", he exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we are stuck like this for 48 hours?\", asked Julie shocked. \"I have to have his voice for so long?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says so in the manual.\", answered Jason, getting used to his new higher voice. \"You can swap with someone else but you can't get your own voice back during these 2 days.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what will people think?\", she asked but immediately realised how stupid the question was. The manual explicitly told that the swaps would not be noticed by anyone else than the players.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven wanted to answer but saw on Julie's face that she had found the answer herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, how about we gather some of our friends and play with them.\", he suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie looked at him even more shocked. \"You WANT us to be transformed into freaks?!\", she asked out loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like anyone would notice. Also it might give us another perspective in life and it could get interesting. Just think of this as an adventure holiday.\", explained Steven and soon Julie agreed with them. She was not completely comfortale with the idea of gathering different traits from different persons but at least these persons would be her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then that is decided.\". Steven put the cards back in the box, closed it and took it into his arms. \"Then let's see who wants to play with us.\", he smiled and left the room.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On his way outside, Steven immediately phoned Toshi and Yuki, the Asian twins and good friends of Steven. Toshi was more the girly type of boy, always hanging out with his twin sister and was shy. His sister was not the tomboy type to make the clich\u00e9 work. She was girly as hell and really liked that she could hang out with his brother who was interested in shopping. Jason believed that Toshi was gay but he could not proof it so far. Besides his affinity for shopping and that he was hanging out more with girls than with guys without dating one in his whole life, he was a completely \u201cnormal\u201d guy. Maybe the part that he was taking it very serious about how he dressed but that\u2019s nothing which labels someone gay, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told them we all meet over at Jason\u2019s.\u201d, explained Steven after he finished the call. The group was already out of the house and Steven took the lead with Jason and Julie following him. \u201cWhy there?\u201d, asked Jason surprised, Julie\u2019s voice was still coming out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimple. Your parents are not home till late evening, right? So we have lots of time without being disturbed.\u201d, explained Jason and dialed the next number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you calling now?\u201d, asked Julie annoyed with Jason\u2019s voice. She was not fond of the idea of swapping any more of her traits than she already had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven slowed down for a bit in order to look back to Julie. \u201cAmber, of course.\u201d, he grinned. Amber was Julie\u2019s nerdy cousin. She was a year younger than Julie and was more interested in mangas than anything else. She was not the cute nerdy girl type but rather the role model for the unpopular girl who is always picked on at school, which occasionally happens at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?!\u201d, asked Julie much more annoyed than she had already been. She did not like her cousin, she was embarrassed some times. It was not like Julie was popular or very girly but she thought of herself that she was cooler than Amber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. She\u2019s always alone in her house. I thought she might have some fun if she plays with us.\u201d, grinned Steven. Julie grunted annoyed as an answer but kept quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, everyone had gathered at Jason\u2019s place. Jason found it rather disturbing that not one of them was finding it strange that he had Julie\u2019s voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then.\u201d, began Steven and explained the rules while looking at Toshi, Yuki and Amber. Toshi was wearing a stylish gray t-shirt of some brand Steven did not recognize. He was also wearing brown shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sister Yuki was dressed in a pink t-shirt which showed her B-Cups and a matching pink skirt. On her feet were pink two-inch kitten heels. Her hair was straight down her shoulder and as black as her brother\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nerdy Amber was dressed in a big pullover with an anime figure on it. Again Steven was not able to tell who or what it was. She wore big thick glasses, her uncombed hair looked shaggy and dirty. Steven had no idea what size her breasts were. He was unable to guess because you could not see any feminine curves under her baggy clothes. If her face did not look so feminine she could have easily been a boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone understood the rules? I think it\u2019s the best if we just play and everyone can see how it works.\u201d, said Steven and dealt the cards. Who won?</span></div></div>",

I hear there's some poker to be played!\" Henry stoops and passes through the low doorway into the cellar, where the group had settled on playing. He sports a blue-green and grey varsity jacket and some faded jeans. His hair looks like it's been recently shaved off, leaving a short military cut. Behind him, the Jade enters. She looks small beside him, but she's actually a few inches taller than Julie. Her brown hair falls down a dark green top thar emphasizes her curves almost as well as her black skirt. She wears a pair of heeled boots on her small feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason and Steven had just finished moving furniture so that they have a couch, a loveseat, and one of those comfy computer chairs with wheels centered around a smallish round wooden table. The deck of cards sit at the center of the table. Jason turns to see the duo. \"Hey man, have a seat. Just not the computer chair. It has been claimed,\" he squeaks with his new feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has been claimed?\" Jade raises an eyebrow inquisitively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thy chair hath been claimed!\" Julie declares as she hops into the comfy throne. Her voice cracks mid-sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Henry, I take it this is Jade? How long have you two been a thing?\" Asks Steven as he sits down on the couch next to Jason, on the side closet to Julie and her rolling throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, only about a week tops,\" he says, \"I think this one's a keeper.\" She gives him a half smile in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you two hardly know each other. You'll have to be careful with Henry here, Jade. He may have giants' blood in him, but really just a softy on the inside... and not as sizeable as you'd think. The locker room's revealed many a dong, and Little Henry was one,\" chirps Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch it, little man. I could crush you like a bug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're not fooling anyone either, Jason. The man's packing.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just when Steven had gotten the cards out of the box, the room got dark. Everything except the three teenagers, the box and the cards turned black. Steven dropped the cards in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the-?!\", exclaimed Steven and looked around. \"What has happened here? Why is everything black?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before one of his friends could answer although the answer would have just been the same question Steven had asked. From the box emerged black smoke which formed a cloud. Then red eyes appeared. The eyes seemed to look directly at the three although the three were positioned in a triangle around the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Freedom! I'm finally free!\", said a voice which came presumably from the cloud. The eyes seemed to look even more at the three. It felt like they were looking directly into the soul. \"And I have new victims.\", chuckled the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Victims?\", asked Julie shocked and earned another deep chuckle from the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, victims. You see, I'm M'Rtlor. I'm a... how would you humans call it? Ah, yes. A demon. I'm imprisoned in this box and these cards. No matter what I do, I can't get free but that doesn't mean I can't have my fun.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven could swear he saw a faint mouth with a big grin in the cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These cards are special and you are my prisoners right now.\", the disembodied voice explained. \"You can't escape from this realm if I don't allow it. Here come the cards in play. I'll allow you to leave if you play my game.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of game?\", asked Julie frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A wonderful one.\", chuckled the voice. \"I'll grant you freedom if you gain 100 points in my game but be warned! If you get negative points you'll die.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gulped. \"And how do we get points?\", asked Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was coming to that point. Why are you humans always so impatient? You see this board?\". A board appeared beside the box. It had three rectangles at the top and three at the bottom. \"You can see the three rectangles at the top. Each one of these belongs to one of you. At the top there will be a picture of some person displayed. The ones at the bottom are for the cards your friend has dropped. The rectangles on the left belong to you, girl. The one in the middle belongs to the boy on your left (Steven) and the last one to the boy on your right (Jason). When the game begins a picture appears and a card. You will swap what is on the card with the person. Then you will have to... Hm... Let's see... Let's begin small, you have to live two days with the swap.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what has this to do with these points you mentioned?\", asked Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the points. You will have to pretend that the swap is normal. Reality changes to accomodate but people are able to notice the changes if you act strange. If you act like you should in this reality than everything is alright. If you \"survive\" the time limit than you'll get 5 points. If you're spotted, so someone finds out about the swap, you'll be transported back here and lose 20 points. Remember if you get negative points then you'll die.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But! You can't do this! This is impossible!\", yelled Julie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA depp laugh could be heard. \"You sound like you have a choice. And to make things more interesting for me: You have to swap with a person from the opposite gender. Okay, now then. We will start.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven wanted to protest but his voice had suddenly vanished. The cloud must have made them all silent for now.</span></div></div>",

The demon seemed to take its time and enjoyed the fear, the three had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen finally, after what felt like years of waiting, some pictures appeared on the board. On the top rectangle on the far left was a picture of a 18 years old boy with blond hair. He was very muscular and was wearing a red and white football jacket. Julie immediately recognized him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhil Anderson? The quarterback?\u201d, she asked and was surprised that she could talk again. Phil was the kind of boy Julie despised. Julie never was a girly girl. Sure, she loved to wear skirts sometimes, even dresses but that was the only thing. That was why she was usually hanging out with Steven and Jason. They had just much more in common than the other girls who usually wanted to talk about their hair or their next date. Julie was not really into shopping either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I know you don\u2019t like him. I thought he might be a perfect first swappee for you.\u201d, the voice explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen in the next rectangle, the one designated for Steven, appeared a picture of a middle aged woman with long brown hair. It did not even took a second for Steven to recognize who this was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy mom?!\u201d, he asked angrily. \u201cI\u2019m not going to swap anything with my mom!\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow cute.\u201d, laughed the voice. \u201cAfter all I\u2019ve said you still think you have a choice. You humans are really amusing.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven looked down at the picture and tried to suppress his anger.  His mom was working as a school secretary, likely not the school he was attending. She was still happily married and had two kids, Steven and his little brother Benjamin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep chuckle could be heard again. The demon seemed to be entertained very well not like the three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next and last picture which was designated for Jason showed a geeky girl with thick glasses and braces. She had fuzzy, black hair pulled in a ponytail and freckles. She looked to be around Jason\u2019s age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! How come everyone gets someone they know but me?!\u201d, asked Jason the cloud. The three were still not sure if the cloud was the demon or something else but they had nothing else they could talk to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you know her. This is Emily Harrison. You were in the same class all elementary school. She had a crush on you, probably still has but she was always too shy to talk to you and you were too self-fixated to even notice her. To be honest, I couldn\u2019t find a better subject for you. You\u2019re just too average and too hard to anger.\u201d, the voice explained. Steven tried to confirm if the voice was coming out of the cloud but it seemed like it came from every angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d, the voice then continued. \u201cNow that we have your swap partners, my victims, let\u2019s see what it is you will be swapping.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep, evil laugh could be heard and the cards Steven had dropped suddenly levitated from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDraw a card.\u201d. The cards were floating before Julie. She slowly draw a card from the deck. Just when she had it drawn from the deck, it vanished and appeared faced down on the board beneath Phil Anderson\u2019s picture. The cards then floated over to Steven, who draw a card, and to Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow there were the three pictures and three cards on the board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s see what you will swap.\u201d.</span></div></div>",

On the card there was just one word written: \"Job\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does this mean?\", she asked confused. \"I'm going to swap my job with him? I don't work and neither does he. Or does it mean being a student.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\", the voice answered in a snake like tone. \"You're going to swap jobs with him.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie shrugged her shoulders. \"So what? I'm a student, he's a student. Nothing will change.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice laughed amused. \"Oh, don't be so naive. You'll be going to his classes and be quarteback.\", it explained laughingly. The word were still echoing in the completely black room just when Julie's clothes changed slightly. The jeans jacket she was wearing turned into the red and white football jacket Phil was wearing on the picture. \"Congratulations, Julie.\", the voice chuckled again. \"You're now quarterback.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven had a really bad feeling and gulped when he saw what had happened with Julie. He did not want to know what might happen to him. Maybe he would not be as lucky as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next card!\", growled the voice and the next card, Steven's card, turned around. It looked just as simple as Julie's one and had one word written on it: \"Life\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to swap lives with my mom?!\", exclaimed Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\", answered the voice in the same amused tone it had explained Julie her fate. \"This is going to be interesting. Everyone will think you're her, your body will stay the same, don't worry. But you will be wearing her clothes. I know your body is different than your mom's but the clothes will fit never the less.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like Julie's change, Steven's began just when the voice had finished speaking. His clothes changed from a t-shirt and trousers to a blouse, jeans shorts and flip flops. His fingernails were painted pink, just like his toenails. He now had earrings dangling from his ears and he could feel a bra and panties beneath his clothes. His lips tasted strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie had to giggle at the sight of her friend in such a feminine outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next!\", the voice growled again and left no time for the friends to laugh about Steven. The last card, Jason's card turned around. It looked as minimalistic as the other cards but the word differed again. \"Heads\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to swap heads with Emily?\", he asked. \"Like having my head on her body or I keep my body and gain her head?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Steven could swear that he saw a grin in the cloud. \"Oh, very simple. You're going to get her...\"</span></div></div>",

Jason's body got more feminine, his clothes changed into a pink sweater with a cat face on it, purple sweat pants and pink running shoes. The clothes tried to hide small B-Cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grabbed down to his crotch in fear of what he might discover there. His fear came true. His member was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is insane!\", he cried out. \"I'm a girl from the neck down! A girl I don't even know!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deep evil laugh could be heard again. At least one person was having fun right now, if you could count the demon as a person. \"That's the rules. I'll give you the chance to get used to the changes mentally. Let's say one hour. After that, you'll awake on the following morning at 6 o' clock. Oh yeah. You're allowed to interact with the other \"players\" but be warned that people may get suspicious. But you have a small bonus. I'm so nice, I know. People will be less suspicious if you have zero to twenty points. They'll be more forgiving with mistakes you do in your new role. If you're still alive and make it to 70 point, than you'll get into hard mode.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the cloud vanished back inside the box and left the three friends alone with their fears in the dark room and wondering what it meant with hard mode. Jason was busy checking out his new female body. \"This is insane.\", he kept repeating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Jason.\", said Julie. \"Just calm down... I guess we have to play along. What other choice do we have?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could run and escape!\", Jason cried out loud and sank to the ground. Except for the head, he looked like a small, helpless girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would work wonderfully.\", replied Steven and rolled his eyes. \"The thing just turned your body female but of course it will let us run away.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed and looked down at his body. He cupped his newly found breats with his smaller hands. \"But I don't want to be like this!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I want to be like this?!\", asked Steven angrily. \"But we have no choice. We can only play along and hope that the demon keeps his promise. There is nothing else we can do.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed again, more deeply this time. \"You're right... So this is me for now... I guess I now have to wear the clothes of this Emily together with her body...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better than wearing your mom's clothes without her body.\", grinned Julie who tried to lighten up the situation but with no success. \"I'll have to go to classes I don't even know and have to play football. I don't even know the rules!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're all pretty messed up... I guess this is what the demon wants.\". Steven recieved a nod from his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen everyone stayed silent and tried to cope with what had just happened to them and tried to think that this will not be that bad. The sooner than they had thought, the hour was over and everything which was not black by now turned black.</span></div></div>",

He closed his eyes and wanted to sleep a little longer as he felt somebody touches your cheek lightly. \"Morning, deer. Have you slept well?\" Steven opened his eyes and looked to his right and saw .... his father. \"That can't be, that can't be.\" He thought. He looked around and saw he wasn't in his room but in his parents. \"Everything all right, dear?\" His father asked. \"Just a bad dream, nothing more than a bad dream.\" Steven answered hoping it really was just a bad dream and hoping he would soon wake up. \"Then lay down a little more, I'll make breakfast ready and wake the kids up.\" As Steven lay down his father kissed him on the cheek and stood up. \"That can't be. I can't be my mother. I just can't be.\" Steven thought as he saw his father only wearing his boxers walking towards one of the dressers and putting on a business suit.<br>\r\nEven though his father was already 42 years old he still had a pretty athletic body. Nobody would guess somebody like him as a businessman and father would have such a good looking body without working out, but he did.<br>\r\nAs the father left the room Steven shoved the blanket away seeing for the first time the sexy nightgown his mother wore the whole night and he is now wearing. He stood up and walked towards the big mirror. \"No, that can't be.\" Steve said as he saw his reflection. Just like in what he thought was a dream he had pink painted fingernails and toenails, earrings dangled from his now pierced ears, the nightgown perfectly fitted his body and enhanced his non existing cleavage while covering his sexy panty with his dick forming a little bulge. On his face was the perfect make up his mother always had on.<br>\r\n\"I really have my mothers things on.\" He says a little disbelieving.

I'll be there soon.\" Steven nearly addressed his mother as mom, what seems right but would be suspicious. Sharon, the mother, closed the door and left Steven alone. For a few seconds he kept looking at the door before he tore at his hear. \"Shit, what am I doing?\" He said realizing he could have been the whole day alone if he had said he would take the day off, but now he had to go to his mothers work. She was a secretary at a local school, not the one Steven went to, and as long as Steven could think never missed a day. And now Steven even had to dress up as her and that would be a real problem. On the one hand  he had a smaller body than her and all her closes wouldn't fit, which wouldn't be a problem because the demon M'Rtlor made them fit. And on the other hand his mother never went to work in something he could refer as comfortable, always wearing heels, stockings, skirts and a blouse or a dress. \"Just what am I going to do?

He opened the next wardrobe and saw nothing but skirts and a few pants. Steven opened all wardrobes surprised how many clothes his mother had.<br>\r\nFinally he just took something he thought his mother would wear. He slipped see-through stockings over his feet and the legs up which made his legs look more slender, although the hair could clearly be seen. He took a black skirt, pulled it over his butt and zipped it up. The skirt was skin tight and covered not even half of Steven's thighs. Next would be either the heels or the bra. Steven decided to try the bra first. He took a black one, put the straps on his shoulders and tried to close it at his back, but couldn't. \"Why can't I get this done? In the films it looked so easy as they took them off.\" Steven tried for a few times before throwing the bra on the floor. \"Then it has to go without.\" He takes a white blouse, buttoned it up until only the button at the collar wasn't closed and shoved it inside the skirt. \"So, nobody would notice I'm not wearing a bra.\" He said. Last he took high heels his mother often wore. After stepping in them he looked at his 5\" bigger reflection in the mirror and was pleased as far as he could for wearing his mothers clothes.<br>\r\nHe turned around on his tiptoes and took a step towards the door as he tripped a little. \"Shit, thees heels are too high. It looks so easy when girls walk in them.\" Steven is just about to take the heels off as the door opens and his father walked in. \"Are you ready dear? If you don't hurry I have to leave without you and you have to walk to school.\"</span></div></div>",

He stepped towards his brother, knelt down and gave him a light kiss on the cheek. \"On the mouth, mom, like you always do.\" He protested and Steven knew he was right. \"You have to get used to leave without a kiss.\" He said hoping it would work, but as Benjamin still looked sad at him he didn't know of an other way than kiss him on the lips. \"Love you mom!\" Benjamin said as he ran out to get to school.<br>\r\nAfter that Steven and his father left the house too. They drove with their car, Mark at the wheel, Steven on the passenger seat. On the way Steven thought what he could do to not get busted for the rest of the two days. He was so deep in thoughts he didn't noticed they arrived at his stop. \"Steven, hey Steven!\" Mark said.  \"Er, yes? What did you say?\" Steven asked. \"We are at your job.\" It took a few seconds for him to realize the meaning of it. \"Oh yes. Sorry, I was so deep in thoughts.\" He opened the door and was about to set a foot out as he saw his fathers face pretty close to his. \"So I have to kiss him too?\" He thought and kissed his father on the lips. But compared with the little good-bye-kiss with his brother was the kiss with his father much deeper not to say arousing. Steven felt Marks hand behind his head pulling him in, the lips sucking on his and, what was the most disturbing, he felt his fathers tongue in his mouth. It wasn't for a long time, but as Mark stopped the kiss Steven had a red face. \"See you later, dear.\" Mark said and Steven got out of the car without saying anything. Even after his father drove away he kept standing there blushing, and not because he was embarrassed of getting kissed by a man, he was ashamed of himself for liking getting kissed by his father and getting turned on by it. If somebody would have taken a closer look at Steven's skirt he would have seen a bulge in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Mrs Parker.\" Somebody greeted Steven and as he looked who it was he saw ...</span></div></div>",

I hope you can do your work with the same enthusiasm.\" The principal went to the entrance while Steven keeps standing still a little longer before he followed. He knew the way to the office his mother worked in by visiting her a few times. The key to it was his purse. It was his mothers purse and Steven nearly had forgotten it, but Mark noticed and gave it to him. The office wasn't very big, only one desk with one computer was there, but many shelves full with books and files. Steven sat down on the office chair his mother normally sat in and looked at the things on the desk. There were filings labeled \"To be done\" and \"Done\", a few stamps, a case with many different pens and a picture of his family. As he looked at the picture he noticed his mother wearing his male clothes and him wearing his mothers with make-up and fancy jewelry. He couldn't keep his eyes from the picture, it was funny to see his mother, who always wanted to look her best, wearing his teenage clothes with her mature body, her breasts stretching the shirt, but the clothes seemed to fit her. And it was a little funny to see himself with her clothes on, especially the make-up made him look pretty much like a girl, only the short hair, the lack of cleavage and a small bulge on the skirt showed he wasn't. He looked at his father and couldn't take his eyes away from him. He remembered the kiss from a few minutes ago and that he got a hard-on from it and felt his dick reacting in the same way as before. It lifted his skirt a up and pressed against the underside of the desk. \"Shit.\" He thought and tried to think about something else, but it didn't went down. He knew he had to do something to get it down, but what could he do?  The only thing Steven thought would work was to jerk-off, but he couldn't do it in the office. So he had to do it in the toilet, like he did as his old self. He left the room and went, or rather stumble, to the next toilet. He was about to enter it as he noticed the next problem. Which toilet should he enter? The boys like he normally would do? Or the girls because everybody thought he was female?</span></div></div>",

Fancy meeting you here.\" He looked around and saw a very beautiful woman. She wore black high heels, dark stockings with a black garter belt, a tight red skirt just long enough to cover the panty, a black lacy top pushing her big breasts even more up, a red jacket matching the skirt, her black hair was half open half in a bun, big loop earrings dangled from her ears and her make-up was perfectly done. Steven recognized her as Amanda Jackson, one of the teachers at this school and one of his mothers friends. He didn't knew her very good, but he knew the clothes she was wearing weren't the sauciest ones of her, sometimes she wore even shorter skirts or she didn't wore a bra and let her nipples poke through her blouse, which was so open that it just covered them. As a normal boy Steven sometimes fantasized about her and her attitude to greet him by giving him a kiss on the cheek while bending over had given him an erection more than just once.<br>\r\nAmanda gave Steven two kisses, one on each cheek, like she did with his mother. \"Are you here to touch up your make-up or to alleviate stress?\" She said looking at the tent-like bulge on Steven's skirt. He blushed and tied to hide it. \"Didn't your husband satisfy you enough last night?\" She asked while dragging Steven in the girls toilet, but he didn't answer. In Amanda and Steven stepped in front of the mirrors. She placed her purse on the vanity basin and starts to touch up her make-up. \"I tell you you should look for one or two hot men and let them satisfy you like your husband never had done. An affair always makes a relationship more interesting.\" Steven didn't really hear the rest of Amanda's talking about her last men, he just stood there looking at his reflection.<br>\r\n\"Aren't you going to touch up your make-up?\" Are the first words he heard again. \"I don't have anything with me.\" He answered. \"That's a problem. But I just finished, so I'll lend you mine. Or better, I'll do yours. Then it'll be faster and You don't have to give it back.\" It took Amanda a few minutes, but as she finished she made Steven's beautiful make-up into a drop-dead one which no man could resist to look at.<br>\r\nAfter that Amanda left, she had to go to her class and perhaps give one or two students extra lessons. Steven kept standing in the toilet looking at his reflection. His face now looked like a twin version of Amanda's, just a little bit manly. But he had an other problem: his erection didn't go down and the skirt moved so it was barely covering it, just a few more steps and everybody would see his dick. He would like to jerk-off to get ti down, but he had spent much time in the toilet and he had work to do.</span></div></div>",

As he wiped the mess away his erection went down and he hid his dick under the skirt. He left the stall, washed his hands and looked again at his reflection. He really didn't look like he did as a boy. \"What wonders make-up does.\" He said before going back to his office. His walking in the heels had gotten better and he didn't stumble as much as before.<br>\r\nAs Steven entered his office the principal was waiting. \"Mrs Parker, I was waiting for you.\" He said a little angry. \"I need these documents done before noon.\" He pointed at a pile of files on the desk. \"Sorry, sir.\" Is all Steven could say. He sat down on his chair and took the first file. He felt gazes on himself and as he looked up he saw the principals eyes going up and down. One point he looked at was his face and the other was on his chest. Steven gazed down and saw his nipples perking through his blouse. Steven looked back up and saw the principal walking towards him. \"But I think I need these documents only at the afternoon, if you could get an other job done.\"</span></div></div>",

Or was it because of the lacking bra and Miss Jackson's work?\"<br>\r\nSteven began to look at the documents, first wondering what he had to do, but fast noticing he had to only stamp most of them and mail the others to some people with important sounding titles. He finished them just before noon and brought them to the principal. This time he didn't tried to hit on Steven. So Steven went back to his office, did the rest of his work and left in the afternoon the building. Steven walked back home.

Both hands now played with his erect nipples and his fathers cock rubbed on his ass. Light moans emitted his mouth. Steven didn't felt like a boy at the moment, now he was a woman and got aroused by her husband. Mike pushed his wife on the bed and grabbed her ass. He shoved his cock into her ass.

Steven didn't had many problems with cooking, he didn't made something complicated and used a book. He called for Benjamin and Sharon and sat down. Benjamin was very fast, shortly followed by Sharon and her friend. As Steven saw who it was he was complete surprised. In walked a girl his age, she wore black ballet flats, jeans and a sweater, her breasts weren't very big but clearly showed under the sweater, the neckline was so wide it showed half of her shoulders and the straps of her bra. So far she was a normal girl, but her head wasn't. Sharon her her friend Jason sat across from Steven and just like Steven Jason wasn't very pleased by the idea of eating with each other.

It's so embarrassing to walk in these clothes, putting on make-up is difficult, my feet hurt and my boss is hitting on me.\" \"I know what you mean. Having to sit down when peeing is so annoying and these breasts doesn't stop to bounce.\" Jason lifted his sweater and squeezed his breasts a little.

The parting with your brother wasn't bad solved, but your father was pretty suspicious. On the normal level you would have been found out just after the first hours. And in the toilet, would your mother really masturbate while at work? And when one of her friends talks with you you have to reply, and you have to check your make-up more often and touch it up. Luckily Amanda did it for you, but that attracted first the principal and later your father. The rest was nicely done, except your meeting with Jason, which you barely managed, and the last night. Did you really think your father didn't notice the lie of having an headache?\" Steven's face turned red of shame. \"But I'm so nice.

But do you think you could date a girl when you are one or are even into men?\" M'Rtlor smashed all hopes of Jason in an instant. \"But that's something else. You were not bad, dressing like a girl, acting like it's normal, even satisfying your bodies desires. Only your meeting with Steven wasn't so good, but not so bad as it would get you into real trouble. So you get your five points and we can start with the second round.\" Jason's rectangle moved to the same row as the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spotlights went out, but it didn't went black again, rather got a little brighter.

'Why are we back to normal? Why doesn't bread taste like chocolate? What is the meaning of life? Is there a god?' Can't you just accept something when it's better for you?\"<br>\r\nJason kept silent so he couldn't provoke M'Rtlor any further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's get started with the scoring.\" Suddenly everything got pitch black, only the game board and Julie were in the spotlight. She wore male boxers and a baggy T-shirt. \"I'm really impressed. Not only did you managed to follow Phil's classes, which you don't know, you even let everybody in the football team think you really would be the quarterback. Nobody had the lightest idea you weren't like you seemed to be. So you really deserve the five points.\" The rectangles on the left of the board moved forward until it reached five points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next is the boy living his mothers life.\" The spotlight on Julie went black and went on above Steven. He was wearing his mothers nightgown and the tight panty. On his face still was the make-up he applied and the earrings dangled from his ears. \"The start wasn't so good, you took pretty long to get dressed and even missed the bra. The parting with your brother wasn't bad solved, but your father was pretty suspicious. On the normal level you would have been found out just after the first hours. And in the toilet, would your mother really masturbate while at work? And when one of her friends talks with you you have to reply, and you have to check your make-up more often and touch it up. Luckily Amanda did it for you, but that attracted first the principal and later your father. The rest was nicely done, except your meeting with Jason, which you barely managed, and the last night.

Do I really have to change your 'partner' to someone you wouldn't like to swap with?\" M'Rtlor was very angry, so Julie didn't replied so she couldn't make it worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen in the next rectangle, the one designated for Jason, appeared a picture of a young woman, maybe in her mid twenties, with shoulder long blond hair. She wore a black top, tight jeans and black high heels like she was out partying.<br>\r\n\"Who is she?\" Again Jason didn't recognized her.<br>\r\n\"Do you remember your sister Jessica?\"<br>\r\nJason remembered his older sister. She was 9 years older than him and left the house 6 years ago. But she couldn't be the person on the picture, the face and hair color didn't matched. \"Could she be ...?\"<br>\r\n\"Maggie Scott, your sisters girlfriend and lover.\"<br>\r\nNow Jason remembered her. She and Jessica were dating each other for a few month as his father found out. He didn't accepted that his daughter was a lesbian and forced her out.

What you swap is her horniness. From now on you'll get aroused by the lightest touch and can't get satisfied until you had multiple orgasms.\"<br>\r\nImmediately Jason felt his pussy getting hot and wet and his nipples got hard and poked through the nightgown. He had already masturbated in his girly body, liked it and wondered how a multiple orgasm would feel like. But now he feared not to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And last my special friend.\" Steven's card turned around. \"Take two\" was written on it. \"Now that's rare.\" The voice said. \"Not only do you get to swap one thing.

They vanished and appeared beside the picture of Amanda Jackson.<br>\r\n\"Let's see what you have drawn.\"<br>\r\nThe first card turned around. What was written on it was what Steven guessed, \"Fashion\".<br>\r\nM'Rtlor didn't explain the meaning of the card and Steven didn't needed it. His nightgown changed into short black skirt, a lacy black bra and a shiny black jacket, buttoned so the bra was fully seen. The panty changed into a matching panty and pantyhose. He got pushed up as 5\" high heels formed under his feet. His mothers earrings got bigger and more fancy and the make-up became like Amanda made it look on the first day. Now Steven looked as provocative as Amanda did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven had a few seconds to find the balance on the heels before the second card turned around with \".....\" written on it.</span></div></div>",

He saw in the reflection his cheekbones and chin getting rounder and less prominent. Next his nose got smaller and petite in marked contrast to his lips, which got bigger and fuller. Steven's face now looked a lot like Amanda's, but you could still recognize him. He felt the last change really intense because his skin got swelled up on his chest. Two round mounds formed as silicone implants formed under his skin. The new breasts got pushed up by the bra and gave him a nice cleavage. As the implants stopped filling Steven had clearly faked c-cup breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have wonderful two days\". The cloud vanished and the three friends were standing next to each other, Julie in her t-shirt, Jason in his nightgown and Steven in his new provocative work clothes.<br>\r\n Steven touched his breasts and squeezed them a little. They were pretty firm and while pushing the whole implant moved under his skin. \"Now I'm neither a boy nor a girl.\"<br>\r\n\"Could you please stop touching yourself.\" Jason said with a wheezy voice while touching himself. \"It's already hard enough for me.\"<br>\r\n\"Jason is right.\" Julie said.<br>\r\n\"But it's so weird to feel something move under your skin.\" Steven continued touching himself.<br>\r\n\"Stop it already.\" Julie tried to grab his hands, but grabbed the breasts instead.<br>\r\n\"Didn't you say I should stop?\" Steven asked and Julie backed away as she noticed she loved to touch them. Ashamed she looked away and saw Jason fingering his pussy.<br>\r\n\"Not enough.\" He moaned while his . \"Not big enough. I need something bigger.\"<br>\r\nSteven looked at his friend. A sucking noise came from the wet pussy. Just now Steven noticed his erection, both his dick and nipples were hard. As he walked towards his friend his dick swung around and the breasts bounced lightly.<br>\r\n\"That's it. Shove it into my pussy.\" Jason bagged wanting to get satisfied.<br>\r\nSteven knelt down before the girl stroking his hard dick and she spread her legs. He was just about to shove it into the wet pussy as the hour was over and everybody was sent back to their homes.</span></div></div>",

His body was becoming aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit! I have to think about something else! Aunt Petunia in a bikini, aunt Petunia in a bikini...\", thought Jason with fear but it was in vain. His new sex drive was making him crazy. Soon his slender hand was on his pussy and he was stroking it. But it was not enough. He did not feel satisfied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn! This feeling is too much! I need something inside of me!\", he thought and suddenly a picture of a dildo which was located in his closet appeared before his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't be, right? That can't have changed?\", he thought still fingering himself. His desire was too much and he slowly walked over to the closet, not stopping to use his fingers to penetrare his pussy. And inside, just like he saw, there was a dildo, easily to find and get. It looked well used. Jason looked closer and saw that there were more deeper inside the closet. \"I guess I use them a lot... No wonder, considering how I feel...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed the dildo and looked at it. He needed it but he did not want to use it. \"But I have no choice... I must...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dildo entered his pussy and he moaned. His legs became shaky. He plumped on his more shaped butt and continued penetrating his pussy. His moans began to get louder. \"I have to be quiet... I have no idea if anyone knows I'm like this. If I was born like this, I'd try to keep it a secret. But it feels so good!\", he thought and soon he came. But he did not feel satisfied. He wanted more. He continued the penetration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The next two days will be aweful... No scratch that... I have to stay like this and new swaps will be added to this... I guess I'm gonna die. There is no way that I can survive this...\", he thought slowly while moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJus then he was interrupted by a knock on the door. It was his mother telling him to get ready for school. Jason stopped shortly. He looked at the clock. An hour. He had masturbated for an hour and he was still not satisfied. \"Damn...\", he thought.</span></div></div>",

His chest felt heavier than it should. \"No, no, no, no.\", he whispered agitated and got back up and felt his chest drag forward slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down and his fears became reality. He was wearing a pink nightgown with Hello Kitty on it. Two orbs were pushing out from his chest and were bulging out the nightgown. He grabbed this orbs with smaller, daintier hands than he used to had. The breasts were merely B-Cups and therefore not really big but Jason could feel the difference between his new and his old chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. This wasn't a dream. This is real!\", he gasped shocked. He jumped out of his bed and ran out to the bathroom. He looked into the mirror which was hanging there and saw the strange look of his head on Emily's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not real! This can't be real!\", he repeated over and over again, hoping everything would change back to normal. But it did not. He was still a girl from the neck down. He pinched himself and hoped that this was just a dream. It was not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... Okay... Calm down...\", he whispered and tried to focus on his face rather than his body. \"Everything that happened was true. So... I guess I'll have to play along because I guess the other things he had told were true as well, so I die if I get caught.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason then noticed a pressure on his bladder and went over to the toilet and pushed the soft panties he was wearing, down his legs. He wanted to grab his penis and position it so the urin would get into the toilet but he noticed that he had non.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I have to sit down for now...\", he sighed and sat down, then let the urin ran down. When he was finished, he wiped his newly found vagina clean and got strange feeling from it but he tried to ignore them. He pulled the panties back up and then washed his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I shower? I guess I should... But I don't know if I'm comfortable with... showering with this body. But I should...

The words of the demonic cloud echoed in his ears as he looked around the bathroom, halk expecting to see a pair of dark eyes watching him. But there was nothing there, he let out a sigh as he gazed down once more at the petite, feminine body his head was now fastened to. \"Hell with it, here goes!\" he thought, as he lifted his <i>'Hello Kitty'</i> nightgown up over his head, revealing his panty-clad body. As he prepared for hiw shower, Jason couldn't help but wonder what Emily now looked like with his body under her head. But he quit thinking about it the more angrier he got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look ridiculous!\" he told himself, cupping his modest breasts in his small hands and then running those same hands down over his delicate stomach, his wider hips and perhaps most 'uncomfortably' of all...his panty-clad vagina. He just couldn't get used to the feeling of not having his 'equipment' nestled between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he switched on the shower, Jason ran his slender fingers through his hair, ditched his panties and stepped inside, pulling the curtain across as he did so. He was still at home and he didn't want any of his family barging in on him in this state. Even though he knew they would see him as being 'normal'. <i>\"How can it be normal a guy having a girl's body??\"</i> Jason grumbled in anger as he enjoyed the hot water pouring down over his feminized body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile taking the shower, Jason tried to remember Emily, the girl who's body he now had, but he just couldn't. Maybe he had been too self-fixated in the past, but that was just how he was, and in any case he couldn't bring himself to make friends with such a geeky-looking girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, and after scrubbing himself with body wash, Jason rinsed all the soapy water off of his body and turned the shower off. As he stood there dripping wet, Jason's hands slowly...gradually found their way to his crotch, and he began satisfying the curiosity he had been suppressing up until this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was then...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jason then grabbed a towel, dried himself and then tied it around his chest. He left the bathroom and entered his room to get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was another obstacle on his way to endure this punishment he had received from the demon. He still had a problem with having this body but he had a bigger problem dessing this body. Emily might be a geeky girl, but she loved to wear feminine clothes, even though they were not very stylish and most of them had cute motives on them. \"Just like the nightgown...\". He thought back at the \"Hello Kitty\"-nightgown he was wearing just moments ago and shuddered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have to get dressed...\", he thought and took a pink sweater with a flowery pattern out of the waderobe and put it on. Just after that he noticed the underwear drawer where a bra was hanging out. \"Oh no, don't tell me...\", he mumbled. \"I have to wear these?! Great...\", he sighed and got the blue bra out of it, then looking for matching panties. The panties were no problem for him to put on, neither was the bra which shocked him. \"I can put on a bra, I always wanted to be able to do this.\", he thought sarcastically. He then put the sweater on and grabbed the sweater again. He finished his outfit with simple jeans which had a flower embroidered in each leg. On his feet he put some black ballet flats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout looking at himself in the mirror he went downstairs to have breakfast with his family.

Jason just looked down at himself, arched an eyebrow and then looked back up at his mother. \"Mom...is this outfit okay for school?\" he asked her, wondering what her response would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean honey? You wear that sweater and those jeans most days to school. They look good on you\" his mother smiled, laughing slightly as she handed him his plate. The scent of freshly cooked pancakes filled Jason's nostrils, and his rumbling stomach made him sit down and satiate his hunger immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so!\" Jason shrugged, as he sat down at the table grabbed his knife and fork. He studied his dainty hands for a moment and then whoofed down his pancakes without coming up for air almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for those were you?\" his mom asked, as she removed his plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely!\" Jason replied, as he wiped his mouth. Then as he sat there drinking a glass of orange juice, he slipped his feet in and out of his ballet flats under the table. It still felt weird having Emily's petite body under his head, but he seemed a lot more 'at ease' now he was sure nobody else would notice. That said, everyone at school would probably view him as a very effiminate boy, to say the least. He sighed, slipped his feet back into his flats and then stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can drive you to school if you like honey?\" his mom offered, causing Jason to glance at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...\" Jason paused, wondering whether to walk to school or not.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He started to open his mouth when he remembered what the voice had told them. They had to act like everything is normal, have to hide their swaps. He thought what he would do if his mother would ask him while he had his normal body. The answer was clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks mom.\", he said and regretted it immediately. It was after the rules but would his mother find it strange? She suggested it, he doubts that she strongly believes that he will neglect it. On the other hand... People at school might think that it's strange. Especially Steven. He was in his mother's life, so his mother was probably leading his life and was probably another pawn in this demon's chess game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be going then.\", he said and left the kitchen, grabbing his feminine backpack and left the house, his small breasts bouncing a little. It was not really visible but Jason could feel it, and it annoyed him. \"Just two days...\", he thought with crunching teeth. \"Two days and this is over... But who knows what will be swapped next... Some mental changes could be fatal... Like losing the ability to speak our language or something like that... Oh, don't think about something like this now! Everything is going to be fine, we three will win this and everything will be okay.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as he wished that the walk to school would go on for the whole two days, he got there sooner than he would want to. He gulped when he saw the first students walk towards him. He looked at the floor, looking over his feminine body to his ballet flats. He had his small, dainty hands stuck in his pockets. When they passed him without screaming why he had a girl's body, he was getting more comfortable with this body. It was not just coincidence that his mother did not notice. He passed more and more students and nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I won't be treated like a freak... When I'm acting completely normal.\", he thought and began, for the first time since the demon appeared, to smile. Just then someone yelled his name and he turned around to see...</span></div></div>",

Everyone around saw nothing wrong with a mature woman dressed and acting like a teenage boy, just like they saw nothing wrong with Jason having a female body from the neck down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What up!\" Sharon then said, fist-punching Jason's dainty hand with her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure!\" Jason mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon just frowned. \"What's wrong with you today, you seem a little out of it\" she asked Jason, looking down at him. \"Anyway, we're getting together with Julie later, she phoned me earlier and asked to meet up with us\" Sharon continued. But Jason wasn't really listening to every word, he was too busy thinking what Steven was doing at home, dressed in his own mother's clothes and living her life, being forced to act like she would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...are you listening?\" Sharon suddenly snapped, slapping Jason upside the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn...yeah...I heard you, we're meeting Julie\" Jason grimaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, sshhhh!\" Sharon suddenly said, as she pointed out a passing girl. Jason turned and saw one of the prettiest girls in school, Vanessa Shaw, a blonde with mouth-watering curves and a cute face. Both Jason and Steven had a crush on Vanessa, which meant now that both he and Sharon were getting 'wet' at the sight of her. \"Damn, I'd love to take a strap-on to her ass!\" Sharon muttered, eliciting a shocked look from Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...yeah...me too!\" Jason responded, looking down at his petite female body. He really missed his penis at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, lets get to class dude\" Sharon then nudged Jason in his slender arm, after having another good admiring stare at Vanessa's ass. \"That's an image we can save up for later\" Sharon then laughed, as she thought about masturbating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Jason, the day had started out weird...and was just getting weirder.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe I should change my behaviour if I survive all of this.\", he thought and sat down on his desk. He rubbed his legs together when he sat there. Now that he knew where Emily was and that she was looking at him, he was feeling unconfident again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the first time in his whole life that he was looking forward to his math class, because there he would not need to think about all of this. He concentrated on the whole subject, just to avoid thinking about Emily, his body or the middle aged woman who was sitting beside him. He realised that he really understood what the teacher was talking about when the class ended. \"Maybe I just should listen more often to him...\", he thought when he left the room with Sharon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man this was really boring.\", complained Sharon. \"At least it's over now.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er yeah...\", mumbled Jason, still adjusting to the fact that his best friends mother was talking to him, thinking she was really her son. The two went to their next class, biology, and Jason noticed ashamed that Emily was there as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can't be. How can I not notice someone who is there almost all of my day?\", he thought. \"I really should change myself. I'm a horrible person. It's not like I have to talk with her but I should at least notice her...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the teacher entered class and told everybody that they would have to do a presentation of a subject as partners. To make things worse, he chose the pairs random and Jason ended up with Emily. \"Is the demon's hand in there? Is he controlling the teacher or anything like this?\", he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up and seated himself beside her so that they could work through the chapter they had to present. Jason noticed that her face was read and that she tried to avoid any eye contact. She looked at the book like her life depended on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should talk to her...\", he thought. \"I somehow feel bad for ignoring her all these years... Apologize or something like this...\". What he did not consider so far was that he had to try and act as if everything is normal.

And he had her girly...petite body under his noggin. \"Hey!\" Emily replied sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second, Jason looked around...half expected the demon cloud to swoop down and envelop him, but that didn't happen.

At the same time he felt a warm, tingling sensation between his legs, and when he glanced at Emily's crotch...he noticed a definite hard-on forming in her jeans. His eyes widened...but he didn't freak out, he was quite used to feeling 'weird' by now, what with his own feminized body and his new, middle-aged (female) best friend \"Steven\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its okay! I just never had the nerve to talk to you before\" Emily said in response, smiling incessantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe...we could...get a cup of coffee sometime, after school?\" Jason quickly suggested, eliciting an even bigger grin from Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like that!\" Emily gushed, and then the two of them got back to preparing their joint presentation. It didn't take long to prepare, the two headswapped teenagers seemed to have real chemistry together. The presentation went well, and when it was done...they went back to their seats. But they continued glancing at each other, and for the first time...Jason saw past Emily's glasses and braces...and saw the beauty underneath. It was almost like...having Emily's body beneath his head had made him a new person...literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before the bell rang, signaling the end of the lesson, and \"Steven\"...or rather his mother...was the first out of class, having been bored stupid. \"Shit...that was dull, I think my brain melted\" Sharon grumbled, acting exactly like her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason however wasn't paying attention, and Sharon noticed the way he was staring longingly at Emily. \"Dude...you serious?? She's such a dork!\" Sharon chuckled, but that only drew a scowl from Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it...Steven!\" Jason grumbled, \"She's not a dork, she's sweet!\" he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough! She does look like she's got a big enough cock at least\" Sharon commented, as she looked at Emily's groin. That statement just made Jason wince, hearing his best friend's mom talking about 'his' genitals like that. Even though those genitals were currently Emily's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason let out a disbelieving sigh...then laughed a little, shaking his head and taking another look down at himself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The only time he saw Julie was during lunch where she was sitting at the same table as the other football players and the cheerleaders. Jason had to admit that she looked strange and out of place. He was not sure if they were still considered friends. Phil did not seem to be befriended with Jason and \"Steven\" but it looked like he was not befriended with the sports crew either. \"A clique who does not let anybody in for sure.\", thought Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was relieved that he did not have PE that day. He was not sure if he would have taken it with the body he currently owned. Sure, he was getting used to it, but that did not make it any better that running was strange for him. The breast, luckily not as big as some of the other girls breasts, juggling was an experience which was getting annoying very fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason had also noticed that Emily and he really had every class together. It was like she was following through every class just to be near him. \"Creepy and sweet at the same time.\", he thought and then he espied Emily at the school gate waiting for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason breathed in heavily once. He was feeling bad about how he treated her over the last few years, on the other hand he was afraid because of the demon's game. \"Well, better die a nice guy than continue living as an ass.\", he thought and walked over to her, his breasts moving up and down slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily!\", he called out which resulted in her turning around. \"Sorry to keep you waiting.\", he said and smiled at her. Her face turned red the exact moment he did so. \"Sweet.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be...\", she said, her hands crossed behind her back and her face directed to the ground. \"I just arrived here.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\", replied Jason. \"Then er... let's go.\". He went in front, Emily followed him close by. The whole walk to the caf\u00e9, they were quiet. Emily did not have the courage to say anything and Jason had no idea what he should talk about. He did not know what she was interested in. Hell, he did not know that she actually exist yesterday!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the caf\u00e9 it had not been any better for them. They both ordered coffee and continued being quiet. When the cup of coffee finally came, it felt like they ordered it years ago, Jason finally decided to talk. He shifted his ballet-flat feet together, because he was nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Emily... I'll be honest... I don't know much about you... So why... Why don't you tell me something about you?\", he suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily slowly looked up from her cup and made eye contact with him for a few seconds, then her face turned red again and she looked back down to her cup when she began talking. Her voice was hard to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm 15 years old... I like reading books and comics...\", she began and Jason had a hard time to listen. She was so nervous that she barely could a word out of her mouth and when she did, it was barely audible.</span></div></div>",

He nervously slid his dainty feet in and out of his flats under the table as he looked at Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love your sweater!\" Rachel smirked at Jason, making him look down at the pink, flower-embroidered top he had on. \"Its VERY you!\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...thanks!\" Jason grumbled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, what kind of greeting is that?

Andrew sat down on the table while Jason and Emily were leaving the caf\u00e9.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unbelievable.\", sighed Jason. \"I just wanted to talk to you alone and then nearly half of the town shows up.\". He looked over to Emily and noticed the hard-on she had gotten for the first time. \"Is this because of me or because of someone else?\", he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine...\", said Emily nearly unaudible. \"I think it was nice...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways...\", sighed Jason. \"Let's go somewhere else.\".</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mark awoke with a smile on his face. It was the first day of summer... well real day of summer that first weekend doesn't really count. As he got up and walked over to the bathroom to take care of the morning routine he paused to look in the mirror. He saw himself, an average 17 year old boy about 6 foot even with brown hair, he had a fit body but by no means ripped a good looking fellow if he didn't say so himself. See most teenagers dreaded the summer vacation with family, the separation from friends, computers, significant others and getting couped up in a car with your family, but his family was different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You see ever since his mom, Mary, came across a strange deck of cards that had changed the summertime for her family forever. His mom was a 40 something year old school teacher who worked at the same school he and his siblings attended so she got the same time off that they did. She had red hair that she kept short and a slim figure as she enjoyed taking care of her body. She stood at 5 ft 8 so while a good height not nearly as tall as his father. She had a large b/ small c cup chest.  She enjoyed garage sale hunting and one day came across a strange looking deck of cards that the owner was all to happy to get rid of saying, \"I've had enough adventures its time to share this gift with others. Don't worry deary the rules inside explain it all just come back and tell me about it if you want and we can swap stories.\" It had scared Mary at first but decided not to press the issue and took the cards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That was a fun summer. Mark thought as he remembered last summer. His mom had tested the cards with just his father first, and once they discovered they worked they devised a plan for the summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His father was an accountant with a lawyer who had pretty flexible hours since he and his good friend from college had started a firm together and been decently successful. He stood a bit taller than mark and you could see the family resemblance. He was a good father though every year packed the family up in the van and started out on  the road to wherever his destination for the summer would be just like his father did for him and his family. He always had some national park to hike, or worlds largest this or that to see, and living in Kansas city they were in the center of the US with, as he saw it, the best location to go any where. The worst part was that he always kept it a secret from the kids and just tell them to pack for everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And pack I have Mark said as he looked that the 3 huge bags he had packed for the trip as he headed on down the the breakfast he could smell cooking downstairs. Though the size of his belongings were nothing compared to what his sisters would have to pack. \"oh well a couple of them will be mine in a bit.\" he thought to himself as he walked into the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good to see the last one is up. GOODMORNING sleepyhead!\" His mom greeted him cheerfully as she laid a plate of pancakes before him. He ate, his two sisters sitting at the table across from him. His older sister Katie had just graduated high school and would be going to college the next year. Where Mark took after his father she took after her mother. She was almost the same height with the same red hair though she wore it longer. She was a cheerleader which kept her in good shape and ran with the almost popular group in school. The real difference she had from her mother was that she was sporting a pair of full C cup breasts. His other sister was the odd ball in the family. Her name was Erin and she was a tomboy. Star player on the girls freshman soccer team that year she was very athletic. she was short though at 5ft 1 though their mother kept telling her she would grow. She had her hair cut as short and unlike her sister it was brown. her breasts weren't to large yet only an A but she knew she was about to break into the b cup range. Her and her sister still remained close despite their differences although Erin was at how Katie would try to change her subtly to act more like a girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As he finished up quickly and helped his father get the car ready while Katie called her friends and said her goodbyes his mother went to get the cards. Those magical cards. They allowed his family to have the vacation of their lives last summer and now that they were experienced they were ready to make this trip even better. His mother believed that overusing the cards would make them dull and instead said that they were only to be used over the summer. So Mark and his sisters had had to wait the whole year for this day to come again. To them it was bigger than christmas. He suspected that his parents had used them without the kids during the year but he could never tell, nobody could. Finally the time came as the preparations were complete and the family gathered in the kitchen with the box containing the cards in the middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well family time for another vacation. Everybody remembers the rules right?\" Mary said. as everyone nodded quickly. \"Well just in case ill read them off again so were all on the same page.  </span></div></div>",

(Copied from the teacher branch)<br>\r\nYou play a normal round of poker but instead of betting money, you bet traits of yourself. The traits can be anything you can name. The traits are not equal in worth, some are more worth than others. A list can be found below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game will be played like a normal poker game, you bet and the one with the best hand wins. The winner can choose to either swap his traits with those in the pot or swap these with the other players. You can't swap back traits you had when you began the game. It is possible to win and lose other traits throughout the game. For example it is possible that Mark get's red hair, loses it and wins the same again during the game. He can't swap his own hair back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwapping ages or genders does not change you physical. People just think of you that you're that old or the opposite gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't matter what you bet, it is possible that there are several of the same trait in the pot. It's not possible to swap a hand for a foot or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the start of every hand, two people have to place a pot. The person dealing has to give in traits worth 1 points, the person right to him/her has to give traits worth 2 point. That then circules clockwise the next hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen someone set bets, the other players have to bet equal or more points to continue playing, e.g. Katie has a bets traits worth 4 points, then the other will have to bet traits worth 4 or more points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReality adjusts to the swaps. It is only possible to leave the game table in between hands not when the game is played.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll swaps can be reversed any time after two days when all players gather, put their hands on the card box and saying a magical formula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrait - Points<br>\r\nSmall body parts (e.g hands, feet, lips... etc) - 1 Point<br>\r\nSmall Possessions (e.g. jewelry, single books, single dvds) - 1 Point<br>\r\nOne clothing article - 1 Point<br>\r\nPersonal Infos (e.g. Age, name... etc) - 2 Point<br>\r\nLarger body parts (e.g. torso, legs, face... etc) - 2 Points<br>\r\n'Medium' Posessions (e.g. small personal library, DVD collections) - 2 points<br>\r\nSkills - 2 Points<br>\r\nMale/ Female body parts - 3 Points<br>\r\nMajor posessions (e.g. cars, houses, all of one article of clothing) - 3 Points<br>\r\nGender - 3 Points<br>\r\nPersonality changes - 4 Points<br>\r\nWhole Outfit - 4 Points<br>\r\nLife - 5 Points</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ok and just to remind everyone of how this works for our own game over the vacation. We play before we get in the car to drive to the next location. What we trade you will keep until we are about to depart for the next location. Before playing again we will all reset to what we normally have. Anything and everything is up for trades.\" Marks dad, Mike, said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mark knew that everything was up for trades all to well. Last year the trip had started with small trades but then tricks had been played. He recalled one time that his sister Katie wore a pair of low heals to the trade session and won a hand that resulted swapping them with Marks only pair of tennis shoes. That left him in a pair of heels for an entire weekend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well then lets start this years game!\" Mary said as she dealt out everyone's hand. \"I'll start out with my eye color\" she said as a holo gram of two blue eyes poped up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So I have to bet two points......\" Katie mused since she sat to the right of her mother. \"I guess ill put out my skirt and my bracelet.\" as they soon appeared floating next to  her. Mark didnt know if he wanted to spend this first car ride in a skirt before he could change out at their first stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hmmm...\" his father said as he frowned at his cards. \"I'll just fold with cards like these. Not a good way to start the summer.\" That didnt suprise Mark one bit. His father was a very cautious player and never bet unless he had a good chance of wining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Boring as ever dad. I'll call with my voice, and raise u my sandals.\" Erin said as a musical note with a \"E\" and a pair of sandals appeared next to her. It was bold and Mark almost withdrew like his father. But he wasn't about to back down to his sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I call with my DS and my hands.\" knowing that Erin would desperatly want his DS to play since she didnt have her own yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"One points not much I call with my hairband.\" Katie said as the hair band that was keeping her hair in a pony tail appeared before her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So two points to call..\" his mom mussed. \"Then i call with my age.\" she said as a picture of a birthday cake appeared next to her with two big candles with the numbers 4 and 7 on them. \"Alright time to show.\" Mary said as she laid her cards down with a suprising two pair but the real winner was....</span></div></div>",

Erin you can have moms eyes. But i think ill be taking those sandals of yours for the car ride.\" She said as slid them into the hologram of Erin, while on the return placing the sandals into her own character. Immediatly after Erin blinked and when she opened her eyes again they were a nice blue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Darn now i got to wear these shoes you got, and without socks.\" Erin said as she examined the tennis shoes that previously belonged to her sister with a little to much pink for her tastes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You think you got it rough I'm wearing sandals with socks. Though that can be taken care of after the game. Back to the business at hand though. Dad you can have moms age, none of us want to be to old right now, and take my hairband while your at it.\" She said as she slid the items on over to her father. The hair band was just lying on top of his short cut hair looking a little silly on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here i was hoping to be young again.\" Mary said with disappointment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ya maybe next time mom. Now then Mark how about we give Erin that DS of yours and send those hands might as well accompany it.\" right as Katie finished Mark saw his hands instantly become smaller though luckily the nails weren't long or painted like his sister or his moms hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Lastly we have this little voice and my skirt. Well mom you wanted to be younger so I'll let you at least sound it.\" She laughed as she slid the musical note on over to her mom. \" And Mark this skirt would look lovely on you.\" Katie smiled as she saw her skirt turn into his basketball shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Now you'll see why I dont like em\" Erin said though it sounded strange with her mothers voice coming out instead of her own higher one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ya well its only a car ride and who knows, maybe you will be wearing it by the time we stop playing.\" Mark remarked as he looked down at his new skirt. It was predominately purple and had come down to Katie's knees and he was glad it had adjusted to the same length on him otherwise he might be wearing a miniskirt right now. This was the casualty of being a boy with 2 sisters, not made better by his father, he always ended up much more female than he went in with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Lets get this next hand going then.

His sister had a sinister smile on her face which meant she had a good hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well then I'll call with my selection of books i brought.\" Mary said with her daughters voice. As a tiny bookcase appeared hovering next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And I will fold.\" Mike said again as predictable as ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well then read'em and weep suckas!\" Erin exclaimed showing three queens. A surprisingly good hand for herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well that beats me.\"Mary said showing her hand of a single pair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Its good but not good enough for this.\" Mark said showing a strait figuring he won with such a hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well that hand beats mine.\"Katie said looking down trodden. \"If i didn't have all spades!\" She smiled flashing her flush as Marks face fell. \"Looks like luck is gonna be with me this summer. Now to sort out his great pot. I'll start by taking dads watch and since mom took your last name i guess you can have her first.\" she said as a watch appeared on her wrist and she slid the name tag on to her dads figure. \"I'll also take moms books for now there might be a good read hidden in there. Now since it is my skirt I'll take marks legs and waist.\" Right as she finished moving them Mark could feel like he had shifted in his seat and when he looked down he saw that he now had Katies hairless legs beneath his skirt and his waist had become a little smaller and he now had a full ass. He ran his hand across his legs as he felt the smoothness of his legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Lastly what to do with the boobs. I think I'll give mine to shorty over there.\" She said as Erin's chest just ballooned forward as she sprouted Katies D'cup breasts which looked absolutely massive on her short 5ft frame. \"and mark i think you can go ahead and have those tiny tits of Erin's.\" and just like that Mark could  feel some straps around his back and he opened the front of his shirt and looked down to be greeted with two small pert breasts. When he looked up he saw that Erin was happily bouncing her new breasts up and down while Katie was patting her now bare chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now young lady we still got a game to play please stop playing with your new breasts until we're done. Now it your turn to deal.\" Mary, or now Mike, said as Mark laughed at the sound of Erin's own voice scolding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had to put in traits worth 1 point. \u201cI think I\u2019ll put something small in\u2026 I\u2019ll bet my facial hair.\u201d, he said and a hologram of a chin with small hair studs appears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was the next to put something into the pot and she had to put in 2 points. \u201cLet me see\u2026\u201d, she mumbled and thought about it while seesawing slightly on her chair. \u201cI\u2019ll put my name.\u201d, she finally answered. A name tag appeared besides her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow creative.\u201d, said Katie and rolled her eyes. Erin looked at her with an evil glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark looked at his cards and decided to play along. \u201cI have a chance to win.\u201d, he thought. \u201cI\u2019ll bet my lips.\u201d, he called out and tried to play low for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie then looked at her own cards. \u201cHm\u2026 These are no good. I\u2019ll fold.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll call and bet my cooking skills.\u201d, declared \u201cMary\u201d and a symbol of a spoon and a fork which are crossed appeared beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo points then\u2026\u201d, mumbled Mike and thought if he should continue. He was a patient and careful player but the cards he had there were good.  \u201cOkay I\u2019ll call with my torso.\u201d. An image of his torso appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll bet my sports skills.\u201d, said Erin and a sheet with a soccer ball appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark then called and bet his hair. Then everyone showed their hands. Mark grinned triumphantly when Erin and his dad showed their cards. His hand beat them easily. But his grin suddenly vanished from his face when he saw his mother\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won.\u201d, smiled his mother. \u201cThen let\u2019s see who gets what\u2026\u201d. She looked at the pot and then at her family around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst, I think I\u2019ll swap names with Erin. I just feel more comfortable with a girl\u2019s name. What next? Ah, I think Mark will look great with my lips.\u201d, his mother grinned mean when her lips became slimmer while Mark\u2019s got fuller. \u201cI\u2019m not really in the mood for cooking or even knowing how to cook. It\u2019s always so annoying to think that I could cook better than the cook in the restaurant.\u201d. Mark\u2019s mother was really proud of her cooking skills. \u201cSoo\u2026 Katie you get to have it.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused for a moment to think. \u201cYup that\u2019s good. Katie you will get \u201cMary\u201d \u2019s torso.\u201d. As soon as she dragged the torso picture over to Katie\u2019s figure, the swap took place. Katie\u2019s chest, which was devoid of any breasts but still clad in a bra, got bigger and hairier, he stomach as well, while the torso of her father was becoming more feminine but luckily without any breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHM\u2026 What did I forget? Ah yes, facial hair\u2026 Why not Erin?\u201d. Small hairs sprouted out of Erin\u2019s chin while the chin of her father was now smooth. \u201cAnd last but not least, Mark you will get Erin\u2019s sports skills.\u201d.</span></div></div>",

I guess ill wager my driving skills.\" Mike, or Mary, said as a picture of a driving wheel appeared in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet my ears!\" Erin said as her petite ears appeared before her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thats strange. I bet my all my shirts. Don't really need them when there's nothing to fill them with.\" Katie said as a clothing rack of t-shirts and blouses appeared in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think its time to make a good call and fold.\" Mark said as he saw his hand consisted of nothing but a jack high card. Besides he felt as if he had lost enough this session already ans he looked down past the two small mounds in his shirt and to his new skirt and the legs beneath. Well.... at least enough to keep me occupied then next few weeks, he thought as he rubbed his legs together under the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then I guess I'll call with my height then.\" Mary said as a ruler with 5'8'' appeared next to a mini figure of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope your not planning to swap that with me honey. I call with my facial hair.\" Mike said as a mustache appeared before him. Though he was clean shaven now come the next morning it would need to be catered to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I call with my ipod.\" Erin said as it appeared before her in between her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then who gets to deal out the goodies?\" Mark said as everyone laid out their hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my luck couldn't last all day.\" Katie frowned as she was defeated by her sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YAY I won one.\" Erin screamed childishly which sounded awkward with a woman's voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well darn thought i had a chance this time.\" Mike said as he had lost with his two pair to Erins two pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well lets see. I think I'll keep my Ipod, but swap my ears with Katie.\" Erin said as she slid her ears over to Katie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well congrats now you look like dumbo with those things on you. At least i can hide mine under my hair.\" Katie said as she touched her new ears. Though she was right even though they wern't that much bigger Katies ears looked abnormally big on Erin's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to smart to be making fun of the person who won. For that dumbo comment you can have Dads facial hair. And I'll just take your clothes to. I do have the bust to match them anyway. Well I always wanted to be taller so i think ill take that height of yours mom.\" As she slid that one into place. Right as it made contact with her figure Mark watched as his mother just dropped in size in her chair as she dropped 8 inches in height. While on the other side of the table Erin shot up the same amount. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is what i was afraid would happen when i put that up. Everything looks sooo big now. My feet barley touch the ground now.\" Mary said as she looked around her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing everything seems so small or at least manageable, and even my new boobs look better on me now that i have this height.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right about that\", Mark thought to himself as now Katies breasts seemed much more proportional to her frame than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess the last matter of business is dads driving abilities. I think ill let you keep that duty since your the only one who knows where we're going.\" Erin stated as she quickly pushed it back into her dad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless of who wins you seem to be the one coming out ahead in these exchanges.\" Katie commented as the cards were dealt out for the next round.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All thanks to you Sis. After all you gave me 2 new friends.\" Erin said as she squeezed her two new boobs. \"Cant wait to see what the next hand brings.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I put up these hands of Marks and my earrings.\" Erin said as two little studs appeared as she never really wore much in her ears but had been talked into having them pierced by her friends. \"I think this voice suits me much better now mom. Being so small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya well I bet my feet, they don't really go with the look i'm trying to pull off right now.\" Mark smiled as he gestured to the lower half of his body that was predominately his sisters right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very cute bro. Though I hope that I'm the brother in a minute. I bet my Gender.\" Katie smiled as the Female symbol appeared before her. To everyone's surprise. Mark remembered last year when Erin had made this bet though it was more so just to make up the points she needed and she figured she would get it back or switch it with her mom or sister. But Katie had won that game and switched it with Mark and he had spent the next few days joining her mom and sister in the girls bathroom and having doors held open for him by courteous men. He figured that he would end up a girl again if Katie won. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow already trying to be a boy. And i thought Erin was the tomboy in this family. I call with my Eyesight and my glasses.\" Mary said as an eye-chart appeared before her. While in her youth she had had 20/20 eyesight it had been deteriorating a bit quicker than she had wanted it to. Though she had contacts to make up for it most of the time. This pot was quickly filling with things that Mark really didn't want to have swapped with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then I'll be backing out of this one getting a little to big for my liking.\" Mike said as he tossed in his cards.  Thanks for leaving me alone in this dad. Mark thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmmmmmm. I call with this really tight shirt.\" Erin said. and she was right while it had adjusted for her height gain it hadn't been as accommodating for her chest. Her, Katie's former, bra had a distinct outline showing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I call with my body hair.\" Mark said figuring it would be a better alternative to having to shave his sisters legs. And he wasn't going to back out of this pot. Not when he needed to have a chance at wining or possibly be a girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then read em and weep!\" Katie said triumphantly as she showed another flush to the dismay for her family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One second now. I believe that this. is what they call a full HOUSE\" Mark said in disbelief that he had won a round. While the look on his sisters face was priceless as it went from jubilation to defeat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then i think ill go ahead and let you keep my hands but those earrings are going on over to mom. And dad can have your shirt.\" Mark said as he saw his sisters bright blue shirt turn into the dark green polo his father had been wearing. Also she gains some feminine dangling earrings from her mother that she wouldn't usually wear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis you can have my feet, and take my body hair while your at it.\" Mark said as he felt all the hair on his body leave as he had smooth legs and smooth arms now while his sister was seemingly coated in hair, though in reality it was very little. He also saw her feet get much bigger as his shrunk to fit much better at the end of his legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom i think i can help you with the little eyesight problem you have. Erin you have said your coming out ahead, I think too ahead. So you can have mom's eyesight and glasses.\" Mark said as he slid them in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOW, everything just got blurry.\" Erin said as she rubbed her eyes and blinked repeatedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same for me. OH! That's right i have contacts in.\" Mary said as she quickly took them out. \"Wow i haven't had natural eyesight this good since i was in my twenties. Thanks for this Erin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya ya now where are your glasses I kinda need them right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i have them in the car in my purse, but now they are probably in your backpack in the car as well. I would give u the contacts but they won't fit you. So your just going to have to bear with it until we're done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well. So what you doing with Katie's gender Mark. Your already half female why not make it official.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As tempting as that is I have a better idea. I always wanted a brother so I think ill have two moms while I'm at it.\" Mark grinned as his father realized what he meant by that, and within a second Katie was his older brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet now I'm a dude!. This is gonna be fun bro. This will be even better then you being the sister. Should have kept playing new mom.\" Katie said happily as she highfived Mark. </span></div></div>",

It might be the last so if you were holding out on anything now is the time to make a move.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i have to start so i bet all my gym shorts.\" Mark said knowing that not saying all his shorts would mark it as a medium possession worth 2 points. Besides it was something he could dump off on his sister to help her feel more comfortable with his legs. He didn't want to see his legs in short shorts all the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice thought bro ill take em off you when I win.\" Katie confidently said. \"I bet my girlyness\" Right as she finished a pink pony riding a rainbow appeared before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that supposed to be?\" Mary asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what i was thinking of was like how i love shopping and dresses. you know girl stuff, not that this little unicorn isn't stereotypical at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that sure is interesting, and intimidating so i fold.\" Mike said as he folded once again, to the groans of his family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie you have to learn how to accept trying something new. I call with my whole current outfit.\" Mary said as her Sundress, sandles, panties and bra, stud earrings that she got from Erin and, lastly her wedding ring appeared out in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While i would love to better show off these babies.\" Erin said squeezing her breasts. \"A dress is something i don't want to be in anytime soon. I got everything I'm going to need this trip and there's is more for me to try out a differnt time. I fold.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that was suprising to everyone as Erin almost never folded unless it was a really bad hand. Mark knew that while she said she was content, the real reason was she didn't want to risk losing anything she had gained on what he assumed was a terrible hand. Mark on the other hand had a decent hand but was hesitant at the quickness that his mom had called on Katie's high bet. Whats more Katie was giving him very strange looks which only left him to think she was planning on making him start thinking like a girl. He had to take the chance to keep that from happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I call with my favorite color.\" Mark said. As a color wheel with an arrow pointing at blue appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was weak. Now SHOW i want to see who WON!!\" Erin demanded impatiently. As everyone presented their cards Katie's smile widened as she had won again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man this is a lucky summer for me. Lets see how were gonna deal out the fun. Mark thanks for putting out your shorts I think i know where you and i want them. I'll toss your favorite color over to mom though.\" Katie said as she made the arrangements. Right as his favorite color was put into his moms character he though about what it was an realized that now it was Red. Thankfully not the pink that Katie adored. \"You nice little setup you have going on right now mom can go ahead and find its way on to your beloved daughter.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughhh!!!!!!!!! I don't want this dress. Your so mean. Im sorry I gave you facial hair now can you please get this off me.\" Erin protested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you know once the change is made there's no going back. But don't worry you'll be thinking differently in a second.\" Katie smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO. Don't do that. Please not that.\" Erin said with a terrified face as she realized her sisters intentions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you won't even mind it. Besides I'm a guy now I don't want to be one and be uncomfortable with guy stuff. And i don't want to go full guy and swap with dad or Mark so it has to be you. Besides you'll love that dress in a second just like I do.\" Katie said as she pushed the girlyness into Erin. \"Though i don't anymore.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get you for this. Though you are right this dress is really nice good pick on it mom. ugh what am i saying!\" Erin said exasperatedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your just saying what you believe. Man I'm glad i thought ahead and got those gym shorts from Mark. I got something good to wear instead of a skirt of short shorts. This will defiantly make things interesting. So still want to play one more round or are ya done now sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it my call anyway. And Erin we'll have to have a mother daughter day and go shopping now.\" Mary said trying to lighten Erin's mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Don't want to Go Sho- oh That does sound appealing.\" Erin said defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well as for another hand i think.... </span></div></div>",

Mark turned around and quickly pushed back down his skirt and gave Katie a death stare to make her stop. <br>\r\n----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel so small like this!\" Mike whined as soon as the kids were out of hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still love you no matter the height.\" Mary said as she bent down and picked up her wife and gave her a big kiss. \"Now your just FUN sized.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I know what kind of 'fun' your thinking of.\" Mike said as she returned the kiss. \"And i thought the only way I would be a lesbian was if someone swap me and Marks sexual preferences, but now I'm a happily married lesbian to a handsome woman who towers over me. Please tell me that we have separate rooms in a hotel for tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I do. The kids will be across the hall 4 doors down. And their key wont work in the door. I figured one of them would do something crazy. And now we have Erin to thank for this new experience, though this shirt is a little tight.\" Mary said as she continued to kiss her beautiful wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks good on you. And as great as this is we're going to have to continue tonight.\" Mike said as she broke off the kiss with her new wife and gathered up the cards. \"The kids are probably getting restless and don't know what kind of trouble has already started.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya I guess your right. I bet Katie's rearing to go now.\" Mary said and sure enough as they reached the garage they found all the kids with their shirt collars pulled forward and getting better looks at their chests. \"Come on now kid lets wait till we're out of the neighborhood and on the road before you start doing those things. In the car we got a long road ahead today.\" He  said as he corralled them into the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Time for another interesting trip.' Mark thought as he watched the house pull farther away. The same house he had grown up in and had never changed. Not unlike this car. \"This car....\" He mussed as he looked over to his sister and new brother. \"Is gonna see a lot of changes. And its gonna be fun.\" </span></div></div>",

I don't want to be answering any questions when we get back. Wait till we're on the highway and then i'll let you be.\" Mike warned her children. To Mark this was the longest 5 min to the freeway ever. He just kept staring down at his legs and how they were a perfect image of his sisters. Well they were hers anyway. Though as he looked down he could see the bumps in his chest from Erin's young breasts. Even his hands intrigued him and he hadn't even gotten a good look at his feet yet. He just sat there rubbing his legs together and just feeling the smoothness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok your in the clear.\" Mike said as she turned back toward the front of the car. Immediately Katie took of her shirt to admire her now flat chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so cool. I probably don't even have to wear a top anymore since I'm a guy now.\" Katie said as she patted her chest. Mark decided to follow suit and took off his own shirt to reveal Erin's small a cups encased in her bra. He brought his hands up and squeezed them. the sensation of having breasts grabbed was something he hadn't felt in a year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know i would be mad at you... if i was about to do  the same thing.\" Erin said as she put her hands on her chest and started doing the same thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure you have the windows covered up!\" Mike called from the front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we do mom. Now mark show me that sexy ass of yours.\" Katie said. Curious himself Mark undid his new skirt and sat in his boxers. though they did little to hide the form of Katie's great ass. \"Looks good on you bro.\" Katie joked as she gave it a smack. Though I'm going to want them shaved before i get'em back otherwise ill just have to shave these.\"She joked gesturing to his legs which now belonged to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for a while until they pretended that they were bored though they were still jittery about the changes. Erin decided to try out her new DS only to find that she really didn't find much joy in it. When Katie played some she found that she was in love with it though she was still not any good. Erin just resigned to listening to her ipod, but soon found that all her songs had been replaced with boy bands that she hated but now found fantastic. She soon fell asleep but without the top of her dress on and her boobs spilling out of her bra. It seems so strange to see his 14 year old sister the size of his mother and sister with almost fully matured breasts. \"Though i have a pair of my own.\" He grinned as he once again fondled his new breasts. They wern't as big as Katies but they were here, and temproarily they were his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up and get dressed time to get out!\" Mary said as Mark looked outside to see that they were at...</span></div></div>",

It was uncomfortable to wear and he had quickly taken it off and put his shirt back on at the beginning of the ride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need some help with that?\" Katie offered as she help him get situated to Mark's embarrassment. Once everyone was ready they left the car and waited in the lobby with their luggage while Mary went to get the keys to the reserved rooms barely catching herself as she almost asked for the reservation under the name mike. Once they had the keys she gave one to Katie and Mark for their room they would be sharing with Erin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you kids are at the end of the hall no fighting and Mark gets one bed and girls share the other.\" Mary informed the children. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But moooom I don't want to sleep with a boy in my bed! Don't you remember i have 2 brothers now. Besides i'm as big as him now anyway. (in more ways than just height.)\" Erin protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you have a point boys you have to share this time and no fighting about it. Now run along and get situated. There's a pool and other things to do here. Me and your new mother will be here so if you need anything knock.\" Mike said as he and his wife entered the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is gonna suck sharing a bed.\" Mark commented as they walked toward their room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry about it bro. I promise I wont be tooo grabby.\" Katie teased as she gave his ass a pinch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your falling into being a tomboy character too quickly.\" Mark groaned as they slipped into the room.

Guys don't wear bikini's people would stare and think i'm a cross dresser.\" Mark responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly, but im a guy to... i wonder why i still have these. Oh well I don't have much of a choice now do I?\" Katie said as she started to walk toward the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, since your a guy I don't think there's any problem with me lending you mine.\" Mark offered as he held up his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what are you gonna wear.\" Katie asked as she took the trunks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i brought these along just in case. Though I think you will approve.\" Mark said as he held up a speedo that he had gotten for his short bout with the swim team this year. He brought them just in case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that will defiantly look better on you now.\" Katie said as she jumped into the bathroom and quickly emerged with Mark's trunks on. \"They feel a little funny i hope the mesh doesn't get caught up 'you know where'.\" Katie gestured to her crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ya if it gets to much just come back and switch out.\" Mark said as he ducked in to the bathroom and slipped on the speedo. As he looked in the mirror he had to admit that it had never looked so good on him. He gave his ass a playful slap and stepped out to the room to find Erin already in her suit as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughh I want to wear the bikini though Katie. No boy is gonna look at me while I'm in this one piece. I want to show off you boobs.\" Erin was complaining still with her mothers voice which only made the situation more comical. Ya well we need to drop this top off with dad in case he wants to swim. He's a girl now and needs to cover up his top regardless of his lack of something to show off. We don't want the vacation put on hold as he gets arrested for indecent exposure. If he doesn't want it you can just change into it. Now go give it to him and meet us at the pool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Katie and Mark walked down to the pool area with Katie pleasently walking topless. This is great! Nobody even cares that I'm topless right now being a guy is great. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya i still dont know what will happen when i take my shirt off. I mean i'm a guy but guys don't have these.\" He said gesturing to his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry about it. Besides....\" Katie said as she pushed him into the pool. \"It's already see-through!\" She laughed as Mark emerged from the water a little miffed. He climbed out and and threw his shirt off to the side now soaked. This left him bare chested with his sisters small breasts open to the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see my girls are enjoying the fresh air.\" Erin giggled as she walked into the pool area now in the bikini she had wanted to wear. She was trying to sexily sway back and forth to show off her new height, untill Katie snuck up behind her and pushed her into the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still missing the curves little one. Bigger boobs and height don't fix that!\" Katie laughed as she did a cannonball right next to where Erin had landed. The rest of the night in the pool went much like this with Katie pestering her sister. At one point they all took turns on each others shoulders now that Erin was tall and strong enough to support their weight in the deep end. They all had a great time though Erin and Mark both noted that they were having troubles with their acquired assets. Eventually they were done with the pool and they moved next to the game room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow the guy at the front desk didn't even give me a second look for being shirtless.\" Katie commented as she returned with the pool sticks and balls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats wrong with a guy being shirtless in his swim trunks?\" Erin giggled as she broke. The game continued and as it wound down Mark found himself leaning far across the table for a better shot. His breasts brushed against the soft fabric covering the table making his nipples stand erect which only made the situation worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOW! giving quite a show there bro. If you could see yourself now you would see a really sexy sight. Almost wish i had taken you sexual preference just so I could get more out of this.\" Katie joked though Mark knew she was right and just thinking about how his ass must look right now made both his nipples even harder and his bulge a little bigger in the confines of the speedo. After a little more pool they decided it was time for bed and returned to their room. After they took showers to wash out the chlorine Erin and Mark were laying in bed as Katie turned off the lights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scoot your big butt over.\" Katie joked as she pushed him to the side as she slipped into bed next to Mark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God these things are annoying to sleep with. How do you manage it?\" Mark asked as he shifted around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What these things.\" Katie said as she gave his breasts a squeeze causing him to gasp at the sensation.\" you just let them be and sleep on your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok now children. Mommy says its time to sleep.\" Erin said in a motherly tone with their mothers voice. Which got a good laugh out of everyone and after a bit of shifting and occasional pinches and squeezes from Katie. Mark finally fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

Mike and Mary were at their hotel room, the light was dimmed, romantic music was playing. Mary had ordered some wine. \"It's all perfect.\", smiled Mike lovingly at Mary and positioned her glass wine so that Mary could clink the glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary smiled back at his wife. \"I'm glad you enjoy it.\", she said after clinking and took a sip. \"I just hope you don't drink too much. With your reduced heigth, I have no idea when you might be too drunk to remember all of this.\", she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Says the former man with the tight, girl's shirt.\", she smirked and took a sip as well. Mary shrugged her shoulders. \"At least I'm still a man where it counts.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike put her glass away and crawled over to her new wife. \"And I'm glad for that.\", she whispered seductively. She then took Mary's glass and put it besides her own. A few moments later, Mike was on Mary's lap and began kissing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary gladly put her arms around Mike. He was dragging his wife into a much tighter embrace. He really enjoyed that his wife was now much shorter because that made her much lighter. Not that she was fat, but the reduced heigth made her weigth nearly non existent. Which also made the next move she had in mind much easier. Mary took hold of Mike's butt and lifter her up, then moving her to the nearest cupboard where he positioned her while taking off her pants and the small panties, which usually belonged to Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somebody is getting frisky.\", cooed Mike, which sounded strange and somewhat unerotic in Mary's ears, considering it was her daughter's voice talking to her like that. But she dismissed it quickly and concentrated on pleasuring her wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time, her own pants where down, revealing her rock-hard penis. Mike looked down and smiled broadly while licking her lips. Mary returned the smile and began carressing Mike's vagina with her penis. As soon as the penis touched it, Mike began making pleasurable noises which made Mary move faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Mary was busy down there, Mike began peeling off Mary's tight shirt, revealing her strong chest. Mike let her hands wander over the chest she loved so much. Mary grinned at her wife and began undressing Mike's shirt as well, revealing a lacy, pink bra. \"Katie's bra really looks good on you.\", she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up.\", replied Mike and moved her hips so that Mary's penis slipped into the hole. \"Shut up and take me.\", she continued, now moaning slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike did not need to tell her that twice. No sooner than the words escaped Mike's soft lips, Mary began pushing her penis in and out harder and harder, resulting in loud moans on both sides. After a few moments, Mary lifted Mike up again and began slamming her to the wall. Mike slung her arms around her wife and dug her long fingernails in Mary's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, both were laying on the bed, sweating and breathing heavily. The two had multiple \"playthroughs\" how they liked to call it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\", whispered Mike. \"This hadn't been so good since last time we swapped. I'm astonished you survived this long, considering your age.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary looked at his wife, looking somewhat displeased but Mike knew she just acted. \"Well, I'm younger than you remember. So don't talk about being old.\", replied Mary and laid her arm around his wife. \"I love you.\", she said and kissed Mike on the forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you, too.\", replied Mike and closed her eyes, her head resting on her wife's chest.</span></div></div>",

He looked forward to see his two budding breasts on his chest rising up and down as he breathed. He just sat there for a few minutes watching his own breasts. \"I don't remember getting long hair though...\" He thought as he looked to his side to see Katie sprawled out on the bed and he realized that it was her hair that had fallen on his face. After looking at her face he could see that she was already growing a bit of facial hair that had accumulated over the night. She had fallen asleep with her shirt off just like him though it looked strange now that she lacked her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well good morning sleepy head.\" Mark heard his mom say.

I really want another dress to wear. Though let me tell you don't let mom stick this eyesight thing on you it sucks. Since I don't have her contacts I didn't have anything to take with me this morning and it was annoying. Everything is a bit blurry and you can't read anything from far away. Oh well time to take a shower.\" Erin said as she grabbed a set of clothes she had picked out and dis-appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------&gt;<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Later the family packed into the van to continue to their destination.

Mark had decided to wear the same bra from yesterday since it was the only one he owned, along with a t shirt and a pair of short shorts at Katie's urging. The clearly showed the bulge in the front but from the back it was a fantastic sight. Mike and Mary looked rather similar to what they usually did, But Erin had borrowed a skirt from her mother as she wore a tank top. The skirt had been long on her mother but on Erin it had practically turned into a mini-skirt. If it wasn't for her still developing frame Erin would had been an absolute knockout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well kids its time to move out!\" Mary said as they took off. </span></div></div>",

Now not the California beach mind u but the gulf of mexico which, by Mark's initial scan, wasn't all to crowded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright kids grab your suits and meet back at the van after you've changed, don't forget sunscreen cause we're gonna be here for the rest of the day.\" Mary said and she meant it, it was only 10 in the morning currently so the family was in for a day of fun in the sun. They all grabbed their suits and headed for the changing rooms that were provided next to the parking lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well see you guys in a bit come on bro!\" Katie said as she walked into the boys changing room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprised you got that on the first go.\" Mark commented as he joined her in the changing room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well i admit i was thinking about it all  the way from the car so i wouldn't mess up.\" Katie said as she changed in her stall. Mark had given her his swim suit again though this time it was so he wouldn't get his legs back with a bikini bottom tan line. They quickly changed and Mark emerged to see Katie topless and rubbing her chest still feeling awkward with nothing covering it. They walked back to the car to find that they were back before the ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Man girls take forever to change right.\" Katie said as they both laughed. They then saw their family walk toward them Mike wearing a conservative 2 piece bikini that looked good on her now shortened frame. Erin walked next to her wearing her bikini that had reformed for her size though it had been build for sporting not for showing off which she wanted to do now. Though regardless her new assets still proudly protruded forward. Once again Mark thought how hot she would look if her body matched. But her aura was broken by the sight of Marks manly hands at the end of her arms. Also she was wearing a pair of glasses having had enough troubles with her mothers eyesight over the last days she had resigned to wearing them all the time. Mary looked the most out of place with as she wore a t-shirt and trunks as he would have to keep covered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Hate You\" Erin said looking at Katie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh are we still on about the girliness thing I thought we were past that.\" Katie said backing away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No you took my only pair of sandals. Now I have to walk barefoot across the parking lot.\" Erin groaned. After gathering their things they grabbed everything they needed and set up camp out under one of the few umbrellas remaining on the beach. Next they all applied healthy doses of sunblock not wanting to return any borrowed body parts sun burnt. As Mark was applying it to himself he realized that he was going to have to apply it to his breasts since he was bare chested. He started to rub it on but the rubbing turned to a massage as he got lost in the new sensations of his chest. Pleasure that he wasn't used to arroused him as his nipples grew hard and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey you want to to get my back for me.\" Katie said smiling over her shoulder as she presented her back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ya... Yah no problem.\" Mark said as he snapped out of his trance. There would be time that later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry to stop your fun but the moms were starting to take notice you'll have plenty of time to play with them later. Trust me I know how fun boobs can be.\" Katie said as Mark rubbed sunscreen on her back with Erin's small hands. \"Wait till we're out in the water and I'll tell you about something I'm thinking up for the next swap. Here let me get you\" She said as you turned for her. \"Trust me your gonna like it especially if you like these.\" She giggled as she gave his breasts a playful grab. <br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------<br>\r\n\"Well sweetie we're only gonna have these bodies for a little while longer, and there is still so much i want to do with you while your still fun sized.\" Mary said as she kissed her wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya fun for you but novelty of it in everyday life wore off for me. The world is so much bigger now and I hate being looked down on by everyone. Though the sex is still great that's only a small part even though its my favorite. This is the same beach we went to a few years back isn't it, I wonder if our secret spot is still there?\" Mike smiled.</span></div></div>",

Keep an eye on the stuff.\" Mary said as she and Mike walked off down the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then what do you guys want to do know?\" Mark asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about you guys but I'm going to work on a nice tan.\" Erin said as she started to lay out on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really! You gained almost half a foot of height and your not even going to take advantage of it. Come one suns not even that bright yet and there arn't that many people lets go out to the waves.\" Katie said as she grabbed Erin's arm and pulled on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! Fine! Stop being so annoying, I'll come swimming.\" Mary said as Katie sprinted for the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man I hope I'm not really that annoying, am I?\" Erin asked Mark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah your not that bad she's just taking it to the extreme right now.\" Mark answered as the slowly wadded out into the water. Still being earlier in the day it hadn't warmed up to much though it probably wouldn't get much better. Knowing the quickest way to get used to it he just held his breath and jumped right in. It was cold but after a bit he emerged to Erin still timidly walking in bit by bit. \"Come on in its great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My old friends would beg to differ.\" Erin replied pointing at Mark's chest. His nipples were rock hard and sent strange sensations through his body as he brushed his small hand against them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on sis the water is fine!\" Katie shouted as he emerged behind Erin and dragged her into the water screaming the whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD YOU ARE SO ANNOYING!\" Erin screamed after she emerged with her own nipples now clearly showing an outline through the bikini she now wore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you'll thank me later. Mark your legs are excellent in the water so much stronger than the ones i used to have. Made dunking Erin alot easier, so is swimming. Come on lets swim to that bouey and back.\" Katie smiled as he pointed to a bright orange bouey placed out about a hundred yards away from where they were. Feeling as if he had no choice he looked at Erin with a sorrowful glance and followed Katie on out. As he swam he thought more about how his body felt than the distance he still had to cover. The most noticeable was how his breasts now just felt like a drag in the water just getting in the way and even hurting some times as he had to adjust his stroke to not bump into them as he pulled his arms back. When he could ignore them he was feeling how his legs were different, and how his kicks felt strange due to his new structure of his hips which were much wider. And every time he looked ahead to see the distance remaining he saw Erin's small dainty hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About time you made it I was getting bored.\" Katie said as he finally reached the bouey. As he turned back he saw that Erin was just behind him and reached not long after her sporting ability really showing while her new height gave her more strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These things are pretty annoying to swim with.\" Erin said hefting her chest. \"I couldn't imagine having to do it with a normal bikini.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it felt great not having to lug them around. Though these legs are what really made it much easier. If mom ever let us use the cards during the year you might want to steal them for one of your games Erin.\" Katie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya the cards would make everything alot more interesting during the year. Though I wouldn't want to risk you trading something and running off to college with it.\" Erin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be fun to steal your athletic ability and then go be a star soccer player at school.\" Katie smiled thinking about it. \"Oh well, RACE YOU BACK!\" he shouted as he took off again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't look forward to the next swap enough. I cant take much more of her like this.\" Erin groaned as she took off after him as Mark reluctantly followed. <br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------&gt;<br>\r\nThe rest off the morning passed with more swimming by Katie and Mark and Erin resigning to sunbathing and giving guys suggestive looks and even talking to a few when they would come up to talk to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 12:15 the moms showed up again both with smiles on their faces and a bit of sand in their hair. They went to go collect the food from the car and bring it back. The beach had become a bit crowded now that it was later in the day and the sun was shining in full force. And there was still a full day ahead. </span></div></div>",

As she walked away Mark watched as she sexily swayed her hips trying to attract attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a cock tease right bro.\" Katie smiled as she sat back and patted her belly. \"Don't worry if you get my mind and a female body you might find it fun to do the same thing. Your on vacation you don't care if people think your a slut, or a tomboy in my case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya I figure that will happen sooner or later. Could be fun.\" Mark replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey kids come over here i got a surprise.\" Mike said as she pulled out the cards from her purse. \"I''m about done with being tiny anymore time for something new, who knows might be a teenager again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well looks like this is going to be the end of brother bonding for now. Don't worry I had fun doing this I'm sure it'll come up again.\" Katie smiled as she gave his ass one more playful swat. \"Can't wait till i get that back though. Sorry to break it to ya but it looks much better on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know I really like having a great piece of ass to feel up anytime I want, maybe I'll take it again.\" Mark joked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows if your good i might let you grab it regardless.\" Katie smiled as they joined up with the parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't we have to wait for Erin to switch back?\" Mark asked as Mark looked ready to recite the phrase to switch things back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we wanted to see if every player has to be present to hear the phrase in order to turn back. So sadly Erin is going to be the guinea pig today. Any objections? Good now here we go.\" Mike said as she started to recite what sounded like giberish to the family and anyone who might over hear it. But after it was over the cards gave a bright glow which temporarily blinded the family. Mark opened his eyes to look down and once again be greeted by a bare chest and hairy legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD!\" He heard Katie scream and as he looked he saw why. Since she was bare chested when the swap back occurred so she was now. She was holding her chest with one arm while scrambling for a towel not far away to cover herself up with. \"Next time give me a chance to cover up before your going to give me my tits back.\" She hissed at Mary who had now regained her name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry sweetie.\" She said trying to hold back her laughter at the situation just as Mark was. \"Here I brought your suit from the car go get your sister and change at the same time.\" She instructed as Katie scurried off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have remembered that you need to wear what u swapped when u swap back other wise clothing doesn't change.\" Mark said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya I know I still have a pair of your fathers boxers from last year. Though now your going to be stuck with Katie's skirt now aren't you. That will be fun to wear to school one day.\" Mary laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya and i can't wait to show up to casual Friday's wearing my daughters shirt.\" Mark laughed as well. \"Also its good to be a man again I've been waiting to do this all day.\" He said as he took off his shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to say it's much better to be the right size again as much fun as it was to be small enough to have to worry about getting stepped on.\" Mary laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to use me as the guinea pig without asking you jerks!\" Erin said as she returned now shorter with her smaller breasts fully contained in her bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good you remember swapping back that's the other thing i wanted to test. This opens up so many more possibilities.\" Mary said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure that its safe to play with so many people around?\" Katie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should be since only the people playing notice the changes. If you want we can play a hand with you watching but not dealt in and you can tell us what you think is happening.\" Mary grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! no. I'll be ok lets just get this round going.\" Katie said quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya I'm ready to be tall again it was way to much fun and i wasn't done yet. who knows might even try being taller.\" She grinned looking at Mike and Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then lets get started with the first hand......</span></div></div>",

I bet my Bikini Bottom.\" She said dealing out the cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then 2 from me I bet my feet and my hair style. All this hair is hot on a day like today, hopefully one of you boys can lend yours.\" She said smiling as her  shoulder-length hair and feet appeared before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet my height!\" Erin blurted out excited to potentially rejoin the tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm what to bet...\" Mark said as he stared at his cards. He was really thinking about what Katie had said to him earlier while they had been swimming while Erin sunbathed. She had told him that she was having a blast as a guy but wanted to to go all the way and become as much of a guy as possible. But she didn't want to do it alone and suggested that he do it as well. Though Mark hadn't told anyone he was really curious what it would be like to be entirely female so he had agreed to do it. The plan was simple if either won a hand make the other as much of the other sex as possible, and Katie had wanted to make it a game so the person who went to farther lengths at the end of the rounds would win and got to bury the other in the sand. 'well let the game begin' Mark thought.<br>\r\n\"I'll raise you my Penis and swim trunks.\" He said as his dick was displayed before him for all to see with his trunks right beside it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well seems like someone wants to go big this round. I fold.\" Mike said trying to look away from his sons genitalia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll call with my arm's and hands.\" Katie said smiling since she knew Mark would be going through with the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow this pot is getting big. Time for it to get bigger don't ya say I call with my swimming ability.\" Mary said. Now this scared both Katie and Mark a little. They both knew that swimming was not their mother's strong suit and they could be stuck without the ability to swim well for the rest of the day, but it was to late now any way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I call with my hair color.\" Erin said as a blob of orange the same color as her hair appeared in front of her next to the ruler displaying her height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then time to show.\" Mark said as all of them dropped down their cards. As he looked around his smile turned into a frown as he saw that Katie and Erin had beaten his hand. He feared that he might shrink before he saw that his mother had been the overall victor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well what a pleasant surprise and with so much on the board. Mark your hair seems a bit shorter than Mike's so I think I'll take that and you know what I'll give it a dye job as well.\" Mary said as Mark felt the change take place as his hair grew down to his shoulders then a wave of orange cascaded down his previously brown hair as he watched the same happen to Erin's hair. \"Next I'll give Mike Katie's Arms and hands.\" She said as Mike stared shocked as his muscular arms shrunk into Katie's feminine one's, which worked out well for Katie. <br>\r\n\"Hmmm Erin you can keep your height for now nobody really wants it, but you can have Katie's bottom. And Mark you can have my feet but I'm going to want something in return your penis will do quite nicely.\" She said little did Mark know that Mary had been quite pleased when she saw that he had bet his penis. She had thought of the naughty things that she could do with it and Mike later. Right as she slid it to her character she felt like something was pushing out of her vagina and she looked down to see a bulge had formed in her bikini. She looked over to Mark to see that he had opened the front of his trunks and was gaping at what she knew was the lack of a penis. <br>\r\n\"Ehem have a bit more decency in public young man. Let me get you something that will fit much better on you.\" She said as she slid his swim trunks onto herself giving him her bikini bottom. \"And just for the fun of it you can have my swimming skills as well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that his world had changed enormously. He lost his penis, not to his sister like he had intended but to his mother. And now he couldn't even remember how to swim well. He knew the strokes but vaguely. He rubbed his legs together feeling the new sensation of a vagina between his legs, everything more foreign so much stranger than the breasts he had just been sporting. He looked down where his legs were crossed as he sat on the blanket and took in the sight of his flat crotch. As he continued to look he saw his mothers smaller feet that were starting to show signs of age but that were still unmistakably feminine. He was in for it now but he realized there was still a long way to go to be fully female. He had the most important part taken care of but there was much more to be had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well on to the next Hand!\" Mary said as she dealt out the cards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She still had not given up her plan to become tall again, she only needed to win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark then thought of how he could become more feminine without gaining too much attention. \"I guess I just have to bluff.\". Mark put on his worst poker face and made it look like he had a very good hand although he would probably lose with it. \"I'll bet my chest.\", he proclaimed. Since female chest was considered a female body part, the male chest was as well, which meant that Mark had put 3 points into the pot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah.\", whistled Mike. \"You seem to have a really good hand.\". Mike looked at his own feminine hands with manicure which originally belonged to his daughter. \"I guess I'll fold then.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad has fallen to the bluff... I guess he is too cautious to really read us.\", thought Mark but he had not counted on his father anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie looked suspiciously at Mark and tried to figure out if he really bluffed or not. Maybe it was not a good idea to make such an obvious bluff from Mark now they thought that he really had a good hand. \"I'll call. I'll bet my legs and... let's see... my jewelry.\", said Katie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll call aswell.\", said Mary. \"My bikini tops.\". Multiple bikini tops which were all laid above each other appeared beside Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin grimaced. \"I guess I can't win like this... I'll fold.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie then grinned at Mark. \"Okay then. I want to see your hand.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark nodded and showed his hand to the others. \"I knew it!\", exclaimed Katie happily. \"You bluffed!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark faked a sigh. \"I guess you read me like a book.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Mary and Katie both showed their hands and the winner was Katie. \"Looks good.\", smiled Katie and looked at the pot and thought about what to do. \"Let's see...\", she mumbled and licked her lips while she thought about it. \"I guess I have to disappoint Erin again. You can keep your height. Next... hm... Yeah. Mom, you get Mark's chest since you already have his crotch.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was surprised when the orbs appeared on his chest. They were big and sagging slightly but what surprised him most was that Katie had given him something feminine. She could have easily given him her own boobs and that way gain a male trait and win the other game the two were playing. \"Maybe... Maybe she wants to punish me with middle-aged breasts?\", thought Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie then continued her swap around. \"Not much left. I guess dad you can have mom's bikini tops.\". Mark now knew why she had done it. Although Katie's boobs were bigger, their mother's boobs were more sagging and more uncomfortable without a bra and she was speculating that he will not get one. Maybe she just did not want his chest again and speculated for their fathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who will get my legs... Dad, you already have my arms and hands, now you can get my legs as well. Erin, you can get my jewelry, oh and mom's hands, almost forgot them.\", smiled Katie and looked down at her more muscular legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark had gained another trait this round but he was not sure if he really wanted it right now. He looked down at the big orbs which were covered slightly by his long, orange hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin took the cards with her manicured hands. More careful because of the long fingernails. She then dealt the cards.</span></div></div>",

Make your bet I put up moms hands, i dont think i can handle the manicure.\" Erin said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well.

Not likely though, now hopefully Katie would throw a good amount in the pot and he could turn what she had done to him back on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm I think ill set my breasts and muscle tone.\" Katie said betting a whooping 5 points. Its a bluff. Mark hoped in his head though not to sure of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that is quite a hefty bet. I call.\" Mary said smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha.... what!\" Katie said shocked someone would call. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes it will be very fun. I place my gender and my ears and earrings. Oh this next session will have plenty of excellent changes to experience. Katie you looked to be having such a great time without breast and being guy that I guess ill give it a try.

I'll toss in all of my underwear.\" Mark said calling as well. He figured he would need some panties for the upcoming time as a woman, and this way he could choose who's he would have, hopefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess by the look on your face you don't have much in that hand of yours do you Katie?\" Mary taunted as Katie's depressed face confirmed what she had said. \"To bad I'm going to have fun dishing out pot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast there mom still have to beat me. I have a full house.\" Mark said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh your right i don't suppose these girls wouldn't change that would they?\" Mary said flashing her 4 queen's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... that'ss not fair!\" Mark exclaimed not believing his mom had gotten 4 of a kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but it happened and I think your going to join them.\" Mary said as she swapped her gender with Mark. \"See now I have 3 daughters. Though I'm not your mother anymore am I, shame. Good idea putting up your underwear we're going to need them for comfort, and you're going to need my bra's for my girls later. Lets see. Mike you can have some breasts since you have the tops for them.\" Mary said as Mikes bikini top filled out nicely. Though to Mark that was only helping Katie, although she still had to get rid of her gender. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And i think you kids can swap muscle tone as well as voices, be thankful that I didn't leave you with a child's voice Mark.\" Mary said as he gasped as his body seemed to shrink as he lost the average amount of muscle that he had. His body seemed much more girly as he was now practically one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a kid mom I'm practically old enough to drive.\" Erin complained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then your old enough to have a woman's hands.\" Mary said as she placed her hands back to her. Erin had been practically untouched this round save her hair color that was now brown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey I know you want to be young again. But i think another time. We've got enough going on without being teenagers again.\" Mary said as she kept him in his late 40's. \"And Mark you can have my ear's and earrings. I'll be nice not having anything dangling for a while.\" Mary finished as she sat back and viewed her creation. She was a man, and no longer had a son though that seemed that it might soon change. Her new daughter now had her impressive breasts out on display along wither her vagina and feet. His hair now looked exactly like hers had hanging down to to the tops of his chest. Her eldest child now sounded like a man, and looked like one now only having a vagina that would still count her as a girl. She could sense that her two older children wanted to take a walk on the other side of the fence and decided that she would join them. And the thoughts of maybe getting her husband a vagina had her new friend stirring in her pants.</span></div></div>",

On his ears which felt strangely different, no wonder since they were his mothers, on which some earring dangled down. His feet looked as old as his breasts and just as feminine. His bikini bottom hid a vagina, the same one through which he entered the world. \"I should try to ignore this...\", he thought while shuddering. His muscle tone was different as well. He felt weaker and more feminine than before. Last but not least, his voice was now that of his own sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark then looked over to his sister to check how much she had changed. So far she had their father's arms, hands, legs and chest and Mark's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like I'm going to win our little game.\", thought Mark and grinned broadly which was did not go by unnoticed by Katie. She looked at him with a \"We'll see who laughs last\"-glare. Mark shuddered slightly.

If I would finally win again...\", he thought. \"That way, we would have two happy people.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I have to bet two points... I'll bet my face.\", said Mike and looked at his cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie looked at her own hand and put the next bet. \"Keeping it low for now...\", she whispered so nobody could hear it. \"I'll bet my lips.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How cautious.\", grinned Mary. \"Now let's see... Yeah, I like this. I'll bet my stomach and all of my make-up.\". Mary hoped that Katie would bet her vagina this round. She had already noticed the plan her former son and her eldest daughter were following, although she had no idea about 'the game' the two were playing but she wanted to help them. Also she wanted to give her husband equipment which better fits her own equipment below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin sighed. \"As much as I would like to bet something, I guess I can't win. I'll fold. Today I really don't have any luck\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My hand is good. I might win... Well, I thought this last time, but let's see.\". Mark looked up from his cards. \"I'll call. I'll bet my legs and my name.\", he said and still got used to his higher voice. With that he had put 4 points into the pot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike folded as well. \"My hand is garbage and the pot is getting too big.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We really are dominating this game.\", laughed Katie in her deeper voice. \"Well, dad normally folds anyway.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to talk or bet something?\", asked Mark and tried to persuade her into folding. \"Are you too afraid to play with such a big pot?\". Sadly his plan had the opposite effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry.\", she said with a stern look. \"I'll call. I'll bet my gender.\". With the one point she had previously bet, she now had put 4 points into the pot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary looked at the pot, then back to her cards. \"I'll fold. I don't think I could win.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then...\". Mark looked at Katie. \"Then let's see.\". A moment later, Mark nearly jumped up with joy. \"Now let's see who gets what.\", he grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First... Erin, you can get rid of your manicured hands, I'll take them.\", he said and swapped hands with Erin which resulted in him having his mother's manicured hands. \"Also, mom you can get my legs... mh... and my name while I'm at it. Will be interesting I think, I mean I'm a woman now anyway, so why not have a female name?<br>\r\nKatie, you can keep your gender. I don't think anyone would want it anyway. Erin, you'll get dad's face.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the latest swap became visible Mark had a hard time not to laugh. His dad with Erin's face looked strange but his dad's face, complete with his whiskers, on Erin's little head and body just looked wrong but plain funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Did I forget anything? Oh, right. I guess I'll take mom's stomach as well and her make-up.\", he said and looked down when his stomach changed a bit. His mother's stomach was still pretty fit but you could see that age left some signs and you could see some small love handles. His face felt funny, now that there was make-up on it. It only occured to him now that he nearly swapped completely with his mom. No wonder considering that he tried to avoid swapping with his sister since that would benefit her with their bet.</span></div></div>",

I bet my feet.\" Mike said leading off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i have to bet three but I'm going to raise one and just bet my gender.\" Katie said knowing she had a lot of room to make up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm well I don't have all to much left go with so might as well play this through. I call with all my dresses.\" Mary, or Mark, said as a shopping rack filled with dresses appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well not to bad yet so I bet my height and my feet.\" Erin said. Now mark knew that if he only called he would have a chance at not only winning but even if Katie did win she wouldn't be able to beat him. But... this wasn't garunteed to be the last round, so he tried to scare her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I call with all my Shirts and my face.\" He said figuring he should be prepared for the week ahead and finish looking the part. He figured that his body was set but his face was still off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You kids just keep betting too much. I'm out.\" Mike said once more with his daugher's voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I will raise even that, I bet my vagina and my sexual orientation.\" Katie bringing the pot all the way to 10.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out\" \"Out\" Mary and Erin both said quickly. Now this was a hard decision for Mark. He knew that his sister didn't have a good hand and was just desperately trying to win or at-least get close enough for a tie but he didn't have the best hand either with only a pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fold.\" Mark said. It wasn't worth the risk. Though if Katie really traded away her sexual orientation she would win. Mark would have to say they at least tied. Though she couldn't could she that would be to much even for her. Wouldn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, that is how you bluff.\" Katie smiled as she showed that her hand merely consisted of a Jack high card. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think I'll finish becoming a boy now, if you would be so kind to trade with me dad, or should I say mom.\" Katie smiled as she gave her father her vagina, gender, and bikini bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark you have to be better prepared for the time ahead and now that you practically have moms body you need to show it off so I'll make these clothes swaps for you. Though I think I'll be needing the shirts.\" She said as she swapped the dresses from Mary and the shirts from her onto Mark. This left Mark rather confused, his sister was helping him although she could just make the argument that it is only what we look like after the game not the possessions they had and he would have to agree on that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm now Mark, or Mary wow that does fit better. Mary your face is all prettied up but with that face it just doesn't work. I think you would look better with mine.\" She said as Mark now found himself looking at his own face staring at him from across the circle. It was like looking in a mirror only it wasn't mimicking what he was doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm as for my sexual orientation I think I go ahead and really take a walk on the other side. I think I'll swap it with Mike.\" Katie said and while Mike had the look of utter horror on her face the swap was done. She had really done it. She seemed to close her eyes for a second and then open them again. Then she stared at Mark's breasts and smiled a broad grin. \"Nice.\" She said now clearly having a new outlook on Mark's new assets. As Mark noted that her new friend was getting bigger. Now if Mark had been looking she would have notice that his own mother was also getting rather aroused. Mary was already excited when her husband gained a vagina and while she wasn't all to into vagina's the though itself was going to be enough. She was only scared that her husband would be to afraid of her penis, though that problem was now taken care of in fact he might even be the initiator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin I think I'm going to be your favorite sibling really soon cause I'm going to switch out your height.\" Katie smiled as Erin's face lit up while Everyone else stared at Katie with fear in their eyes. \"In fact I'm going to make you even taller though Mary won't like where this is going.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh not again!\" Mary said she waited to lose her height again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't taking you Mark since when have you been named Mary?\" Katie said as she evilly grinned at Mark, the new Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT! NO NO NO!\" Mark shouted though it sounded like a scream now with his voice. Next thing he knew he was no longer looking slightly down at Katie but having to look up instead. He looked to his side and saw that his \"little\" sister was now enormous to him since now sat with his previous 6 foot 2 inch height. \"Wh... Why?\" He asked in a whimper that his new voice only made seem even weaker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Cause its funny. Also you were far to tall for a girl. Could you imagine the looks you would have gotten towering over a lot of the guys here. Despite that body you would scare them all away. You look so much hotter now, and those tits look absolutely enormous on you.\" Katie smiled. And as Marked looked down he was shocked to see that while his entire body had shrunk proportionately to his height change His breasts had remained the exact same. They looked absolutely enormous on him, but as he looked around everything was absolutely enormous to him. Katie had played him again. First she gave him the large middle aged breasts then she shrunk him down to a pipsqueak. He felt another small tingle and looked down to see that he now had his Erin's feet instead of his mothers, which surprisingly enough were smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then are we done or not?\" Katie said smiling down at Mark.</span></div></div>",

He had made a bet with his sister, but he had gotten to caught up in the bet to realized just how much he had traded away. He looked down at the two orbs on his chest that had belonged to his mother, un-bound, hanging free. He noticed that they seemed even bigger than before as they hadn't shrunk with the rest of his body, on his 6'2\" frame they had seemed manageable and almost proportionate, now they would be an enormous chore especially for the rest of the day without any support. He was practically what his mother was from the first round since he had close to her exact body along with the lack of height she had possessed. He turned his head and red hair fell in front of his face. He brushed it aside and couldn't help but notice his mothers slim hands. Everything was so wrong, and so big. He hadn't realized how much the world would change. The towel he had barely fit on now easily fit him easily and the umbrella seemed much higher now. As he looked at the rest of his family he saw he parents talking with each other, Mike looking angry or worried as Mary talked to him with a smile obviously happy with the changes. The women in the family were now men and vise versa. As he looked at Katie to see that she looked like a man now though her face didn't match the youth of her body, the face that used to belong to mark, the face that was staring directly at his chest! Mark saw as he realized that now like girls just like him and he knew that he would be staring at 5 foot tall teenage girl with a C-cup chest was sitting on the beach topless, but he didn't like it now that he was that girl. He quickly pulled his legs up to his chest as he was balled up blocking her easy view as she pretended like she hadn't been looking. 'Already acting like a guy.' He thought as he now felt his breasts press up against his smooth legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So sis I think that I'll take the win this time.\" Katie smirked as she stood up. \"Now where to bury you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so!\" Mark said sharply as he looked up. \"You would have won if you had stopped after switching you sexual orientation but you wanted to mess with me and like u said this height suits a girl much better than my old one.\" He said standing to emphasize his point. After doing so he regretted it. He had expected to rise higher and was taken back by just how short he was. Also the resulting quickness of his rise sent his breasts bouncing and once again left Katie staring as Mark covered them up with his hands. \"Up here bro.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow so that's why guys do that to me huh. I might give them some more slack in the future, but back to business I may have made u smaller but I think making my self a lesbian counts for a bit more.\" Katie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lesbian is not quite the right term now but have more body parts and visually look alot more like a girl. I HAVE MAKEUP ON!\" He screamed back in a voice that was almost a shriek now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what since we're not going to agree on this lets let mom decide since she helped us out so much. Need me to carry u over to her?\" Katie joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh HA HA\" Mark said as he followed Katie. It was unnerving to hear your own voice taunting you whats more was that for every 2 steps his sister took he had to take 3 and left a small print in the sand with Erin's tiny feet. He was already finding that without a top his breasts were causing some pain as they bounced with every step, he also noticed that they bounced significantly more than the small breasts he had from Erin previously which barely moved at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom we need your help real quick.\" Katie said breaking up their parents conversation and taking their new father off to the side. \"You noticed that me and Mark were changing genders now just real quickly we need you to pick who is more like the opposite gender?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering what was going on but I figured you both just wanted to try the other side. Well I think you both went equally as well the other way.\" Mary responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad no time to be a mom and be nice to both kids we need a strait answer, one winner.\" Mark said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you put it that way I'm going to get a good look at both of you.\" She said stepping back and taking in both their bodies. Katie made a strong man pose while Mark seeing what she was doing posed like a model with his hand on his hip and his other behind his head. \"Oh you two look adorable, but if i had to choose then the winner would be..........</span></div></div>",

I even swapped my sexual orientation!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you did.\", began Mary began to explain. \"BUT you forgot one thing: Sexual orientation is not bound to your gender, right? Or is a lesbian less of a woman than a heterosexuell woman?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie sighed. \"I guess not...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I think Mark is more of a woman than you are a man.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sis, I guess I am the winner and you are the loser.\", grinned Mark broadly. Katie shuddered when she saw this evil grin coming from her own face. \"Okay, okay.\", she replied. \"I guess I lost.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them told their \"father\" what would happen to the loser. \"Well.\", Mark began. \"I guess, we better get used to this and all. We'll leave you and dad alone.\". Mark grabbed Katie's now more muscular arm with his manicured hands and dragged her away from Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\", grunted Katie. \"I know that it might not be a good idea to tell her of the whole bet but you don't have to drag me away, short stuff.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt occured to Mark that he now was really smaller than he used to be. The moment when he found out that he had won was so great that he almost forgot all of the changes. This was the moment when he noticed his breasts again which were hanging heavily on his chest. Katie's eyes went to the freehanging breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark instincitvely put his arm across his chest. \"I think I should cover those...\", he mumbled. \"But first, you're going to be buried.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie sighed. \"Okay, fine I guess.\". She laid down in the sand. \"Go on, do your worse.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark sat down and began to bury Katie deep beneath the sand. With his smaller hands he needed a little bit more time than he would have with his own hands but he succeeded eventually. Mark grinned and looked at his creation. \"Well, you can free yourself now. I'll go get a top and if you could not free yourself when I get back... I'll maybe consider helping you.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark then got up, covered his breasts and went to his hotelroom. There he looked through his new waderobe. His shirts have changed to Katie's and he now had his mom's dresses in his suitcase. Also he now had some bikini bottoms in it. \"Didn't know that mom and Katie took so many clothes with them. Oh, well, now I have more choice.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark then thought about what to wear. \"Hm... One of Katie's tank-top or mom's dress?\", he thought and decided to wear...</span></div></div>",

It hugged his feminine curves beautifully. \"I gotta admit...\", he mumbled when he looked at the mirror in the room. \"I look kinda hot.\".

Now get me out of here!\", she ordered him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark's grin got even wider and he sat up, trying to look taller which did not really work out the way he wanted it to work out.

Out!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine.\", smiled Mark. \"I'm not such a bad sister, I'll let you free now.\". With that said, Mark began digging up Katie. \"There. Now you're free. You're welcome.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\", sighed Katie. \"All those muscles and I couldn't get free myself... Well, you could have worked out a bit more than I'd have succeeded for sure.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark shook his head. \"Yeah sure. Just look for a scap-goat. Nevermind. Any idea what we should do now?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie nodded and smiled. \"Yeah, I do have an idea. I see you're already dressed.\". Katie pointed at Mark's sundress but then stopped for a moment, her eyes fixated on Mark's cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark coughed to get her attention. \"My eyes are up here.\", he said and pointed to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie blinked twice and need a moment to regain her senses. \"Oh, right. Sorry. Still having get used to this. I mean, I didn't know I had such a sex drive. Maybe it's because it's easier to see something that dad likes... Now that I think about it... I mean, I have dad's sexual preferations so it's only natural that I now like mom's boobs which you currently possess.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you still trailed off. Tell me what you want to do.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right, sorry. I just thought, how about we two go look for some people to flirt with. Have some fun. I mean, we're both young, we're both looking good and we both are on holidays, so we should have fun.\", explained Katie finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mh, good idea.\", replied Mark. \"We agreed to experience life from the half of humanity so we should do this. But don't try to hook me up with a man.\". He looked with harsh eyes at his sister. \"I may be a girl now but I still like girls.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which makes you a lesbian, alright. I guess we'll find you someone. I really regret that I didn't swap my sexual preferences with you. This would be much more fun if we both were into the other gender now. Ah well, you can't have everything.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie stretched her arms and legs a bit. \"Okay then, I'll get dressed and we meet up at the hotel reception.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\", answered Mark and before he could say anything else, Katie already ran away to get dressed. \"There is someone eager to meet some new people. Oh well.\". Mark then walked slowly to their rendevouz point, already being used to his different body.</span></div></div>",

Erin was too engrossed in her heigth anyway. \"She really seemed happy.\", said Mike when he sat down on the bed. He felt weird having his daughter's arms, hands, legs and worst of all her breasts clad in his wife's bikini top and not to mention his daughters vagina between his legs. But the worst swap he had gotten was his daughter's sexual orientation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how are you feeling?\", asked Mary who was now called Mark. She slowly sat beside her husband and laid her arm around her husband and put her hand which originally belonged to Erin on his shoulder. \"I mean, swapping your sexual orientation is something really big. Are you feeling alright?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at his wife and she saw her youngest daughter face looking at her but her eyes looked so different. In them she saw her husband whom she loves so very much. \"I... I don't know. I know that it's wrong but this just feels right.\". His eyes went down to his wife's swimming shorts which belonged originally to their son. She actually looked much like their son. \"Just thinking of having your... cock... inside of me... I get turned on...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary smiled at him and carressed her cheek with her boyish hands. \"It's okay.\", she whispered softly. \"Just think of this as some kind of roleplay. You're the wife and I'm the husband.\". She then began kissing him with lust. At first she was repulsed at kissing her daughter's face but soon she had forgotten it and wrapped her arms around her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis attitued changed as fast as hers and his hands began roaming over her boyish body. The touches and the kisses they exchanged made her penis come to life and press against Mike thigh. \"I see you're liking it.\", he grinned and pushed her away from him. Before Mary could react he had pulled off her shorts and his mouth was wrapped around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary began to moan. \"I really enjoy our vacation.\", she moaned softly. \"We always get kinky.\". Her face showed a grin which soon faded to a pleasurable smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike continued until her cock exploded. He swallowed all of it which suprised Mary. She decided to not say something and looked deep into the eyes which reflected so much lust from her husband. Soon they were kissing again.</span></div></div>",

Some guys were checking out Mark, he noticed some girls did, too, although most of them had an envious glare instead of a lustful one. Also everyone looked so big. Mark feared that someone walked over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that you're quite popular around here\", grinned Katie when she arrived. Mark was surprised that she finished dressing so fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Kinda...\", replied Mark slowly. \"And I have to admit, I kind of like the attention I get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark turned around, his sundress began floating up slightly. \"But I can't be mad at them. I'm really looking good.\" Mark tried his best girlish giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm glad you enjoy yourself. How about we look for some dates now?\", asked Katie broadly grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! Stop there! Who said anything about dates?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, 'Mary'. Don't be such a spoil-sport. We did these swaps in order to experience the whole opposite gender. So you have to date someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark looked at Katie with an evil glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held up her hands to show that she gives up. \"Fine. I allow you to date lesbians since you're technically a lesbian yourself. BUT you have to date someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark sighed. \"Okay fine... But what are the chances that I find one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't worry about that too much. Just try to have fun and talk to girls maybe boys... Hey, I have an idea. Since you're a girl, it should be easier for you to talk with the girls first\", said Katie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you're being ridiculous. As if girls would talk more easily with other girls. I guess if a cute boy goes up to them and talks to them, it would be more easy to start a conversation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay. But let's stay together since we're hunting the same 'food'. Also I want to see you flirting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark looked at his sister and thought about telling her that he did not want to but he was curious as well. \"Okay fine... Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark turned around and went over to the bar of the hotel. \"I wonder what mom and dad are doing right now...\", mumbled Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to ask? Despite not changing their ages, the swaps turn them to teenagers again. They're probably at their room having sex with your penis and my vagina\", replied Katie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for telling me that. Now I can't get that picture out of my mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie giggled mean. \"You can try to forget that by going over to that group of girls there.\" She pointed to a group of five girls around Mark's age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark looked at them, then back to Katie.</span></div></div>",

Mark breathed in heavily, channeled all his courage and then walked slowly over to the group of girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind was racing. How should he talk to them? He was not good at talking to girls before the swaps and now he was certainly not any better. Maybe it was harder now, since he could not use the typically flirt phrases to break the ice. On the other side... He was a girl now. It's easier for girls talking to other girls, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe distance between him and the group was nearly zero and the time frame to turn around nearly closed. Mark was about to turn around when one of the girls noticed him and turned her head to him. Now it was to late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl that looked at him had brown, shoulder length hair. She wore a pink tank-top and tight jeans. Her breats werea B-Cup maybe a small C-Cup. Mark was not good at guessing sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took in another deep breath and then brought out his first words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... Hi...\", he stummered. \"Do you er... know to have fun around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe expected that they would tell hin to get lost but they did not. The brown haired girl smiled at him. \"Yeah. You new here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark nodded. \"We just arrived here this morning. You five looked like you had fun, so I thought maybe my brother...\", he pointed over to Katie. \"And me thought maybe we could join you girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five girls briefly looked over to Katie. \"He looks kinda cute\", said the only asian girl of the group. \"Get him over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark noticed that she licked her lips slightly. \"Love at first sight, eh?\", he thought and winked at Katie to call her over. The brown haired girl slid on the bench to make room for Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\", he smiled and took a seat. Katie was at the table before he had even sat down. The asian girl quickly made room for Katie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's best if we intoduce ourselves first\", suggested Mark. \"I'm Mary and this is my brother Katie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you two\", smiled the brown haired girl. \"I'm Andrea. The girl drooling over your brother is Kaori.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then pointed over to a blond girl. \"She's Heather, the nearly identical looking girl besides her is her twin Jessi. Don't worry, we have a hard time telling them apart as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark giggled slighty but kept being quiet and let her talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And last but not least, the firy red head there is Lilly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie smiled sheepishly. \"Nice to meet you ladies. What were you doing here anyways? You don't look old enough to drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaori smiled at Katie. \"That's right. We were just discussing what we should do. We thought about maybe sitting down on a fire at the beach. We just needed a good looking boy who plays guitar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea leaned over to Mark and whispered in his ear. \"We did not. We were thinking about what we should do but haven't come up with anything. Kaori just makes things up to flirt with your brother. Her ideas of a beach vacation mostly bases on surfing movies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\", replied Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed that Katie and Kaori have gotten up while Andrea corrected her friend for Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we waiting for?\", asked Kaori and pressed her dainty body against Katie's bigger frame. \"Let's go.\"</span></div></div>",

Each player is dealt an amount of cards that is to be determined by the group that is playing. Then you will take the remaining cards and place them in a deck in the center and take turns with one person flipping over the card where you will find that it has changed into a trait. How does the ordinary card change from a leftover card in the deck to a new card you might ask? Magic! After the trait has been revealed you may begin the fun part of the game, bidding on it. All players place one card from their hands face down and reveal all at once. The Player that has the highest card wins with the Highest card being an Ace and the lowest being a 2. The winner gets control over that trait for all the players until either the next game or when it is agreed upon to end the session at which point all players will return to normal. If two players bid with the same value card then it is a draw and they both gain control over the trait for the allotted time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As a few additional rules and notes. The minimum amount of time for a session is 48 hours with the maximum being forever. Reality will adjust so that people will not notice any difference unless the person in control of the trait wills it to be that way and the person they are changing consents to it. So a person with blonde hair will still be seen as a blonde unless it is made for people to see otherwise. Also if you feel you would want to play extra rounds just reshuffle the deck and deal out more cards but remember not to shuffle your winnings into the deck. Remember everything is reversible and everything can be changed so enjoy this marvelous deck. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright then kids now that we've had our recap the question is do we want to play our first game now or wait till we get to our first destination however far away that is.\" Mom said knowing what the answer would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Now!!!!\" the kids shouted in unison. They had been waiting all year in anticipation and weren't waiting any longer. The game was interesting in that you had power over the other members of the game for a few days but at the same time they would have power over you. Though if you were ever unlucky enough to no have a good game and wind up with no traits or only a silly trait like shoe color you could bet on being the guinea pig for that leg of the trip. That was Mark at one point in the trip while Erin had the power over height. He spent a good amount of time as a 3 foot midget while Erin made herself a 10 foot amazon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well then without further ado let the game begin.\" Mary said as she flipped the first card. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He frowned as he saw that his highest card was a queen and it was a poor hand overall with a jack, 9, 10, 6, and a 4 being his other cards. He decided that he probably wouldn't be winning this hand with the interest that Katie was showing so he played his 4. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright time to show.\" Mary said after everyone had played their card. She revealed an 7 while Erin showed a 2  not caring for her hair all to much and their dad Chris played a 5. Katie saw what they played and smiled as she revealed a 9. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figured I could scare you guys off. That means I get the first powers. I wonder what I can do with them.\" She said picking up the card and focusing on using her new found power. The card glowed in her hand and Mary gasped. Everyone turned to her as they watched her hair that she kept shot grow down to just below her shoulders. She turned and pulled some of it in front of her face as she inspected it before letting it fall back behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow I'm regretting not betting more on this one. I could have so much fun with hair that I would have to worry about.\" Mary said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let me test one more thing.\" Katie said as the card glowed again. This time Mary's now longer hair magically began to braid itself into two pig tails that would look cute on a 5 year old but strange on a grown woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this will be to much fun!\" Katie laughed. \"But I'll stop for now. Lets get started on the next round.\" She exclaimed as she flipped over the next card. </span></div></div>",

Bringing his hand up, he saw in place of his bland and boring nails were them now pink with tiny black hearts. Strangely, it seems they were manicured too. Taking off his shoes and socks he looked at his toes to see their nails also pink with hearts, matching his fingernails too.

The card was a pretty common power over on the trips and a fun one too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everyone only having 3  cards left, they were all dealt 3 more cards. Mark looked down at his cards like the rest of his family. He still had his jack, 9, and 10 from before, and have received a king, another 10, and a 7. Mark, now satisfied with having a good hand, put down his king in hopes of finally winning a round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody put down their cards, then flipped their cards.

He didn't say anything, but his red face showed what he was feeling. From what she was seeing, Erin was laughing her head off. Katie giggled as she took a red bra out of her luggage and handed to her dad, silently putting it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark then felt funny and felt tingles running through his whole torso, knowing it was his turn. The skin on his torso turned soft and smooth, the skin on his arms met a clear difference in the skin when reaching his shoulders. Speaking of his shoulders, they became less square and more round and prominent. His stomach caved in a bit and became tight and flat. He went from slouching in his seat to sitting straight as his back became arched making his butt and chest stick out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis whole torso lost mass making his arms and legs look freakishly huge. Finally, his nipples became puffy as flesh built up behind them into orbs. They grew and grew until they became full and juicy DD breast. Once the transformation was complete, Mark fell forward a bit at the weight of them. He dropped his cards faced down to hold his new appendages up that were unsupported under his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOM! HOW BIG ARE THESE, AND WHY?!\" Mark yelled at the top of his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Erin was in tears from what's going on, even Katie joined her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the looks of it, DD,\" Mary said nonchalantly, \"I just thought of something big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THESE ARE THE HEAVIEST THINGS I EVER CARRIED AND IT'S KILLING MY BACK!\" Mark still screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry dear, just try and deal with it, just hope something comes up in this game to get you a bra.\" Mary told him. \"You are way past my size, even Katie's for that matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark, not knowing what to say, just hung his head in defeat. Katie and Erin recovered from their fit not able to cry anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn bro, you're even more stacked than I will ever be.\" Katie said smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just start the next round.\" Mark muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n( Sorry for the long chapter lol ;) )<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was the card?</span></div></div>",

Katie flipped a 7 as Mary showed a 7 as well .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won this round bro.\" Katie told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark took the card and waited for the next round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you going to try it out?\" Katie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later, yeah.\" Mark grumbled, \"And can you change my nails back?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie giggled in response as Mary spoke up, \"I'll make them smaller, but let me make your torso more feminine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, sure.\" Mark said quite rudely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary made the changes,making Mark's waist significantly smaller and his hips just flaring out a little bit, giving him a hourglass shape. His DD breast shrank down to now just being D breast. Mark expecting them to be smaller, made the mistake of letting them go, to have fallen forward a bit like before. Mark groaned seeing what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really mom? Why can't you make them way smaller?\" Mark said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where's the fun in that?\" Mary said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding up his new breast again, he said, \"Let's just start the next round.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was the card?</span></div></div>",

Mark knew he had to win this one, but faltered when he looked at his hand seeing as his highest card was a jack. He put it down hoping somehow he would win, as the others also put their cards. The cards were flipped to reveal Mary's and Chris's as 9 and 8. Mark flipped his card, but groaned when he saw his sisters' cards. Both of the sisters' cards were both queens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally! Did you need this bro?\" Erin said mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark groaned, \" Please Katie! Help me out here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie was going to give him his much needed bra since she knew how it hurt, but Erin whispered something to her. Seeing as how they both power over the card, they would decide together. Hearing what Erin told her, Katie giggled and nodded. They both pointed at Mark changing his clothes. The family watched looking at Mark's new clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark wondered why they were all staring at him, his mom staring at with a cheerful smile, his sisters laughing to themselves, and his dad looking surprised. He did notice he didn't need to hold his heavy breasts up anymore and his back didn't hurt as much, but he felt heavy and felt something constricting his crotch and waist. Katie pointed at him signifying another change, this time he get weight on the back of his head. He got up to look in a mirror, but almost fell over when he was taller than normal and his feet were on their tippy toes. They felt like, heels? He looked down to see if it was heels, but couldn't getting a vision of white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw his new chest encased in a silky white material, feeling what he guessed was a corset under. Looking past it, he couldn't see his legs or feet, but a ridiculously long skirt reaching all the way to the floor and a large bow on his belly. Looking behind him, he saw a meter of the skirt laid out. He stumbled over to a mirror taking note of the lace white gloves he was wearing. What he saw made his jaw drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw himself standing in a silky wedding dress that hanged off his arms. Without seeing it, he knew he was wearing white lingerie and stockings.If he saw his legs, he knew it wouldn't be a pleasing sight. His arms would look right with the dress if it wasn't for the slight hair on them. He felt the dress snug on his torso, but breezy below his chest. He had so much makeup on his face that at a glance, he looked like a girl.

He sat down picking up his cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is too good.\" Erin said wiping tears from her eyes flipping over the next power card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is the next card?</span></div></div>",

You play a regular game of Uno, but each card you play allows you to conduct a swap. The type of swap depends on the color and type of card. Each player is handed 7 card where the game can begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwapping is just like the original poker rules, but the color of the card decides what kind of swap. For example if the card is red (body), it would be \u201cI want to swap hair with Mary.\u201d When a swap happens, a player can\u2019t swap back what was traded unless they use a reverse card, though only following the card\u2019s rule. A swap occurs between the current and next player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll changes made in the game is adjusted to reality so it\u2019s as if you were always like that. The players are the only one who remembers what changes. When age or gender is swapped, you are only perceived as your new trait and not physically changed. Each time someone get an Uno, they can choose any kind of swap that happens to use, or save it and change someone else\u2019s swap (following the card rules). Play until a person in last place is determined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTypes of Cards<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColors:<br>\r\nRed-Body<br>\r\nGreen-Clothing<br>\r\nYellow-Personal Info<br>\r\nBlue-Personality <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecial Cards:<br>\r\nReverse-Undo last swap and replace swap with a new one of the color of the card. Also reverses play order.<br>\r\nSkip-Skips the next player\u2019s turn and perform a swap according to color.<br>\r\nWild- When played the player can choose any kind of swap to happen with them self and the next player.<br>\r\nWild Draw 4-Probably the best card in the whole game. Not only can you choose what kind of swap happens, but you can choose any of the players to swap. It\u2019s not only 1 swap, but 4 too. The next player also draws 4 cards and loses their turn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow remember kids,\u201d their father Tom said, \u201cWe will play 1 game, and at each rest stop we go back to normal and play again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shuffled the cards and passed them out where he then placed the starting card in the middle of the table. The card was a yellow 7, a personal info card, or in short, life card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince Erin started last time, why don\u2019t you start this honey?\u201d Mary told Mark as she took a seat next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark nodded and looked over the seating. On his left across the table was Katie across the table and on his right was his mom who finished getting comfortable in her seat. They usually played in a counter-clockwise circle, realizing he would be switching with his mom first. He gulped at the thought. It wasn\u2019t that he was afraid of having a woman\u2019s parts, he got used to it thanks to his sisters. It\u2019s just that the fact she was his mom made it a little awkward.

His hand was sore from signing autographs, and his throat was sore from yelling and the multitude of voices he'd put on to entertain his fans. Having only a small fanbase, Ben could've sworn hehas met all of his fans in the first day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was currently headed to the hotel room currently occupied by one of his friends, Chris, for their annual game of Vidcon poker, as they had dubbed it. It was not, however, any ordinary game of poker. The cards they played with allowed players to swap traits, and have reality be altered to fit, as if things had always been like that. They'd always play one game after the first day, then another before the last, so they could all swap back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was a little nervous this year. Sure, last time he had ended up attending Vidcon with an almost completely female body, but that wasn't what bothered him. What really worried him was that this year, his girlfriend, Jessica, had been let in on the whole thing, and would be playing alongside the rest of them. Sure, it was her choice, but it didn't stop him from worrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of them arrived at Chris's room, Ben knocked on the door, looking down at his shoes. He was wearing the same outfit he wore in most of his videos; a green t-shirt under a black zip-hoodie, unzipped, blue jeans, and white sneakers. He was also wearing what fans had dubbed his signature items; two silver necklaces, one with a turtle shaped pendant, the other with pendant shaped like the symbol for the zodiac sign, Cancer, and a NeoCube, threaded out into a band 6x36 and worn around my left wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen's random examining of himself was interrupted when the door he and Jessica were standing infront of opened, revealing Chris's smiling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are! You're the last ones here,\" he said, laughing to himself, \"Come on in, then we can start.\" He headed back to the table where the others were, as Ben led Jessica inside and closed the door behind them. After looking down, and then back up again, Ben had to move some of his shoulder length, dirty-blonde hair back behind his ears. When Jessica first found out about the cards, she asked whether he had gotten his longer-than-average hair through a swap that he decided to keep. That was far from the truth of course; Ben had simply had his hair around shoulder length since high school. They took the two empty seats at the table. As Chris shuffled the cards, Ben took the time to examine the people he'd be playing with tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the same group as usual, but Ben couldn't help but notice that even with the addition of his girlfriend, everyone at the table was a Youtuber partner, but they all made different kinds of videos. Ben considered himself a bit of an all rounder, doing let's plays, paridy songs, and vlogs. Despite this variety, he had yet to become popular, and doubted he ever would, but after today, he was content with a small fanbase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his right sat Chris, known online as Darth Chipmunk, who's Youtube career consisted mainly of making flash animations that looked like a game, but actually weren't. He had short brown hair, tanned skin, and while he wasn't too bulked up, you could definately see a differance between him and Ben's scrawny frame. He was currently wearing a black t-shirt with a logo from one of his videos on it, white shorts, and black sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the right of Chris sat Alice, a.k.a. Rainbow Slash. Her videos consisted mainly of humerous skits, as well as a few videos where she'd answer questions fans had asked. She had long black hair with a few neon pink streaks in it, and was wearing a black jacket over a My Little Pony t-shirt, a black skirt that went just below her knees, and black boots with a small heel. The t-shirt looked out of place with the rest of the outfit, but that was one of the reasons she stood out so much in a crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her right sat Rachel, known as Snow by both her fans and us. She didn't do much for her own channel aside from recording things in slow motion, but she often appeared in the rest of the group's videos. She has shoulder length hair, dyed to be a silver-ish colour, and rather pale skin. She was wearing a grey hoodie, some tight-fitting jeans, and a pair of black ballet flats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow was sort of staring at the person sitting next to her, Sam. His real name was Sang, but he preferred Sam, and was known online as Chopstick Ninja. He mostly did game reviews, but also let's played a few games like Starcraft. He had spiked black hair, slightly tanned skin, and pretty thin eyes. He was wearing a plaid scarf, a red woolen jumper, black cargo pants, and black sneakers. At least, they looked like sneakers; they were probably actually his heelies, shoes with wheels in the heels. Snow was staring at him because he had his head down on the table, and was supposedly sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd lastly, sitting on Sam's left and Ben's right was Ben's girlfriend, Jessica, known by both her and her boyfriend's fans as Squishy. She mostly did vlogs, but also appeared a lot in videos made by the rest of the group. She had long blonde hair, and was wearing a blue floral print dress that went just below her knees, and a pair of 2 inch white heels. She also had a bit of make-up on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris got out the cards and said, \"Hey Sam! We're starting!\" He threw the box at Sam, which woke him up. Ben noticed Sam was wearing his glasses, which he needed in order to read without getting a headache. \"So Jess, did Ben explain the rules?\" Ben facepalmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew I was forgetting something!\" Ben said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow smirked at him and said, \"Wow, with a memory like that, it's a wonder you even remember to post videos on your channel.\" Everyone laugh, Ben included, as they all knew he often forgot to record or upload videos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK then,\" Chris started, \"Here's how it works...\"</span></div></div>",

The traits can be anything you can name. The traits are not equal in worth, some are more worth than others. A list can be found below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game will be played like a normal poker game, you bet and the one with the best hand wins. The winner can choose to either swap his traits with those in the pot or swap these with the other players. You can't swap back traits you had when you began the game. It is possible to win and lose other traits throughout the game. For example it is possible that Henry get's a vagina, loses it and wins the same again during the game. He can't swap his own penis back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwapping ages or genders does not change you physical. People just think of you that you're that old or the opposite gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't matter what you bet, it is possible that there are several of the same trait in the pot. It's not possible to swap a hand for a foot or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the start of every hand, two people have to place a pot. The person dealing has to give in traits worth 1 points, the person right to him/her has to give traits worth 2 point. That then circules clockwise the next hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen someone set bets, the other players have to bet equal or more points to continue playing, e.g. Andrea has a bets traits worth 4 points, then the other will have to bet traits worth 4 or more points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReality adjusts to the swaps. It is only possible to leave the game table in between hands not when the game is played.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll swaps can be reversed any time after three days when all players gather, put their hands on the card box and saying a magical formula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrait - Points<br>\r\nSmall body parts (e.g hands, feet, lips... etc) - 1 Point<br>\r\nSmall Possessions (e.g. jewelry, single books, single dvds) - 1 Point<br>\r\nOne clothing article - 1 Point<br>\r\nPersonal Infos (e.g. Age, name... etc) - 1 Point<br>\r\nLarger body parts (e.g. torso, legs, face... etc) - 2 Points<br>\r\n'Medium' Posessions (e.g. small personal library, DVD collections) - 2 points<br>\r\nSkills - 2 Points<br>\r\nMale/ Female body parts - 3 Points<br>\r\nMajor posessions (e.g. cars, houses) - 3 Points<br>\r\nGender - 3 Points<br>\r\nPersonality changes - 4 Points<br>\r\nWhole Outfit - 4 Points<br>\r\nLife - 5 Points</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You understand all that?\" Chris asked. \"The point list is here if you need it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I understood it,\" Jess replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty then, HERE COME THE CARDS!\" Chris said in an overly dramatic way.</span></div></div>",

Then I bet my volleyball skills.\u201d A volleyball revealed itself next to her. Reading the list, Jess decided on a skill to make sure she didn\u2019t bet something too big that she didn\u2019t understand about. She does play regularly which keeps her fit, but she doesnt think she\u2019ll need it anytime soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam frowned at his cards, \u201cI got nothing, I fold.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow on the other hand seemed satisfied, \u201cI bet my age and pants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Alice betted with an impressive poker face, \u201cI bet my hair and lips.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see what everyone has!\u201d Chris said excitedly showing his hand.\u201d I\u2019m going to be honest here, I wasn\u2019t expecting to win.\u201d He chuckled showing his hand composed of nothing. Ben smiled at his friend. This was just like him to just want to play the game, considering he was the one who bought it. Chris brought it to their first Vidcon together after he found it on the ground during a walk. His adventurous and easygoing attitude made it where he barely had any complaints to any change he received.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSecond to that, I ain\u2019t winning this.\u201d Ben agreed exposing his one pair of 4\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow cheerfully showed off her trio of jacks, \u201cSo you\u2019re saying I have a chance?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfraid not Rach, not with these babies.\u201d Alice slyly revealed her straight. \u201cI think I won this one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave I been forgotten already, because if I recall, a flush beats all of yours.\u201d Jess smirked showing her party of clubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice looked with disbelief before smiling, \u201cNot bad rookie, I get you next time.\u201d Where there was Chris who didn\u2019t try too much in the game, Alice was the complete opposite. She always was looking to win, especially one with magical properties. Suddenly, all the holograms floated to Jess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlustered, Jess asked, \u201cSo how do I do this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimple. It\u2019s like click and drag on a computer, except just with your hands.\u201d Sam explained. Jess nodded in understanding before hesitantly picking her boyfriend\u2019s YouTube name. She put it next to herself to see nothing change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did nothing happen?\u201d She questioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s a name. Nothing physical can be seen.\u201d Snow said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...\u201d Jess said embarrassed reaching for the name. When she tried to move it, she found it only stayed right in its place. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I move it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris eyes widened in realization before explaing, \u201cOh yeah, forgot to mention. Once you assign a bet, it can\u2019t be changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you go forgetting again.\u201d Snow deadpanned. \u201cSo remember, we\u2019re stuck with whatever changes happen unless it\u2019s switched with another until we revert the changes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam chuckled as he spoke, \u201cAnd Ben here will be called Squishy by everyone here at the event. They all shared a chuckle at the silly change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking of a joke, Alice turned to Jess, \u201cNow, if you want to see a real change, why don\u2019t you swap my hair with Ben\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen eyes widened before trying to stop Jess, \u201cNO WAIT DON\u2019T-\u201c but it was already too late as he felt hair tickling his neck. Ben now had a cute hair style that framed his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely styling this.\u201d Alice said taking her new dirty hair in her hands. \u201cEspecially after you cut my nails when you had my hands last time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked down sad, \u201cI said I was sorry...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow waved it off, \u201cIt\u2019s fine Jess, none of us hold anything to anyone, except Alice. Just have fun with the game.\u201d Jess smiled and nodded before taking action with the rest of the pot. She gave Chris\u2019 sneakers to Snow while giving her age and pants to Sam. She gave Alice\u2019s lips back and kept her volleyball skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so bad I\u2019m 20 again, at least you can legally drink now Snow. Though these jeans are really tight.\u201d Sam thought aloud as he fidgeted with his new pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you guys think my feet look cute in these?\u201d Chris joked showing off his new flats. They all laughed as Ben dealt the cards next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s keep this game interesting...\u201d he said looking at his new hand.</span></div></div>",

It's basically Go Fish, BUT,\" he put heavy emphasis on 'but', stretching it out, \"When you make a pair, you can switch something with the person you got the card from. When you get rid of your hand, you can choose to swap something between two other people who still have cards, or you can wait a while and make someone's choice of swap for them. The last person to get rid of their hand, not counting the person who is left with cards, won't get to do this because there won't be enough people left with cards. If you take longer than two kinutes to decide what you're gonna swap, something random will be swapped. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, pretty much,\" Jessica replied, trying to focus on the words rather than the elaborate hand gestures. \"It's basically Go Fish, but with swaps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\"  Alice randomly burst forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why do you call it swap poker rather than swap go fish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds better.\" Jessica had nothing to say to that, and just nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should probably explain how you initiate the swaps,\" Sam said. Chris made a face as if he was internally facepalming for not explaining those. Sam continued, \"When you want to swap, you say 'I want to swap X'. If you choose to swap two other people, you say, 'I want Y and Y to swap X'. to choose to wait and alter someone else's swap, you say, 'I will wait to swap'. When chaning someone else's swap, you say, 'I change Y's swap to X'. In all of these, X is a thing to swap and Y is a person, understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, let's do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Righty-o,\" Chris said rather loudly, as he began shuffling the cards. \"We usually play three hands, and we go anti-clockwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why anti-clockwise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen answered this time, \"Because we can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris dealt out 5 cards to each person then stuck the rest of the cards in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice started, \"Oh, lucky me, a pair right off the bat.\" She put a pair of twos on the table. \"Let's see... Jess, do you have any Jacks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica shook her head. \"Go fish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Alice had picked up a card, Snow looked slyly at Ben, who had a terrible Poker face by the way, and said, \"Ben, do you have any sevens?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen tossed a seven of hearts across the table, saying, \"Why must my lucky number betray me so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting down her pair of sevens, Snow said, \"I want to swap...</span></div></div>",

Philly always had really good flea markets, because of all the unique, crazy, and just plain weird people who lived there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI should probably give some backstory.

He was quiet, but when he talked he always said something funny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott was the maniac of the group; he never thought before he acted, and was a total party animal. He had dark black hair and a bunch of tattoos, with ever-present stubble on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler was a ladie's man; he always picked up girls, and was a handsome guy, so it wasn't any surprise there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle was my on-again off-again lover. We both liked each other, but she always said she was waiting until after college to start a relationship. A curvy brunette, I planned to ask her out the minute we graduated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie was a petite girl who always wore sweaters that were way too big on her. She was a total hipster, always taking pictures of everything, and had pretty much been in charge of decorating our house, since none of us really cared much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaitlyn was adventurous and easygoing, and very funny. We were good friends despite not talking very often, save for the nights when we stayed up late smoking pot and having deep conversations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristen was a shy girl who only really talked to Isaac. I didn't know much about her, but she seemed nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler found a deck of cards and asked the person how much it was. The man smiled and said, \"For you, free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only later that we realized this wasn't a normal deck of cards</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The participants play a normal poker hand but without betting. The one who wins the hand can swap anything he wants from the other players simply by saying the words \"I want to swap ... with ... \". What you swap can be anything but it is not allowed to swap everything at once. For example you can swap heads with someone but you cannot swap the whole body in one hand.<br>\r\nWhen a swap took place nobody except the ones playing at the moment will notice anything strange, reality will alter so that it was always that way.<br>\r\nThe words for a swap have to be spoken within a time frame of two minutes. If not, a random swap between the winner and one of the losers takes place.<br>\r\nA swap which took place cannot be reverted by the person's who participated in the swap within 48 hours. For example if Michael swaps hair with Anna neither Michale nor Anna can swap their rightful hair back before 48 hours have passed but it is possible for someone other to swap hair with the two of them.<br>\r\nIt is also not possible to swap something back you had before within 48 hours. For example: Michael now has Anna's hair, Anna has Michael's. Josie wins the hand and swaps hair with Michael so she gets Anna's hair. Michael now has Josie's hair. It would be possible for Anna to swap hair with Michael so she would get Josie's hair but it is not possible for her to swap hair with Josie in order to get her own hair back.<br>\r\nClothes adjust when someone swaps clothing or if some other physical aspect is swapped which would not fit with the clothes currently worn. For example if someone swaps height with some his clothes adjust to his sight so they fit just like the clothes before fit.<br>\r\nThe swaps are not limited to physical appearance. It is possible to swap lives or personal information. If someone decides to swap lives he exchanges places with the person he swaps but keeps his body, clothes and first name. Family, friends and gender get swapped. It is possible as well to swap tastes, personality, connections to persons (e.g. Michael could swap being the son of Jeremy's mother. He would still live his own life, in his own house with his parents and sisters but he would be the son of Jeremy's mother).<br>\r\nIf someone quits playing the game while the others continue, the person will only notice the swaps prior quitting the game. Every swap which takes place afterwards will be completely unnoticed by the person. Also it is impossible to tell someone who not participated what has been swapped, because every information regarding a swap cannot be heard by someone who did not participate. For example: Michael tells his mother that he swapped hair with his sister. For Michaels mother he will have not said anything. Not even his lips moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter explaining the rules you guys start and who wins.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rules are as following. (Copied from the teacher branch)<br>\r\nYou play a normal round of poker but instead of betting money, you bet traits of yourself. The traits can be anything you can name. The traits are not equal in worth, some are more worth than others. A list can be found below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game will be played like a normal poker game, you bet and the one with the best hand wins. The winner can choose to either swap his traits with those in the pot or swap these with the other players. You can't swap back traits you had when you began the game. It is possible to win and lose other traits throughout the game. For example it is possible that Mark get's red hair, loses it and wins the same again during the game. He can't swap his own hair back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwapping ages or genders does not change you physical. People just think of you that you're that old or the opposite gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't matter what you bet, it is possible that there are several of the same trait in the pot. It's not possible to swap a hand for a foot or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the start of every hand, two people have to place a pot. The person dealing has to give in traits worth 1 points, the person right to him/her has to give traits worth 2 point. That then circules clockwise the next hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen someone set bets, the other players have to bet equal or more points to continue playing, e.g. Katie has a bets traits worth 4 points, then the other will have to bet traits worth 4 or more points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReality adjusts to the swaps. It is only possible to leave the game table in between hands not when the game is played.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll swaps can be reversed any time after two days when all players gather, put their hands on the card box and saying a magical formula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrait - Points<br>\r\nSmall body parts (e.g hands, feet, lips... etc) - 1 Point<br>\r\nSmall Possessions (e.g. jewelry, single books, single dvds) - 1 Point<br>\r\nOne clothing article - 1 Point<br>\r\nPersonal Infos (e.g. Age, name... etc) - 2 Point<br>\r\nLarger body parts (e.g. torso, legs, face... etc) - 2 Points<br>\r\n'Medium' Posessions (e.g. small personal library, DVD collections) - 2 points<br>\r\nSkills - 2 Points<br>\r\nMale/ Female body parts - 3 Points<br>\r\nMajor posessions (e.g. cars, houses, all of one article of clothing) - 3 Points<br>\r\nGender - 3 Points<br>\r\nPersonality changes - 4 Points<br>\r\nWhole Outfit - 4 Points<br>\r\nLife - 5 Points<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I am going remind everyone here that this is only for fun and to get used to how other people live.\" Cindy reminded the group.  \"I am going to play along with you guys so that I am aware of the swaps and so that I will be able to keep an eye out for any misbehaving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know Mom\" said Anna \"And you have no problem locking the cards away if we misuse them, leaving us the way we are for a certain amount of time.  We have heard this before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and I say we do this for 1 week this time, how do you guys feel about that?\" Cindy asked the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mrs. Ferguson.\" replied the group with a somewhat monotonous voice.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Alright, Micheal, since it's your birthday, how about you start off the night.\" announced Cindy with great fanfare that she only heard in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I will bet my feet\" Micheal announced with a pair of his feet floating above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"2 points\" Melody mumbled to herself, \"I bet my name.\" With the bet made, a name tag with her name was floating above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet my driving skills,\" Jeremy announced as a car was literally parked above his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am out\" Anna announced, which was unusual for her because she usually went gung ho with this game. \"I didn't have anything, I hope that will turn around in the next couple hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet my hands and my gender\" Cindy said while trying to keep a decent poker face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Josie said to herself, 'I really don't have anything good, but I really want to start the night off with a bang.  I might be able to bluff my way through things like I did last time.' she thought. \"Okay, I bet all of my pants and my earrings.\" She finally stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicheal groaned as he thought of what he could do. \"I am going to bet my chest. Since it is considered to be a body part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am out\" stated Melody, \"This is getting too much for me.\"  As she put her cards down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" announced Jeremy as he followed his sister's movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you two lets see what you have.\" Cindy said as she watched their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only have a pair of Jacks\" Josie said as she blushed slightly while looking at Micheal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't beat my 3 tens\" Micheal said amused and getting ready to deal out the loot to the losers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa there, that certainly doesn't beat my 3 nines,\" Cindy chimed in,\"But don't worry honey, I am sure you will win next time.\" As she tried to cheer up her son.<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Jeremy you can keep your driving skills and you can have Josie's pants too.  Melody, I know you try to be around the bigger kids for some reason that you don't want to discuss right now, so I am going to give your name to Micheal and he can have my gender while I am at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, wait...\" Micheal said abruptly. \"You grabbed the wrong item and accidentally gave my chest to Melody.\" But it was too late, Micheal now had the underdeveloped chest of a 13 year old girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, here is her name and I will take Josie's earrings too. Now what to do with my hands. Anna, I think you should feel the love that is going around too.\"  With that said she now sported Anna's manicured hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that is not how I wanted to start the evening\" announced Melody (Micheal)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets start the next hand\" Anna said as she grabbed the cards with her now older hands.</span></div></div>",

He had to make this right, with that he looked down at his cards and thought that he could make it work with the cards he had.  'I will need to bluff a little bit to do it, but I think I can do it.'  He was snapped out of his train of thought when he heard the game begin with Josie announcing her bet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet my shirt.\"  She announced as the hologram appeared over her head to signify the game had accepted her bet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's see if we can turn this night around, I bet my arms.\"  He said as he looked down at his cards to signify that he had this to the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I bet my hair and all my underwear.\"  Melody announced fairly confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm out.\" Jeremy announced as he laid down his cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are always a fuddy duddy and you need to learn to live a little.\"  Melody said as she looked over at her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Jeremy, I think you need to listen to her.\"  Anna said as she looked down.  \"I bet my legs and makeup.  I only bet the last part to make up points.\"  She said with a grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have anything to stand up to this, I'm out to.\"  Cindy announced as she too put her cards down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too\"  Josie announced as she put hers down too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I just need 2 points to stay in.\"  Michael needed to make sure that he had the cards to stay in the game.  '3 Queens, I know I can win with that.'  He thought to himself as he announced his bet to the group. \"I bet my Height.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody and Anna both checked and they laid down their cards. Anna had 2 pair and she was happy about that. \"Sorry to burst your bubble\"  Michael said as he laid down his cards to show the group the 3 queens he had hidden in his hands. \"Now that I won...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so.\" Melody proudly announced as she laid down her cards, \"I have all hearts.\"  Michael was taken aback and didn't know what to say.  He certainly thought he would win this round. \"So all I have to do is grab the items and give them to the person that I want to give it to?\"  She wondered as she never won a round herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy nodded as she said \"Yes, it's like a click and drop on a computer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you do...\"  Anna said abruptly as she leaned over to Melody.  After about 20 seconds, she started to deal out the \"riches\" to the players.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josie you can give your shirt to Jeremy.\"  Melody said as she brought the piece of clothing over to her brother's name.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy looked down and saw Josie's Green shirt now on his chest.  \"At least it's not Anna's shirt.\"  He said laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...  Michael, since you have my chest you can have my underwear too and my hair too, but I want something in return.  I know your height will be neat to try for a while.\"  She said and Michael was in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this is weird, everything looks taller all of a sudden and at least my hair is tied back like yours was.\"  Michael said as he felt his body around and felt the fabric constraining his chest and saw that it was pink.  \"Wow, pink?  Didn't think you had it in you Melody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody blushed as she looked down at Michael.  \"What about my legs and makeup?\"  Anna asked as she looked at Melody<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, who do you want to give them to?\"  Melody asked as she didn't really know what to do with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I want my legs back and you can give the makeup to Michael since he is going down that road anyway.\"  Anna said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I will give your legs back and give the makeup to Michael\"  Melody said as she dragged the items to their respective new owners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!?\"  Michael said as he looked in a mirror to see Anna's pinks and purples on his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I need to lock the cards away?\" Cindy wondered as she got the cards ready for another round?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's just a little weird right now for me.\"  Michael said as he calmed down and got ready for another hand.</span></div></div>",

As for your arms, I think I will give them to myself.  I mean, I am mostly you anyway and I don't think anybody else would have wanted them.\"  Melody said as she gave herself the arms of Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you could have given them to Jeremy, that way I could have had something masculine.\"  Michael pointed out as he looked at his cards. 'I might just be able to win this one' he thought to himself,' but in order to do so, I would need to bluff a little bit.'  Indeed he would have to bluff a little more to get a win for himself. \"Alright, Melody, it's your turn to start it all off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, hmm... I bet my age.\"  She said as a holographic number 13 appeared above her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy looked down at his cards and wondered if he had a chance.  He never was really good at bluffing and decided to fold. \"I don't have anything good this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna looked at her cards and made her bet. \"I bet my face and hmm... my makeup skills, while I am at it.  I don't really need it right now.\"  She said this while looking at Michael with a grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I have to put in 4 points...\"  Cindy said as she began to look at her cards to make sure that they were worth it.  \" I think I will put in my favorite color and my taste in movies.\"  With the bet placed, a pointer on a color wheel pointed to the purple and some Rom-Com movies appeared over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael was surprised to see the pot now.  \"So in order to call, I have to put in 5 points worth of something.\"  Michael said to himself as he looked around to see Josie, Melody and his Mom nodding in agreement.  \"Okay, I bet my current outfit with...  my eyes.\"  He said and looked over to Josie to see if she would join in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is too much and I fold.\"  She announced as she placed her cards face down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I think I will call with all of my pants.\"  Melody announced with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't think I like that grin' Michael thought as he looked down at his cards again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I call with my earrings.\" Anna announced, \"That's everyone, so lets show what we have.\"  Melody laid down and showed that she had a 3 of a kind of 4's.  Cindy had 2 pairs and then looked to Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael looked down and saw that he might win. \"Looks good Melody, but it won't beat my 3 of a kind of 5's.\"  Michael just had to beat Anna's hand and he waited with great anticipation to see what she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that is a nice hand Michael, but I have a full house with 9's and Queens.\"  Anna laughed as she looked at the bounty of traits to give to people.  \"Melody you can have Cindy's favorite color.  Michael you can have Melody's pants and while you have those, you might as well have her age too since you are her former size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael looked down to see that his jeans had morphed into Melody's pink shorts.  He sighed as he looked back to Anna to see what else she had in store for him.  \"Michael, since you have my makeup, you should get my skills and my face too, I think it will look alot better.\"  Michael saw his face starting back at him but not making the same facial movements.  \"So we still have the taste in movies, my earrings, and Michael's outfit.  Mom, you can keep your taste in movies.  Michael you can have my earrings, but I think I will take your outfit.\"  Anna then looked over to see Michael wearing her former outfit of a white skirt with black stripes and also the pink top with spaghetti straps and he was also wearing her black ballet flats too.  Michael also brought his hands up to his ears to feel the damage too.  He felt what he knew he had, double piercings in each ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, we have 2 more hands and then I have a surprise for you guys.\"  Cindy announced as she saw the wonder in all the faces grow exponentially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell us now Mrs. Ferguson, so that we can know if we need to make any swaps.\"  Melody said as she looked over to Cindy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, alright.  After the games are over, I decided to take all of you guys to the local water park for some fun.  Since it's not even noon yet, we can still have a little bit of fun.\"  She announced and saw everyone except for Michael, become super happy with the announcement.  \"What's wrong Michael?\"  Cindy wondered as she looked over at her son<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, right now, as I am, I will have to swim with a shirt on or wear a female suit, right?\" He wondered to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you have my gender and are considered a 13 year old girl with a name of Melody.\"  She said back to him.  \"Why do you want to do something else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I will make due.\"  He said with a grin as they got ready for the next hand.</span></div></div>",

My School knowledge so far.\"  Everybody knew that he took a lot of advanced subjects in school and since it was now summer, he wouldn't really need it until School started back in August.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody looked down and decided that this was too much for her. \"I don't have anything\" and she placed her cards face down and folded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm out too, this is getting too much for me too.\" Jeremy stated as he quickly folded too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will put in my voice.\"  Anna stated as she tried to stay in the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is getting too much for me too, I fold\"  Cindy announced as she folder her cards too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I will bring it up a notch and bet my Girliness too.\"  Josie bet as a pink unicorn appeared above her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm out.\"  Michael and Anna said as they both folded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that is how you bluff,\" Josie said as she showed her cards with a Jack high. \"I am going to keep my Girliness and my genitals for right now, I don't want to give that up.

And Michael, your School knowledge can go to...\"  She grabbed his knowledge and did a quick roulette around the table and let it go randomly so that she didn't know where it would land. \"Who got it?\"  she wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody was extremely happy, \"I did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael didn't know anything past the 8th grade, it tried to remember Trigonometry and Calculus, but it didn't come to him.  'Atleast this is only for a week, hopefully.\"  He thought to himself. \"Alright one last hand.\"  Michael proclaimed as Cindy dealt out the cards</span></div></div>",

Melody on the other hand was actually liking the changes and wanted to try some other things too.  \"Anna, I do believe it's your turn to deal this final round\" Cindy said as she handed her the cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, ladies and gentlemen, here goes the last hand.\"  Anna told the group but was mostly looking at Melody and Michael.  Everyone gathered up their cards and glanced at them, Melody, Michael and Josie were pleased with their hands and were ready to get the ball rolling. \"I bet my name,\"  Anna announced and a holographic name tag appeared once again above her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy glanced down at her cards. \"I bet all my shirts and my hair.\" she announced as her hairstyle and a clothing rack full of shirts appeared above her head.  She appeared to be very confident with her decision and her cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy also seemed to be confident upon looking at his hand or rather Anna's hands, that is.  \"I bet these hands and my skin too\" He started to bet and then thought 'I don't think that will be too bad, I hope.'  \"And lastly, hmm...  I bet my entire Manga collection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy was perplexed, \"What is manga?\" she wondered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael then answered in terms that he knew she would understand. \"It's a collection of Graphic Novels mostly from Japan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it might be an interesting read.\" She said to herself as she waited for her new daughter to place the next bets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am going to do this next round of bets to help myself until we switch back to normal.\"  He said to the group, \"I bet all of my leg wear, that includes pants and shorts.  Also my body hair and while I am at it I bet my genitals too.\"  Josie and Jeremy were shocked for this revelation.  They didn't expect for him to go this far, but he must have a really good hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you must have a decent hand, huh, 'Melody'?  To go along with that I will bet all of my shirts and my Life too.\"  Josie said as everyone else seemed to be shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it's my turn now,\"  Melody said, \"I bet my girlyness, all my DVDs, and I guess to round things out, I bet my Feminine skills too.\"  With these bets placed, a pink horse riding a rainbow appeared over a collection of DVDs and also a list of items the group wasn't able to make out. With that Jeremy, Anna and Cindy all folded and didn't want to place anything else on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\" Michael wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if I hope it works like it should, then it will help you when you are female down below.\"  Melody confidently said as she pointed to his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, your confident that your going to win aren't you?\"  Michael said to her as he showed them his set of cards.  \"Read it and weep.  I have a flush of all Diamonds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice, nice, but I don't think it will beat my 4 Queens,\"  Josie said as she got ready to deal out the goods, or so she thought. \"Can you beat that Melody?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, I think I can.\"  She said confidently as laid down her cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck, how did you pull that off?\"  Michael wondered as he saw what Melody had.  She had a straight flush 6 - 10 of clubs.  As she laid down her hand, all the traits that everyone bet slowly drifted toward Melody so that she can hand them out to the people she saw fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, lets hurry up and deal out the pile of stuff so that we can get to the water park.\"  Anna said somewhat miffed that she didn't get a good hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go\" Melody announced as she started to hand out the traits. \"My dear brother, you can have Mrs. Ferguson's shirts and hair, but you might want to say good bye to your Manga collection.  Josie, I hope you enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josie, I want those to come back the same condition that they arrived in.\"  Jeremy said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeremy, you can have Anna's name too, but she can have your skin for compensation.\"  Melody announced as she saw her brother's dry and somewhat oily skin become smooth and supple. \"Josie, you can keep your life, I don't think anyone else want to live it right now anyway.  Michael, I will give your body hair to Anna but I will take your genitals and all your leg wear so that I can be comfortable for the time we are like this.  As for Anna's hands, you can have those too, as well as my girlyness, female skills, I think you will need those.  And why not have my DVD collection and Josie's Shirts too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael know it was inevitable and a matter of time he would turn out like this.  Unlike last time, he had to deal with being 'female' for a week and had to use the women's restroom.  Now he had a smooth body to go with everything else. \"At least now, I can go look at all those nice dresses we see at the mal...  What am I saying?\"  Michael wondered as he put his hands up to his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought that's what would happen.\"  Josie said with a smirk at her diminutive boyfriend.  \"Don't worry, we will fully explore your new feminine side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that will have to wait for after we get back from the water park.  Everyone go home and get your suits and meet back here in an hour.\" Cindy said as she gathered up the cards and put them up for the next time.</span></div></div>",

As she walked up the stairs, she couldn't help but notice how much bigger everything seemed.  She walked up to his door and noticed that the knob now came up to his chest. She opened the door to see if anything else changed.  He looked around and noticed that several things have changed. Firstly, there were more purples than she remembered and she noticed a couple more DVDs that the had originally.  She then went over to see what kind of lame movies Melody had and were now his.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I have to give him credit.  She has a nice taste in movies.\"  Melody commented to herself.  She noticed that there were several super hero movies that she enjoyed to watch and alot of older comedies too.  \"I think I need to start hanging out more often. Now let me check out my clothes and see what I am in for.\"  She made his way over to the dresser and looked inside to see an array of panties and bras. \"What the heck.\"  He said as he pulled out a couple of Dr. Who bras and also a R2D2 one too.  \"She is awesome. I better get my swimsuit ready and make my way down stairs so that I won't be left behind.\"  After some looking around she was able to find her swimsuit and then she found it in a drawer to the left of the underwear.  It was a 2 piece purple number but had a halter top style. \"This is sooo cute.\"  Melody sighed as she found out what was coming out of her mouth.  She then started to undress in order to get the suit on and also to check out how she now looks.  She stripped down and made her way over to the full length mirror that she found hanging on the closet door and marveled how everything combined together.  She now had brown hair that flowed down to her mid back, her sister's face with noticeable makeup, small but noticeable breasts that were on their way to the B cup range, nice arms tipped with her sister's hands and just now noticed that she now had pink nail polish.  \"I must have got that with the makeup transfer.\"  She said to herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melody, we need to start getting ready you will have plenty of time to check yourself out until we play again.\"  Her mother informed her through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, mom, let me get my stuff on and I will meet you down stairs.\"  She said with her Josie's voice.  'I guess everything else will have to wait for later on.'  she thought to herself as she quickly got dressed in the swimsuit and a pair of pink shorts and a light purple tank top.  She then made her way down stairs to see that mostly everybody had arrived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are just waiting on Josie and then we can get in the van and make our way there.\"  Cindy said as she was busy packing towels and sunscreen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Michael,\"  Melody said and thought it weird that she was using her old name. \"I didn't know that you were into all comic and sci-fi stuff too.  Josie is into certain things, but I have to drag her to see the Superhero movies that are coming out these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I see that you found my DVD collection.\"  Michael said.  \"If you want, I don't mind going with you to see movies.  Oh, did you like the Dr. Who underwear that I have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody blushed as she heard this.  \"Yeah, how did you get into that stuff?\"  she wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it was my brother.  I saw him watching it one day and I was hooked.\"  He started saying. \"The story lines are really interesting and the underlying plots are about peace and love.\" The two of them continued to talk about their favorite shows and what shows they need to check out in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Micheal and Melody are you two coming or what?\"  Anna wondered as he was holding the door open for Cindy who was carrying out some supplies.  He had his blonde hair up in a pony tail to keep it out of his face and in an attempt to keep cool at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry.\"  Melody replied as she and Michael make their way to the van and found seats in the back with Josie.  Of course Melody would sit in the middle while Josie and Michael were on either side of her.</span></div></div>",

They talked about the latest games that they wanted to play, any upcoming movies that they wanted to see, an even some comic that looked interesting.  \"You know I have to admit, I thought you would be a girly girl and not like any of this stuff.\"  Melody said to Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I liked to wear certain dresses and skirts, but when it comes to other aspects, like make up and shopping, I am not that into it.  But you should know that now that you have my girlyness.\"  He said to Melody.  Deep down she knew he was right.  She could feel that the pink fru-fru dresses turned out to be really dumb she thought.  They continued to talk about other things and Melody could sense that Josie was starting to feel left out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Josie,\" Melody wondered. \"You've been quiet most of the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I really couldn't talk anyhow, with the two of you talking about Dr. Who, Video games, and comics.\"  Josie answered back.  \"Perhaps tonight, you can introduce me to some of those things.\"  She was clearly trying to get interest the both of them realized, well, it was either that she was getting tired of being left out of the conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want, I have the new DVDs, if you want to try them out and watch them with me you can.  Perhaps tonight or tomorrow.\" Melody suggested.  \"I should have them for a couple days at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I would really like that.\"  She said looking at Melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, We're here.\"  Cindy announced as they pulled into a half deserted parking lot.  \"And still a little early.\" They soon found a parking space, it was fairly close to the gates and they soon were out of the vehicle.  \"So, here is the sun screen and I don't want you guys to return the traits back sun burned.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone soon agreed and Melody needed help putting sunscreen on her back and noticed that Josie was busy helping Anna putting sunscreen on her back.  \"Michael do you mind helping me?  I mean, Josie is busy and I mostly have your body anyway.\" Melody wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure not a problem, since I have your height, I won't have to try too hard to reach up.\"  He said smiling.  He soon was done helping Melody with her problem and they were on their way to the gates.  Cindy soon paid the prices for admission and they made their way to the various slides and pools. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So which one are you going to try first?\" Josie wondered to Melody as he looked down to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always wanted to try 'The Lightning Bolt', it was a slide that went 2.5 stories straight down.  Some people say that you even come up off of the slide.\"  Melody said as she looked at the map to find it's location.  \"There it is, it's just next to the lazy river and the medical tent.  Hmm... I wonder if they did that on purpose.\"  She joked as Jeremy, Anna and them made their way over to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Michael overheard them talking about the water slide and he made his way over too. \"I think it will be fun.\"  He said to himself as he followed them to the slide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean I am too small for this ride?  It's only a couple inches.\"  Melody nearly screamed at the attendant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but rules are rules.\"  The attendant said to her as they were trying to let Melody go down the slide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine... I will wait at the bottom.\"  She said with a huff as she turned around to head back down the stairs.  She looked around and thought that at least Josie would follow her and wait with her.  She didn't see her coming and just went ahead and went down to wait at the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melody, what's going on?\"  she heard a voice from behind her in the line. She turned around to see who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael, yeah, apparently your height is too small for this ride and I can't go on it and now I have to wait for the others to go through the line before we do something else.\" Melody replied back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, if you want, I can wait with you too.\"  He replied back, \"I mean, I have nothing else to do.  You four just left me in the dust.\"  Melody honestly felt bad for what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I didn't think about you, I'm truly sorry.\"  Melody replied back to him.  \"You know what.  How about we go check out the arcade that they have here. I brought some money and we can test out our skills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you wont stand a chance, right?\" Michael replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we will have to go and see.\"  Melody replied while she took Michael's arm and dragged him along.  After about 4-5 minutes, they find the small arcade that the park offered and they checked out the games.  \"Whoa, check it out.  They have Marvel vs. Capcom.  What do you say we have a little wager.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you have in mind?\"  Michael wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if I win, then you have to let me check out some of your comics and movies.\"  Melody said with a confident manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, and if I win, then you have to take me to go see the new Avengers Movie and I get to choose what you wear.\"  Michael then bet Melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal.\"  Melody said with a smile on her face as she dug out the needed money to start the game.</span></div></div>",

The fight itself didn't take more than 3 to 4 minutes, but it seemed to take forever.    Michael took out Melody's Ryu with his Spiderman character but he took heavy damage.  Melody took this to her advantage and finished him off with Zero.  Zero also was able to take out Wolverine too and but sustained 75% damage.  \"Looks like I am going to win this one.\"  Melody said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not over until it's over.\"  Michael replied back.  Soon Deadpool was able to finish off Zero while sustaining little damage. \"See, now we are even.\"  He replied back as they were now tied 2-2 and the next victor would be the winner of the bet.  The battle was long and hard but Ryu wasn't able to survive the combo attacks that Deadpool was able to unleash.  The unsuspecting Melody was not able to protect against the onslaught.  \"See what did I tell you?\"  Michael said to his little friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you learn to do that?\"  Melody asked with eyes full of bewilderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I found it online and I started playing it with a gamepad that I bought.  I found the combos online and learned them.\"  Michael said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I never suspected you to be such a bad ass.\" Melody said chuckling.  \"You know I think we will need to hang out more often.  I know, your brother likes to talk about the latest he read in Manga and nothing else.  But with you, I am able to talk about the latest movies, comics and video games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Josie?\"  Michael replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, she never really like to talk about comics and games. And it seems that we have been drifting apart as of late.  Well, ever since the start of the year when she started to have different lunch than us.  But, honestly, I think it was bound to come.\"  Melody replied back not making eye contact with Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what.  I think we will go tomorrow night and I think you will look beautiful in the dress I will pick out for you tonight.  How bout it?\"  He wondered as he looked over to Melody to started to tear up a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that sounds good.\"  She said with a smile on her face. \"Come on, let's go check to see if we can find the others.\"  Soon they were on their way once again to search the bottom of The Lightning Bolt to see if they were through the line.  Michael and Melody were soon to the ride and found that they were coming down the slide when they arrived.  \"Look there they are.\"  Melody said as she pointed them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, they are going down really fast.\"  He replied back.  \"And now they are skimming across the surface too.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would have been so cool going down that slide.\"  She said. \"But what do you want to do next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, lets talk it over with them after they get down, I think we should do the wave pool next.\"  Michael siad back to her as they waited for the groups return.</span></div></div>",

I still haven't figured out why you still hang out with this guy though.\" she said with a smile, pointing a thumb at the tall skinny guy that was Justin over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't figured it out either. I'm just some bum who comes to reunions still in his work clothes\" joked Justin, who was dressed in a blue plaid cotton dress shirt and some comfortable jeans. He had come straight to the reunion dinner from working at his store and didn't have time to change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy followed him into the house, dressed in her short, v-necked, silver sequinned dress and tall, black heels (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://g.nordstromimage.com/ImageGallery/store/product/Gigantic/13/_10423513.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://g.nordstromimage.com/ImageGallery...</a>). \"I thought you looked great, Justin. Way better than the skids who showed up in their Metallica t-shirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Eve's sister Jaime and Brendan's sister Shelbi came upstairs from her room Jaime was staying in for the weekend in the basement. \"Oh good. You guys are back. How was it, Luce?\" asked Jaime, who was dressed in her skin tight jeans and tiny cropped t-shirt (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thechive.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/girls-in-tight-jeans-14.jpg?quality=94&amp;strip=info&amp;w=600\" target=\"_blank\">https://thechive.files.wordpress.com/201...</a>). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing special. Just a mediocre dinner and some watered down drinks.\" the ginger answered her best friend. \"I could use a real drink before we start playing some games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say no more!\" said Shelbi, heading off to the kitchen. She was currently training to be a bartender at work and felt she needed all the practice she can get. A short while later, the purple haired girl in the high wasted jeans and button down shirt (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://41.media.tumblr.com/2741f4d25601363b8b62f30e24c35aff/tumblr_nkro8cxFlz1tufnqmo1_500.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://41.media.tumblr.com/2741f4d256013...</a>) returned with cold beers for everyone. \"Here's drinks for everyone. Now let's do something. I'm bored since all of my friends are out of town and Im stuck here for work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we have Monopoly or Catan...\" started Kristen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I think Lauren has something that would be interesting to try.\" said Brendan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a look of excitement, Lauren went into her purse and pulled out a deck of cards. \"I just got these from a weird shop the other day before we left to come here. I thought I would be fun to try them out. It's called Swap Poker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds interesting.\" said Justin \"What are the rules and how does it work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren pulled the deck out of the box and on top was a card with the rules written on it. \"Here. Take a look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> (Copied from teacher branch)<br>\r\n\"You play a normal round of poker but instead of betting money, you bet traits of yourself. The traits can be anything you can name. The traits are not equal in worth, some are more worth than others. A list can be found below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game will be played like a normal poker game, you bet and the one with the best hand wins. The winner can choose to either swap traits with those in the pot or swap these with the other players. You can't swap back traits you had when you began the game. It is possible to win and lose other traits throughout the game. For example it is possible that Brendan get's red hair, loses it and wins the same again during the game. He can't swap his own hair back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwapping ages or genders does not change you physical. People just think of you that you're that old or the opposite gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't matter what you bet, it is possible that there are several of the same trait in the pot. It's not possible to swap a hand for a foot or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the start of every hand, two people have to place a pot. The person dealing has to give in traits worth 1 points, the person right to him/her has to give traits worth 2 point. That then circles clockwise the next hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen someone set bets, the other players have to bet equal or more points to continue playing, e.g. Eve has a bets traits worth 4 points, then the other will have to bet traits worth 4 or more points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReality adjusts to the swaps. It is only possible to leave the game table in between hands not when the game is played.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll swaps can be reversed any time after two days when all players gather, put their hands on the card box and saying a magical formula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrait - Points<br>\r\nSmall body parts (e.g hands, feet, lips... etc) - 1 Point<br>\r\nSmall Possessions (e.g. jewelry, single books, single dvds) - 1 Point<br>\r\nOne clothing article - 1 Point<br>\r\nPersonal Infos (e.g. Age, name... etc) - 2 Point<br>\r\nLarger body parts (e.g. torso, legs, face... etc) - 2 Points<br>\r\n'Medium' Posessions (e.g. small personal library, DVD collections) - 2 points<br>\r\nSkills - 2 Points<br>\r\nMale/ Female body parts - 3 Points<br>\r\nMajor posessions (e.g. cars, houses, all of one article of clothing) - 3 Points<br>\r\nGender - 3 Points<br>\r\nPersonality changes - 4 Points<br>\r\nWhole Outfit - 4 Points<br>\r\nLife - 5 Points</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does anyone else think it's a weird coincidence that the examples use our names?\" asked Shelbi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrendan smiled at his younger sister before looking to Lauren. \"You're just being paranoid, Shelbi. Lauren, since it's your deck, do you want to have the honours of dealing first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure , hon. Then you can start off the betting with the small blind, and Lucy can be big blind, and can continue around the circle.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know how poker works, Laur. Deal the cards so I can unload this belly on someone.\" laughed Eve.</span></div></div>",

I'll bet my... Bras.\" said Jamie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve looked deep in thought. \"So I need three points now? I guess I'll bet my language skills and my earrings.\" A piece of paper with the words French, English and Spanish appeared over her head along with her diamond earrings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is french first?\" asked Shelbi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we're from Quebec, of course. Why do you think Jaime and I have accents?\" said Eve. \"Your turn, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin threw his cards down in disgust. \"These are garbage. I fold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelbi tried to hide a smile as she placed her bet. \"I'll bet my boobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren was quick to fold at that point. \"I only have Ace high. B, you need three more points.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, whatever she has, I'm not beating.

I'm out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alight little sister, what do you have to make such a bold bet.\" asked Brendan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pair of queens.\" said Shelbi, showing her hand. \"But look how close it is to a flush!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close doesn't beat my two pair though. Jacks and tens!\" Laughed Jaime, as she laid down her hand causing all of the holograms to float in front of her. \"So now I just have to push the hologram to whoever I want to have the trait? Let's try this out then. Lauren, you can have your boyfriends underwear.\" she said as she pushed the image of the boxers to the speed skater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do I have to take them off now, or... Holy shit!\" screamed Brendan, quickly undoing his pants and pulling them down slightly to reveal the black g-string he had seen his girlfriend put on earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So much for not showing lines in this dress anymore...\" sighed Lauren once the sense of panic had died down in the room. \" So I guess the guy who sold me the cards wasn't kidding when he said when we played we'd be in for a night of magic and fun...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god...\" muttered Shelbi. \"I'm really wishing I hadn't bet my boobs now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of those, Brendan, they're your's now! And I guess you'll be needing my bras now too.\" She joked, first sliding his sisters large DDs over to him, causing his chest to expand, while his younger sister's deflated. Soon after a bra was supporting his new endowments while Jaime was now bra-less under her t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so weird.\" mumbled Brendan, bouncing in his chair, making his chest shake in his newly acquired bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaime tried her best not to laugh as she continued dishing out her winnings. \"Eve, I really like those earrings, so I'll take them, and Justin, you can have my sister's language skills. That way when my mom calls, you can impress her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merci. Uh, I mean thanks.\" said Justin, sounding more french. He leaned over to his wife and whispered in her ear, \"Do you always have to translate your thoughts from french to english?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not anymore.\" She replied, her accent having completely disappeared. \"That was thoughtful of you to give Justin my french skills to talk to mom, Jaime, but how am I going to talk to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit. I never thought of that. I think it said that reality adjusts outside of the game, so maybe you just never learned it? Sorry.\" apologized Jaime before realizing that there was two last items. \"I'll just keep my name for now,\" she said sliding the nameplate back onto herself.\"And Luce, you can keep your eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it's my deal then.\" said Brendan, adjusting his bra before gathering up the cards and shuffling them in order to prepare for the next hand.</span></div></div>",

They're just in the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the daily struggle of chesty women, B.\" laughed Jamie, causing her bra-free C-cups to jiggle under her white t-shirt. \"You'll appreciate the bras I gave you, since that will help contain the girls. I know i miss them already. Sort of.\" she said with a mischievous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I guess. Luce, you want to play your blind so that we can get started?\" mumbled Brendan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy thought for a moment before coming up with her bet. \"I'll let someone else be called Ginger for a bit. I bet my hair. You're up Jaime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bet my makeup skills.\" said Jamie, as the holographic image of a piece of paper with the words \"Skills: Makeup\" appeared. \"Worst case, if I get call into a gig before we switch back, someone else does my makeup for me anyway. Now that the blinds are in, let's take a look at these cards.\" The room fell silent, apart from the music playing in the background as everyone looked at their cards and contemplated their bets, now knowing that there was a bit more on the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked towards Eve as she made her first contributions to the pot. \"These have been driving both me and Justin crazy for a while now: I bet my pregnancy hormones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Bon id\u00e9e</i>, babe\" said Justin, letting his new \"first language\" skills accidentally slip in again. \"That brings it up to three points, so I'll go ahead and bet my truck. It's a brand new F-150, so that should be worth the points.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm out.\" grumbled Shelbi, clearly still miffed about her last big loss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren paused to think, looking from her cards to the pot several time before saying \"I'll bet my voice, singing skill and piano skills.\" confidently stated Lauren, as the 3 images moved into the pot. \"Five points to you, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrendan was slightly dumbfounded. He knew Lauren was quite a good jazz pianist, and a talented singer (Playing gigs helped to pay her team fees), and she must have a pretty good hand to be willing to bet those. Then again, he thought his hand was pretty good too. \"Five, huh? I guess I'll call with my outfit and my hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Lucy said as she analyzed her cards to try to figure out what the last two could possibly have. \"Brendan never bluffed back when we used to play. He's got something big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, on his chest!\" joked Justin, which caused everyone in the group to have a good laugh, except for the Windsor sibling, who were not amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaime threw down her cards as well. \"Yeah. No way these cards can beat whatever they're packing. What about you, sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got nothing.\" she said. Justin wordlessly followed suit leaving the couple as the sole survivors of the hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it's just us, babe. Ready to show your losing hand?\" asked Lauren. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, but I'll show you this winner right here.\" Brendan replied, laying down his hand. \"Flush. Nothing but diamonds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren looked disappointed. \"Damn.\" she muttered. \"That is a good hand... But it's got nothing on these four queens!!!\" Brendan was so blown away by his girlfriend's play he could barely enjoy her victory dance, shaking her big sexy ass around in triumph before taking her seat and preparing to divide up her winnings. \"I'll start off by taking Lucy's hair. I've always wanted to try being a redhead.\" she said, as her hair turned from her normal shade of dark brown to a brilliant auburn, to Lucy's trademark ginger, while the model's hair did the opposite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both those colours look really good on you girls. You should maybe consider keeping the change for a while.\" said Eve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's all or nothing, and I'm pretty sure Shelbi would hate us forever if we made everyone keep all of the changes just so we could try a different hairstyle.\" stated Lauren. Shelbi nodded to confirm her suspicions. \"Anyway, Jaime, you can have your sister's crazy pregnancy hormones, and Shelbi, you can have Justin's truck so that you can stop asking me and Brendan for rides to work while we try to enjoy our vacation here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man. Does this mean I'll be getting all of the weird food cravings? You know I can't eat a lot with my line of work.\" Jaime whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve leaned over and and whispered in her younger sister's ear, \"Probably shouldn't have messed with her boyfriend then. It's not so bad though. You might gain a bit of weight, but you boobs will get bigger. Look what they've already done for me. Just watch out though. They can make you crazy horny. Also regular crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we have left.\" wondered Lauren, looking over the remaining traits. Justin, you can have Jaime's makeup skills. I'm going to keep my piano play ability for now, but honey, you can join me on stage and do the singing with my voice.\" she said with a smile, throwing the last four item to her choices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Nice make up, Justin.\" laughed Brendan in his new voice, watching his best friends face become covered in various shades of mascara, foundation, concealer and lip gloss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be a dink, babe.\" scolded Lauren with her new, manly voice. \"Just for that, Eve gets your outfit.\" said said, sliding the final item to their pregnant friend. Suddenly, Eve was the one dressed up in dress pants, a light blue shirt whose buttons were being strained by her bulging belly and a purple bowtie, while Brendan was showing off his cleavage in the tight red maternity dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karma's a bitch.\" Eve smiled, unbuttoning the shirt to relieve tension on the buttons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can be too.\" laughed Lauren as they prepared for the next hand.</span></div></div>",

These new hormones are already giving me cravings that are living up to the stereotype.\" she said, taking her seat at the table. \"I guess it's my turn to post a blind again, huh? Well then, I guess I can put in my thong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve put a hand on her husband's leg and smiled to assure him that she would make sure that he didn't end up in her sister's panties before speaking up. \"I'm sick of being the shortest one in the group, so I'll bet my height.\" A vertical ruler showing 64 inches appeared and made it's way to the middle to sit with the image of Jaime's underwear allowing Lucy to deal out the next hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fold.\" Justin immediately announced, flipping his hand to show an unsalvageable hand where nothing even came close to matching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelbi smiled for the first time since losing her breasts to her brother and winked at Jaime, as if they had psychically formulated a plan. \"Bad luck there, Justy-Poo. I'll put in all of my bras, since I don't need them anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren matched with her extensive collection of shoes, while both Brendan and Lucy, much like Justin, folded, bringing the wagering back to Jaime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll call with my taste in music\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'll call BS.\" said Eve.\"You have a terrible tell, little sister. Dad could never see it, but I always know when you're lying. You have nothing, which is why I can confidently bet my big pregnant belly, because I know I can't lose with this hand.\" she announced with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelbi looked across the table to her pregnant opponent, trying to read her as best she could. Was she lying too? Was she lying about Jaime lying? Looking back to her own hand, the youngest player made her decision. \"I'll bet my gender.\" she said with an evil smile aimed at Justin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to be the one choosing where that belly goes, so even though I'm sure I could totally beat you, Evie, I'll fold.\" said Lauren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve smiled \"Aww. Thanks Laur. I knew there was a reason I liked you more than Brendan.\" she joked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like everyone's even then.\" announced Justin nervously. \"Show your cards ladies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three women laid down their hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell did you know I was bluffing!?\" fumed Jaime, who was showing an Ace High. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I told you, I'd lose that power over you, dear sister.\" Eve laughed, adjusting her recently acquired bowtie. \"And If i'm not mistaken, Miss Windsor, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 made up of all diamonds, puts your 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace of many different suits to shame. Like I said: I can't lose with this hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddamnit...\" muttered Shelbi, angry to lose again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now who should hold on to my baby for me for the next few days...\" mused Eve, caressing he belly tauntingly while looking around the table. \"Well, Brendan, you are already wearing the dress for it, so you can take care of the little one for a while.\" she laughed, moving the hologram outline of her bump to her friend causing his belly to swell up, while her's shrunk to his slim swimmer's abdominals. \"Now, as for my height, I'll go from the shortest to the tallest by swapping with you, babe.\" she said, sliding the ruler to Justin, causing her to grow a full foot in height, while her husband shrunk down to her old height of 5'4\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel so tiny now...\" he said, examining his new perspective. \"I hope this doesn't have an effect on my swing. I have to give golf lessons tomorrow morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be fine. You're a great teacher. You taught me how to play well, when I was that size.\" Eve smiled, looking down on her now tiny husband. \"Anyway, let's give out the rest here. Jaime, you can take Shelbi's bras, since you will want something to support them over the next few days, knowing what those hormones were doing to my body... Justin, you can also have my sister's musical tastes, just because I know Jaime loves country music like I do, and the we can listen together!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. now not only do I know every Blake Shelton song, but I'm also a shameless Belieber...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never thought I'd hear the day you say that.\" laughed Brendan, caressing his new belly under his stretched out maternity dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha! Yeah!\" smirked Jaime. \"That guy's a turd. I don't even remember why I liked him with his garbage melodies and auto-tune.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll come around to him again. Everyone does.\" said Eve with a smile, hearing her sister talk about was was once her favourite pop star like that. \"As for your thong, Jaime, I'm going to give it to Lauren, since she was worried about showing lines under her dress earlier, and Shelbi, I'll be nice and let you keep your gender. For now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. This baby is sitting right on top of my bladder somehow.\" complained Brendan. \"I'm going to go to the bathroom, and when I get back we should decide if we want to keep going for another hand, or just call it a night here.\" With that, he got up and waddled off to the bathroom to relieve himself.</span></div></div>",

Justin nodded and smiled in agreement as everyone around the table agreed to Jaime's terms (Some more reluctantly than others), and the final hand was ready to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll start off this final hand of big bets with my half of my marriage.\" announced Eve, as a holographic image of her wedding ring made it's way to the middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'll match with my half.\" said Justin, as the image of his ring joined his wife's in the pot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone around the table was shocked. Justin and Eve had dated since high school and had finally married the year before. \"Sick of married life already you two?\" asked Brendan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. We have a plan.\" smiled Eve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if you don't win and I get to give your marriage away to someone else?\" asked Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're feeling lucky.\" Justin replied, winking at Brendan and Lauren while Jaime dealt out the hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bet my piercings and hair colour.\" said Shelbi, barely glancing at her cards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we're going big, I guess I'll have to put in my butt.\" Lauren said with a smile, while patting her large, muscular posterior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe. I hope you don't lose that, babe. It's one of my favourite body parts of your's.\" said Brendan. \"I guess I'll bet my junk. Worst case, it will better explain how I'm now pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't make you sound very confident in your hand there, B.\" mused Lucy. \"I guess I'll bet my job as a model.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good one, Luce. Glad you've decided to finally play in for the last hand.\" ribbed Jaime. \"I'm going to go really big and bet both my boobs and entire wardrobe. You always say I dress too slutty, Evie.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit! Did you deal yourself all of the good cards or something?\" asked a very shocked Lucy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. Only two ways to find out. Fold or match. It'll take another 3 points from everyone to stay in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve looked at her cards and back to her sister, looking for her tell again. \"Shit. She might actually have something good. I can probably beat her with these cards, so I'll call with my gender.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin leaned over and kissed his taller wife on the cheek. \"Honey, you better win for the literal sake of our marriage, since I have nothing again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout missing a beat or showing expression Shelbi quickly answered with a call of her own. \"My fashion sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll add in my legs too.\" said Lauren, adding her thick, well muscled legs to the pot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another favourite.\" said Brendan as he called as well with all of his hair, both head and body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll call with my gender. Alright let's see what everyone has.\" said Lucy. \"I have a straight. 3 to 7.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't beat that. I had nothing.\" said Brendan, throwing down his cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same.\" said Lauren not happy to lose again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve smiled as she showed her hand. \"Flush beats a straight there, Luce. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it also beats a pair of twos.\" said Jamie,\"Lucky for me, I have another pair of twos to make it a four of a kind. Looks like I win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelbi spoke up and smiled for the first time since the beginning of the game. \"Not so fast, blondie. Have you met the Royal family?\" Shelbi showed her hand, revealing a royal flush. \"I believe I finally win one, and since it was the last hand and I've wrecked so many plans, it's time for a little chaos. First things first, since I can't have my boobs, I'll be taking the next available ones.\" she said, taking Jaime's sizeable chest for herself and leaving Jaime with Brendan's manly pectorals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. What if the pregnancy hormones mess with my chest?\" asked Brendan, worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelbi shrugged. \"Not my problem, bro, but since you love your girlfriend's ass and legs so much, you can have them.\" she said passing the holograms to him, causing his legs and ass to plump up with both feminine shape and muscle. \"While we're at it, you can also have Eve's gender. I've always wanted a big sister anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time nothing physical happened to Brendan. \"Ummm... I thought I'd turn into a girl at this point. Why do I still look the same?\" he wondered out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's because you've always been considered a woman now, because my driver's license says I'm male. Look.\" said Eve who had pull it out to investigate. Sure enough, next to the category \"Sex\" was an M, indicating Eve had always been a guy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HA! That hilarious!\" laughed Shelbi. \"Let's make it official though. You can have my brother's genitals and hair. It'll go good with his outfit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve gasped as her long blonde hair became darker and shorter and a 5 o'clock shadow grew in on her face, while Brendan's became clear and long blond hair grew down to the middle of his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa. Does that make us a gay couple now?\" asked Justin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not when I give you Lucy's gender.\" laughed Shelbi, now drunk with power. \"Speaking of Lucy, I'll take your modelling job for now, and since high end models like yourself don't have piercings or purple highlights, I'll need to give those to someone else... Lauren, you've been ginger long enough. You can take my hair, and piercings.\" Lauren's hair lengthened to her waist and darkened to take on the Windsor brown hair with Shelbi's purple highlights. \"I'll keep my fashion sense though, since I do like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith only two items left, Shelbi paused to think. \"Oooh. Last but not least, the marriage. I can cause so much chaos right now. I could marry my brother to his best friend Justy-poo, or I can marry the sisters.. er... brother and sister now. Hahaha. Maybe I'll take Lauren all for myself... Actually, I'll be nice. I figured when you two put your marriage on the table, it was to give my brot...sister and Lauren a taste of married life. So, I'll give Brendan Eve's ring, since her new gender makes her the wife now, and Lauren, you can be the husband. Mazel tov to the new lesbian couple!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was speechless for a bit as they soaked in the swaps and what they would mean for the next few days.</span></div></div>",

I'm a pretty nice guy.\" said James, kissing his girlfriend on the lips before ringing the doorbell. \"We'll probably just play xbox while you girls drink wine and talk about boys, or whatever it is you girls do on girl's night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Door's open!\" They heard Christina yell.

I feel like I never see you anymore now that finals are coming up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe athletic girl gave an awkward smile. \"Yeah... Between the mountain of homework I'm buried in and training, I barely have time for anything else, or anyone. Student athlete life is hard. This is the first night off I've had since the semester started, it seems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like you need some wine.\" said Erin, bringing her friend a very full glass of pinot noir. \"I like your outfit by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks! It's not often I get to wear dresses, so I figured I should take advantage of it.\" Grace said, twirling around to show off her outfit (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images.lululemon.com/is/image/lululemon/LW8948S_015929_1?\" target=\"_blank\">https://images.lululemon.com/is/image/lu...</a>$pdp_zoom$) \"Since it's also Lululemon, it also counts as athletic wear, so I don't feel too awkward in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly Gracie.

I don't plan on getting that drunk tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Famous last words!\" shouted Tyler, dressed in his jeans and a plain white t-shirt. \"I remember when you'd say that back in high school too, then I'd find myself holding your hair back three hours later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace quickly changed the subject before she could be further embarrassed. \"So are we playing poker again tonight, or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! That would be really fun, especially now that the boys are here!\" said Caitlin, her enthusiasm rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler looked at his girlfriend confused. \"Girl's night has just been code for poker night this whole time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, Ty. This is a special kind of poker. See, back in our first year, Christina bought a magical deck of cards, where if you win a hand, you get to say 'I want to swap blank with blank, but you only have two minutes to decide, or the cards pick for you.\" explained Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mean, like, clothing...\" asked James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" said Caitlin. \"Body parts. Like Erin said. It's magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you don't have to worry about looking weird at work or anything. It changes reality so that everyone not playing the game thinks that however you look is how you always were.\" said Christina, returning from her room where she hid the cards. \"It's been fun keeping both the cards and some of the swaps a secret from you all this time, but I suppose we can let you boys in on the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this just sounds ludicrous. you ladies believe in magic AND you believe you can beat me at poker?\" scoffed James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace, knew James could never turn down a challenge, and thought it would be fun to finally bring him into the world of changes she had been playing with for the last few years. \"Sounds like a challenge, mister unbeatable. Why don't we play a few hands, so that you can put your money where your mouth is. Or in this case, your mouth where someone else's mouth is.\" This last comment caused the girls to erupt in a fit of giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on, missy. Let play.\"</span></div></div>",

It's like it's adjusted to fit my pecs, and your underwear actually fits me too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. The magic of the cards does that. Now everyone thinks that it's normal that you've always worn the clothes that I wore, and vice versa. Also, your welcome for not wearing a thong tonight, though you now have quite the selection at home.\" explained Erin with a bunch of hand motions that caused her massive, unrestrained chest to wobble uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina noticed Erin's boobs bouncing around. \"It's going to be a long week without a bra and those girls going wherever they want though.

The girls are your's for the week so you can do whatever you want with them, just maybe not in public.\" Erin said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure how to feel about my boyfriend having bigger boobs than me.\" said Grace, staring at her boyfriend's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames shrugged, making his breasts shake around their Victoria's Secret made confines and sending small waves of foreign pleasure throughout his body. \"You're the one who wanted to play, hon. Besides, I think these could be fun, and it's only for a week. I still need to win a few hands, so I can always change.\"</span></div></div>",

I won!\" he exclaimed, bouncing in his seat with excitement, making his boobs bounce hypnotically without even realizing he was doing it, before pausing, looking deep in thought. \"I don't even know what I want to swap though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had better choose soon, hun. There's only a 2 minute window, or the game picks for you. I think there's about a minute left, since you took all of that time at the beginning to realize you have no ideas.\" reminded Grace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" James nodded as he got back to thinking. Did he want another physical change? The boobs were already quite the shock (Though he was sure it was not as much as Tyler's was). Maybe change some belongings, like the clothing swap? Oh! Or he could get something back from Erin! He had never really sen her in workout clothes, and it would be hard to train the college's volleyball team without some proper gym attire. That and he wouldn't have to wear panties anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to swap my clothes back with Erin.\" he announced confidently. After a brief pause, he still felt the tightness of the dress around his midsection, and the air flowing gently between his bare legs. \"What? Why didn't we switch back?\" he asked, confusion showing on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No swap-backs, Jay. Sorry.\" shrugged Erin with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Caitlin spoke up. \"And that tingle I'm feeling at the back of my mind tells me that you've run out of time. I wonder what we swapped? It doesn't feel like a mental change...\" she said, running her delicate hands up and down her body, looking for some different physical feature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's not a body part.\" said Grace, looking her friends over, trying to help them find the swap. \"Check your guy's Facebook profiles. We found that was a good place to see any lifestyle changes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin and James both pulled out their phones and went to check their Facebook accounts for something amiss. The first thing James noticed on his page was that his profile picture had changed. It was the same picture of him and Grace at a friend's wedding from the previous summer, with Grace in a blue low, cut dress (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://testn.imgix.net/Zoom/7/_11440907.jpg?fit=fill&amp;bg=fff&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=60&amp;w=380&amp;h=583\" target=\"_blank\">http://testn.imgix.net/Zoom/7/_11440907....</a>) but instead of his usual suit, he was wearing a tight, shiny silver dress that emphasized his breasts with a pair of 3-inch heels. (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://testn.imgix.net/Zoom/8/_11198468.jpg?fit=fill&amp;bg=fff&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=60&amp;w=860&amp;h=1318\" target=\"_blank\">http://testn.imgix.net/Zoom/8/_11198468....</a>). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found it!\" exclaimed Caitlin, distracting James from the picture. \"Looks like I'm considered a guy now. Under basic info, it says 'Male'. I still like guys though, so I guess that makes me a gay man. Weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Christina chuckle. \"Awww. I guess you two are a lesbian couple now, Gracie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, it makes me bi now. I still like guys, just this one girl, who is still pretty manly where it counts.\" Grace replied matter-of-factly, while motioning to James' crotch with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaitlin just smiled. \"This is going to be nice. One of my profs seems to hate every girl in class, so this will be a pleasant change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, and you can go in the men's change room now.\" Erin joked as they prepared to deal out the next hand. \"Maybe I'll swap gender's with Tyler so that we can enjoy the sights together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler gave Erin a look that was a cross between anger and horror. \"Don't even try it.\"</span></div></div>",

If I'm a girl now, I can't have this stubble on my face or hairy legs. Ladies have nice smooth, hairless skin, and that bit of snark just won you a week's worth of man hair, Chrissy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit.\" both Christina and Tyler muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to swap all of my hair with Christina.\" said James. He felt a tingle run through his body, starting at the top of his head and running all the way down to his feet. The tingling in his scalp became stronger as his hair turned red and cascaded down, tickling his bare back as it grew out into Christina's mid-back length style. Body hair began receding as his legs, stomach, chest and arms became smooth and hairless. Meanwhile, Christina was regretting speaking up as coarse brown hair sprouted up al over her body. Her hair sucked back into her head, becoming the short, messy style James was known for. Sideburns grew down beside her ears as a 5 o'clock shadow covered her feminine face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should have seen this one coming.\" she said, running her hand over her face, feeling the unfamiliar texture and listening to the scratching sound it made on her hand. \"At least now, it won't take me forever to do my hair in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames looked at the ginger locks that now draped over his shoulders. \"Crap. I only wanted body hair. You have to be very specific with this game, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. Maybe you'll get another chance to actually get what you want next hand, sweetie.\" laughed Grace, seeing her boyfriend (Now girlfriend) with a long, red, feminine hairstyle to go with his massive rack and sexy dress. Even though he didn't look like the guy she loved, she still felt very attracted to him and his new form. </span></div></div>",

I'm pretty sure that a flush beats those 3 aces.\" said the blonde, as she revealed her hand made up completely of hearts. Grace was speechless, as her friend stole her win out from under her. \"Also, you aren't the only one who hadn't won a hand yet. This was my first win, and Tyler is yet to win something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak for yourself.\" he mumbled. \"I wouldn't call having to give my body parts away winning...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways...\" said Caitlin, ignoring Tyler's side comment. \"This next swap is one for me, though it might be a weird one.\" This caused both Tyler and James to worry slightly. If this next swap was what she considered weird, did that make the last bunch fairly normal or tame in this game? \"It's been a while since I've had sex, and I'm sorry for doing this to you, but for my swap, I want to swap relationships with Tyler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the shit?!\" he exclaimed as he awaited for something to change, before realizing he didn't feel anything. \"So what does this mean now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace, who was already on her phone chucked to herself as she looked over the changes to her friends' lives. \"According to Facebook, it's been Christina and Caitlin who have been dating since high school. I think you and Christina still live together, but you're roommates now, instead of dating.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true.\" said Christina. \"I have a bunch of new memories of me and Caitlin doing couple-y things, while we were more just friends. Sorry Ty...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is fucked. I'm out.\" Tyler said, clearly flustered by the massive life shifting event that just occurred. He stood up to leave the table, before Christina grabbed his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ty, please don't leave. If you quit, you won't be able to see the rest of the changes. At least sit in on the hands. We promise we won't switch with you anymore. Right?\" Christina asked, looking at Caitlin specifically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" replied the blond girl (Now considered a guy by everyone outside the table). \"I'm sorry Tyler. I was being selfish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe exasperated Tyler quietly sat back down at the table, stewing in his anger at both the loss of his manhood and his girlfriend. \"Fine. But you really owe me when we swap back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina gave him a quick kiss on the cheek, which caused Tyler to recoil a bit as her new facial hair brushed against his own cheek. \"Thanks, babe. We'll just play one more hand, since this is a lot for anyone to take in on their first game.\"</span></div></div>",

I'm already a guy this week... And I have a girlfriend... I'm getting bored of the usual girl's parts from the game, but I can't take anything from Tyler again, so I need something left from James...\" she mused, eyeing up Grace's lover. \"Christina, is there anything you want me to have from Jay?\" she asked her new girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I'm good.\" smiled the former redhead, now sporting James' shorter, brown style. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ten seconds.\" reminded Erin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking quickly, Caitlin made her choice. \"I want to swap voices with James.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group sat in silence around the table for a moment in silence before James finally spoke up in her new, feminine voice. \"This is going to be a lot less intimidating when I'm training the teams tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you sound so cute now.\" Caitlin replied with James' lower register, causing the group to burst out in laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace fetched a pen and paper from Christina's desk to perform her usual duty of writing down a list of the swaps from each person so that they could remember who needed to swap back the following week. \"Alright, let me know who has whose parts so I can keep track of these things.\"</span></div></div>",

Besides, now that you have your own to play with, maybe you can show me what you learn about playing with boobs tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive to Grace's house was a short one from Christina's, so it didn't take long for James to drop off her girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll probably see you tomorrow around school, babe.\" said Grace as she kissed James goodbye. \"It's kind of weird kissing you without the beard hairs tickling me now.\" she noted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Christina and Ty...

Upon arriving home, she quickly made her way to her room where she could properly inspect her new body. She removed her dress and bra to see her new massive boobs, which sat proudly on her chest. She then reached up and fondled them, gently stroking her new, more sensitive nipples, which caused her to let out a sexy, feminine moan. \"Mmmm. This is going to be a fun night.\" she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of her night was spent in bed, dressed in nothing but a pair of purple panties, feeling up her smooth legs, and massaging her massive mammaries. When she was finally tired, James learned one of the down sides of having big boobs: she could no longer sleep on her stomach like she was used to. After that, it took a bit of tossing and turning to find a comfortable position that wasn't crushing her boobs or putting long, red hair in her mouth, but when she did, she fell right asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was awoken very early the next morning by a text massage from Christina. \"Good morning James. You should probably get up now. It takes a while to do my hair in the morning. :)  I'm going back to bed lol.\" The new redhead made her way to the bathroom where she took a quick shower (Or as quick as one can be while playing with her boobs) before standing in front of the mirror, clueless of what to do. \"Shit. I know Grace leaves a hairdryer and brush here, but I have no idea what to do...\" she thought. \"I wishI had someone to teach me how to... Oh yeah. YouTube is full of tutorials. I can just use those.\" She pulled out her iPad and looked up the most popular how to video. After struggling for a bit, she finally left the bathroom with her hair in a messy bun. \"Now to find something to wear today...\" A search through her closet found that Erin had a few good outfits that she could use for the day while training the volleyball girls. She finally settled on a pair of seafoam green seamless hipster panties, black sports bra, white tank top and grey yoga pants. A typical outfit for most girls in the gym these day. As she packed her bag with her school books, she made sure to pack the deck of Swap Cards as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the school day went by fairly well, other than the couple of times she nearly went into the Men's washrooms before the moment she was waiting for: Training the women's volleyball team. A group of amazonian women, each one beautiful in their own ways, and some who James was planning to use the cards with. She made friends with most of the girls over the season, but grew especially close with a small group of them. Allison, a tall athletic ginger with a pair of modest B-Cups; Chelsea, who had pink streaks in her blonde hair, large C-Cups and a slightly curvier physique; Courtney, a tall skinny brunette with small B-Cups who made money by also being a model; and Victoria, the team athletic therapist, a shorter brunette with B-Cups and a big athletic bubble butt. James asked each of them if they'd be interested in playing a quick game of poker in the therapy room after the gym, to which the girls agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Step one: complete.\" James thought with a smile</span></div></div>",

Any player that folds, loses a trait to the player on the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe face up card determines the trait lost in the following way: Aces mean intellectual ability. Kings mean hair. Queens mean eyes. Jacks mean complexion. Tens mean genitals. Nines mean torso. Eights mean butt. Sevens mean arms. Sixes mean legs. Fives mean nose. Fours mean ears. Threes mean mouth. Two means personality (including fashion sense, interests and hobbies). Suit determines duration. Clubs mean an hour. Hearts mean a day. Diamonds mean a week. And spades mean a month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will let you decide if swaps have to match or not. With matching swaps, a player swaps traits for the same traits such as legs for legs. With unmatching swaps, legs can be swapped for arms however, aces, jacks, nines, and twos cannot be swapped except for matching traits. So unmatching swap can easily become complicated. I'll leave it up to you to decide how you want to handle the complications.</span></div></div>",

Seven random college students had gathered in the library to study but none of them was in the mood. They each wanted to be elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was construction going on nearby but the rain had put a halt to it. So Mark was also bored and stopped in the library to think about what to do with his unplanned day off. So far, there had been no predictions of flooding but the library was one of the safest places to be if flooding did occur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone interested in a game of cards. I found this strange deck yesterday and haven't tried it out.\" Mark said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason asked, \"What's so strange about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark said, \"It's called swap poker and it has some strange rules that don't make sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seven students agreed to play at least one hand Mark dealt going around the circle to his right as follows: Sarah had a nine of spades showing and a worthless hand. Scotty had a king of clubs showing with a potential straight. Catherine had a two of diamonds showing and a worthless hand. Rick had a ten of hearts showing and a worthless hand. Rachel had an ace of clubs showing with all the other aces in her hand. Jason had a ten of spades showing with a worthless hand. Ben had a nine of diamonds showing and a worthless hand. Mark dealt himself a king of spades showing but a worthless hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen started to fold but Mark said, \"If I understand the rules, there are penalties for folding. A nine of diamones means that you would lose your torso for a week whatever that means.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen said, \"Whatever that means is right. What kind of penalty is that? It's probably just talkng about some tokens that were supposed to be in the game but got lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone except Rachel and Scotty folded. Scotty's straight never materialized but she didn't fold. Rachel won the first hand. Suddenly, everyone experienced a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's hair became curly and brown while her chest flattened. Scotty's chest grew. Catherine lost her personality becoming depressed. Rick became interested in tea parties but lost his genitals. Rachel gained a penis and balls beside her vagina. Jason lost his genitals. Ben received a second set of genitals beside his original set but lost all his upper torso musculature. Mark gained upper torso musculature but lost his hair.</span></div></div>",

On the way, the 5 of you stop at a restaurant and play the infamous swap cards. You were going to play the Swap Poker with Bets. Rules are as follows:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou play a normal round of poker but instead of betting money, you bet traits of yourself. The traits can be anything you can name. The traits are not equal in worth, some are more worth than others. A list can be found below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game will be played like a normal poker game, you bet and the one with the best hand wins. The winner can choose to either swap his traits with those in the pot or swap these with the other players. You can't swap back traits you had when you began the game. It is possible to win and lose other traits throughout the game. For example it is possible that Henry get's a vagina, loses it and wins the same again during the game. He can't swap his own penis back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwapping ages or genders does not change you physical. People just think of you that you're that old or the opposite gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't matter what you bet, it is possible that there are several of the same trait in the pot. It's not possible to swap a hand for a foot or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the start of every hand, two people have to place a pot. The person dealing has to give in traits worth 1 points, the person right to him/her has to give traits worth 2 point. That then circules clockwise the next hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen someone set bets, the other players have to bet equal or more points to continue playing, e.g. Shawn has a bets traits worth 4 points, then the other will have to bet traits worth 4 or more points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReality adjusts to the swaps. It is only possible to leave the game table in between hands not when the game is played.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll swaps can be reversed any time after three days when all players gather, put their hands on the card box and saying a magical formula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrait - Points<br>\r\nSmall body parts (e.g hands, feet, lips... etc) - 1 Point<br>\r\nSmall Possessions (e.g. jewelry, single books, single dvds) - 1 Point<br>\r\nOne clothing article - 1 Point<br>\r\nPersonal Infos (e.g. Age, name... etc) - 1 Point<br>\r\nLarger body parts (e.g. torso, legs, face... etc) - 2 Points<br>\r\n'Medium' Posessions (e.g. small personal library, DVD collections) - 2 points<br>\r\nSkills - 2 Points<br>\r\nMale/ Female body parts - 3 Points<br>\r\nMajor posessions (e.g. cars, houses) - 3 Points<br>\r\nGender - 3 Points<br>\r\nPersonality changes - 4 Points<br>\r\nWhole Outfit - 4 Points<br>\r\nLife - 5 Points<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe characters:<br>\r\nShawn (17 years old)- About 5 feet 6 inches, messed up straighy brown hair, a bit nerdy and a book worm, average build; not scrawny or muscular<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana (17 years old)- Short, about 5 feet 1 inch tall, black hair that reaches below her neck, glasses and small but cute face, not much in terms of athleticism and is an avid reader<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen (18 years old)- About 5 feet 5 inches, short blonde hair, pretty athletic because of cheerleading and wears a lot of make-up<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason (18 years old)- Tall, 6 feet, has bulging muscles because of being the Quarterback of their school, buzzcut hair and has the makings of facial hair, Gwen's boyfriend<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina (12 years old)- 4 feet 9 inches, blonde hair tied up in pigtails, really thin but has a cute face similar to her sister Gwen<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay guys should we start?\" You ask the others \"I'll deal.\" You look at your cards and try to keep a poker face as you see you only have a jack high. You try to bluff your way through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bet my face and my current outfit\" referring to your green shirt and jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! But I can read you bluff anywhere Shawn. I bet my breasts and my gender\" Dana says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If your really bluffing, I'll bet my voice, name and vagina.\" Christina says happily seeing the worry in your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just fold. I've got nothing.\" Jason says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bet my life and my underwear.\" Gwen says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll fold\" You and Christina almost say simultaneously. The remaining girls show their cards. Gwen had a full house but Dana's four queens had something to say about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha!\" She says in triumph. \"Hmmm... Christina you can give Shawn your outfit and voice. Your name and vagina however will got to Jason. Gwen will have some interesting choices in sex now.\" You are shocked to see that you are now wearing a tight pink shirt that says \"cute\" and black leggings. Your shoes seem to be pink sandals with ribbons on top. You mutter something but immediately close your mouth after hearing you high-pitched girly voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gwen you can keep your life but I think Jason will be happy to get your underwear for his \"slit\" Dana says as Gwen's bra dissapears and Jason suddenly has something loosely hangling on his chest. You assume he also has panties underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep my gender but I think I'll switch breasts with Gwen though to see those huge puppies.\" Dana's shirt stretched as huge C-cup breasts replace her A-cups. Gwen however looks dissappointed in her smaller bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we start the next hand already?\" You say cringing to your much higher-pitched voice and at your current outfit.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Gwen is looking much younger with her pigtails and small bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! Give me a break! Can I have something good sis?\" Gwen says in outrage<br>\r\n\"Ugh. How about Shawn's legs and arms?\" Christina says in disgust.<br>\r\n\"Noooo!\" Gwen was shouting as her legs became my all too familiar hairy legs and arms while I got her feminine cheerleader ones.<br>\r\n\"Jason. Maybe your height could be an issue in football.\" Christina says evilly as Jason shrinks to Dana's short stature while Dana skyrocketed to Jason's 6 feet. \"Jason could use a new name and age while I'm at it.\" Jason checked for his driver's licence but only found a school id for middle school with Christina on it and 12 as the age instead of 18.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god this game!\" Jason said is surprise.<br>\r\n\"Dana, you can keep your complexion.\" Christina says \"You can have Gwen's make-up skills too.\" Dana's face suddenly looked brighter with different styles of make-up applied on it. Gwen's face looked sloppy however with only lazily applied lipstick and a failed attempt at using blush.<br>\r\n\"Thanks Christina or should I say Jason!\" Dana says as she high-fives the now stronger Christina.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I think Shawn's face would look good on you.\" Gwen says laughing. Your face suddenly had a tingling feeling as you felt your nose become smaller and your lips become fuller.

You felt a beadband on your head and small earingd on each ear. Your shoes became black flats to complete your transformation. Dana on the other hand looked ridiculous in Christina's pink \"CUTE\" shirt and black leggings. Gwen's sizable bust only made her look weirder and your old face with Gwen's make-up did not help either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christina, no height for you this time.\" Gwen told the pouting Christina. \"Revenge is a dish best served cold.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
