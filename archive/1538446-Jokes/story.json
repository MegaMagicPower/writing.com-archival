I am amazed by his presentation of the story that I actually called him always to continue the story.  I mean, it is a story, but in actual I have to deal with other people to continue the story.  If I cannot deal with these people, the story, he won't give the real meaning of the story.  I followed his instructions and I found out later that it's only a joke for me.  Now I am not joking to anybody even here in WDC.  So, I am serious now and not joking.  Okay?  But, I will give you an assignment to make a joke/s.</span></div></div>",

Though his body be a prisoner of the soulless land of Catatonia while the sun still ruled the sky, his mind rode Xanadu\u2019s sacred river Alph down to the sunless sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slept not the dreamless sleep of the dead but the eternal morpheus sleep of the undead. His dreams flickered across the cobwebs of his mind like the silent films that fascinated him a century ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDreams of the countless loves lost, senseless wars fought, and unspeakable horrors committed, danced through his head, unbidden. And the sun-- like all nosferatu, the vampire dreamed of the sun and the bittersweet day when last they embraced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere tucked in the protective confines of his coffin, sealed within the safety of the mausoleum, the creature basked in the brilliance of a harmless imagined star. A star so bright it brought a crimson tear to his ghoulish eye. He basked in the glow, savoring the sensation of warmth upon his sun kissed skin, flesh glistening with perspiration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerspiring from the heat of Helios \u2026 heat \u2026 The heat was intense. The fiend did not understand. The smell of charred cloth and burning hair -- his hair-- penetrated the misty veil of his consciousness. The searing pain that invaded every fiber of his languid frame was unbearable. How was this happening?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampire fought monstrously to break the grip of the supernatural lethargy that plagued him. Screaming in mindless frustration and willing his limbs to move. He felt his skin smolder and crack as he simmered in his own bloody juices. In one mammoth act of desperation, he flung open the lid and slithered weakly over the side, congealing in a pool on the floor of his tomb like drying blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coolness of the marble floor revitalized the still smoking vampire. Standing to his full height, he surveyed his surroundings, quickly deducing what had taken place. With moral indignation and outrage he yelled\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>\u201cWho's the wise-ass that put me in the tanning bed!\u201d</b></u></span></div></div>",

His mom and dad are upstairs arguing. \"You are such a bastard!\" \"Well your a stingy bitch!\" His father stomps out of the room into the bathroom. Johnny enters and asks his mother \"Mommy whats a bastard and a bitch?\" she replies \"Well a bastard is another word for a gentleman and a bitch is another word for a lady\" she leaves Johnny wondering and goes downstairs. Johnny wanders to his brothers room who is in the middle of his health homework. \"Conception occurs when the man puts his penis in the vagina...\" Johnny speaks up \"Bro whats a penis and vagina?\" His brother not wanting to explain the \"birds and the bees\" says \" A penis is a type of mans hat and a vagina is a ladys overcoat\" He shoos Johnny out of the room and Johnny goes to find his father in the bathroom shaving. He cuts himself and says \"Shit!\" \"Daddy whats shit?\" His dad startled says \"It's the type of shaving cream I use.\" Johhny accepts the answer and goes downstairs to find his mother cutting the turkey. She accedently cuts her finger \"Fuck!\" \"Mommy whats fuck mean?\" She replies \"Its a special way to cut the turkey\" At that statement the doorbell rings and Johnny runs to greet his guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gathers them all in the front hall and proudly exlaims to the group:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome bitches and bastards, may I take your penises and vaginas? Mom's in the kitchen fucking the turkey, and dads upstiars wiping the shit off his face.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We provide for you so lets call you The People and your baby brother is the Future. So think about it and see what you can tell me in the morning. Johnny did his homework, ate dinner and went to bed all the time thinking about what his father had said. He woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of his brother crying. He went to his room and found he had soiled his diaper. He went to his parents room and found his mother fast asleep. Not wanting to disturb her, he went to the nanny's room but the door was locked. He peeked through the keyhole and saw his dad having sex with the nanny. He gave up and went back to bed. In the morning he jumped merrily down the stairs to his dad at the breakfast table and gleefully announced \"Dad I think I understand politics now.\" His dad encouringinly replied \"Good, explain to me what you think politics are and how they work\" <br>\r\nHe replied<br>\r\n\"While the Government is screwing the Working Class, The Senate is fast asleep, The people are being ignored and the Futuer is in deep shit.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Little Johnny had been hearing quite a bit about 'courting' from the older boys, and he wondered what it was and how it was done. One day he took his question to his mother, who became rather flustered. Instead of explaining things to Johnny, she told him to hide behind the curtains one night and watch his older sister and her boyfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis he did. The following morning, Johnny described everything to his mother. \"Sis and her boyfriend sat and talked for a while, then he turned off most of the lights. Then he started kissing and hugging her. I figured Sis must be getting sick, because her face started looking funny. He must have thought so too, because he put his hand inside her blouse to feel her heart, just the way the doctor would. Except he's not as smart as the doctor because he seemed to have trouble finding her heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess he was getting sick too, because pretty soon both of them started panting and gettin all out of breath. His other hand must of been cold because he put it under her skirt. About this time Sis got worse and began to moan and sigh and squirm around and slide down toward the end of the couch. This was when her fever started. I knew it was a fever, because Sis told him she felt really hot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, I found out what was making them so sick, a big eel had gotten inside his pants somehow. It just jumped out of his pants and stood there, about 10 inches long, honest anyway, he grabbed it in one hand to keep it from getting away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sis saw it, she got really scared, her eyes got big, and her mouth fell open, and she started calling out to God and stuff like that. She said it was the biggest one she's ever seen; I should tell her about the ones down at the lake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, Sis got brave and tried to kill the eel by biting its head off. All of a sudden she grabbed it with both hands and held it tight while he took a muzzle out of his pocket and slipped it over the eel's head to keep it from biting again. Sis lay back and spread her legs so she could get a scissor -- lock on it and he helped by lying on top of the eel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eel put up a hell of a fight. Sis started groaning and squealing and her boyfriend almost upset the couch. I guess they wanted to kill the eel by squashing it between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while they both quit moving and gave a great sigh. Her boyfriend got up, and sure enough, they killed the eel. I knew because it just hung there, limp, and some of its insides were hanging out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSis and her boyfriend were a little tired from the battle, but they went back to courting anyway. He started hugging and kissing her again. By golly, the eel wasn't dead! It jumped straight up and started to fight again. I guess eels are like cats -- they have nine lives or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Sis jumped up and tried to kill it by sitting on it. After a 35 minute struggle, they finally killed the eel. I knew it was dead, because I saw Sis's boyfriend peel its skin off and flush it down the toilet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother fainted.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hypothetical situation, a guy who is higher than the Hubble telescope on crystal meth and paint thinner breaks into your house, steals everything you own, rapes and murders your children wife and dog, beats the shit out of you and ties you to a phone pole and makes you watch him burn your house to the ground. A few days later he gets arrested and charged with breaking and entering, burglary, premeditated homicide, and bestiality. He gets 7 consecutive life sentences without a chance for parole. He is going to spend the rest of his and his grandchildren\u2019s life in prison. The media is going to call it \u201cjustice\u201d. Justice was served. He got what he deserved. And that\u2019s that, everyone goes on about their lives as you try to rebuild yours. Now let\u2019s look at it from the perspective no one ever thinks about. This man has literally taken your entire life away from you and you will never fully recover. And now you, as a free taxpaying citizen of the united states, get to spend the rest of your life, paying for his permanent residency in the form of an 8x8 cell with a bucket to shit in and a slab of crab infested wool to sleep on. You get to pay for him to have 3 meals a day. You get to pay for his gym membership, his laundering services, his rehabilitation, his education on how to find a gang in prison to survive with, his babysitting fees in the form of the prison guards salaries, and last but not least you get to pay every single penny of his healthcare expenses. Something you never thought about isn\u2019t it? All prisoners on this planet have all expense paid healthcare. Because you ,as free taxpaying citizen of the united states, get to front the bill. You get to pay for all the stitches from shiv wounds, and to get his asshole resized and his therapy sessions because a black guy named \u201cbig bubba\u201d got a little frisky in the shower. In the meantime the blow to your mental health which prevents you from ever being able to hold a job at a pay grade above shoveling cow shit, means that you have no means to get yourself a permanent residence, or a bucket to shit in, or a crab infested slab of wool to sleep on, or 3 meals a day, or a gym membership, or laundering services, or rehabilitation, or education, or any form of healthcare. Because justice was served. But let\u2019s look at it from another perspective. A crime that heinous should certainly be worthy of the death penalty. However most of the states in America don\u2019t like the capital punishment. So if this happens anywhere in the country other than Texas, this is what happens. 3-10 years of court battles and appeals and overrulings and controversies and delays and overpaid lawyers battling your fresh out of a third rate law school in a third world country public defender asshole. But through it all he finally gets sentenced to death. And then he will sit on death row for 5+ years, while you pay for his entire life after you\u2019ve paid for the millions of dollars worth of court battles. But through it all, finally the day comes where you get to pay for his execution. A lethal injection which contains a secret cocktail of deadly chemicals that probably cost you thousands of dollars each. But through it all, you get to watch this brutal heartless man who stole your life get put down. After they give him an alcohol swab that you also paid for. I mean common, We\u2019re killing the bastard, the least we could do is make sure he doesn\u2019t get an infection. So you tell me does that sound like the kind of justice we should have to live with? Regular people in this country have to fight and claw their way around the workplace to ensure they have enough money to put food on the table, and just because they happen to be free taxpaying citizens of the united states, a percentage of that goes to make sure rapists, murderers, drug dealers, maniacs, cannibals, and thieves have a quality meal, plenty of time in the sunshine to lift weights and sodomize one another and free healthcare. Meanwhile you have to pay 600 dollars to take your child to the hospital because he wrecked his bike in the street on the pothole that the state just doesn\u2019t have the spare money to fix.</span></div></div>",
